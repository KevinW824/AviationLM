3.2.5 
Thermal treatment of mill products: Unless otherwise specified in the contract or purchase order, 
processing of mill products for which the tables are not applicable (e.g. raw material which is 
continuously heat-treated) shall be annealed, austenitized, quenched and tempered with proven 
commercial practices. Such practices shall provide equivalence with respect to end product 
mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and microstructure, as required by the applicable 
material specification or engineering drawing, and shall be substantiated by tests or methods 
determined by the cognizant engineering organization. 
3.3 
Process requirements: 
3.3.1 
General: The equipment and processing techniques employed in the heat-treatment of material 
shall be fully capable of providing the combination of mechanical properties, corrosion resistance 
and microstructure in 
the product as specified in the appropriate procurement document. 
 
                                                                                

3.3.1.1 
Cleaning: Material shall be cleaned prior to heat-treatment 
as required to remove contaminants 
and leave no substance that could have a deleterious effect. Cleaning prior to heat treatment of 
mill products is not required provided no surface condition is retained which could have a 
deleterious effect on the product. 
3.3.1.2 
Spacing: Material shall be racked or supported to allow circulation 
of heating and quenching 
media; to ensure exposure of surfaces to heating and quenching media; and to minimize 
warpage during heating and quenching. 
3.3.1.3 
Approval for use of coatings or platings: Except for copper or nickel plating as described in 
footnote 8/ 
of 3.1.1 .l, 
approval from the cognizant engineering organization shall be obtained 
prior to the use of coatings or plating 
for protection of surfaces during heat-treatment. 
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
3.3.2 
Mechanical properties: Parts made from Classes A and B steels shall, after heat treatment, be hardness tested in accordance with 4.3.2.1. Hardness test data shall be converted to equivalent tensile strengths as specified by ASTM A 370 (see 6.5) and the tensile strengths shall conform to the design requirements. Where a dispute exists in the hardness test, the tensile test shall be performed in accordance with ASTM E 8 and the test results shall conform to the design requirements. Parts made from the following Class D steels shall be accompanied through heat treatment by a minimum of one tensile specimen of the same alloy form and condition: AM 350 
(thicker than .O15 inch thickness), AM 355, all parts heat-treated to an RH temper, parts that are resolution heat-treated, and all parts made from 17-4 PH and 15-5 PH heat treated to H1100 and H1150 tempers. Tensile specimens shall be tested in accordance with 4.3.2.2 and shall meet the requirements of the applicable drawing, design specification, or material specification. All other class D steel parts shall be hardness tested to the requirements of AMs 2759 and AMS 2759/3. 

When specified in the contract or purchase order, a minimum of one tensile specimen shall accompany any Class D steel solution heat-treated, aged or both. Consideration shall be given so that the tensile specimen is representative of the parts that are to be manufactured, ¡.e. they are of similar size and of the same alloy form and condition. 

3.3.2.1 
Permissible 
variations of Classes A and B steel from design ultimate strength: When a minimum 
acceptable strength level and no maximum strength level is specified by design or the applicable 
material specification, the maximum strength shall be 20 ksi above the minimum, except for Hy- 
Tuf and H-11 steels for which a maximum strength of 30 ksi above the minimum is acceptable. 
For 300 M steel, a maximum strength of 30 ksi above the minimum is acceptable, provided the 
maximum tensile strength does not exceed 305 ksi. 
3.3.3 
Surface contamination: When material is hardened, normalized before hardening or is rehardened 
after hardening, the requirements of 3.3.3.1, 3.3.3.2 and 3.3.3.3 shall apply. These requirements 
do not apply provided it is definitely known that sufficient material will subsequently be removed to 
eliminate any deleterious surface conditions.

Decarburization 
of Classes A and B material: The heating medium in 
furnaces used 
for 
normalizing Class A material and for hardening Classes A and B material shall be so controlled 
as not to produce excessive decarburization. For furnaces used to heat-treat material whose 
final hardness will be HRC 46 
(220 
ksi) and above, partial decarburization shall be judged 
excessive if greater than 0.003 
inch deep on any finish machined surface. For furnaces used 
to 
heat-treat material whose final hardness will be less than HRC 46 
(220

 Responsibility 
for inspection: 
Unless otherwise specified in the contract or purchase order, the contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements (examintions and tests) as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract or purchase order, the contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in this specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to ensure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements.

 Responsibility for compliance: All items shall meet all requirements of section 3
.
 The inspection 
set forth in this specification shall become a part of the contractor's overall inspection 
system or 
quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements in the specification shall not relieve 
the contractor of the responsibility of ensuring that all products or supplies submitted to the 
Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract. Sampling inspection, as 
part of manufacturing operations, is an acceptable practice to ascertain conformance to 
requirements, however, this does not authorize submission of known defective material, either 
indicated or actual, nor does it commit the Government 
to accept defective material.

4.3.3.1 
Determination 
of surface chemistry changes: The depth of decarburization shall be determined 
by making a microhardness traverse per ASTM E 384 using at least 250X magnification and 
recording hardness 
versus depth below surface. The boundary of the decarburization shall be at 
the depth at which the hardness rises 
to the equivalent of 20 points Knoop below the core 
hardness. In addition, the microhardness and microstructure shall show no evidence of carburization or nitriding. The traverse shall show no evidence of increased hardness at the 
surface as indicated by (20) points knoop or equivalent above the core hardness. 
4.3.3.2 
Intergranular attack: Intergranular 
oxidation of Class A material shall be determined by 
metallographically etching specimens of these steels for 7 - 20 minutes in a freshly prepared 
boiling 
solution consisting of 16 grams of chromic acid and 80 grams of sodium hydroxide in 
145 milliliters 
of water. Intergranular 
oxidation of Classes B and D material shall be determined 
metallographically by etching specimens of these steels for 1 - 2 minutes in a freshly prepared 
solution consisting of 1 
gram of picric 
acid in 5 milliliters 
of hydrochloric acid and 1 
O0 
milliliters 
of 
ethanol. Alternate etchants may be used provided their effectiveness with respect to revealing 
intergranular attack is substantiated. 
4.4 
Test procedures for quench rate control: 
4.4.1 
Comparative cooling curve evaluation: Variation in the quenching effectiveness of an oil, water, or 
aqueous polymer quenchant bath may be monitored using a suitable cooling curve evaluation 
procedure approved by the cognizant engineering organization. 
4.4.2 
Magnetic quenchometer: Variation in the quenching effectiveness of oil quenching media may be 
monitored using a magnetic quenchometer test as described in ASTM D 3520. 
4.4.3 
Hot wire test: When this test is used variation in the quenching effectiveness of oil quenching 
media shall be performed in accordance with the following. 
4.4.3.1 
Procedure: Pour 150 ml of oil to be tested in clean 250 ml beaker. Heat oil to 60 O
C
 
by placing 
thermometer in 
oil and heating on a hot plate (heat within 5 minutes). Place precut wire 
(No. 28 Cupron- 55% Copper, 45% Nickel-wire cut in 2.5 inch lengths) in clamps such that the 
wire is straight and 
taut. Wires that have been kinked or in 
any way flattened should not be used. 
When oil is at 60 i 
2 O
C
,
 remove thermometer and transfer beaker to Hot Wire Tester setup. The 
Hot Wire Tester consists of a dual spring clamp for holding the wire (1 
.O inch 
of effective wire 
length), electrical leads to the control box which supplies 60 cycle A.C. current to each clamp. 
The current is steadily increased 
from O to 35 amperes in 4.5 seconds using solid state circuitry 
with a thyristor (triac) optically coupled to a stair case generator. Maximum current through the 
wire is displayed on a LED Digital Read Out. Immediately immerse clamped wire and holder in 
oil and turn on controls. Reading is completed within 10 
seconds, The maximum current flow is 
read from the LED digital read out and recorded. Fresh wire can be placed in clamps and test 
repeated as quickly as manipulations can be performed. Tests must be performed in triplicate 
and the 3 results averaged. Readings should fall within 0.5 amps to be valid. Otherwise test 
should be repeated. 
 
                                                                                

4.4.4 Mechanical properties test of all quenching media: Shall be performed by quenching specimens of 
alloy steel, of appropriate hardenability and dimensions and testing a mechanical property (e.g., 
hardness, strength, modulus) which varies directly or inversely with the effectiveness of quench. 
The specific test shall verify quenchant effectiveness by comparing the tested mechanical property 
results with those properties listed in the applicable drawing or material specification. 
4.4.4.1 
Specimen selection for mechanical properties test of all quenching media: Selection of the 
specimen dimensionsíhardenability 
combination should be aimed at achieving approximately full 
hardening (e.g. 95% martensite) on the surface and significantly less hardening (e.g., less than 
50% martensite plus bainite) at the center. 
4.4.4.2 
Tempering specimen for machining: Specimens may be tempered lightly (e.g., at 500 O F  
(260 
O C ) )  after quenching to facilitate machining. 
4.4.4.3 
Testing area: Tests may be performed 
on (1) surface, sub-surface, mid-radius or center material, 
or (
2
)
 
the entire section or any portion of it. 
                                                                                          
4.4.4.4 
Conformance of testing: Hardness testing shall conform to ASTM E 18 for Rockwell hardness 
testing and ASTM E 1 
O for Brinell hardness testing. Tensile testing shall conform to ASTM E 8. 
Modulus testing shall be by a dynamic (resonant frequency) method similar to ASTM C 848. 

## 5. Packaging:

This section is not applicable to this specification. 

## 6. Notes:

Intended use: 

## 6.1

Heat-treating processes are used to obtain desired properties within the limitation of the respective classes of steel (see 1.2). 

## Rate Of Heating: 6.2

When the steel, size, design of parts, or the operating conditions are such that no cracking or excessive warpage results, the material may be charged into the heat-treating furnace or bath at any desired temperature not exceeding the maximum temperature specified for the operation and the material involved. In continuous furnaces used to anneal and normalize mill products, a thermal head may be used. The temperature of the mill product shall not exceed the maximum processing temperature. 

 
Holding-time intervals and protective coatings: 

6.3 
The holding-time intervals indicated by Tables IIA and llB are approximately correct for heating in air, in a gaseous atmosphere, or in salt baths. The proper time interval will vary with the type of steel, capacity of heating elements, and size of charge, as well as with the thickness of the individual material and protective coatings. 

6.4 
Shape influence: 
Much of the published literature and the data in this specification refers to round specimens of various diameters. In order to use the data successfully on actual parts, it is first necessary to visualize the parts as simple geometric shapes such as rounds, hexagons, squares, plates or tubes. These shapes can then be considered as the round size which will have approximately the same cooling rate as that of the simple shape. The relationship between the various simple shapes and the corresponding round size is indicated on Figure I .  

Hardness-tensile 
relationship: 
6.5 
The normal relationship between the tensile strength and hardness of carbon and low alloy steel is indicated in the hardness conversion table o f ASTM A 370. The table is to be used as a guide as the relationship is not precise. 

6.5.1 Narrow strength range (+ 5 ksi): When a narrow range in strength is required, tests to determine 
the relationship between hardness and strength should be made on the actual part. Hardness 
values should be considered as the average value obtained by at least 
three determinations, each 
of which should check within 2 points 
Rockwell, or 20 points Brinell 
or Vickers, or either o
f
 the other 
two values. 
6.5.2 
Thin-walled tubing hardness tests: On relatively thin-walled tubings or parts 
which cannot be firmly 
supported on the anvil o
f
 the test machine, only methods which measure the area of the 
impression (Vickers or Knoop) are acceptable. Any process which affects the surface, such as buffing and plating, or the presence of decarburized or porous areas and hard spots will affect the 
hardness and the corresponding relation 
between hardness and tensile strength. 
6.6 
Heating baths: 
Material inserted in salt baths should be free from liquids and coatings which may sublime or become gaseous and thereby splatter or explode the contents of the bath. Precautions should be taken when heat-treating corrosion-resistant steel in salt baths to which carbonaceous rectifiers have been added. Such baths, while neutral to carbon and low alloy steel, may carburize corrosionresistant steel and lower the impact properties and resistance to corrosion.

6.7 
Verification of heat-treating procedures: 
Hardness is not the only criterion of satisfactory heat-treatment since excessively coarsened grains, over-heated, or improperly tempered steel may show adequate hardness, but may be deficient in ductility and other mechanical properties. Patts are acceptable only when the requirements of this specification and applicable design requirements are met. 

6.8 
Classification of strength: 
All references herein to strength or tensile strength refer to ultimate tensile strength. 

6.9 
Holding at temperature: 
"Holding at temperature" refers to material time at temperature. 

## 6.10 Classes A And B Finish Machined Surfaces:

When parts made from Classes A and B 
steel containing finish machined surfaces are normalized or rehardened and these operations are not immediately before or after hardening, it is the manufacturer's responsibility to assure that the combined effects of the treatment meet the requirements of 3.3.3. Finish machined surfaces are those from which less than 0.020 inch 
(Class A) and 0.01 O 
inch (Class B) 
will subsequently be removed. 

                                                                                          

## 6.11 Definition Of Terms:

6.11.1 Material includes all forms of steel products described within the specification (mill products and 
parts). 
6.11.2 Mill product is defined herein as a product which is commonly produced in: finished form as plate, 
sheet, strip, bar, rod, and structural shapes; semi-finished form as **blooms,** billets, slabs and tube
