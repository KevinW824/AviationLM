## 1.0 Purpose And Scope 1.1 Introduction

This document contains minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) for GNSS airborne antenna equipment designed to use GPS or GLONASS augmented by other systems/equipment/techniques as appropriate to meet the performance requirements for primary means of navigation for en route, terminal, non-precision, and precision approach phases of flight. The airborne navigation system can be used as a primary means navigation system in an aircraft when approved and an operational GNSS navigation satellite system is available.  Incorporated within these standards are equipment characteristics that should be useful to users, designers, manufacturers, and installers of the equipment.

 This document defines the antenna performance for antennas that will be used with GNSS receiver equipment. Section 1.0 of this document provides information and assumptions needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated in the remaining sections.  It describes typical equipment applications and operational goals, and forms the basis for the standards stated in Sections 2.0 through 4.0. Section 2.0 contains the minimum performance standards for the equipment.  These standards define required performance under standard operating conditions and stressed physical environmental conditions.  It also details the recommended bench test procedures necessary to demonstrate compliance. Section 3.0 describes the performance required of the installed equipment.  Tests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. Section 4.0 describes the operational characteristics for equipment installations, and defines conditions that will assure the operator that operations can be conducted safely and reliably in the expected operational environment. Compliance with these standards by manufacturers, installers, and users is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will satisfactorily perform its intended function(s) under conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operations. The word "equipment" as used in this document includes all components or units necessary (as determined by the equipment manufacturer or installer) for the equipment to properly perform its intended function. 

It is recognized that any regulatory application of these standards is the responsibility of appropriate government agencies.

Inasmuch as the measured values of equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the measurement method, standard test conditions and methods of test are recommended in this document.

## 1.2 System Characteristics

The GNSS is a world-wide position, velocity, and time determination system that includes one or more satellite constellations, receivers, and system integrity monitoring, augmented as necessary to support the required navigation performance for the actual phase of operation.  The GNSS includes ground control and monitoring stations, satellites, and avionics including antenna(s), and currently consists of the United States Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian Federation Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS). 

## 1.3 Operational Applications

The GNSS antenna equipment is intended to be used in all phases of aircraft operation, including on the surface, approach and landing, departure, terminal, and en route.

## 1.4 Operational Goals

The operational goal for the GNSS antenna is to provide adequate GNSS satellite signals under a wide range of environmental conditions and installations that will assure safe flight operations.  The requirements of this document provide the minimum requirements for antennas designed for GNSS service and employing either passive or active designs. 

## 1.5 Assumptions

It is assumed that the GNSS antenna will be used with GNSS receiver equipment defined in appropriate MOPS.

## 1.6 Test Procedures

The test procedures specified in this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the performance requirements.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred.  These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. The order of tests specified suggests that the antenna be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design, and design qualification, into operational use.  For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2.0 shall have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed systems tests of section 3.0. Four types of test procedures are specified.  These include:

a.
Environmental Tests
Environmental test requirements are specified in Section 2.3.  The procedures and their associated limit requirements are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the antenna under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations. Unless otherwise specified, the environmental conditions and test procedures contained in RTCA/DO-160C, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, will be used to demonstrate antenna compliance.

b.
Bench Tests
Bench Test procedures are specified in Section 2.4.  These tests provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Section 2.2.  Test results may be used by antenna manufacturers as design guidance, for monitoring compliance, and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of antenna design.

c.
Installed Equipment Tests
The installed equipment test procedures and their associated limits are specified in Section 3.0.  Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included in the installed antenna tests, their successful completion is precondition a to completion of the installed tests.  In certain instances, however, installed antenna tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from, or to, other antenna installed on the aircraft, etc.  Installed tests are normally performed under two conditions:

(1) With the aircraft on the ground and using simulated or operational system
inputs.
(2) With the aircraft in flight using operational system inputs appropriate to the
antenna under test.
Test results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the intended operational environment.

## D. Operational Tests

The operational tests are specified in Section 4.0.  These test procedures and their associated limits are intended to be conducted by operating personnel as one means of ensuring that the equipment is functioning properly, and can be reliably used for its intended function(s).

## 2.2.1.3 Passive Antenna Vswr And Impedance

The VSWR for a dry antenna shall not exceed 1.5:1 over the operating frequency range when interfaced with a nominal 50 ohm impedance transmission line.

The VSWR for an antenna exposed to rain, or an ice accumulation of 0.5 inches, shall not exceed 2.0:1.

## 2.2.1.4 Antenna Gain

The minimum gain shall not be less than the following for the specified elevation angle, at the operating frequency, above the horizon at any azimuth:

| Elevation Angle    | Minimum Gain   |

## 2.2.2 Gnss Antenna - With Integrated Preamplifier (Optional)

The GNSS antenna, as defined in Section 2.2.1 above, integrated with a preamplifier, as illustrated in Figure 2-1, includes the antenna, cabling between the antenna and preamplifier, burnout protection, selective filtering, and a low-noise-amplifier (LNA).

NOTE:
These preamplifier requirements are defined for GPS only.  The requirements for GLONASS are under study.

## 2.2.2.1 Preamplifier Gain And Noise Figure

The preamplifier shall provide additional gain of 26.5 dB, minimum, to that specified in Section 2.2.1.4, with a maximum 4 dB noise figure, including all circuitry in the integrated antenna/preamplifier.  This additional gain is applicable to points A and B in Figure 2-1, and does not include cabling between the preamplifier and the GNSS receiver at point C.

NOTE:
 No maximum gain is specified.  Thus, the total gain of the preamplifier and GNSS receiver combination may be installation dependent.

## 2.2.2.2 Preamplifier Gain Compression

The preamplifier shall have a 1 dB gain compression point not less than the values shown in Figure 2-2 defined at the antenna port.  The CW interference levels below

## 2.3 Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in this subsection are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the antenna under conditions representative of those that may be encountered in actual operations. Some of the environmental tests contained in this subsection need not be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition. These tests are identified by the phrase "When Required." If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional environmental conditions, then these "When Required" tests shall be performed. Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of antenna performance under environmental test conditions are set forth in RTCA Document DO-160C, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment.  General information on the use of DO-160C is contained in Sections 1.0 through 3.0 of that document.  Also, a method of identifying which environmental tests are conducted and other amplifying information on the conduct of the tests is contained in Appendix A of DO-160C. Some of the performance requirements in Section 2.2 are not required to be tested to all of the conditions contained in RTCA/DO-160C. If judgment and experience indicate that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions, and that the level of performance specified in Section 2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these particular environmental conditions, such tests may be omitted. In addition to the exceptions above, certain environmental tests contained in this section are not required for minimum performance equipment unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the antenna for additional environmental conditions.  If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the antenna to these additional conditions, then these tests shall be performed.

## 2.3.1 Specific Environmental Test Conditions

The equipment shall be subjected to the test conditions as specified in RTCA/DO- 160C as indicated below.  Categories are for locations external to the aircraft.

Antenna Test Set. Antenna Test Set (to provide power as required by the manufacturer to the preamplifier). 50 Ohm RF Terminator. Bridge-T.

## Measurement Requirements:

The stability of the amplifier shall be tested in 7 steps:

1.
Connect the preamplifier output to the spectrum analyzer.  Set the spectrum
analyzer to measure signals at least as low as -110 dBm,  and with as wide
a frequency range as practical.
2.
Connect the preamplifier input to a 50 ohm terminator.
3.
Apply power to the preamplifier and verify that the preamplifier does not generate any detectable signals.
4.
Remove the RF terminator from the preamplifier input. Verify that the preamplifier does not generate any detectable signals.
5.
Apply a short across the preamplifier input. Verify that the preamplifier does not generate any detectable signals.
6.
Connect the preamplifier input to the spectrum analyzer.  Set the spectrum
analyzer to measure signals at least as low as -110 dBm, and with as wide
a frequency range as practical.  Connect a 50 ohm terminator to the preamplifier output.  Using a bridge-T to supply power to the preamplifier
as necessary, verify that the preamplifier does not generate any detectable signals at the preamplifier input.
7.
Connect an RF short circuit to the amplifier output.

NOTE:
      One acceptable method of applying an RF short circuit to the amplifier
      while providing power through the same terminals is to use an open-
      ended cable of 1/4 wavelength (at 1575.42 MHz) connected to the
      preamplifier output.  Power can be supplied by a normal T or bridge-T
      connection to the preamplifier output.

Verify that the preamplifier does not generate any signals at the preamplifier
input.

8.
Apply an RF open circuit at the preamplifier output terminals.  Verify that the preamplifier does not generate any detectable signals at the preamplifier
input.

## 2.4.3.4 Preamplifier Selectivity Test (Section 2.2.2.4)

Equipment Required: Antenna Test Set (to provide power as required by the manufacturer to the preamplifier). Automatic Network Analyzer (Hewlett-Packard 8753, 8720, 8510, or equivalent).

Synthesized Signal Generator (Hewlett-Packard 8662A or equivalent).

Measurement Requirements:

1.
Connect the RF output of the network analyzer to the preamplifier input.
2.
Connect the preamplifier output to the network analyzer input.
3.
Adjust the network analyzer to provide a constant, linearly swept signal level of  -60 dBm, or as appropriate, over the frequency range of 1500 MHz to 1660 MHz.
4.
Verify that the displayed signal meets the levels specified in Figure 2-3,
relative to the input signal level.

## 2.4.3.5 Burnout Protection Test (Section 2.2.2.5)

Equipment Required: Antenna Test Set (to provide power as required by the manufacturer to the preamplifier).

Synthesized Signal Generator (Hewlett-Packard 8662A or equivalent).

Spectrum Analyzer (Hewlett-Packard 8568B, or equivalent).

RF Amplifier (Hewlett-Packard 8347A, or equivalent). Measurement Requirements:

1.
Connect the RF Amplifier between the signal generator and the preamplifier.
2.
Set the RF generator to a frequency of 1575.42 MHz and adjust the level to obtain a signal of +30 dBm at the preamplifier input.
3.
Apply power to the preamplifier, and subject the preamplifier input to a test signal of +30 dBm at 1575.42 MHz for 5 minutes.
4.
Repeat the tests described in Sections 2.4.3.1, 2.4.3.2, and 2.4.3.3.  Verify
that the preamplifier still meets the Gain, Noise Figure, and Stability requirements of those Sections.
5.
Re-connect the equipment as stated in steps 1 and 2.
6.
With power removed from the preamplifier, subject the preamplifier input to a test signal of +30 dBm at 1575.42 MHz for 5 minutes.
7.
Repeat the tests described in Sections 2.4.3.1, 2.4.3.2, and 2.4.3.3.  Verify that the preamplifier still meets the Gain, Noise Figure and Stability
requirements of those Sections.

## 2.4.3.6 Pulse Power Operation Test (Section 2.2.2.6)

Equipment Required: Antenna Test Set (to provide power as required by the manufacturer to the preamplifier) Two Synthesized Signal Generators (Hewlett-Packard 8662A or equivalent) Spectrum Analyzer (Hewlett-Packard 8568B, or equivalent) Modulator (Hewlett-Packard 11665B, or equivalent) Pulse Generator (Fluke 5712, or equivalent) Linear RF Power Amplifier (500 W peak, minimum) 20 dB Directional Coupler Variable Attenuator (0-40 dB) 3 dB Power Splitter Adjustable Phase Delay Line Phase Detector Oscilloscope Measurement Requirements:

1.
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-6.  Any attenuation of the pulsed RF signal through cable losses, connector losses, losses in the 20 dB directional coupler, etc. shall be taken into account when setting the power of signal generator #1, such that the peak power listed in Table 2-1A shall be present at the preamplifier input.
2.
Temporarily disable the pulse power signal from generator #1.  Set the signal generator #2 to an output level of 0 dBm and a frequency of 1575.42 MHz.  Adjust the variable attenuator such that the preamplifier produces an output power of -10 dB below its 1 dB compression point,  with a minimum power of -10 dBm.  If the phase detector used will work reliably with a
lower output power, a lower value may be used.  Finally, adjust the phase delay line such that the oscilloscope shows a phase difference between the preamplifier output and the delayed signal generator #2 signal of 0N.

3.
Set the pulse generator and signal generator #1 to produce the pulsed signal
required for test #1 in Table 2-1A.
4.
Verify that the preamplifier meets all criteria set forth in Section 2.2.2.6. The recovery time shall be measured as the time needed by the preamplifier to return to a phase difference between its output signal and the delayed signal generator #2 signal of less that +30E, as shown by the oscilloscope.
5.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 for tests 2 through 8 using the appropriate settings
shown in Table 2-1A for each test.
