## Foreword

 
This document was prepared by RTCA Special Committee 172 (SC-172) and approved by the RTCA 
Program Management Committee on November 8, 2005. 
 
RTCA, Incorporated is a not-for-profit corporation formed to advance the art and science of aviation and 
aviation electronic systems for the benefit of the public.  The organization functions as a Federal 
Advisory Committee and develops consensus based recommendations on contemporary aviation issues.  
RTCA's objectives include but are not limited to: 
 
- 
      Coalescing aviation system user and provider technical requirements in a manner that helps 
      government and industry meet their mutual objectives and responsibilities. 

 
- 
Analyzing and recommending solutions to the system technical issues that aviation faces as it continues to pursue increased safety, system capacity and efficiency. 
 
- 
Developing consensus on the application of pertinent technology to fulfil user and provider requirements, including development of minimum operational performance standards for electronic systems and equipment that support aviation. 
 
- 
Assisting in developing the appropriate technical material upon which positions for the International 
Civil Aviation Organization and the International Telecommunications Union and other appropriate international organizations can be based. 

 
The organization's recommendations are often used as the basis for government and private sector 
decisions as well as the foundation for many Federal Aviation Administration Technical Standard Orders. 
 
Since RTCA is not an official agency of the United States Government, its recommendations may not be 
regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the U. S. government 
organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations 
relate. 
 
The physical layer material of this document is based on the Physical Layer MOPS for Airborne VDL 
Mode 2 (EUROCAE Working Group 47 document, ED-92, dated March 2000), since the physical layer is 
largely in common to both VDL Mode 2 and VDL Mode 3.  Development of this document and ED-92 
were coordinated with EUROCAE Working Group 47. 
 
Appendix B is a Normative Appendix.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
 
1.1 
Introduction 
 
This document contains the minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) and verification procedures for an aircraft Very High Frequency (VHF) Digital Link (VDL) 
Mode 3 transceiver, intended to be used for air-ground (A/G) voice and data communications.  The document is designed so that equipment certified to its standards will be compatible with the VDL Mode 3 Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) in RTCA DO-224B. Compliance with these standards is one means of assuring that VDL Mode 3 equipment will function satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in air traffic control (ATC) A/G operations and that data formats will be compatible with the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN).  These standards specify characteristics useful to designers, manufacturers, installers, and users of the VDL Mode 3 A/G communications system equipment. This document is organized in four major technical sections and appendices as follows: 
 
Section 1 
describes the purpose and scope. 

Section 2 
contains minimum performance requirements under both standard and environmental test conditions with equipment performance verification procedures. 
Section 3 
describes installed equipment performance tests. 
Section 4 
describes operational performance tests. 
Appendix A contains a list of acronyms used in this document. Appendix B contains matrices that cross reference requirements to verification testing 
and equipment architecture classes under environmental conditions and for 
standard conditions.  This appendix is normative in the sense that it specifically identifies which requirements make up the minimum set for the standard classes of equipment. 
Appendix C defines the assumed functional partitioning of VDL Mode 3 protocol 
functions for the separated equipment architecture. 
Appendix D provides an example of the Data/Management Interface for the separated 
equipment architecture.  This example is described at a high level.  No protocol details (e.g., bit definition, data rate, physical layer details, etc.) for the Data/Management Interface are given. 
Appendix E defines test vectors for evaluation of the vocoder audio levels and a silence 
test vector for BER testing. 

## 1.2 System Overview The Vdl Mode 3 A/G Communications System Provides Functionally Simultaneous Voice And Data Communications Between Aircraft And Ground-Based Users.  The Vdl Mode 3 A/G Communications System Architecture Is Defined To Provide Coverage Similar To

--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
today's analog-based Double Sideband-Amplitude Modulation (DSB-AM) system as a minimum.  In addition, VDL Mode 3 uses Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technology to provide integrated voice and data communications between aircraft users and ground-based users and operates in the standard VHF Aeronautical Mobile (Route) 
Service (AM(R)S) band. The VDL Mode 3 system is capable of operating in today's sectorized airspace.  The ground controller and the associated aircraft users form a user group that is assigned dedicated communications resources (a frequency and time slots) for voice and data communications under control of the ground station.  The VDL Mode 3 system can be configured for voice only time slots per frequency assignment or for voice and a data link in separate time slots for each user group on that frequency assignment.  Voice communication is based on a low rate voice-encoding algorithm to achieve high bandwidth efficiency and, for most of the system configurations, uses listen-before-pushto-talk (LBPTT) protocol similar to today's analog-based system. The VDL Mode 3 data subsystem is designed to be a subnetwork of the ATN and is organized according to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of the International Standards Organization (ISO).  Data communications are reservation-based to provide contention-free data service.  Point-to-point data communications between an aircraft ATN router and a ground ATN router are provided through the VDL Mode 3 system via the Aircraft Network Interface (ANI) and Ground Network Interface (GNI), respectively.  Point-to-multi-point data communication is also provided as one way data broadcast from the ground station to the aircraft stations. The VDL Mode 3 system is related to the three lower layers of the OSI model (illustrated in Figure 1-1) providing services described as follows: Layer 1 (Physical layer):  The Physical layer provides transceiver frequency control, bit exchanges over the radio media, and notification functions.  These functions are known as "radio" and "modulation" functions. 

 
VDL Mode 3 uses differentially encoded eight phase shift keying (D8PSK) modulation with a raised cosine filter (Î± = 0.6).  The information to be transmitted is encoded with 3 bits/symbol.  The transmitted symbol rate is 
10,500 symbols/s, resulting in a nominal bit rate of 31,500 bits/s. Layer 2  (Link layer):  The Link layer is split into two sublayers and a management entity. 

 
The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer provides access control to the Physical layer using TDMA and is based on a centralized ground-based reservation system for data link access. The Data Link Services (DLS) sublayer is composed of an Acknowledged- Connectionless Data Link (A-CLDL) protocol whose main functions are frame exchanges, frame processing, priority queuing, error detection, and error recovery. 

The Link Management Entity (LME) is in charge of link establishment and release services between the aircraft and ground DLS sublayers.  It also delivers link status information to the subnetwork, DLS, and the Voice Unit. 
 
Layer 3 (Network layer):  The VDL Mode 3 MASPS in RTCA DO-224B define only the 
lowest sublayer of the Network layer, the Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAcP) 
sublayer. 
The SNAcP sublayer provides transport of VDL Mode 3 subnetwork packets 
through the use of a payload field similar to what is used in links today such as Ethernet.  The subnetwork layer provides packet exchanges, header 
compression, and subnetwork connection management functions, and can 
provide error recovery, flow control, and packet fragmentation.  The VDL Mode 
3 subnetwork layer can be configured to send Connectionless Network Protocol 
(CLNP) packets and connection-oriented ISO 8208 packets. 
1.3 
Aircraft Equipment Architectures VDL Mode 3 avionics equipment may be implemented in several differing physical architectures.  This paragraph describes two possible types of aircraft equipment architectures: one type is composed of integrated equipment and the other is composed of separated equipment.  Although these architectures are not the only possible architectures, they are representative of the most common equipment architectures expected in the marketplace. 

1.3.1 
 
Integrated Equipment Archhitecture According to the services provided, the integrated equipment architecture is divided into either a combined voice and data architecture (shown in Figure 1-2a) or a voice only architecture (shown in Figure 1-2b). 

 
1.3.1.1  
Voice and Data Capable In the integrated equipment architecture that provides both voice and data applications, all VDL Mode 3 functions associated with an aircraft radio are integrated into a common physical unit of equipment.  Throughout this document this integrated equipment architecture for voice and data is generically referred to as equipment architecture ID 
(Integrated equipment with Data capability in addition to voice capability).  Other equipment required for operation in the integrated equipment architecture for voice and data includes a VHF antenna, as illustrated in Figure 1-2a.  In equipment architecture ID, the radio control/management functions may be internal or external.  Note that equipment architecture ID is further defined and classified in Section 2.1.9, depending upon the subnetwork interfaces implemented. 1.3.1.2  
Voice Capable Only In the architectures that provide voice-only service, all VDL Mode 3 functions required to support voice-only operations are integrated into a common physical unit of equipment.  Throughout this document these integrated voice-only architectures are referred to as architecture IB (Integrated equipment with Basic voice-only capability) and architecture IV (Integrated equipment with Voice-only capability).  Other equipment required for operation in architecture IB or IV includes a VHF antenna, as illustrated in Figure 1-2b.  In voice-only architectures, the radio control/management functions may be internal or external.  Note that voice-only architectures are further defined in Section 
2.1.9. 

1.3.2 
 
Separated Equipment Architectures For the separated equipment architecture it is assumed that both voice and data services are provided.  In the separated equipment architecture (shown in Figure 1-3) the VDL 
Mode 3 functionality is divided between the VHF Digital Radio (VDR) and the Communication Management Unit (CMU).  The VDL Mode 3 functional allocation between the VDR and CMU and the interface characteristics assumed in this document are given in Appendices C and D.  The VDR implements the lower layer protocols in the VDL Mode 3 protocol stack while the CMU implements the upper layers in the VDL 
Mode 3 protocol stack.  The VDR is classified as architecture SL (Separated equipment with Lower layer protocols) while the CMU is classified as architecture SU (Separated equipment with Upper layer protocols). Architectures SL and SU are further defined and classified in Section 2.1.9, depending upon the subnetwork interfaces implemented. Architecture SL (VDR) implements the Physical layer, the MAC sublayer, the Voice Unit, most of the DLS sublayer, a portion of the LME, and a function providing the data and management information transfer between the VDR and the CMU. 

 
Architecture SU (CMU) implements the SNAcP sublayer, a subset of the DLS sublayer, a portion of the LME and a function providing the data and management information transfer between the CMU and the VDR. 

Note: 
This example illustrates one possible way of allocating the functionality between the VDR and CMU.  Other functional allocations can be considered. Other equipment required for operation in the separated equipment architecture includes a VHF antenna, as illustrated in Figure 1-3.  The separated equipment architecture assumes that the radio control/management functions are performed via the CMU and/or an external Radio Tuning Panel. 

 
1.4 
Operational Applications 
 
While operational applications will evolve with time, this document defines minimum 
standards to support implementation of anticipated applications.  The specific 
applications to be served can be classified under the following general categories: 
 
a. Air Traffic Control (ATC) b. Flight Information Services (FIS) c. Aeronautical Operational Control (AOC) 
 
1.5 
Operational Goals The operational goals of the VDL Mode 3 system are to: 
a. improve spectrum utilization 
b. enhance voice operational capabilities with equal or better voice quality and 
increased voice capacity, compared to the 25 kHz DSB AM system 
c. add new data link capability 
d. support A/G communications for sector-oriented user groups. 
 
1.6 
Equipment Performance Verification To test the equipment for compliance with the performance requirements, four types of 
tests are specified.  These include: a. Bench Tests b. Environmental Tests 
c. Installed Equipment Tests d. Operational Tests The performance requirements for each type of tests and the corresponding test procedures are specified in this document.  The order of tests suggests that the avionics transceiver be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design into design validation, equipment qualification, and operation.  The objectives of these tests are described in the following subsections. 

1.6.1 
 
Bench Tests The equipment will be subjected to bench tests to verify compliance to the performance requirements under controlled environment.  The test results may be used as the basis for approval of equipment design, equipment qualification, and acceptance.  The bench test procedures are specified in Section 2.4.  Appendix B contains cross-references of tests to equipment architecture classes. 

1.6.2 
 
Environmental Tests Upon successful completion of bench tests, the equipment will be subjected to environmental tests to verify compliance to the performance requirements under extreme environmental conditions expected in actual operations and abnormal conditions.  The test results may be applied to equipment qualification and acceptance.  The environmental tests are specified in Section 2.3.  Table B-1 contains cross-references of environmental tests to equipment architecture classes. 

 
1.6.3 
 
Installed Equipment Tests After successful environmental tests, the equipment will be installed in the aircraft for further testing to verify compliance to the performance specifications of Section 3 in the aircraft environment.  The installed equipment tests will be conducted primarily with the aircraft on the ground using simulated or operational system inputs and may be supplemented with flight tests.  The test results may be used to isolate design faults that are traceable to the general aircraft environment, e.g., radio frequency interference (RFI) 
and the aircraft power supply system.  As in the case of bench and environmental tests, the installed equipment tests are critical to equipment qualification and acceptance.  The installed equipment tests are specified in Section 3. 

1.6.4 
 
Operational Tests After successful completion of the installed equipment tests, the equipment will be subjected to operational tests conducted by operating personnel to ensure that the equipment, as a part of the overall A/G communications system, operates satisfactorily end-to-end in real operational environments.  The operational tests are specified in Section 4.

In VDL Mode 3, an adjacent channel is a channel that has a bandwidth of 25 kHz and whose frequency assignment is adjacent to that of a desired reference channel.  A first adjacent channel is a channel whose center frequency is 25 kHz above or below that of the desired VDL Mode 3 channel.  The nth adjacent channel is a channel whose center frequency is 25n kHz above or below that of the desired VDL Mode 3 channel.   
 
1.7.2 
 
Adjacent Channel Power Adjacent channel power is the amount of radio frequency (RF) signal power that falls within a given adjacent channel. 

 
Adjacent channel power includes discrete spurious signals, signal sidebands, and noise density (including phase noise) at the transmitter output. 

1.7.3 
 
Adjacent Channel Rejection (ACR) ACR corresponds to the receiver's ability to demodulate the desired signal and meet the BER requirement in the presence of an adjacent channel interfering signal. The ACR ratio, expressed in decibels (dB), is the maximum power difference between the adjacent channel interfering signal and the desired signal that allows the specified BER performance to be met. 

1.7.4 
 
Bit Error Rate (BER) BER is expressed as the ratio between the number of erroneous bits received and the total number of bits received.  The uncorrected BER represents the BER without the benefit of Forward Error Correction (FEC). 

1.7.5 
 
Co-channel Interference (CCI) CCI protection is the overall capability of a receiver to demodulate the desired signal and achieve the specified bit error rate (BER) performance in the presence of an unwanted signal at the same assigned frequency. The CCI ratio is the power ratio between the desired signal and the unwanted signal expressed in dB. 

1.7.6 
 
Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is defined as the root mean square (rms) error in the in phase-quadrature phase (I-Q) vector magnitude measured at the ideal sampling points, expressed as a percentage.  Mathematically, this can be written as 

$EVM=100\cdot\sqrt{Expectation\left(\left(\Delta I^{2}+\Delta Q^{2}\right)/\left(I^{2}+Q^{2}\right)\right)}$.

 At the ideal sampling points, the I-Q values are on the unit circle so that $\,I^2+Q^2=1\,$, and

. Methods that use more than one sample per symbol to determine EVM are acceptable, provided the measurements can be related to the definition above. 1.7.7 
 
Reference Signal Level The reference signal level is the desired signal level used in the receiver performance specifications unless otherwise stated. 

1.7.8 
 
Transmitter Reference Burst Sequence  
 
For tests, which require stressing the transmitter, a reference burst sequence is defined and is illustrated in Section 2.4.1.8. 

 
1.7.9 
 
Undesired VDL Mode 3 Test Signal An undesired signal is a simulated VDL Mode 3 signal generated on a valid VDL Mode 3 frequency channel by means of a continuous wave (CW) signal frequency modulated by a 400 Hz tone with a peak frequency deviation of 5.25 kHz. 

Note: 
This test signal represents an idealized VDL Mode 3 signal, with adjacent channel spectral characteristics that are significantly better than those permitted for a VDL Mode 3 transmitter that marginally meets the requirements of Section 
2.2.1.3.7 of this MOPS. 

 
1.7.10  
Basic Voice Service The provision of push-to-talk voice services without the support of using discretely addressable Local User IDs for signaling between the ground station and aircraft stations (aircraft stations use the dummy Aircraft ID, i.e., 61). The Basic Voice service is available to aircraft stations in TS1, TS2, or TS3 timing state. 

1.7.11  
Enhanced Voice Service Enhanced Voice service, which provides operational enhancements to the Basic Voice service, relies on signaling between the ground station and the aircraft stations using Local User IDs for aircraft station addressing. The Enhanced Voice service features are defined in RTCA/DO-279 Next Generation Air/Ground Communications (NEXCOM) 
Principles of Operations VDL Mode 3. The Enhanced Voice service is available to aircraft stations that have received discrete Local User IDs by successfully completing the net entry process (see RTCA DO-224B, Section 3.3.2.3.2.1.2) and are in TS1 timing state. The ground station has the option not to support certain Enhanced Voice features through the Supported Options message signaling during the net entry process (see RTCA DO-224B, Section 3.3.2.3.2.1.2.1). 

1.7.12  
Enhanced Voice and Data Service Provides all the Enhanced Voice functions described above in addition to a data link capability employing at least one of the protocol stacks described in this specification. 

(These services are available after the successful completion of the net entry procedure and Initial Link Negotiation.)

Note: 
Appendix B presents a matrix correlating MASPS requirements of RTCA DO-
224B with MOPS tests for equipment architecture classes. 

 
2.1.1 
 
Airworthiness The equipment shall not, under either normal or faulty conditions, impair the airworthiness of the aircraft in which it is installed. 

2.1.2

--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

2.1.7 
 
Effects of Test Unless otherwise provided, the design of the equipment shall be such that, subsequent to 
the application of the specified tests, no condition exists which would be detrimental to 
the continued performance of the equipment. 
2.1.8 
 
Equipment Classes 
 
2.1.8.1  
Receivers One class of VDL Mode 3 receiver is defined as follows: Class G: Receivers used in a 25 kilohertz (kHz) channel separation environment. 
 
Note: 
Classes A through E are DSB-AM receivers defined in RTCA DO-186B. Class F 
is the VDL Mode 2 receiver defined in EUROCAE ED-92 and in RTCA DO-281A 
(VDL Mode 2 MOPS). 
 
2.1.8.2  
Transmitters Two classes of VDL Mode 3 transmitters are defined as follows: Class 9: Transmitters designed to operate in a 25 kHz channel separation environment 
with a maximum range of 200 nautical miles. Class 10: Transmitters designed to operate in a 25 kHz channel separation environment 
with a maximum range of 100 nautical miles. 
 
Note: 
Classes 1 through 6 are DSB-AM transmitters defined in RTCA DO-186B. Classes 7 and 8 are VDL Mode 2 transmitters defined in EUROCAE ED-92 and 
in RTCA DO-281A (VDL Mode 2 MOPS). 
 
2.1.9 
 
VDL Mode 3 Avionics Equipment Classes 
 
This MOPS defines seven (7) VDL Mode 3 equipment classes.  These classes will provide flexibility for manufacturers in equipment implementation to meet the market needs and allow testing for certification of avionics equipment implemented in different equipment architectures.  The VDL Mode 3 avionics equipment classes are classified in 
accordance with the following: 
- 
services provided (basic voice only, enhanced voice only, or data/voice)  
- 
equipment architecture (integrated or separated)  
- 
subnetwork interface protocols implemented (ISO 8208 or CLNP) Throughout this document the equipment architecture nomenclature is based on using the letter "I" to indicate integrated equipment and "S" to indicate separated equipment; a second letter is used to indicate services provided in the case of integrated equipment, 
"B" for basic voice only, "V" for enhanced voice only, and "D" for data in addition to 
enhanced voice.  Note that enhanced voice includes basic voice.  In the case of separated 
equipment, the second letter is used to indicate the layers of protocols implemented, "L" 
--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
for the lower layers and "U" for the upper layers.  Furthermore, the lower protocol stack designated by "L" shall include all protocol functions necessary to support enhanced voice operation.  By combining these two letters: 

 
- 
IB is used to designate an equipment architecture with basic voice capability 
only. 
- 
IV is used to designate an integrated equipment architecture with enhanced 
voice capability only. 
- 
ID is used to designate an integrated equipment architecture with both enhanced voice and data capabilities. 
- 
SL is used to designate a separated equipment architecture that implements the lower layer protocols in the VDL Mode 3 protocol stack.  By itself SL supports enhanced voice and, in conjunction with SU, provides both enhanced voice and 
data capabilities.  
- 
SU is used to designate a separated equipment architecture that implements the upper layer protocols in the VDL Mode 3 protocol stack and, in conjunction with SL, provides both enhanced voice and data capabilities. The 2-letter equipment architecture designators described above is followed by a single digit numerical designator to identify the specific subnetwork interface protocols implemented.  A "0" after the letter designator is used to indicate that a subnetwork 
interface is not relevant and is not implemented; a "1" is used to indicate the ISO 8208 
subnetwork interface with compression, and a "2" is used to indicate the CLNP subnetwork interface with compression.  As indicated in Section 2.2.3.1.2 the ground station is not required to support the Raw, ISO 8208 without compression, CLNP without 
compression, or ATN Frame Mode subnetwork interface, and therefore, no separate 
subnetwork designator is assigned for these subnetwork interfaces in this MOPS. Furthermore, as indicated in 2.2.3.1.1, aircraft stations supporting data link services must 
provide the raw interface or some other means for direct access to data information at the subnetwork access protocol interface. By combining the two letter designators and the numerical designators, a total of 7 
equipment classes are defined in Table 2-1 for VDL Mode 3 avionics radios.

2.1.10  
Software Management If the equipment design is implemented using digital computer techniques, the computer software package shall follow guidelines contained in RTCA document DO-178B "Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification."  The equivalent or later editions of DO-178B may be used with the agreement of the authority. 

 
2.2 
Minimum Performance Requirements - Standard Conditions 
 
2.2.1 
 
VDL Mode 3 Subnetwork Physical Layer Requirements 
 
Unless otherwise stated, all physical layer requirements specified in the subsections of Section 2.2.1 shall be applicable to Equipment Classes IB0, IV0, ID*, and SL0.  
Furthermore, these Equipment Classes shall meet the physical layer requirements as specified in Section 3.3.1 of DO-224B, including all applicable subsections, tables, figures, and appendices. 

2.2.1.1  
Transceiver Requirements Unless otherwise stated, all transceiver requirements shall be applicable under room temperature (25o C) condition and with the transceiver tuned to any 25 kHz channel from 
118.000 megahertz (MHz) to 136.975 MHz. 

2.2.1.1.1 
Tuning Range and Channel Increments The transceiver shall be tunable to any 25 kHz channel, from 118.000 MHz to 136.975 MHz (760 channels), as defined in RTCA DO-224B.  The transceiver shall limit its operation to specific time slot(s) on a specific frequency channel defined by the channel label per Appendix M of RTCA DO-224B and the VDL Mode 3 system configuration in use.  
 
Note: 
Manufacturers should note that in the future, part or all of the frequency band 
108.000 to 117.975 MHz may become available for air-ground communications. 

 
2.2.1.1.2 
Modulation The transceiver shall use D8PSK modulation as defined in RTCA DO-224B. 

2.2.1.1.3 
Tuning Time The transceiver shall tune from one channel to another within 100 ms of the receipt of the "frequency change" command from the transceiver tuning control, when the transceiver is not transmitting. 

Note: 
The tuning time is measured starting from the command to tune to the new frequency to the point that the radio starts receiving Mode 3 bursts on its new net. 

 
2.2.1.1.4 
Receive to Transmit Turnaround Time 
 
The transceiver shall complete turnaround from reception to transmission within 17 symbol periods.  This time can be relaxed to 33 symbol periods for aircraft radios which do not implement functions requiring discrete addressing (i.e., IB0). 

Notes: 1. Receive to transmit turnaround time is defined as the time between the middle of the last information symbol of one receive burst and the middle of the first symbol of the synchronization sequence of the subsequent transmit burst. 2. The shortest receive to transmit turnaround time for an aircraft radio occurs when the reception of an uplink management burst (M burst) beacon is followed by a downlink voice or data (V/D) transmission in the same time slot.  
 
--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
2.2.1.1.5 
Transmit to Receive Turnaround Time The transceiver shall complete turnaround from transmission to reception within 32 symbol periods. 

 
Notes: 
 
1. Transmit to receive turnaround time is defined as the time between the middle of the last information symbol of one transmit burst and the middle of the first symbol of the synchronization sequence of the subsequent receive burst. 2. The worst case transmit to receive turnaround time for an aircraft radio occurs when it transmits a downlink M burst message and receives a V/D message in the same time slot. 

 
2.2.1.1.6 
Uplink Voice Delay Requirement 
 
The end-to-end voice delay of the communications link consisting of a reference ground station transmitter and the avionics receiver Equipment Under Test (EUT), connected back-to-back, shall be less than 236 ms.

2.2.1.2.6 
Symbol Rate Capture Range The BER requirement (Section 2.2.1.2) shall be achieved when the desired signal at the reference signal level (Section 2.2.1.2) is subject to a symbol rate offset of Â± 50 parts per million (ppm). 

2.2.1.2.7 
Frequency Capture Range The BER requirement (Section 2.2.1.2) shall be achieved when the desired signal at the reference level (Section 2.2.1.2) is subject to a frequency offset of Â± 967 Hz. 

 
Note: 
This value is composed of the maximum transmitter frequency error at 136.975 
MHz (Â± 685 Hz) and the maximum Doppler shift (Â± *282 Hz).* 
 
When tested over the range of environmental conditions specified in Section 2.3, frequency capture range performance shall be measured with a signal level 6 dB above the reference level (Section 2.2.1.2). 

2.2.1.2.8 
Phase Acceleration The BER requirement (Section 2.2.1.2) shall be achieved when a desired VDL Mode 3 signal operating at the reference signal level (Section 2.2.1.2) is subject to a phase acceleration of 1000 Hz/s or less, provided the frequency offset of the signal remains 685 
Hz or less from the frequency of the tuned channel. 

Note: 
Phase Acceleration is related to frequency modulation processes, in both Doppler scenarios and VDL transmitter residual frequency modulation. The frequency modulation produced in Doppler scenarios is characterized by low modulation rates and low peak frequency deviations.  DO-224B specifies maximum phase accelerations permissible in VDL transmitters that swamp those produced in Doppler scenarios.  The rate in the test has been set to reflect both Doppler and VDL transmitter phase acceleration specifications to ensure VDL receivers will correctly demodulate signals modulated by Doppler and residual FM mechanisms.   
 
2.2.1.2.9 
Co-channel Interference (CCI) The BER requirement (Section 2.2.1.2) shall be achieved when an on channel undesired VDL Mode 3 signal, which is at least 20 dB below the desired signal is applied in addition to the desired signal operating at the reference signal level (Section 2.2.1.2). 

2.2.1.2.10 
Conducted Spurious Emission When the receiver input is terminated in a resistive load that is equal to the receiver nominal input impedance, the level of any spurious emission appearing across the load shall not exceed minus 57 dBm over the frequency range of 50 kHz to 1215 MHz, with the exception of the range of 108 to 137 MHz, where it shall not exceed minus 64 dBm.

2.2.1.3.2 
RF Output Power The RF output power of the transmitter shall be the average power measured over an 
output burst. Class 9: The RF output power, measured at the transmitter antenna port, on all 
frequencies for which the transmitter is designed, shall not be less than 15 watts. Class 10: The output power, measured at the transmitter antenna port, on all frequencies 
for which the transmitter is designed, shall not be less than 4 watts. 
 
Note: 
To achieve the requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.6 and Section 2.2.1.3.7, it is 
recommended that the maximum output power be limited to 25 watts. 
 
2.2.1.3.3 
RF Power Rise Time The transmitter ramp-up and power stabilization component of the training sequence shall be defined over the time interval t = -5.5 to t = -0.5, where t = 0 is the middle of the first symbol of the synchronization sequence (refer to Figure 2-14).  The RF power shall be equal to or less than minus 40 dB relative to the carrier (dBc) prior to time t = -5.5 and equal to or greater than 90% of the manufacturer stated output power for the entire time interval between t = -3.0 and t = -0.5.  Time (t) is measured in symbol periods (approximately 95.24 microseconds (Âµsec) per symbol period). 
Notes: 1. It is recommended that symbols transmitted during the ramp-up and power 
stabilization segment represent the information 000. 
 
2. In order to minimize the effect of power in an adjacent channel, careful attention 
must be paid to the profile of the RF signal during the ramp-up period. 
 
3. The relative timing associated with the RF rise time is shown in Figure 2-14 in 
Section 2.4.4.2.3. 
 
4. Minus 40 dB relative to the carrier (dBc) is 40 dB below the manufacturer stated 
output power 
 
2.2.1.3.4 
RF Power Release Time The transmitter output power shall decay at least 20 dB below the rated RF output power level (Section 2.2.1.3.2) within 2.5 symbol periods (approximately 238.1 Âµsec) after the middle of the final information symbol.  The transmitter power leakage when the transmitter is in the "off" state shall be less than minus 83 dBm. 
Note: 
In order to minimize the effect of power in an adjacent channel during power ramp-down, careful attention must be paid to the profile of the RF signal during the ramp-down period. 
 
2.2.1.3.5 
Symbol Constellation Error The EVM (Section 1.7.6), when measured over the first 100 symbols of the reference 
burst sequence (Section 2.4.1.8), shall be less than 6%. 
 
2.2.1.3.6 
Spurious Emissions When the transmitter is "active" (e.g., transceiver in transmit mode) and is terminated in a resistive load equal to the nominal output impedance, the power of any spurious emission at the output of the transmitter shall not exceed the limits listed in items a through g below. a. 0.25 microwatts (ÂµW) (minus 36 dBm) within a bandwidth of 1 kHz, on any 
frequency in the range 9 kHz to 150 kHz.  
b. 0.25 microwatts (minus 36 dBm) within a bandwidth of 10 kHz, on any frequency in 
the range 150 kHz to 30 MHz. 
c. 0.25 microwatts (minus 36 dBm) within a bandwidth of 100 kHz, on any frequency 
in the range 30 MHz to 108 MHz. 
d. 0.25 microwatts (minus 36 dBm) within a bandwidth of 100 kHz, on any frequency 
in the range 108 MHz to 117.5 MHz. 
e. 0.25 microwatts (minus 36 dBm) within a bandwidth of 10 kHz, on any frequency in 
the range 117.5 MHz to 117.8 MHz. 
f. 
0.25 microwatts (minus 36 dBm) within a bandwidth of 10 kHz, on any frequency in 
the range 137.175 MHz to 137.475 MHz. 
g. 0.25 microwatts (minus 36 dBm) within a bandwidth of 100 kHz, on any frequency 
in the range 137.475 MHz to 1.7 gigahertz (GHz). Additionally, the level of spurious emissions at discrete frequencies (excluding harmonics) shall not exceed 4 nanowatts (nW) (minus 54 dBm) in the following bands. h. 47 to 68 MHz i. 
88 to 108 MHz 
j. 
162 to 244 MHz 
k. 328 to 336 MHz 
l. 
470 to 862 MHz 
 
Harmonic emission products shall be at least 60 dB below the rated RF output power, i.e., minus 60 dBc.  Harmonic emission products in the ICAO Global Navigation Satellite 
System (GNSS) band extending from 1559 to 1610 MHz shall be no greater than minus 60 dBm.  The level of the N-th harmonic emission product shall be measured in a bandwidth that is N times 25 kHz. When the transmitter is "idle" (i.e., transceiver is in receive mode) and is terminated in a resistive load equal to its nominal output impedance, the power of any spurious emission at the output of the transmitter shall not exceed the limits listed below in items m through 
o. 
m. 2 nW (minus 57 dBm) within a bandwidth of 1 kHz, on any frequency in the range 9 
kHz to 150 kHz.  
n. 2 nW (minus 57 dBm) within a bandwidth of 10 kHz, on any frequency in the range 
150 kHz to 30 MHz. 
o. 2 nW (minus 57 dBm) within a bandwidth of 100 kHz, on any frequency in the range 
30 MHz to 1 GHz. 
 
Notes:   
 
1. Spurious emissions are power emissions that are outside the desired bandwidth and 
the level of which may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission 
of information.  Spurious emissions include parasitic emissions, intermodulation 
products and frequency conversion products. 2. In order to provide adequate protection for a GNSS receiver when a VDL Mode 3 
transceiver is operated on the same aircraft, the manufacturers should ensure that 
the transmitter harmonic filter remains effective at frequencies in the band 1559 - 
1610 MHz.  See Section 3.2.2. 3. If other receiving systems are installed, transmitter harmonics may interfere with 
those systems.  See Section 3.2.2, Note 2. 
 
2.2.1.3.7 
Adjacent Channel Power 
 
First adjacent channel 
The RF power measured over a 16 kHz channel bandwidth centered on the first adjacent channel shall not exceed minus 18 dBm under all operating conditions (including transmitter attack and decay). The RF power measured over a 25 kHz channel bandwidth centered on the first adjacent channel shall not exceed plus 2 dBm under all operating conditions (including transmitter 
attack and decay). 
Second and third adjacent channel 
The RF power measured over a 25 kHz channel bandwidth when centered on either the second adjacent channel or the third adjacent channel shall not exceed minus 28 dBm under all operating conditions (including transmitter attack and decay).

Beyond the fourth adjacent channel  
Beyond the fourth adjacent channel, the RF power measured in a 25 kHz channel bandwidth shall decrease at a rate of no less than 5 dB per octave of channel offset (e.g., minus 43 dBm or less at the eighth adjacent channel, minus 48 dBm or less at the sixteenth adjacent channel, and minus 53 dBm or less at the thirty-second adjacent channel) to minus 53 dBm or less under all operating conditions (including transmitter 
attack and decay). 
Note: 
The adjacent channel power requirements apply over the entire 117.8 MHz to 137.175 MHz band.

2.3.1 
 
Introduction The environmental tests and performance requirements referenced in this section provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under conditions representative of those that may be encountered in actual operations. 

Some of the environmental tests listed in Table 2-2 and in Table 2-3 in this section do not have to be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition.  These tests are identified by the phrase "if required." If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional environmental conditions, then these "if required" tests shall be performed. Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in documents RTCA DO-160D/EUROCAE ED-14D "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment," July 1997.  The use of later editions of these documents must be agreed with the appropriate approval authority. 

The tests in Table 2-2 and Table 2-3 shall, in general, be conducted only at the mid-band frequency, 127.500 MHz.  However, tests conducted to ascertain equipment performance at extreme temperatures must be conducted also at the lowest and highest channel assignments of the AM(R)S band.

Receiver 
 
Note: 
Some of the performance requirements in Section 2.2.1.2 are not required to be tested to all of the conditions contained in RTCA DO-160D/EUROCAE ED-14D.  

Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Section 2.2.1.2 will not be measurably degraded 
by exposure to these conditions. 
 
2.3.3 
 
Transmitter 
 
Note: 
Some of the performance requirements in Section 2.2.1.3 are not required to be 
tested to all of the conditions contained in RTCA DO-160D/EUROCAE ED-14D. Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Section 2.2.1.3 will not be measurably degraded 
by exposure to these conditions.

The application of this test may result in damage to the equipment. It may, therefore, be conducted after the other tests.  
Furthermore, paragraph 2.1.7 of this document -"Effects of Tests" - does not apply following crash safety shocks. 
(2) 
The application of this test may result in damage to the equipment. It may, therefore, be conducted after the other tests.  
Furthermore, paragraph 2.1.7 of this document -"Effects of Tests" - does not apply. 
(3) 
Equipment performance requirements for this function of the EUT are defined within DO-160D. 
(4) 
Tailor the conducted and radiated RF susceptibility tests in RTCA/DO-160 Section 20 as follows.  From 112 MHz to 143 MHz excluding the tuned frequency plus and minus 200 kHz, perform the radiated RF susceptibility tests using a calibrated field strength of 25 millivolts per meter, and perform the conducted RF susceptibility using a calibrated cable bundle current of 40 microamperes.  The frequency band of the tuned frequency plus and minus 200 kHz is excluded from this test.  Use the calibration and test procedures in DO-160 Section 20.4, 20.5, and 20.6 that apply to Category T.  For frequencies below 112 MHz and above 143 MHz use a category from RTCA/DO-160 Section 20 appropriate for the intended application of this radio.  The tests should be performed with the antenna coaxial cable terminated in a matched 
load.  This exclusion supersedes the exclusion frequencies specified in RTCA/DO-160 Section 20.3.d.

All mechanical devices shall perform their intended functions.

## 2.4 Equipment Test Procedures The Following Procedures Provide Guidelines For Tests To Ensure Compliance With The Mops Performance Requirements.  Alternative Procedures Or Analyses Providing Equivalent Performance Documentation May Be Used; And If So, They Shall Be Accompanied With Detailed Documentation Of The Method Used.  Therefore, The Procedures Cited Herein Should Be Used As One Criterion In Evaluating Acceptability Of The Alternate Procedures. 2.4.1 Definition Of Terms And Conditions Of Tests 2.4.1.1 Warm-Up And Stabilization Of Test Equipment/Equipment Under Test The Equipment Under Test And The Associated Test Equipment Shall Be Powered Up For A Period Of No Less Than One Hour Prior To The Start Of Each Test Session To Ensure That The Unit Under Test And The Test Equipment Are Sufficiently Stabilized Under The Test Environment. 2.4.1.2 Alignment, Adjustment And Calibration For Equipment Under Test All Alignment, Adjustment And Calibration Of The Test Equipment And Equipment Under Test Shall Be Performed Prior To Commencement Of The Test.  Once The Test Starts, No Further Manual Alignment, Adjustment, And Calibration Of Test Equipment And The Equipment Under Test Shall Be Allowed Throughout The Duration Of The Test.  Automatic Re-Calibration Of The Test Equipment, If Used, Shall Be Permitted. 2.4.1.3 Equipment Termination Unless Otherwise Specified, All Tests Shall Be Performed With The Equipment Rf Terminal(S) Terminated With A Load Matching The Nominal Characteristic Impedance Of The Equipment. 2.4.1.4 Test Equipment Calibration And Replacement All Test Equipment Used For Mops Testing Shall Be Properly Calibrated.  All Test Equipment Calibration Shall Remain Valid Throughout The Entire Duration Of The Test.  In The Case That Test Equipment Needs To Be Replaced Due To Equipment Failure, The Replacement Equipment Shall Be Of The Same Make And Model As The Equipment It Replaces. 2.4.1.5 Failure Of The Equipment Under Test In The Event That The Equipment Under Test Fails During The Course Of The Test, A Report Shall Be Generated By The Manufacturer Of The Failed Equipment To Detail The Cause Of The Failure And The Fixes Proposed.  Test Shall Not Be Resumed Until It Has Been Determined That The Failure Was Not Due To A Design Fault.  Test Shall Not Be Continued, If Engineering Judgment Indicates That The Changes Made To Correct The Failure Would Affect Any Of The Previously Run Tests. 2.4.1.6 Measurement Error Due To Test Equipment And Test Setup Good Engineering Practices Should Be Exercised To Minimize Measurement Error Contributed By The Test Equipment And Test Setup.  Precautions Shall Be Taken To Minimize Measurement Errors Due To Contributions From Noise Sidebands Of Signal Generators And

impedance mismatches.  Whenever practical, measurement error due to test setup, including cable contributions, shall be compensated for. 

Note: 
Test equipment, particularly the VHF signal generators, used in the MOPS tests should be chosen with reasonably low noise floor and noise sidebands to ensure that the test equipment contributions to the measurement errors are negligible. 

 
2.4.1.7  
Default RF Signal Level for Avionics Testing 
 
Unless otherwise stated, the desired RF signal level presented to the RF input of the intended aircraft and ground radios shall be adjusted to a level of minus 50 dBm Â± 5 dB. 

 
2.4.1.8  
Transmitter Reference Burst Sequence For tests that require stressing the transmitter, a reference burst sequence is defined and is illustrated in Figure 2-3.  In this figure, M represents a downlink M burst, V represents a downlink V/D (voice) burst, and D represents a downlink V/D (data) burst.  This sequence shall be repeated 24 times, i.e., for slightly less than 35 seconds.

Note: 
The highest aircraft transmitter duty factor occurs in the 1V3D configuration.  
The recommended sequence is meant to simulate a scenario where an aircraft radio is transmitting a voice message using the A slots while "simultaneously" transmitting a string of data message, each of which is 15 bursts long.  The M 
burst in the B slot represents a Reservation Request.  It is assumed that an uplink Acknowledgment message is sent in cycle 4 and a Reservation is delivered in 
cycle 6.  This corresponds to an overall duty factor of approximately 39%. Poll responses and other infrequent downlink M bursts would add a negligible amount to the duty factor.  For the purposes of this test, the V and D bursts can 
be replaced by special BER measurement bursts (see Section 2.4.2.1). 
 
2.4.2 
 
Special Test Mode and Test Equipment for Physical Layer Tests To facilitate testing of the VDL transceiver for compliance with the requirements stated 
in Section 2.3, a special BER test mode of the VDL transceiver is required if specific test 
procedures stated in Section 2.4 are utilized.  Custom test equipment/fixtures also may be required.  The BER mode and the custom test equipment/fixtures are described in the following Sections. 
2.4.2.1  
BER Mode Many test procedures in Section 2.4 require the use of a BER mode, which is distinct from the operating mode, for measuring the BER of the Physical layer.  The BER mode provides a means of isolating the Physical layer from the upper layers to allow performance measurement of the Physical layer alone.  Without a BER mode, the manufacturer will need to develop equivalent procedures for the tests requiring BER mode.  The alternative test method used for verification shall be traceable back to the minimum operational performance objectives for the transceiver. To facilitate the determination that the VDL Mode 3 equipment satisfies the allocated performance requirements for its intended operation, the implementation of the BER mode must be traceable to the implementation of the operational mode.  Thus, verification of the BER mode will provide a useful performance measure for determination that the VDL Mode 3 equipment is a viable communication system element for a given operational environment. In the BER mode, the receiver shall forward each burst payload to the external BER test fixture prior to error detection or correction procedures. 

2.4.2.2  
VHF Signal Generators Physical layer test procedures require the use of a high performance VHF signal generator, which shall be capable of generating and processing the specified modulation format and transmission format and of supporting the following functions: 1. Transmission of VDL Mode 3 test bursts consisting of the ramp up period followed by the standard 16-symbol synchronization sequence, variable burst length test payload, and ramp down period. 2. Interface to an external BER test fixture for inputting and outputting test payload data. 

 
2.4.2.3  
Undesired Signal Source VHF signal generators are required to generate the undesired signals for the purpose of verifying performance under various interference conditions.  Tests for CCI and ACR 
require the generation of an Undesired VDL Mode 3 Signal, as defined in Section 1.7.9. A VHF signal generator also capable of generating CW and externally modulated FM 
signals is required. 

 
2.4.2.4  
External BER Test Fixture 
 
1. The external BER Test Fixture shall include a message generator/processor to generate test payloads for the desired and undesired signals in both burst and nonburst (continuous) forms.  In either form, appropriate ramp up sequence shall be added to the test payload and mapped directly into the Mode 3 TDMA frame structure.  The formatting shall include cyclic redundancy check (CRC), scrambling, and header. 

 
2. The external BER test fixture generating the transmitted burst payload and receiving and processing the received burst payload must be synchronized with the transceiver under test either explicitly (via some direct connection) or implicitly (via the known sequencing of the pseudorandom test payload). 

 
3. Calculation of cumulative BER statistics shall begin once synchronization of the external BER test fixture between the transmitting and receiving burst payload has been accomplished.  The external BER test fixture shall detect the loss of an entire burst implicitly by lack of a burst payload message in the given burst period.  Each test shall also include a running count of synchronization failures in addition to the cumulative BER. 

 
2.4.2.5  
Test Payload Test payloads used in all BER tests shall be pseudorandom sequences.  Unless otherwise stated, the desired signal payload shall be transmitted in burst form. For BER tests, the minimum length of the pseudorandom test sequence used shall be 
100,000 bits in order to provide statistically meaningful bit error rate measurement at 10-3 
BER. If required, any pseudorandom test sequence used for the undesired signal shall be uncorrelated in content and timing with the pseudorandom test sequence used for the desired signal. 

2.4.2.6  
Unmodulated Carrier Mode 
 
To facilitate the test procedures of Section 2.4.4.2.10, the VDL Mode 3 transceiver shall provide a means of transmitting an unmodulated continuous wave signal in a VDL Mode 
3 burst.  Alternatively, the transceiver may provide a means of measuring the selected carrier frequency, prior to modulation, from a test point that is externally accessible on the VDL Mode 3 transceiver.  The unmodulated carrier signal need not be available at the same output power levels required for the modulated output. 

2.4.3 
 
VDL Mode 3 Test Set  
 
The VDL Mode 3 Test Set, hereafter referred to as the Test Set, is customized test equipment with the functionality required for verifying the voice, link layer, and subnetwork operations of VDL Mode 3 avionics. In order to standardize testing of the various protocol layers above the Physical layer across the range of VDL Mode 3 avionics equipment classes defined in Section 2.1.9, this document adopts the nomenclature of ISO-9646.  Figure 2-4 illustrates a high-level functional block diagram of the ISO-9646 Test Configuration for the VDL Mode 3 
avionics testing.  Figure 2-4 shows the VDL Mode 3 Test Set to consist of an Upper Tester (UT), a Lower Tester (LT), and a set of peripheral functions.  Depending upon the classes of equipment to be tested, the UT and LT will need to be configured accordingly. This section and its subsections give an overview of the major components involved in the ISO-9646 Test Configuration.  Specifically, the terms System Under Test (SUT), Equipment Under Test (EUT), and the major elements of the Test Set are defined. 

--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
 
The **System Under Test** (SUT) is a complete implementation of the VDL Mode 3 
avionics system necessary for the service provided.  For equipment providing voice and data services, the SUT is a complete implementation from the VHF Physical layer through the Subnetwork Access Protocol.  For equipment providing voice-only service, the SUT is an implementation of the VHF Physical layer through that part of the link layer that is required to support voice service. 

The **Equipment Under Test** (EUT) is that part of the SUT to be tested.  Note that EUT 
is synonymous with SUT for equipment classes in the integrated equipment architecture and EUT is a subset of the SUT for the separated equipment architecture. 

The **Upper Tester** (UT) is the means of providing, during test execution, for the control and observation of the upper service boundary of the EUT and of any relevant abstract local primitives. For Class ID* and Class SU* equipment, the upper service boundary is the ISO 8208 or CLNP SNAcP interface.  Note that this may require the insertion of a test point within the SU1 equipment to access the ISO8208 SNAcP and DCE interfaces to conduct the Test Group 9 tests, as the equipment may be integrated with the ATN router. For Class SL0 equipment, the upper service boundary is the Data/Management Interface defined in Section 2.2.6.  Note that the UT does not interface with Class IB0 and Class IV0 equipment. 

The **Lower Tester** (LT) is the means of providing, during test execution, for the control and observation at the appropriate Point of Control and Observation either below the EUT or remote from the EUT, as defined by the chosen test method.  For Class IB0, Class IV0, Class ID*, and Class SL0 equipment, the lower service boundary between the EUT and the LT is the VHF Physical Layer.  For Class SU* equipment, the lower service boundary between the EUT and the LT is the Data/Management Interface defined in Section 2.2.6. 

The **Peripheral Functions** of the Test Set include, as a minimum the following functions: 

- 
Generation of voice and data test messages for use as input to the UT, LT, 
and the EUT, 
- 
Processing of the received voice and data messages 
- 
Providing Input/Output (I/O) functions 
- 
Providing human machine interface for the tester to control and configure the 
Test Set 
 
2.4.3.1  
Upper Tester (UT) Configuration The UT is not necessarily a single definable piece of test instrumentation, but will likely be comprised of an assemblage of test equipment appropriate for a given test procedure 
that is capable of providing the functions necessary for that test.  Figure 2-5 shows the 
functional blocks of a UT required to test the classes of equipment defined in Section 2.1.9.  Note that the interface between the EUT and UT may differ, such as for Classes SL0 and SU*, depending upon the specific architecture classes of the equipment being 
tested, and the UT will need to be configured accordingly.  In the case of testing IB0 and 
IV0 equipment, the UT is not used and will be bypassed.  The major elements of the UT are defined in the subsections that follow. 

Note:  The configurations of the Upper
Tester and the external interface to the EUT
vary with the equipment classes of the EUT.
See Section 2.4.3.4 for the Standard Test
Configurations defined for the different
equipment classes of this MOPS.

 
 
2.4.3.1.1 
Upper Data/Management Interface Test Tool (UDMITT) The Upper Data/Management Interface Test Tool (UDMITT) is a subset of the UT and it implements the protocol layer functions associated with architecture Class SU* equipment.  To test Class SL0 equipment, the UDMITT must include functionality to emulate the upper layers of the VDL Mode 3 protocol stack between the SNAcP interface and the Data/Management Interface.  The UDMITT, when connected to a Class SL0 
EUT, implements the full VDL Mode 3 protocol stack.  The purpose of a UDMITT is to complement a Class SL0 EUT to function as a complete VDL Mode 3 avionics radio and, thus, make the UDMITT/Class SL0 EUT combination an SUT.  The UDMITT function includes a means of bi-directional communications with a Class SL0 EUT by way of the Data/Management Interface defined in Section 2.2.6.  Class ID* equipment has all the necessary VDL Mode 3 protocol functions and does not require the UDMITT for testing.  
The Test Set will be configured such that the UDMITT bypasses its separated equipment functions when testing Class ID* equipment.  As indicated earlier, the UT, including the UDMITT, will be bypassed for testing Class IB0 and IV0 equipment. 

Note: 
An acceptable implementation of a UDMITT for testing Class SL0 equipment could be a certified Class SU* equipment (e.g. a CMU implementing VDL Mode 
3 functionality). 

 
2.4.3.2  
Lower Tester (LT) Configuration The LT is not necessarily a single definable piece of test instrumentation, but will likely be comprised of an assemblage of test equipment appropriate for a given test procedure that is capable of providing the functions necessary for that test.  Figure 2-6 shows the functional blocks of an LT required to test the classes of equipment defined in Section 
2.1.9.  Note that the interface between the EUT and LT may differ, depending upon the specific architecture classes of the equipment being tested.  The LT will need to be configured accordingly.  The major elements of an LT are defined in the sections below. 

 
Note:  The configurations of the Section 2.4.3.4 for the Standard MOPS.

 
 
2.4.3.2.1 
Lower Data/Management Interface Test Tool (LDMITT) The Lower Data/Management Interface Test Tool (LDMITT) is a subset of the Lower Tester and it implements the protocol layer functions associated with architecture Class SL0 equipment.  For Class SU* equipment, the LDMITT must include functionality to emulate the lower layers of the VDL Mode 3 protocol stack between the Data/Management Interface and the physical layer.  The LDMITT when connected to a Class SU* equipment implements the full VDL Mode 3 protocol stack.  The purpose of an LDMITT is to complement a Class SU* EUT to function together as a complete VDL Mode 3 avionics radio and, thus, make the LDMITT/SU* EUT combination an SUT. The LDMITT function includes a means of bi-directional communications with Class SU* EUT by means of the Data/Management Interface defined in Section 2.2.6.  Class ID*, IB0, and IV0 equipment, on the other hand, have all the necessary lower layer VDL 
--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Mode 3 protocol functions implemented internally and do not require the LDMITT 
functionality for testing. The LT will be configured with the LDMITT bypassed.  
Note: 
An acceptable implementation of an LDMITT for testing Class SU* equipment could be a combination of a GSE emulating one or more ground stations, as specified in Section 2.4.3.2.3; an ASE emulating one or more aircraft stations, as specified in Section 2.4.3.2.4; and Class SL0 equipment. 

 
2.4.3.2.2 
RF Bridge An RF Bridge is provided to interconnect the RF signals from the GSE, the ASE, the LDMITT, and the EUT over the VHF A/G communications band to emulate the common shared channel operation of the A/G communications environment. 

2.4.3.2.3 
Ground Station Emulator (GSE) 
 
The GSE emulates all the ground station functions in a VDL Mode 3 network.  Some VDL Mode 3 functions and characteristics can be verified only when a VDL Mode 3 EUT is coupled through an RF link with its VDL Mode 3 Ground Station (GS) counterpart, each controlling or reacting to various states (or changes of state) of each other.  The GSE is used in conjunction with other elements of the Test Set, e.g., the ASE, to form a VDL Mode 3 subnetwork to support MOPS testing. The GSE is not necessarily a single definable piece of test instrumentation, but will likely comprise an assemblage of equipment appropriate for a given test procedure capable of providing the functions necessary for that test. The following is a minimal list to be incorporated as part of the GSE:   

- 
The GSE must be compliant with the applicable requirements set for VDL Mode 3 in RTCA DO-224B. 
- 
The GSE must be able to establish a "link" with the EUT by transmitting and receiving properly modulated RF signals in compliance with DO-224B. 
- 
The GSE must be able to establish an ISO 8208 link with its peer entity in the aircraft 
radio for applicable equipment classes, and to emulate air-ground subnetwork 
operations via this link.  
- 
The GSE must be able to establish a CLNP link with its peer entity in the aircraft 
radio for applicable equipment classes, and to emulate air-ground subnetwork 
operations via this link.  
- 
The GSE must have the ability to control the signaling and communications protocols 
embodied as part of the VDL Mode 3 and ATN manual standards, and to verify correct operation of these protocols. 
- 
The GSE must be capable of emulating two independent ground stations, designated as Ground Station 1 (GS1) and Ground Station 2 (GS2), operating in separate VHF channels. 
 
- 
Each ground station must be independently configurable to support any of the standard VDL Mode 3 system configurations. 
 
- 
Each ground station must be capable of corrupting selected uplink Management (M) bursts and Voice/Data (V/D) bursts prior to transmission and selected downlink bursts after demodulation. 
 
- 
Each ground station must be capable of selectively suppressing the transmission of specified uplink bursts to each connected aircraft station, or discarding specific received bursts in the downlink. 
 
- 
Each ground station must be capable of advancing or retarding the timing of its bursts 
relative to the timing reference of the net independently. 
 
- 
The transmit signal level of each ground station at the destination radio must be independently adjustable from its rated output down to minus 98 dBm in 1 dB steps. 
 
- 
The two ground stations must be able to synchronize their timings to each other or to 
a common timing source. 
 
2.4.3.2.4 
Aircraft Station Emulator (ASE) The Aircraft Station Emulator (ASE) emulates all aircraft radio functions required to operate in a VDL Mode 3 subnetwork.  The ASE is used in conjunction with other 
elements of the Test Set, e.g., the GSE, to form a VDL Mode 3 subnetwork to support 
MOPS testing.  The following is a minimal list of functions that should be incorporated as part of the ASE: 
- 
The ASE must be compliant with the minimum requirements set for VDL Mode 3 in DO-224B. 
 
- 
The ASE must be able to establish a "link" with the EUT and GSE. 
 
- 
The ASE must be capable of emulating up to two independent aircraft stations designated as Aircraft Station 1 (AC1) and Aircraft Station 2 (AC2). 
 
- 
Each aircraft station in the ASE must be capable of advancing or retarding the timing 
of its bursts relative to its timing reference point. 
 
- 
The transmit signal level of each aircraft station in the ASE must be independently adjustable from its rated output down to minus 98 dBm in 1 dB steps. 
 
2.4.3.2.5 
ATN Capability Ground ATN capable and aircraft ATN capable devices are required for end-to-end test 
of the data link.  This may be accomplished by including within the Message Generator/Processor an ATN capability.  Alternately, ATN routers and/or end-systems 
may be attached to the Message Generator/Processor.  The key functional requirements 
of the ground and aircraft ATN capabilities are: 
- 
An ATN capability must include the ability to operate transport protocol class 4 (TP4) connections over connectionless network protocol (CLNP), connectionless 
--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

transport protocol (CLTP) connections over CLNP, and perform the CLNP echo 
request/response protocol.

The TP4, CLTP, and CLNP code must originate from an independent source other than that of the VDL Mode 3 CLNP compression code. 
 
- 
The maximum transmission unit (MTU) size for the CLNP interface must be set to 923 bytes.

Monitor VDL Mode 3 burst timing and header information 
- 
Control of Test Set functions 
- 
Human Machine Interface Some of these functions are described below. 
2.4.3.3.1 
Message Generator/Processor The Message Generator/Processor is used to generate voice and data message stimuli and 
measure voice and data message response to and from the EUT, Aircraft Station Emulator (ASE), and Ground Station Emulator (GSE) in the Test Set. 
2.4.3.3.1.1 
Voice Message Generation and Processing The key functional requirements of the voice message generation and processing are: 
- 
Voice message generation must be controlled by PTT signaling from the ground and 
aircraft radios of the Test Set and the avionics EUT. 
 
- 
The voice message generation and processing function must have the capability to measure end-to-end voice quality objectively (See Note below.).

The Message Generator/Processor may be integrated with a commercially 
available voice quality measurement system for evaluating the voice quality of an air-ground test link objectively.  The test link refers to the reference ground station and the avionics radio EUT connected back-to-back.  Even though there is currently no objective voice quality requirement specified in the MASPS, such 
a requirement is deemed appropriate for the MOPS in order to guarantee that 
the vocoder has been integrated properly into the avionics radio and the end-toend voice quality is of acceptable quality.  Such an objective voice quality requirement is included in Section 2.2.4.1.  
 
2.4.3.3.1.2 
Data Message Generation and Processing The Data Message Generation and Processing functions include a means of bi-directional communications with the VDL Mode 3 EUT by way of CLNP and ISO 8208 packets. The Data Message Generation and Processing functions shall permit user control of data 
content and message timing for transmitted messages.  The Data Message Generation and 
Processing functions shall permit user storage, retrieval and examination of incoming and 
outgoing messages on both octet and packet levels, in accordance with the appropriate 
SNAcP interfaces and DO-224B.  Data fields within packets will also be capable of being loaded with either live data emulating operational scenarios or pseudorandom or arbitrary test data.  The Data Message Generation and Processing functions shall provide a means 
of validating and documenting the information content of any message transmitted to or 
received from the EUT and the GSE and ASE elements.  The key functional requirements 
of the data message generation and processing functions are:  
 
- 
The Data Message Generator/Processor must be capable of generating pseudorandom sequences with user-selectable lengths and priority levels for use as input data messages to the radios. 
 
- 
The Data Message Generator/Processor must allow user generated messages of selected length and priorities to be used as data input to the radios.

- 
The Data Message Generator/Processor must be capable of injecting multiple data 
messages of specified lengths and priorities at a specified rate to all radios of the Test Set and the EUT independently to originate point-to-point data transmission or uplink 
data broadcast. 
 
2.4.3.3.2 
Monitoring Facility The Test Set must include a monitoring facility that is capable of measuring and displaying pertinent system timing information, equipment status, and signal 
characteristics.  The key functional requirements of the Monitoring Facility are: 
 
- 
The Monitoring Facility must monitor the timing of all transmission bursts in a given net in reference to the ground station timing reference. 
 
- 
The Monitoring Facility must log the timing information of bursts onto a data file for post analysis.

consists of a single unit of the designated classes of equipment. 
2.4.3.4.1 
Standard Test Set Configuration 1 for Class IB0/IV0/Class ID* Equipment The standard Test Set configuration 1 is for testing Class IB0, Class IV0, and Class ID* 
equipment in both Single Radio and Multiple Radio testing and is shown in Figure 2-7, 
with its major functional blocks identified. 
--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Physical Layer Tests The standard test configurations described in section 2.4.3.4 above are intended for testing avionics for compliance with link layer, subnetwork layer, and voice requirements.  The Physical layer tests do not normally require the use of the Test Set. The Physical layer of the avionics is typically conducted as a bench test using primarily commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) RF test equipment.  The test equipment and test setup may vary from test to test and will be specified as part of the test procedures for each test. The following test procedures are considered to be satisfactory means of establishing compliance with the Physical layer requirements of Section 2 of this document. However, alternative procedures, which provide equivalent information may be used.  To reduce the number of test cases, the number of frequencies at which the VDL transmitter and receiver are to be tested shall include a low frequency (for example, 118.000 MHz), a mid frequency (for example 127.500 MHz), and a high frequency (for example 136.975 MHz). The Physical layer test procedures of this section are applicable only to Class IB0, IV0, ID*, and SL0 equipment. 

2.4.4.1  
Receiver Test Procedures Unless otherwise stated, for tests of receiver BER performance, the receiver will be placed in the BER Mode and the GSE set in the complementary BER mode.  Figure 2-10

mode.  
 
Step 2  
Use VHF signal generator A to produce a desired VDL Mode 3 signal.  Tune 
both generator A and the receiver under test to one of the test frequencies

Note: 
In the absence of the desired signal (i.e., Generator A switched "off"), the 
intermodulation products produced by any interaction between the interfering signal generators B & C, must be less than minus 105 dBm at the receiver input. Additional band-pass filters, inserted between each generator and the R.F

Bit Rate (Section 2.2.1.3.1) This requirement may be satisfied by written evidence. In this case, the manufacturer must declare crystal stability, aging and temperature coefficients. 
Note: 
The evidence must demonstrate that consideration has been given to the 
temperature variation to which the equipment will be subjected (See Section 2.3, "Environmental Test Conditions") and the frequency range for which the 
equipment is designed to operate. 
 
2.4.4.2.2

Tune the transmitter to one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
 
Step 3 
Key the transmitter under test "on" and modulate the carrier with an 
appropriate test payload in burst form from the transmission generator. Step 4 
Set the power meter (or vector signal analyzer) to capture the VDL Mode 3 
transmitted signal and determine the average transmitter output power during the message period. Step 5 
Verify compliance of the measured output power with the transmitter output 
power requirement (Section 2.2.1.3.2) for the appropriate class of transmitter. Step 6 
Repeat Steps 2 to 5 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
 
Note: 
The output power must not be averaged over the time intervals between signal

## 2.4.4.2.3 Rf Power Rise Time (Section 2.2.1.3.3) Equipment Required Transmission Generator (Pc With Suitable Software) Attenuator (30 Db/30 W) Vector Signal Analyzer

Procedure Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-13. Step 2 
Configure the vector signal analyzer to display both constellation diagram and 
power versus time charts. Step 3 
Tune the transmitter and the vector signal analyzer to one of the test 
frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 4 
Use the transmission generator to generate a single test-burst. Step 5 
Capture the start of the test-burst using both constellation and power versus 
time display and identify the first symbol of the synchronization sequence. 
 
Step 6 
Verify that the RF power level at 5.5 symbol periods before the middle of the 
first synchronization symbol is compliant with the RF power rise time requirement (Section 2.2.1.3.3). Step 7 
Verify that the RF power level for the 3 symbol periods before the middle of 
the first synchronization symbol is compliant with the RF power rise time requirement (Section 2.2.1.3.3). Step 8 
Repeat Steps 3 to 7 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
 
Note: 
The training sequence for each type of burst has a characteristic amplitude profile.  For V/D bursts, with synchronization sequence S2, the profile appears as shown in Figure 2-14.  The point labeled T=0 is the middle (ideal sampling point) of the first symbol of the synchronization sequence.  There is a pronounced notch in the profile at T=0.5, which provides a convenient marker.  This makes it easy to check the power level at the appropriate time, which is 3.5 symbol periods prior to the notch, i.e., at T=-3.  This could constitute an alternative method using a standard spectrum analyzer or fast storage oscilloscope.  For VDL Mode 3 synchronization sequences other than S2, the profile shape will be different.

Equipment Required Transmission Generator (PC with suitable software) Attenuator (30 dB/30 W) Vector Signal Analyzer 
Procedure Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-13. Step 2 
Configure the vector signal analyzer in digital demodulation mode to display 
log magnitude of I & Q vectors, with normalization disabled.  Set the Y-axis to read "dBm".  The symbol times are displayed on the resultant profile of power versus time.  Use of the trigger hold off function will aid signal acquisition. Step 3 
Tune the transmitter and the vector signal analyzer to one of the test 
frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 4 
Use the transmission generator to produce a single burst message.  Capture the 
end of this message on the vector signal analyzer. Step 5 
Use the power versus time display to determine the corresponding profile for 
each symbol of the "power down" ramp. Step 6 
Measure the RF power level at 2.5 symbol periods after the middle of the final 
information symbol of the transmitted burst.   
 
Step 7 
Verify compliance of the measured power level with the RF power release time 
requirement (Section 2.2.1.3.4) Step 8 
Repeat Steps 3 to 7 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4) 
 
Caution: While performing Steps 9 to 13 below, ensure that the transmitter is not keyed 
or transmitting to prevent damage to the Vector Signal Analyzer. Step 9 
Reconfigure the test setup with the Vector Signal Analyzer connected directly 
to the RF output of the transmitter under test. Step 10 
Tune the transmitter to one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 11 
With the transmitter idle (i.e., transceiver in receive mode, powered on but not 
transmitting) measure the transmitter RF output with the Vector Signal 
Analyzer referenced to an RF bandwidth of 25 kHz. Step 12 
Verify compliance of the measured power level with the transmitter power 
leakage requirement (Section 2.2.1.3.4). Step 13

Procedure Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-15. Step 2 
Use a notch filter centered on one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4) to 
attenuate the on-channel signal in order to increase the dynamic range of the measurement without overloading the spectrum analyzer.  Measure the frequency response of the filter and take this into account when calculating 
spurious measurement results. Step 3 
Tune the transmitter to the selected test frequency. Step 4 
Set the transmission generator to produce an appropriate test payload in burst 
form and key the transmitter under test "on". Step 5 
Adjust the spectrum analyzer reference level to provide the maximum dynamic 
range for display and set the input attenuator to the minimum required to ensure that no signal at the analyzer input exceeds the maximum allowable level. Step 6 
Measure the power level of each visible spurious signal using power band 
markers appropriate to the bandwidths specified in (Section 2.2.1.3.6).  Use the filter to reject the carrier in order to increase the dynamic range of the measurement without overloading the spectrum analyzer.  Make proper compensation for the frequency response of the filter to determine the transmitter spurious signal level. Step 7 
Verify compliance of the compensated spurious signal level with the spurious 
emission requirement. Step 8 
Repeat Steps 2 to 7 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 9 
Insert the 2:1 VSWR resistive load and delay into the equipment setup as 
shown in Figure 2-15a. Step 10 
Vary the VSWR phase angle of the load with the delay line and measure the 
spurious emissions from the transmitter as in Step 6. Step 11 
Verify compliance of the compensated spurious signal level under VSWR load 
with the spurious requirement (Section 2.2.1.3.6/2.2.1.3.9). Step 12 
Repeat Steps 10 to 12 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4).

Adjacent Channel Power (Section 2.2.1.3.7) 
 
Method of Measurement for the First Adjacent Channel 
 
Equipment Required Transmission Generator (PC with suitable software) Attenuator (30 dB/30 W) Spectrum Analyzer (with power band marker function) 
Procedure Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-16. Step 2 
Tune the transmitter to one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 3 
Key the transmitter under test "on" and modulate it with the transmission 
generator to produce an appropriate test payload in burst form. Step 4 
Adjust the attenuator in the analyzer to the minimum value, which does not 
overload the input stage of the unit. Step 5 
Use 100 kHz span to display the VDL Mode 3 signal envelope.  Use the 
analyzer IF signal as the trigger source for the display and set averaging to 10.  
 
Step 6 
Use the power band marker function of the analyzer to measure the power in a 
16 kHz bandwidth of the first upper adjacent channel. Step 7 
Repeat Step 6, except measure the power in a 25 kHz bandwidth of the first 
upper adjacent channel. Step 8 
Repeat Steps 3 to 7 for the first lower adjacent channel. Step 9 
Verify compliance of the first adjacent channel powers in 16 kHz and 25 kHz 
bandwidths with the first adjacent channel power requirements (Section 2.2.1.3.7). Step 10

verify that the adjacent channel power measurements satisfy the 
requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.7 when compensating for the increased 
power measurement due to peak measurement versus average measurement  
 
Note 1: As an example, Agilent Application Note 1303, page 18, shows that the peak 
measurement can be 10 dB greater than the average value under some circumstances.  Manufacturers are cautioned to verify the appropriate peak to 
average ratio for their test setup 
Method of Measurement for the Second and Third Adjacent Channel 
 
Equipment Required Transmission Generator (PC with suitable software) Attenuator (30 dB/30 W) VHF Bandpass Filters (each with a 3 dB bandwidth of 25 kHz and attenuation in excess 
of 50 dB at Â±50 kHz) each with a center frequency at one of the 2nd or 3rd 
adjacent channels of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4) 
Spectrum Analyzer (with power band marker function) 
Procedure 
 
Caution:  To protect the analyzer, ensure that the transmitter is not keyed "on" at the 
frequency of the bandpass filter used for this test. 
 
Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-17 using a VHF bandpass filter 
with a center frequency that is 50 kHz above one of the test frequencies 
(Section 2.4.4). Step 2 
Tune the transmitter to the test frequency in Step 1. Step 3 
Start the transmission generator that produces test payload in burst form, and 
key the transmitter under test "on". Step 4 
Set the analyzer span to 50 kHz, and tune the analyzer to the center frequency 
of the VHF bandpass filter.  Decrease the analyzer input attenuator to the minimum level at which the attenuated RF signal from the transmitter under test does not overload the analyzer.  Use the analyzer IF signal as the trigger source for the display and set averaging to 10.   
 
Step 5 
Set the analyzer's power band marker function to 40 kHz and determine the 
second upper adjacent channel power.  Notice that the measurement bandwidth is defined by the VHF bandpass filter, so setting the power band marker to the same bandwidth will give erroneous results. Step 6 
Repeat Steps 1 to 5, except replace the VHF bandpass filter with one whose 
center frequency is 50 kHz below the test frequency, to determine the lower 
second adjacent channel power. Step 7 
Verify compliance of the upper and lower adjacent channel power with the 
second adjacent channel power requirement. Step 8 
Repeat Steps 1 to 6, except replace the VHF bandpass filter with one that has a 
center frequency that is 75 kHz above the test frequency to determine the upper 
3rd adjacent channel power. Step 9 
Repeat Steps 1 to 6, except replace the VHF bandpass filter with one that has a 
center frequency that is 75 kHz below the test frequency, to determine the 
lower 3rd adjacent channel power. Step 10 
Verify compliance of the upper and lower adjacent channel power with the 
third adjacent channel power requirement. Step 11 
Repeat Steps 1 through 10 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 12 
Repeat Steps 1 through 11 with the spectrum analyzer set to peak hold and 
verify that the adjacent channel power measurements satisfy the 
requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.7 when compensating for the increased 
power measurement due to peak measurement versus average measurement. (See Note 1 under the first adjacent channel power measurement.)

of 50 dB at Â±50 kHz), each with a center frequency at one of the 4th adjacent 
channels of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4) 
Spectrum Analyzer (with power band marker function) 
Procedure Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-17 using a VHF bandpass filter 
with a center frequency that is 100 kHz above one of the test frequencies 
(Section 2.4.4). Step 2 
Tune the transmitter to the test frequency in Step 1. Step 3 
Start the transmission generator that produces test payload in burst form, and 
key the transmitter under test "on". Step 4 
Set the analyzer span to 50 kHz and tune the analyzer to the center frequency 
of the VHF bandpass filter.  Decrease the analyzer input attenuator to the minimum level at which the attenuated RF signal from the transmitter under 
test does not overload the analyzer.  Use the analyzer IF signal as the trigger source for the display and set averaging to 10. Step 5 
Set the analyzer's power band marker function to 40 kHz and determine the 
fourth upper adjacent channel power.  Notice that the measurement bandwidth is defined by the VHF bandpass filter; setting the power band marker to the same bandwidth will give erroneous results. Step 6 
Repeat Steps 1 to 5, except replace the VHF bandpass filter with one whose 
center frequency is 100 kHz below the test frequency, to determine the fourth lower adjacent channel power. Step 7 
Verify compliance of the measured upper and lower fourth adjacent channel 
power with the fourth adjacent channel power requirement (Section 2.2.1.3.7). Step 8 
Repeat Steps 1 to 7 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 9 
Repeat Steps 1 through 8 with the spectrum analyzer set to peak hold and 
verify that the adjacent channel measurements satisfy the requirements of 
Section 2.2.1.3.7 when compensating for the increased power 
measurement due to peak measurement versus average measurement. (See Note 1 under the first adjacent channel power measurement.) 
Alternative Measurement Procedure for Adjacent Channel Power 
 
Equipment Required Transmission Generator (PC with suitable software) Attenuator (30 dB/30 W) Notch Filters at the test frequencies (capable of suppressing the on-channel signal by at 
least 60 dB) 
Spectrum Analyzer (with power band marker function) 
 
Procedure Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-18. Step 2 
Tune the transmitter to one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 3 
Start the transmission generator that produces test payload in burst form, and 
key the transmitter under test "on". Step 4 
Use an attenuator to protect the measurement equipment and a notch filter 
centered on the carrier frequency, if the dynamic range of the spectrum analyzer is not sufficient.  Set the spectrum analyzer resolution bandwidth (Br) 
much narrower than the channel bandwidth and the video bandwidth (Bv) equal to ten times Br in order to avoid errors due to video averaging of noise. Step 5 
Measure and store the RF signal spectrum centered on the carrier frequency 
with a frequency span wide enough to display the entire modulation spectrum between the -80 dB points, referred to the peak value. Step 6 
Convert the logarithmic trace values from the spectrum analyzer to linear 
spectral power densities by the relation: 
 
$$P_{i}=\frac{10^{\frac{P_{i}dBm}{10}}}{B_{n}}$$

where: P${}_{\text{atm}}$ = Trace values (dBm)

B${}_{\text{n}}$ = Effective noise bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer (Hz)

P${}_{i}$ = Spectral power densities (mW/Hz)

_Note:_ B${}_{\text{n}}$ = k * Br, _where_ k _is a constant specified for each spectrum analyzer.

--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

* [10] Perform integration of the linear spectral power densities. For computation of the linear spectral power values in the first, second, third, and fourth adjacent channels, use the formula: $$P_{ch}=B_{ch}\times\frac{1}{N}\times\sum_{i=1}^{N}P_{i}$$
 where:  
Pch  =  power in the considered channel Bch = bandwidth of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th adjacent channel, within which adjacent channel power is defined (16 kHz and 25 kHz bandwidths for the 1st adjacent channels, 25 kHz for the 2nd, 
3rd, and 4th adjacent channels) 
N    =  Number of power samples within the limits of the considered    
channel (assigned bandwidth Bch ) 
 
Step 8 
Perform the adjacent channel power measurement for the first, second, third, and fourth adjacent channels on both sides of the carrier frequency (lower and upper adjacent channels). Step 9 
Verify that the adjacent channel power levels on either side of the carrier for the first, second, third, and fourth adjacent channels are lower than the respective adjacent channel power requirements. Step 10  Repeat Steps 2 to 9 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 11 
Repeat Steps 2 through 10 with the spectrum analyzer set to peak hold and verify that the adjacent channel power measurements satisfy the requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.7 when compensating for the increased power measurement due to peak measurement versus average measurement. (See Note 1 under the first adjacent channel power measurement.) 
Method of Measurement Beyond the Fourth Adjacent Channel Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-18. 

 

 Step 2 
Use a notch filter centered at one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4) to 
attenuate the on-channel signal in order to increase the dynamic range of the measurement without overloading the spectrum analyzer.  Measure the frequency response of the filter and take this into account when presenting noise measurement results. Step 3 
Use the transmission generator and key the transmitter under test with 
repetitive test payload in burst form. 
 
--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Step 4 
Tune the transmitter to the test frequency selected in Step 2. Step 5 
Adjust the spectrum analyzer reference level to provide the maximum dynamic 
range for display and set the input attenuator to minimum.  Ensure that no signal at the analyzer input exceeds the maximum allowable level. Step 6 
Record the adjacent channel power level measured in each 25 kHz channel 
bandwidth in the 4th adjacent channel through the 32nd adjacent channel using 
the power band marker function of the analyzer. Step 7 
Plot each measured adjacent channel power in dBm versus its adjacent channel 
number in linear/linear scale.  Also plot the maximum level spectrum mask on the same graph by interconnecting the points (4, -38 dBm) and (32, -53 dBm) with a straight line. 
 
Note 2: The two points (4, -38 dBm) and (32, -53 dBm) in Step 7 define the 5 
dB per octave slope that limits the adjacent channel power between the 
4th and 32nd *adjacent channels as defined in Section 2.2.1.3.7.* Step 8 
Verify that the measured adjacent channel power levels between the 4th and 
32nd adjacent channels are below the maximum level spectrum mask plotted in 
Step 7. Step 9 
Mark on the spectrum analyzer the spectrum level at the 32nd adjacent channel 
corresponding to a power level of â53 dBm in a 25 kHz band. Step 10 
Observe the power spectrum on the spectrum analyzer display to verify that the 
RF spectrum beyond the 32nd adjacent channel is no more than the level 
established in Step 9 above. Step 11 
Repeat Steps 2 to 10 for the other test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 12 
Repeat Steps 2 through 11 with the spectrum analyzer set to peak hold and 
verify that the adjacent channel power measurements satisfy the requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.7 when compensating for the increased power measurement 
due to peak measurement versus average measurement. (See Note 1 under the 
first adjacent channel power measurement.)

Receive to Transmit Turnaround Time (Section 2.2.1.1.4) 
 
Equipment Required VDL Mode 3 Test Set (Section 2.4.3) 
Procedure Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Standard Test Configurations 1, 2, or 3 
shown in Figure 2-7, 2-8, or 2-9, as appropriate for the class of equipment 
under test, and configure the Test Set with GS1 in GSE and AC1 in ASE active. Step 2 
Configure GS1 in system configuration 2V2D with squelch window setting of 
6. Step 3 
Initialize the EUT and AC1 with the designated channel identifier for Net ID A 
and place the EUT in BER mode. Step 4 
Verify completion of net entry by the EUT and AC1. Step 5 
Activate the PTT of the EUT to initiate voice transmission. 
 
Step 6 
Command GS1 to poll AC1 in successive MAC cycles to force AC1 to 
transmit poll response in each of the successive MAC cycles.  Set the ground radio polling reply counter, NL2, to 255.  Set the EUT TL4 timer to 300, the maximum value (300 = 72 seconds), so that it does not time-out its connection due to loss of polling. Step 7 
To simulate the minimum spacing between an uplink beacon message and 
transmissions from an aircraft radio whose timing error is -1 symbol period, introduce an offset of +17 symbol periods in the timing of the Poll Response transmitted by AC1. 
 
Note: 
For EUT not intended to support discrete addressing the offset may be 
increased to 33 symbol periods. Step 8 
Verify at the EUT that no bit errors are received from the AC1 transmitted poll 
response M burst to determine whether or not the EUT received all of the 
D8PSK symbols appropriate for that message burst.  Verify at GS1 that the voice transmission from the EUT is received within 1 D8PSK symbol of its scheduled time and that the header and V/D (voice) bursts contain 8 and 192 D8PSK symbols respectively. Step 9 
Repeat Steps 2 to 8 for system configuration 2V1D.

under test, and configure the Test Set with GS1 and AC1 active. Step 2 
Configure GS1 in system configuration 2V2D. Step 3 
Initialize the EUT and AC1 with the designated channel identifier for Net A. Step 4 
Verify completion of net entry by the EUT and AC1. Step 5 
Command GS1 to poll the EUT in successive MAC cycles to force the EUT to 
transmit poll response in each of the successive MAC cycles. Step 6 
Activate the PTT of AC1 and initiate voice transmission. Step 7 
Introduce a timing offset in AC1 which is offset from its nominal TRP by -2 
symbol periods to simulate the maximum timing error between two aircraft radios. 
 
Step 8 
Verify at the EUT that the voice transmission by AC1 is received with no loss 
of voice frames and the poll response M bursts of the EUT occur with less than 
or equal to 1 D8PSK symbol offset. Step 9 
Repeat Steps 2 to 8 for system configuration 2V1D.

Note: 
The manufacturer may submit written evidence to demonstrate compliance with this requirement.  The 100 ms applies to tuning in Basic Voice mode (no discreteaddressed services), as the wait to send the Leaving Net message would otherwise prevent the compliance with 100ms to tune to the new channel.

Test for Protocols above Physical Layer For testing avionics EUT for compliance with the requirements for protocol layers above 
the Physical layer and system level performance requirements, the VDL Mode 3 Test Set 
defined in Section 2.4.3 is used.  Three standard test configurations are defined in Figures 
2-7, 2-8, and 2-9, respectively, to facilitate testing the appropriate classes of equipment 
defined.   The Test Set should be configured with specific ground stations, aircraft 
stations, and system configurations to support specific tests and will be specified separately for each test. Unless otherwise stated: a. There is no external noise nor interference injected. b. All system parameters will be set at the default values. c. The subnetwork interface is set for the Raw Interface as defined in the Network 
Initialization Exchange Identifier (XID) parameter and in the payload identification 
octet of the VDL Mode 3 MASPS in RTCA DO-224B, Section 3.3.2.3.3.3.4.1.3, 
except for specific ISO 8208 and CLNP subnetwork layer tests. d. Injection of errors into the data messages implies that sufficient errors are introduced 
to exceed the error correction capability of the system.  
 
2.4.5.1  
Test Set Configuration The Test Set is configured to emulate specific operational scenarios required for verification of the functions and performance of the avionics EUT in accordance with a 
set of test procedures associated with a given test case.  The configuration of the Test Set required to support each test is described in a configuration table at the beginning of each test prior to the presentation of the detailed test procedures. The Test Set configuration table is oriented to user groups and provides information on the Net ID, ground station 
emulator, channel frequency, system configuration, aircraft station, squelch window 
--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

In Table 2-4, the Test Set is configured with two VDL Mode 3 nets designated as Net IDs A and B.  GS1 initially operates at channel frequency f1, in Net A of system configuration 
2V2D, with the EUT as the aircraft station, with the squelch window parameter set to 2, and requires voice and data transmission support from the Message Generator/Processor.  
Net B is configured similarly except that GS2 is the ground station, frequency is f2, system configuration is initially 2V1D, and AC1 is the aircraft station in the Net.  In Table 2-4, note that two system configurations are shown, in reverse order, for each net. 

For Net A on f1, 2V2D and 2V1D are designated as configurations 1 and 2 for GS1; and for Net B on f2, 2V1D and 2V2D are designated as configurations 1 and 2 for GS2.  This means that the test will be initially run with the first system configuration for each ground station, i.e., 2V2D for GS1 and 2V1D for GS2.  The test will then be repeated for the second system configurations identified, i.e., 2V1D for GS1 and 2V2D for GS2.  Note that the test procedures are written for the first set of system configurations.  Depending upon the tests, some adaptation of the test procedures may be required for the second set of system configurations. 

2.4.5.2  
Test Case Definition and Organization Test cases are defined based on the functionality of the VDL Mode 3 radio that the test is intended to verify.  Functionally related test cases are grouped into separate test groups.  
An identification scheme is used to uniquely identify each test case with its associated test group.  The identification consists of a numeric field for the test group followed by a 
"-" and a second numeric field for the test within the test group.  For example, Test Case 
2-3 designates test 3 in test group 2.  This nomenclature for the test group and test case does not apply to the Physical layer and environmental tests.  Table 2-5 defines the 13 
test groups for the MOPS testing.  Table B-1 provides the traceability between environmental tests and the applicable equipment classes.  Table B-2 provides the traceability for tests in the standard test conditions and the applicable equipment classes.

Procedure Step 1 
Configure GS1 for system configuration 4V with discrete addressing not 
supported and select the designated channel identifier of Net ID A for the EUT. Step 2 
Key the PTT of the EUT, and verify successful voice access by the EUT.  (This 
verifies that the EUT completes net initialization and transitions to TS1 timing state without prior ground station code information of GS1.) Step 3 
Verify with the Test Set that the EUT transmits Dummy Poll Responses 
autonomously and randomly once every 25 MAC cycles (6 seconds) in the downlink M slots normally reserved for poll responses (LBAC 1). Step 4 
Suppress uplink beacon transmissions for slots B, C and, if applicable, D.  
Vary the squelch window setting in the uplink M bursts for slot A so no two 
consecutive uplink M bursts have the same squelch window field.  Re-initialize 
the EUT and verify that the EUT does not complete net initialization and remains in TS0 timing state. Step 5 
Stop varying the squelch window parameter and verify that the EUT completes 
net initialization and transitions to TS1 timing state. Step 6 
Repeat Steps 1-2, except that GS1 is configured to support discrete addressing. 
 
Step 7 
Verify with the Test Set that the EUT does not transmit Dummy Poll 
Responses. Step 8 
Repeat Steps 1 through 7 with GS1 in system configuration 3V. Step 9 
Reconfigure GS1 for system configuration 2V2D and select the designated 
channel identifier to slot C (data slot) for the EUT. Step 10 
Wait for 15 seconds or longer and verify that the EUT remains in TS0 timing 
state. Step 11 
Repeat Step 10 with GS1 in system configuration 2V1D and select the 
designated channel identifier of slot C (data slot) for the EUT. 
 
Step 12 
Select the designated channel identifier of slot D (Invalid Channel Suffix) for 
the EUT. Step 13 
Wait for 15 seconds or longer and verify that the EUT remains in TS0 timing 
state.

Procedure 
 
Step 1 
Configure GS1 for system configuration 2V2D and select the designated 
channel identifier of Net ID A for the EUT. Step 2 
Command GS1 to ignore Net Entry requests. Step 3 
Wait for 820 ms and verify completion of Net Initialization by activating the 
PTT of the EUT and verify voice access by the EUT. Step 4 
Verify at GS1 that the EUT initiates Net Entry procedures automatically after 
Net Initialization with Net Entry request transmission. 
 
Step 5 
Repeat Steps 1 and 2, but command GS1 to respond to Net Entry requests. Step 6 
Reinitialize the EUT and verify that after completion of net initialization and 
timing state transition from TS0 to TS1, the EUT automatically starts net entry procedures.  Monitor the timing of the bursts with the Test Set for the following message exchanges between the EUT and GS1: 
 
a. Verify Net Entry Request message in the downlink M burst b. Observe Net Entry Response (no previous link) message in the uplink M 
burst 
c. Verify Poll Response message in the downlink M burst in the next MAC 
cycle following the Net Entry Response message 
d. Observe Supported Options message in the uplink M burst in the following 
MAC cycle 
 
Note:  The initial Poll Response may or may not include a Reservation 
Request for XID frame transmission.  Supported Option message may include a Reservation Response or a RACK if a Reservation Request is included in the initial Poll Response.  Since there are no other activities going on in the net during the test, a Reservation 
Request will be granted a Reservation Response. e. Verify CTRL_CMD_LE in the downlink V/D (data) channel 
Note:  If the initial Poll Response is used to request for XID frame 
transmission, the CTRL_CMD_LE frame transmission will occur in the next MAC cycle.  If the initial Poll Response is not used to request data slot for XID, Reservation Request will use random access M bursts, resulting in delay in transmission of CTRL_CMD_LE. 
 
f. 
Observe CTRL_RSP_LE in the uplink V/D (data) channel 
 
Step 7 
Verify completion of link establishment by demonstrating successful voice and 
data accesses by the EUT. 
 
Step 8 
Verify that the EUT responds to a poll request from GS1 with a Poll Response 
message using LBAC 1 in the MAC cycle immediately following the poll. Step 9 
Monitor at GS1 the format of the received Net Entry Request, Poll Response, 
and CTRL_CMD_LE and verify compliance with the respective message format and the M downlink burst training sequence requirements. Step 10 
Repeat the test for system configuration 2V1D.

Reset the PTT and reactivate the PTT of the EUT and verify that the EUT gains 
access to the voice channel. Step 11 
Release the PTT of the EUT and activate AC1's PTT to access the voice 
channel. Step 12 
Activate the PTT of the EUT and verify that the EUT cannot pre-empt AC1's 
voice access. Step 13 
Continue to hold the PTT of the EUT while releasing AC1's PTT and verify 
that the EUT does not gain access to the voice channel. 
 
Step 14 
Reset and reactivate the PTT of the EUT and verify that the EUT gains access 
to the voice channel. Step 15 
Activate the PTT of AC1 and verify that AC1 does not preempt EUT's voice 
access.  Release EUT's PTT. Step 16 
Activate and do not release EUT's PTT.  Activate GS1's PTT while the ground 
preemption feature is deactivated.  Verify that GS1 does not preempt EUT's voice access.  Release EUT's PTT. Step 17 
Activate and do not release EUT's PTT.  Retune EUT to a new channel 
different from GS1.  Verify that the EUT's voice transmission ceases on the old channel within 2 MAC cycles (480 ms) after the retuning command and that the EUT does not transmit on the new channel.  
 
Step 18 
Release and reactivate EUT's PTT before EUT transitions to TS3.  Verify that 
the EUT does not transmit. Step 19 
With EUT's PTT still activated, tune EUT back to f1/Net A and verify that the 
EUT does not transmit after radio retunes to f1/Net A for as long as the PTT is 
asserted.  For those EUT supporting the optional handoff requirement (RTCA DO-224B, 3.3.5.4.5), verify that the audio terminates upon the radio receipt of the tuning command. Step 20 
Release and reactivate EUT's PTT.  Verify the EUT does transmit. Step 21 
Retune EUT to f1/Net C and verify the EUT does not transition out of TS0 by 
activating the EUT's PTT and verifying there is no transmission. Step 22 
Retune EUT to f1/Net D and verify the EUT does not transition out of TS0 by

first V/D (voice) burst at RF. Step 4 
Add the time occupied by the synchronization sequence, voice header, and 
vocoder silence frame(s) (2.29 + 3.05*n ms, where n is the number of vocoder silence frames) from the measurement. Step 5 
Repeat Steps 1-4 25 times by activating the PTT in random. Step 6 
Verify that each measured time is less than 175 ms.   
 
Note: 
GS1 must be able to recognise silence frames from the EUT vocoder, 
or there will be a 15.25 ms uncertainty in the measurements. Step 7 
Repeat Steps 2 and 3, but measure the time from the beginning of the 1 kHz 
tone input to the EUT to the beginning of the corresponding 1 kHz tone received at the voice output of GS1. 
 
Step 8 
Repeat Step 7 25 times by activating the PTT in random. Step 9 
Verify that each measured time is less than 236 ms. Step 10 
Command GS1 to generate a vocoded 1 kHz continuous tone that originates at 
the start of the first vocoder frame in the slot transmission. Step 11 
Measure at the EUT the time elapsed from the beginning of the first received 
RF burst at the RF interface to the beginning of the reconstructed 1 kHz tone output at the audio interface. Step 12 
Repeat the measurements 25 times by activating the PTT in random. Step 13 
Verify that each measured time is less than 40 ms.  
 
Step 14 
Repeat Steps 10-12, but activate the GS1 PTT and apply a 1 kHz continuous 
tone to the microphone input and measure the time from the beginning of the 1 kHz tone input to GS1 to the beginning of the corresponding 1 kHz tone received at the EUT voice output.

Measure at both EUTs the time elapsed from the beginning of the first received 
RF burst at the RF interface to the beginning of the reconstructed 1 kHz tone output at the audio interface. Step 4 
Repeat the measurements 25 times by activating the PTT in random. Step 5 
Verify that each measured time is less than 40 ms. Step 6 
Activate the PTT of the EUT and apply a 1 kHz continuous tone to the 
microphone input. Step 7 
Measure the time from the beginning of the 1 kHz tone input to the EUT to the 
beginning of the corresponding 1 kHz tone received at the voice output of GS1. Step 8 
Repeat Step 7 25 times by activating the PTT in random. Step 9 
Verify that each measured time is less than 236 ms. Step 10 
Repeat Steps 6-8, but measure the time from the beginning of the 1 kHz tone 
input to the EUT#1 to the beginning of the corresponding 1 kHz tone received at the voice output of EUT#2. Step 11

Verify that each measured time is less than 175 ms. Step 13 
Repeat Steps 6-8, but activate the GS1 PTT and apply a 1 kHz continuous tone 
to the microphone input and measure the time from the beginning of the 1 kHz tone input to GS1 to the beginning of the corresponding 1 kHz tone received at the EUT voice output. Step 14 
Verify that each measured time is less than 236 ms.  
 
Step 15 
Repeat the test procedure with GS1 in system configuration 2V1D.

Procedure Step 1 
Configure GS1 for system configuration 2V2D and select the designated 
channel identifier of Net ID A for the EUT. 
 
Step 2 
Activate the PTT of GS1, while adjusting the burst timing of each voice burst 
such that each burst is offset from the nominal time of burst by +1/2 symbol period followed by an offset of -1/2 symbol period alternately. Step 3 
Verify that the voice output at the EUT is without audible dropouts. Step 4 
Deactivate the PTT of GS1 and remove the GS1 voice burst timing offsets of 
Â±1/2 symbol period introduced in Step 2. Step 5 
Activate the PTT of GS1, while varying the ground station timing continuously 
such that the ground station timing advances by Â¼-symbol period every TDMA 
frame for a period that corresponds to the maximum PTT event of 35 seconds. Step 6 
Verify that the voice output at the EUT is without audible dropouts. Step 7 
Deactivate the PTT of GS1 and return GS1 normal. Step 8 
Activate the PTT of GS1 for 5 seconds with voice bursts, then drop the next 16 
voice bursts, followed by resumption of voice bursts, while maintaining voice 
signal field encoding of 01b in the uplink M bursts throughout the ground PTT 
event. Step 9 
Verify that there is a 1.5 to 2.5 second silence (or pseudo-noise) in the voice 
output at the EUT, approximately 5 seconds after the activation of the PTT. Step 10 
Verify also that there is no perceptible pops or clicks in the transition to and out 
of silence. Step 11 
Repeat the test for system configuration 2V1D. 
2.4.5.5  
Test Group 3  --  Voice Operation - Special Timing Conditions 
 
Objective To test for compliance with the RTCA DO-224B requirements associated with voice operations under special timing conditions.

Procedure  
 
Step 1 
Configure GS1 for system configuration 2V2D and select the designated 
channel identifier of Net ID A for the EUT. Step 2 
Verify completion of net initialization by demonstrating successful voice 
access. Step 3 
Activate the PTT of the EUT for voice transmission. Step 4 
Verify with the Test Set that all V/D (voice) bursts occur in LBACs 2 and 6 in 
time slot A. Step 5 
Measure the time offset between the GS1 Timing Reference and the V/D 
(voice) bursts in LBAC 6. Step 6 
Verify that the measured offset is 65Â±1 symbol periods. Step 7 
Introduce a timing offset of up to 1 ms in the GS1 reference time. Step 8 
Measure the time offset at GS1 between the ground timing reference and the 
LBAC 6 transmission from the EUT. Step 9 
Verify that the timing offset between the ground reference and LBAC 6 
remains at 65Â±1 symbol periods.   
 
Note: 
This demonstrates that the ground station timing offset has been incorporated by the EUT to update its timing reference in determining 
its downlink burst timing. Step 10 
Repeat the test for system configuration 2V1D.  The expected offsets in steps 6 
and 9 for system configuration 2V1D should be 118Â±1 symbol periods. 
 
2.4.5.5.2 
Test 3-2  --  Aircraft Validity Window Test 
 
Objective a. Verify that the EUT does not use the current beacon for timing update if the current 
beacon is offset outside the range of âK(n+1)+1 to +1 symbol periods from the previous beacon. (K=4 for 4-slot configurations and 8 for 3-slot configurations, n = 
squelch window parameter) b. Verify that the EUT opens up the validity window to accept all timing updates when 
CTC1 exceeds 24.

Procedure Step 1 
Configure GS1 for system configuration 2V2D and select the designated 
channel identifier of Net ID A for the EUT. Step 2 
Wait for the EUT to transition to TS1 timing state. Step 3 
Introduce an offset to the ground station timing such that the beacons are 
transmitted with the beacon timing advanced from the initial beacon timing by approximately 5 symbol periods. Step 4 
Monitor the timing of the received poll responses from the EUT at GS1 for 
approximately 30 seconds. Step 5 
Verify that the received poll response timing tracks the GS1 timing by 
observing that the ground station timing offset introduced in Step 3 is accepted for timing update by the EUT. Step 6 
Introduce an additional timing offset of 9 symbol periods to the GS1 system 
timing. Step 7 
Repetitively key the PTT on the EUT for about 10 seconds. Step 8 
Monitor the timing of the received RF V/D (voice) bursts from the EUT at GS1 
for approximately 10 seconds. Step 9 
Verify that the received voice burst timing remains offset by approximately 9 
symbol periods from the GS1 timing and a single 9-symbol period timing adjustment to the voice burst occurs after about 6 seconds.  (This verifies that beacon timing offsets greater than the validity windows are ignored by the aircraft radio for about 25 MAC cycles and the aircraft radio validity window is changed to "wide open" after about 25 MAC cycles to accept the next beacon 
for its timing update.)   
 
Step 10 
Retard the timing of the beacons by 3 symbol periods. Step 11 
Repeat steps 7-9 and verify that the EUT does not accept timing updates for 
approximately the first 25 MAC cycles and accepts the ground timing update 
introduced in Step 10 after approximately 25 MAC cycles. Step 12 
Repeat the test for system configuration 2V1D.  The offsets in Step 6 and 9 
should use 18 symbols instead of 9 symbols due to the larger validity window of the 3-slot system configurations. 
 
2.4.5.5.3 
Test 3-3  --  Receipt/Process of Beacon Information From a Distant Station 
 
Objective   
 
Verify that the EUT uses the information field in a beacon with valid Slot ID and Ground 
Station Code even though the timing of the beacon is outside the validity window.

Procedure Step 1 
Configure GS1 for system configuration 2V2D and select the designated 
channel identifier of Net ID A for the EUT. Step 2 
Configure GS2 with the same system configuration, Slot ID, and GSC as GS1, 
but retard the timing of GS2 from that of GS1 by 5 symbol periods and maintain this offset throughout the test.  Command GS2 not to transmit beacons. Step 3 
Wait for the EUT to complete net initialization. Step 4 
Activate the PTT of the EUT to initiate downlink voice transmission. Step 5 
Command GS1 to stop transmitting beacons and poll requests after the EUT 
has seized the voice channel. 
 
Note: 
Steps 6-11 should be performed within 6 seconds of Step 4. Step 6 
Activate the PTT of GS2 to initiate uplink voice transmission with voice 
preemption. Step 7 
Command GS2 to transmit beacons and poll requests. 
 
Step 8 
Verify that EUT's downlink transmission is preempted. (This verifies that the 
voice field of GS2's beacon transmission was processed and was used by the EUT to terminate the downlink voice transmission.) Step 9 
Deactivate the PTT of GS2. Step 10 
Activate the PTT of the EUT to initiate downlink voice transmission. 
 
Note:  Due to the timing offset of GS2, it will not likely change the voice 
signalling field to indicate the channel is 'Occupied'; hence, the aircraft radio will cease transmitting after only a few bursts.  This should still be sufficient for Step 11. Step 11 
Verify at GS2 that the timing of the downlink voice header is 5 symbols (Â± 1 
symbol) advanced relative to the GS2 timing. (This verifies that the EUT does 
not accept the timing updates from GS2, but decodes and processes the beacon 
information.) Step 12 
Repeat the test for system configuration 2V1D.

f. Verify air-to-air voice communications in TS2 and TS3 timing states. Verify that an aircraft radio in TS1 timing state cannot transmit voice bursts in a voice 
channel already occupied by another aircraft radio in TS2 timing state, unless its optional TX inhibit for voice due to a cleared CTS indication was disabled. 
 
Verify that an aircraft radio in TS2 timing state cannot transmit voice bursts in a voice 
channel already occupied by another aircraft radio in TS2 timing state, unless its optional TX inhibit for voice due to a cleared CTS indication was disabled. 
 
Verify that an aircraft radio in TS3 timing state cannot transmit voice bursts in a voice 
channel already occupied by another aircraft radio in TS3 timing state, unless its optional TX inhibit for voice due to a cleared CTS indication was disabled. 
 
Verify that the aircraft radio's slot timing drifts at a rate no greater than Â±5ppm with 
respect to UTC, while the radio is in TS3 timing state.

Procedure  
 
Subtest 1: TS2 Transition and Truncated Voice Operation Step 1 
Configure GS1 for system configuration 2V2D Net ID A and select the 
designated channel identifier of Net ID A for the EUT and AC1.  Configure GS2 for system configuration 2V2D Net ID B and select the designated 
channel identifier of Net ID B for AC2. Step 2 
Wait for the EUT and AC1 to complete link establishment procedures. Step 3 
Sever the link from GS1 to the EUT to emulate loss of ground station beacon at 
the EUT.  Note that the link between GS1 and AC1 and the link between AC1 and the EUT remain connected. 
 
Note 1: 
Severing one RF link between two stations without affecting all other 
RF connections in the net can be accomplished by inserting appropriate RF attenuation between the RF ports of the stations, whose connections are to be severed, and the RF Bridge.  The following is an example of setting the attenuators.  The tester should adjust the attenuators based on the RF output of the transmitters involved.   
 
Example: With an RF output of 15W (42 dBm) a total attenuation of 160 dB will reduce the signal level to â118 dBm, which is 18 dB below the receiver threshold and will have an equivalent effect of a broken RF connection.  A pad of 50 dB is placed in each RF path to prevent overloading the receiver.  To sever the link between GS1 and 
the EUT without affecting all other links, a 30-dB attenuator is inserted between GS1 and the RF Bridge and the same attenuation is 
placed between the EUT and the RF Bridge.  Signals between GS1 and the EUT are attenuated by a total of 160 dB to about â18 dB below receiver threshold to emulate a broken RF link.  Signal for all other RF links are attenuated by 130 dB to about â88 dBm, which is 12 dB above receiver threshold to ensure nearly error-free 
reception. Step 4 
Immediately after the uplink from GS1 to the EUT is severed, activate the PTT 
of the EUT for approximately 1 second and release for approximately 1 second repetitively to initiate voice access for direct air-to-air communications with AC1.   
 
Step 5 
At the Test Set, monitor the Message ID field of the EUT voice bursts for 60 
consecutive MAC cycles. Step 6 
Verify that transition from TS1 voice to TS2 voice occurs.  Specifically, verify 
that TS1 voice continues during the coasting period and that transition to TS2 
voice occurs approximately 50 MAC cycles after loss of Beacon.  Also verify direct air-to-air voice communications with AC1 during the coasting period, during transition to TS2, and after transition to TS2. Step 7 
Repeat Steps 4-5, but key the PTT continuously for 60 MAC cycles and 
observe the message ID field of the voice bursts that the EUT stays in TS1. Step 8 
Release the PTT and reactivate the PTT and verify that the EUT has 
transitioned to TS2.  (This verifies that transition to TS2 is delayed until the 
PTT is released.) 
 
Step 9 
Verify that there is no discontinuity in speech or breakup in voice prior to 
transition, during transition, and after transition to TS2. Step 10 
Measure the truncated voice bursts of the EUT, and verify that the duration of 
each burst is about 85% of a normal full voice burst and the bursts are all confined in slot A. Step 11 
Advance or retard the V/D (voice) bursts of AC1 relative to the GS1 timing to 
verify the actual squelch window setting of the EUT in TS2 is in compliance 
with RTCA DO-224B. Step 12 
Verify that the EUT stays in TS2 indefinitely as long as AC1 is connected to 
GS1 and the EUT and that the link between GS1 and the EUT remains severed.   
 
 
Subtest 2: TS2 Unblocking Own RF Transmission over another TS1 Voice Access 
[OPTIONAL] Step 13 
Activate the PTT of AC1 (in TS1) to access the voice channel. 
 
Step 14 
Activate the PTT of the EUT (in TS2) with TX inhibit for voice disabled. Step 15 
Verify that the EUT cannot unblock its TX inhibit for voice when the voice 
channel is occupied by another aircraft radio in TS1 timing state by observing that no RF transmissions of voice bursts are emanating from the EUT. 
Subtest 3: TS1 Unblocking Own RF Transmission over another TS2 Voice Access 
[OPTIONAL] Step 16 
Clear the PTTs of both the EUT and AC1. Step 17 
Repeat Steps 1-11, but interchange the roles of AC1 and the EUT. Step 18 
Activate the PTT of AC1 (in TS2) to access the voice channel. 
 
Step 19 
Activate the PTT of the EUT (in TS1) with TX inhibit for voice disabled. Step 20 
Verify that the EUT (in TS1), with TX inhibit for voice disabled, can gain 
access to the voice channel already occupied by another aircraft radio transmitting truncated voice by observing RF transmissions of voice bursts 
from both aircraft radios. Step 21 
Release and reactivate the PTT of the EUT with TX inhibit for voice enabled. Step 22 
Verify that the EUT (in TS1), with TX inhibit for voice enabled, cannot gain 
access to the voice channel already occupied by an aircraft radio transmitting 
truncated voice by observing that AC1 continues to have sole access to the voice channel. 
Subtest 4: Air-to-Air Communications between TS2 Users Step 23 
While AC1 is in timing state TS2, sever the link from GS1 to the EUT to force 
the EUT to transition to TS2.  
 
Note 2: 
The sole purpose of GS2 is to provide Alternate Timing Signals to keep the EUT and AC1 in TS2 timing state indefinitely. Step 24 
While both the EUT and AC1 are in TS2, verify direct air-to-air 
communications between the two aircraft. 
Subtest 5: TS2 Unblocking Own RF Transmission over another TS2 Voice Access 
[OPTIONAL] Step 25 
Activate the PTT of AC1. Step 26 
Activate the PTT of the EUT with TX inhibit for voice disabled. Step 27 
Verify that the EUT (in TS2), with TX inhibit for voice disabled, can gain 
access to the voice channel already occupied by another aircraft radio also in TS2 timing state by observing RF transmissions of voice bursts from both aircraft radios. Step 28 
Reset the PTT of the EUT and reactivate the PTT of the EUT with TX inhibit 
for voice enabled. Step 29 
Verify that the EUT (in TS2), with TX inhibit for voice enabled, cannot gain 
access to the voice channel already occupied by another aircraft radio also in TS2 timing state by observing that AC1 continues to have sole access to the voice channel. Step 30 
Clear the PTTs of both the EUT and AC1. 
Subtest 6: TS3Transition and Air-to-air Communications between TS3 Users Step 31 
Command GS2 to stop transmitting beacons and verify that the EUT transitions 
from TS2 to TS3 in f (free running parameter) MAC cycles after the link termination.  (AC1 and AC2 should also transition to TS3.) Step 32 
While in TS3, initiate voice access at the EUT following the LBPTT protocol, 
and verify that air-to-air voice communications is supported in TS3. Step 33 
Verify at RF that the V/D (voice) bursts in TS3 are not truncated. Step 34 
Activate the PTT of AC1 for six (eight for 2V1D) times and initiate a short 
voice transmission each time such that the timing of the RF bursts associated with the current PTT event is offset from that of the previous PTT event by 5 ms.  Verify at the EUT that all voice transmissions are received.  
 
Step 35 
Sever the link between AC1 and AC2 while maintain the links between AC1 
and the EUT and between AC2 and the EUT.  (See Note 1.) Step 36 
Activate AC2's PTT and initiate voice transmission for 15 seconds.  Activate 
AC1's PTT for 30 seconds.  Adjust the burst timing of AC1 and AC2, if necessary, such that the RF bursts of AC1 and AC2 are not overlapping. Observe at GS2 that the RF bursts from both AC1 and AC2 are present for the respective duration of the PTTs and verify at the EUT that the voice received is the juxtaposition of the entire 15 seconds from AC2 followed by the last 15 seconds from AC1. Step 37 
Verify that the EUT remains in TS3. 
Subtest 7: Unblocking Own RF Transmission of one TS3 Radio over another TS3 
Voice Access [OPTIONAL] Step 38 
Activate the PTT of AC1. 
 
Step 39 
Activate the PTT of the EUT with TX inhibit for voice disabled. Step 40 
Verify that the EUT (in TS3), with TX inhibit for voice disabled, can gain 
access to the voice channel already occupied by another aircraft radio also in TS3 timing state by observing RF transmissions of voice bursts from both aircraft radios. Step 41 
Release and reactivate the PTT of the EUT with TX inhibit for voice enabled. Step 42 
Verify that the EUT (in TS3), with TX inhibit for voice enabled, cannot gain 
access to the voice channel already occupied by another aircraft radio also in TS3 timing state by observing that AC1 continues to have sole access to the voice channel. Step 43 
Clear the PTTs of both the EUT and AC1. 
Subtest 8: Transition from TS3 to TS2 and TS1 Upon Restoration of Ground          
Station Step 44 
Restore the link between GS1 and AC1 only. 
 
Step 45 
Observe that AC1 transitions from TS3 to TS1 and verify that the EUT 
transitions from TS3 to TS2. Step 46 
Restore the link from GS1 to the EUT and verify that the EUT transitions from 
TS2 to TS1. Step 47 
Repeat Step 44, but Restore the link between GS1 and the EUT only. Step 48 
Verify that the EUT transitions from TS3 to TS1. 
 
 
Subtest 9: Timing Accuracy in Timing State TS3 Step 49 
While EUT is in TS1 timing state, command GS1 to stop transmitting beacons. Step 50 
Wait 60 seconds to ensure that the EUT transitions to timing state TS3. Step 51 
Activate the PTT of the EUT to initiate voice transmission. Step 52 
Measure the relative timing of the V/D (voice) burst with respect to the GS1 
timing. Step 53 
Wait for another 60 seconds and Repeat Steps 51 and 52. Step 54 
Verify that the difference between the relative timing measured in Step 52 and 
Step 53 is within Â±3 symbol periods. 
 
Note 3: 
This verifies that the EUT's slot timing drifts with respect to UTC at 
a rate no greater than Â±5ppm. Step 55 
Repeat the test procedure with GS1 in system configuration 2V1D.

Procedure Step 1 
Configure GS1 for system configuration 2V2D and select the designated 
channel identifier of Net ID A for the EUT and AC1. Step 2 
Sever the link between GS1 and the EUT to emulate the condition that no GS1 
beacon is available at the EUT.  Ensure that AC1 remains connected to both GS1 and the EUT.  (See Note 1 of Section 2.4.5.5.4.) Step 3 
Reinitialize the EUT. Step 4 
Verify that the EUT completes net initialization and transitions from timing 
state TS0 to TS2 directly. Step 5 
Verify that the EUT is unable to have voice access prior to attaining TS2 
timing state.   
 
Note 1: 
Since it would take approximately 12 seconds to transition from TS0 to TS2, one way to verify Step 5 is to key the PTT repeatedly over the 
12 second period after reinitialization in Step 3 and verify that the PTTs result in no voice access. Step 6 
Sever the link between GS1 and AC1. Step 7 
Reinitialize the EUT and AC1. Step 8 
Verify that both the EUT and AC1 transition from timing state TS0 to TS3 
directly in about 12 seconds in an assumed voice-only mode.   
 
Note 2: 
One way to verify Step 8 is to key the PTT of the EUT repeatedly 
over the 12 seconds period after reinitialization in Step 7 and verify 
that the PTTs result in no voice access. Step 9 
Verify that the EUT is unable to have voice access prior to attaining TS3 
timing state. Step 10 
Repeat Step 1, but tune the EUT to the data slot of Net ID A, i.e., slot C. Step 11 
Wait for 65 seconds and verify that the EUT remains in timing state TS0 by 
demonstrating that PTT does not result in voice access. Step 12 
Repeat the test for system configuration 2V1D.

Objective a. Verify that the aircraft radio uses the downlink random access M burst channel for 
reservation request. b. Verify that the maximum number of random access reservation request 
retransmissions is NM1. c. Verify that the aircraft radio continues to send a data reservation request in poll 
responses after NM1 random access reservation request retransmissions. 
 
Procedure Step 1 
Configure GS1 for system configuration 2V2D and select the designated 
channel identifier of Net ID A for the EUT. Step 2 
Set the TL4 polling timeout parameter to 300 MAC cycles (72 seconds) in the 
EUT.   
 
Note: 
Test 4-3 must be completed within 72 seconds to ensure that the EUT TL4 timer does not time-out (and re-attempt net entry) due to lack of ground polling requests. Step 3 
Suppress GS1 from polling the EUT. Step 4 
Submit to GS1 for delivery to the EUT a series of priority 3 messages (3 = top 
priority encoded as binary 11 in the 2-bit priority field) to block the data channel temporarily. Step 5 
Submit a priority 2 (2-bit priority field encoded as 10) message of length 128 
octets (including DLS frame header) followed by a second priority 2 message 
of length 64 octets to the EUT for delivery to GS1. Step 6 
Verify at GS1 that a Reservation Request message associated with the 128-
octet priority 2 message is transmitted in the random access downlink M burst. Step 7 
Observe that a Reservation Request Acknowledgment (RACK) message is sent 
by GS1 to the EUT in an uplink M burst. Step 8 
Verify at GS1 that there is no Reservation Request retransmission from the 
EUT. Step 9 
Stop sending uplink messages to GS1 to unblock the data channel.  
 
Step 10 
Verify that a Reservation Response message is transmitted from GS1 to the 
EUT to grant the data channel access for the outstanding request and that data transmission by the EUT starts in the next MAC cycle in slot C after receiving the Reservation Response message. Step 11 
Verify that transmission of a Reservation Request message associated with the 
second priority 2 message is not initiated until the data transmission for the previous message is completed and the corresponding uplink ACK message has been received at the EUT. Step 12 
Repeat Steps 1-5, but suppress GS1 from transmitting RACK and Reservation 
Responses.  Verify that the EUT retransmits the Reservation Request until after the total number of retransmissions reaches NM1.  
 
Step 13 
Monitor at GS1 to verify that the Reservation Request transmission satisfies 
the requirements of timing and format for the downlink M bursts. Step 14 
Immediately after NM1 retransmissions of the reservation request in Step 12, 
reset GS1 to resume RACK and Reservation Response processing and command GS1 to poll the EUT. Step 15 
Verify at GS1 that the EUT transmits a poll response with the outstanding data 
reservation request. Step 16 
Repeat the test for system configuration 2V1D.

Verify that the EUT sends a Poll Response with no slots requested to GS1 
when polled by GS1 and GS1 does not respond to the Poll Response without reservation request.  
 
Step 4 
Command GS1 to ignore random access Reservation Request messages, so that 
polling is the only means for requesting downlink reservations. Step 5 
Submit a single message of priority 2 to the EUT for delivery to GS1.  Verify 
that the EUT sends a Poll Response with reservation request for the priority 2 message when polled by GS1. Step 6 
Observe that GS1, with no time slots available to assign for this request, sends 
neither a Reservation Response nor a RACK in responding to the Poll Response. Step 7 
Verify that use of the Random Access downlink M burst for re-transmitting the 
reservation request has been stopped at the EUT upon receiving the poll request. 
 
Step 8 
Verify that the EUT continues to respond to poll requests with poll responses 
containing the same reservation request. Step 9 
Stop submitting messages to GS1 to unblock the data channel. Step 10 
Observe that a Reservation Response message is transmitted by GS1 and is 
received by the EUT by verifying that the EUT initiates data transmission in the assigned time slots beginning in the following MAC cycle. Step 11

Procedure Step 1 
Configure GS1 for system configuration 2V2D and select the designated 
channel identifier of Net ID A for the EUT. Step 2 
With no message pending on the network, submit a single message of priority 
2 (2-bit priority field encoded as 10) and length 930 octets (including DLS 
frame header) to the EUT for delivery to GS1. 
 
Step 3 
After receiving a reservation response associated with the outstanding message, 
and prior to T1 timer expiration at the EUT, submit a sequence of five priority 1 (2-bit priority field encoded as binary 01) messages of 84 octets each (including DLS frame headers) to the EUT for delivery to GS1. Step 4 
Verify with the Test Set that the data transmission of the single 930-octet 
message begins in the next MAC cycle after the Reservation Response and 
consists of exactly 15 V/D (data) bursts. Step 5 
Observe that an uplink ACK message is transmitted in one of the V/D (data) 
slots by GS1 in the uplink within T_ack MAC cycles after the last downlink 
V/D (data) burst (with EOM flag) is received. Step 6 
Verify that the uplink ACK frame is properly extracted from the uplink V/D 
(data) transmission by observing that no retransmission of the downlink 
message occurs. Step 7 
Verify at GS1 that upon completion of the single 930-octet message 
transmission, a reservation request for the five 84 octet messages (See Step 3) is initiated in the form of a single media access event. Step 8 
Verify at GS1 that the EUT downlinks the frame grouped five priority 1 
messages by observing that, upon transmitting the reservation response by GS1, the downlink data transmission begins and takes 7 V/D (data) bursts. Step 9 
Upon completion of the downlink V/D (data) bursts, observe that a single ACK 
frame is generated by GS1 and is transmitted in an uplink V/D (data) burst 
within T_ack MAC cycles from the time the last downlink V/D (data) burst is 
received. Step 10 
Verify that there are no further downlink transmissions in the V/D (data) slots. Step 11 
Command GS1 to send neither ACK nor XID_RSP_LE frames and repeat 
Steps 2-8.   
 
Step 12 
Verify at GS1 that retransmission of the 930-octet frame occurs after expiration 
of T1 timer at the EUT. Step 13 
Verify that duplicate frames are received at GS1, as a result of suppressing the 
uplink ACK frame transmission. Step 14 
Verify that retransmission of the outstanding message stops when the number 
of successive T1 timer expirations exceeds N2. Step 15 
Command GS1 to send a V/D (data) message to the EUT and verify at GS1 
that the associated downlink ACK message is not received in the next MAC cycle after GS1 transmits the last V/D (data) burst. (This Step verifies that the EUT has terminated the data link.) Step 16 
Repeat the test procedure for system configuration 2V1D.

2.4.5.7.2 
Test 5-2  --  Automated Ground Station Handoff 
 
Objective Verify automated handoff of ground stations for the aircraft EUT based on the received signal strength of the ground stations. RTCA DO-224B does not currently specify 3T handoff criteria.  Such handoff criteria are 
left to the avionics manufacturers to determine.  Therefore, sample criteria for automated ground station handoff in 3T are proposed to develop the associated sample MOPS test procedures.  Depending upon the specific implementation of the avionics manufacturers, the test procedures may have to be modified. Sample Handoff Criteria:  Handoff from the current ground station to the new ground station shall be based on the following conditions. 
a) The signal quality used for determining handoff is based on the median signal level 
of the received signal over the last 20 measurements of each candidate ground station, assuming one measurement per MAC cycle. 
 
b) The current ground station signal level is below â70 dBm (Â±1.5 dB). 
 
c) The new ground station signal is at least 6 dB (Â±1.5 dB) stronger than that of the 
current ground station if the current ground station signal level is below â80 dBm. The new ground station signal is at least 10 dB (Â±1.5 dB) stronger than that of the 
current ground station if the current ground station signal level is above â80 dBm.

Procedure Step 1 
Configure GS1 and GS2 for system configuration 3T with frequency f1 and f2, 
respectively, and select f1 and the designated channel identifier for the EUT. 
 
Step 2 
Adjust the output power levels of GS1 and GS2 such that the levels measured 
at the RF port of the EUT are -75 dBm for GS1 and -85 dBm for GS2. Step 3 
Increase the GS2 output power in steps of 3 dB until the level reaches -61 
dBm. Step 4 
Verify that ground station handoff from GS1 to GS2 occurs automatically 
when the median of the received signal level of GS2 over the last 20 MAC cycles reaches â66.5 dBm or above. 
 
Step 5 
Verify handoff of ground stations by observing that the EUT has switched its 
channel frequency from f1 to f2 and performed net entry with GS2.  Verify that 
the EUT completes link establishment with GS2 by initiating a downlink data access. Step 6 
Repeat Step 2, but adjust GS1 and GS2 output power such that the resulting 
signal levels at the RF port of the EUT are â85 dBm and â96 dBm, respectively. Step 7 
Increase the GS2 output power in steps of 3 dB. Step 8 
Verify that no ground station handoff occurs when the median received GS2 
signal level over the last 20 MAC cycle is â81 dBm or below and that handoff from GS1 to GS2 occurs automatically when the median signal level of GS2 
over the last 20 MAC cycles reaches -80.5 dBm or above at the input of the EUT. Step 9 
Verify handoff of ground stations by observing that the EUT has switched its 
channel frequency from f1 to f2 and performed net entry with GS2.  Verify that 
the EUT completes link establishment with GS2 by initiating a downlink data access. Step 10 
Repeat Step 2, but adjust GS1 and GS2 output power such that the resulting 
signal levels at the RF port of the EUT are â68 dBm and â80 dBm, respectively. Step 11 
Increase the GS2 output power in steps of 3 dB from â80 dBm to â20 dBm and 
verify that handoff of ground stations does not occur.

Configuration 1 or 3, shown in Figure 2-7 or 2-9, as appropriate for the class of 
equipment under test identified in Table 2-5. 
 
b. The tests are divided into two groups: point-to-point compression tests and multicast 
tests.  For the point-to-point tests, the EUT is configured with a point-to-point 
network service access point (NSAP) address as is the message generator.   
 
c. For the multicast tests, two NSAP addresses are defined: one representing a 
predefined multicast address; the other representing a dynamically defined multicast address.  The message generator/processor is configured to recognize these addresses 
as multicast.  The ground compressor and the avionics decompressor are initialized for the predefined multicast address, using an index number of one (1).  In this case, the predefined multicast address and the point-to-point NSAP of the message 
generator represent the NSAP pair.   
 
d. The ground station emulator uses a broadcast link address for any frames containing 
a CLNP packet with a multicast address.

ATN device, specifying a connection with ATN quality of service 
(QOS)/Priority/Security values of your choice. Step 2 
Send a series of data from the EUT to GS1, making sure that the data unit size 
is much smaller than the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the VDL Mode 3 connectionless subnetwork interface, i.e., smaller than 923 bytes. Step 3 
Verify at GS1 that the first packet (the connection request) is uncompressed 
and subsequent information (data packet and acknowledgment packet transport 
protocol data units [TPDUs]) is compressed. Step 4 
Verify that the TP4 connection is functioning normally by observing that no 
retransmission occurs, i.e., the EUT decompresses TP4 acknowledgements from the ground and the TP4 acknowledgements are accepted by the TP4 process. 
 
2.4.5.10.1.3 
Test 8-3  --  CLNP Packet Compression 
 
Objective Verify that CLNP packets are sent compressed. 
Procedure (continued from previous test) Step 1 
Using the aircraft ATN capable device, open a new TP4 connection with the 
ground ATN device, specifying no ATN options. Step 2 
Send data with a data unit larger than 923 bytes from the EUT to GS1. Step 3 
Verify at GS1 that the subsequent CLNP packets, which contain the TPDU, are 
received as long compressed packets. Step 4 
Repeat Steps 1-3 but vary the optional header fields in the CLNP protocol data 
unit (PDU) to exercise the entire compressor formatting.  Include packets with and without additional options. 
 
Step 5 
Verify that the TP4 connection is functioning normally by observing that no 
retransmission occurs, i.e., the EUT decompresses TP4 acknowledgements from the ground and the TP4 acknowledgements are accepted by the TP4 process. 
 
2.4.5.10.1.4

process by observing that an ACK is received at GS1.   
 
2.4.5.10.1.5 
Test 8-5  --  Compression Bypass 
 
Objective Verify that CLNP packets which are not of type Data or Error are correctly forwarded and transferred uncompressed. 
Procedure (continued from previous test) Step 1 
Using the ground ATN capability generate a CLNP Echo Request packet to be 
sent from GS1 to the EUT with destination NSAP set to that of the aircraft ATN capability. Step 2 
Verify with the Test Set that a CLNP Echo Response from the EUT is received 
at GS1 and that no compression occurs when transmitting the CLNP Echo Request and Response.   
 
2.4.5.10.1.6 
Test 8-6  --  Index Idle 
 
Objective Verify that idle index numbers are reused. 
Procedure (continued from previous test) Step 1 
Using the aircraft ATN capable device, open 140 new TP4 connections with a 
different NSAP, every second.  Note that it is not necessary that the connection succeed, i.e., the NSAPs can represent no responding ground entity.  The TP4 retransmission timer, T1, must be set to a value larger than 140 seconds.  
 
Step 2 
Verify that the 127th through 140th connections reuse the first 14 index 
numbers.  That is, index numbers 2 through 15 are reused, the index number 1 being permanently reserved for multicast purposes. 
 
2.4.5.10.1.7 
Test 8-7  --  Compression Initialization 
 
Objective Verify that index information is deleted whenever system initialization occurs. 
Procedure (continued from previous test) Step 1 
Use the aircraft ATN capable device to open multiple TP4 connections with the 
ground.  
 
Step 2 
Use the ground ATN capable device to open multiple TP4 connections with the 
EUT. Step 3 
Send enough downlink messages to start the compression of headers on all of 
the TP4 connections. Step 4 
Command the ground CLNP compressor to send a restart packet. Step 5 
Verify that all index information associated with the TP4 connections opened 
by the aircraft ATN device is deleted. Step 6 
Send a new downlink message for each TP4 connection. Step 7 
Verify with the Test Set that the message received is uncompressed. Step 8 
Verify that the index number associated with the predefined multicast NSAP is 
unchanged. Step 9 
Force the system to generate a Leave Event. Step 10 
Verify that all index information is deleted, except for the index associated 
with the predefined multicast NSAP. Step 11 
Reopen a previous NSAP pair connection. Step 12 
Verify that the first packet is sent uncompressed. 
 
2.4.5.10.2 
Multicast Compression Subnetwork Tests 
 
2.4.5.10.2.1 
Test 8-8  --  Predefined Multicast Decompression 
 
Objective Verify that compressed multicast subnetwork data packets that use predefined and 
dynamic NSAPs are correctly processed. 
 
Procedure (continued from previous test) Step 1 
Use the ground ATN capable device to generate one hundred 50-byte messages 
using the Connectionless Transport Protocol (CLTP) with checksum option, 
specifying the predefined multicast NSAP as the destination address.  Each message must contain a unique sequence number and a unique test pattern. Each message is to be injected into GS1 at the rate of one per second. Step 2 
Verify that all of the data is received by the EUT, decompressed correctly, in 
order, with no gaps. Step 3 
Use the ground ATN capable device to generate one hundred 50-byte messages 
using CLTP with checksum option, specifying the dynamic multicast NSAP as the destination address.  Each message must contain a unique sequence number 
and a unique test pattern.  Each message is to be injected into the VDL Mode 3 
test suite at the rate of one per second. Step 4 
Verify that all the data is received by the EUT, decompressed correctly, in 
order, and with no gaps. Step 5 
Continue to generate and transmit the data defined in Steps 1 and 3. Step 6 
Power down the EUT and re-enter the net, performing all initializations as 
required, using the subnetwork parameters as defined in Test 8-1. Step 7 
Wait for the EUT to complete link establishment procedure. Step 8 
Verify that decompression of the multicast data resumes in order and that the 
delay for the resumption of decompression is no more than 5 seconds.  (The 
CT1 parameter guarantees that an uncompressed packet is sent every 5th 
packet, by default).

2.4.5.11.5 
Channel State Test ProceduresâError Recovery Procedures The Channel State Test Procedures are designed to test the Restart, Call Setup and Clearing, Reset, Flow Control and Data Transfer State tables of the aircraft EUT.  While the Nominal State Test Procedures were captured in the earlier sections of this document, this section focuses on the Error Recovery State Test Procedures. The Error Recovery State Test Procedures are designed to test the capability of the Aircraft EUT to recover from erroneous packets received over the ISO 8208 or VDL 
Mode 3 interface.  A series of ISO 8208 and VDL Mode 3 packets will be transferred 
across the ANI boundaries to stimulate the logical states.  Table 2-50 shows the required 
input and output for this test.  Entries in the table are denoted either "ISO 8208" or "VDL Mode 3".  ISO 8208 refers to transactions at the HLE interface, and VDL Mode 3 refers to transactions at the GNI-ANI interface.  Unless otherwise noted, all tests occur on a single logical channel. 
Use the ISO 8208 test set to perform the HLE functions, and use the VDL Mode 3 
Ground Network simulator to perform GNI functions. 
The packet transactions in Table 2-50 are required for the Error Recovery Test 
Procedures.

Procedure 
 
Step 1 
Have the EUT perform link establishment with GS1, while configured for 
MbB operation for the CLNP (No Compression) subnetwork interface. Step 2 
Verify that the parameter former_GNIp in the downlinked CTRL_CMD_LE 
frame has a value of zero. Step 3  
Have GS1 include a GNIp-Group parameter set (DO-224B, Section 3.3.3.3.1.2) 
with valid parameters in the CTRL_RSP_LE frame.  In particular, the MbB_Operations_Permitted parameter shall be set to FALSE.  (This parameter 
must be false at this time, as the aircraft has downlinked a zero value for the former_GNIp parameter.) Step 4 
Retune the EUT to a clear frequency and then back to f1 and repeat Steps 1 and 
3 within TL3 seconds.  This time uplink a valid set of GNIp-Group parameters 
with the MbB_Operations_Permitted parameter set to TRUE and the Operative_GNIp parameter set to a different value than that used in Step 3.  
Verify that the downlinked XID parameter, former_GNIp, has the value transmitted in Step 3. Step 5 
Wait TL3 seconds. Perform Steps 1 and 2 again.  Verify that the former_GNIp 
parameter is set to zero.

Wait Aircraft_TMbB seconds.  Verify that the airborne ATN router receives its 
first Leave Event Message at this time and that the message refers to the 
former_GNIp, i.e., the GNIp referenced in the GNIp-Group parameter set 
transmitted in Step 3 of Test 10-1.  
 
Step 3 
Perform Step 1 again.  Then repeat Step 4 of Test 10-1 within Aircraft_TMbB 
seconds sending an unused operative_GNIp parameter value.  (At this point three different values have been sent to the aircraft).  Verify that the only Leave Event Message sent to the airborne ATN machine is upon reception of the last 
transmittal (i.e., during the repeat of Step 4 of Test 10-1) and that the Leave Event Message references the first operative_GNIp value transmitted. Step 4 
Perform Steps 1, 3 and 4 of Test 10-1 with the following modification.  The 
value of the MbB_Operations_Permitted parameter is set to FALSE in all transmittals.  Verify that a Leave Event Message is sent to the airborne ATN machine upon completion of the net entry procedures of Step 4 of Test 10-1. Verify that the message references the first operative_GNIp transmitted (i.e.

Procedure Step 1 
Perform Steps 1 and 3 of Test 10-1.  Verify that an IDRP connection between 
aircraft and ground ATN routers is started (starting this connection is the 
responsibility of the ground ATN machine). Step 2 
Start a CLNP echo request originating in the aircraft ATN router with 
destination address of the ground ATN router.  Verify that the Ground 
Subnetwork Address field in the DLS sublayer frame header (DO-224B, Section 3.3.2.2.2.1) is set to the Operative_GNIp value established in Step 1. Step 3 
Continue the echo request operation in Step 2, sending a new request every 
second. Perform Step 4 of Test 10-1.  Verify that an IDRP connection between aircraft and ground ATN routers is started.  (Note the ground ATN capability will have to have two logical ATN state machines so that the IDRP connections are viewed as existing in two separate network domains.) Step 4 
Start a second CLNP echo request originating in the aircraft ATN router with a 
destination address of the ground ATN router used to establish the IDRP connection in Step 4 of Test 10-1.  Verify that the Ground Subnetwork Address field in the DLS sublayer frame header (DO-224B, Section 3.3.2.2.2.1) is set to the Operative_GNIp value established in Step 3 for this echo request.  Verify that echo requests started in Steps 2 and 3 have the Operative_GNIp value in the frame header established in Step 1. Step 5 
Repeat Steps 1 through 4 with CLNP compression in operation.

3.2.1 
 
Dynamic Response Operation of the equipment shall not be adversely affected by aircraft ground operations, 
maneuvering, or changes in attitude encountered in normal flight operations. 
 
3.2.2 
 
Interference Effects The equipment shall not be the source of harmful conducted or radiated interference and 
shall not be adversely affected by conducted or radiated interference from other equipment or systems installed in the aircraft. 
Notes:   
 
1. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) problems noted after installation of this 
equipment may result from such factors as design characteristics of previously installed systems or equipment and the physical installation itself.  It is not intended 
that the equipment manufacturer necessarily design for all installation environments. The installing facility will be responsible for resolving any incompatibility between this equipment and previously installed equipment in the aircraft.  The various factors contributing to the incompatibility must be considered. 
 
2. The FCC requirement in CFR 47, of â40 dBc for aircraft spurious emissions, may not 
protect GNSS (including GPS) navigation receivers nor Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service (AMSS) communication receivers from harmful interference because 
additional attenuation is required.  Of particular concern to GNSS are VHF 12th and 
13th harmonics (especially at 121.150, 121.175, 121.2, 131.2, 131.25, and 131.3 
MHz).  Of particular concern to AMS(R)S are the VHF 12th and 13th harmonics (for 
AMS(R)S systems operating in the band 1525 - 1559 MHz, especially at 118.0 - 119.9 MHz and at 127.1 - 129.9 MHz; and for AMS(R)S systems operating in the band 1610 - 1626.5 MHz, especially at 121.1 - 123.85 MHz and 134.15 - 135.55 MHz).   
 
3. Spurious emissions from the VHF antenna or a VHF box can be a problem.  
Additional filtering and shielding may be required to protect navigation receivers on an aircraft.  Intersystem EMC issues are beyond the scope of this document. 
However, if simultaneous operation is required, the methodology stated in the following equation, if applicable, may be used to determine the harmonic levels that would be acceptable for a given set of conditions.  The conditions that correlate with a particular manufacturer's transmitter design should be specified in the installation 
information for the transmitter if the manufacturer intends for the transmitter to be 
used on aircraft that would include such receiving systems. 
 
Transmitter Harmonic Level  =  Sensitivity of Receiving System  
+ Receiver Interference to Desired Signal Level  
  
- Safety Margin - Aggregate Effect Margin + Antenna Isolation + Harmonic Filter Attenuation (if used)

Table B-1 contains the MOPS environmental condition requirements cross reference to verification testing and equipment classes.  Table B-2 contains the MOPS standard condition requirements cross reference to verification testing and equipment classes.  For the purpose of traceability, these tables assume that the division between architecture SL and SU equipment is as defined in Appendix C.  In the Table, X indicates that this requirement is applicable and the specified test should be performed to qualify the indicated class of equipment as MOPS-compliant.  A blank entry indicates that the tests of the indicated paragraph need not be performed to qualify the indicated class of equipment as MOPS-
compliant.  An entry of O indicates that the requirement is associated with the optional 3T configuration and needs to be performed only if the manufacturers choose to qualify the equipment for the option.

## Appendix C Functional Partitioning For Separated Equipment Architecture

 
C.1 
Introduction To support air carrier equipment configurations, the VDL Mode 3 MOPS includes a variety of equipment classes that define separated equipment architectures supporting the VDL Mode 3 subnetwork capabilities.  This Appendix provides the partitioning of the VDL Mode 3 functionality between the VDR (Equipment Architecture SL) and CMU (Equipment Architecture SU). 

C.2 
Rationale The deployment of VDL Mode 3 in the national airspace is projected to occur in phases. VDL Mode 3 deployment is expected to start initially with a VDL Mode 3 voice-only operational capability. It is anticipated that operational support of VDL Mode 3 data will be provided a few years after the introduction of the voice capability.  Therefore, it is highly desirable to devise a plan for implementing VDL Mode 3 avionics equipment for air transport aircraft that:  
 
a. supports the phased deployment of VDL Mode 3 
 
b. minimizes the initial investment in avionics required to provide VDL Mode 3 voice capability  
 
c. results in no modifications to previously installed VDL Mode 3 avionics when VDL Mode 3 data services become operational To support these objectives, it is desirable to partition the VDL Mode 3 functions so that the VDR equipment alone is sufficient to support all VDL Mode 3 voice functions, including enhanced voice operations.  The CMU should not be required for voice-only applications.  This dictates that the VDR 
must include all functionality associated with the physical layer, the MAC sublayer, the part of the LME sublayer that supports voice operation, and the voice unit.  Furthermore, the VDR should also include those DLS sublayer functions that need to be tightly coupled to the MAC and LME functions in order to perform certain time-critical functions. The detailed functional partitioning between the VDR and CMU is given in Section C.3.  Note that the recommended functional partitioning for VDL Mode 3 is consistent with the functional partitioning in aircraft within a VDL Mode 2 system. 

C.3 
Assumed VDL Mode 3 Functional Partitioning Between the VDR and CMU

## Appendix E Audio Test Vectors

 

## E.1 Introduction This Appendix Contains Audio Test Vectors To Assist Manufacturers In The Design And Testing Of Their Radio Audio Sections. E.2 Test Vector For Setting Audio Levels

VDL Mode 3 radios use the DVSI 4.8 kbps AMBE+TM Vocoder for Air Traffic Communication to compress voice for digital transmission.  Although the vocoder is designed to provide good quality voice transmission at low bit rates, it does not generally perform well with a single frequency tone.  Such a tone would be useful in setting up receivers to provide an output audio level that is consistent among VDL Mode 3 radios and between VDL Mode 3 and DSB-AM radios.   
This section presents a compressed test vector (CTV) that enables the decoder to generate a good quality sine wave which can be used for setting audio levels and characterizing harmonic distortion and noise performance. 

## E.2.1 Compressed Test Vector (Ctv) Description

Figure E-1 provides a basic block diagram of the VDL Mode 3 receive signal flow highlighting the use of the CTV. 

The compressed test vector generates a 400 Hz test tone with the following characteristics: 

Æ 
Tone Frequency:  
400 Hz 
Æ 
Signal Power: 
-3 dBFS 
(RMS average power) 
Æ 
Total Distortion: 
 0.0057%  
(band limited from 300 to 3700 Hz) 

A 400 Hz tone was selected because this is the largest single frequency tone that the vocoder can generate.  This frequency limit was discovered during empirical testing and validated by a review of the algorithm.  Although a more common test tone frequency of 1004 Hz is desirable because it is located near the center of the passband, the 400 Hz tone is still within the passband and should not be significantly affected by band edge filter rolloff characteristics. 

Figure E-2 provides an illustration of the decoded waveform.  Figure E-3 and Figure E-4 provide frequency domain views.   
The CTV consists of a single frame of data that is repeated continuously and sent to the decoder.  A single frame of compressed voice data is 96-bits long and represents 20 ms of voice when decoded.  Six frames of data fill a voice burst slot for VDL Mode 3.   The CTV data frame (in VDL Mode 3 bit order) is provided below: 
CTV (Octal): 
 
3464 0302 2044 3014 6114 4647 2423 3360 
 
CTV (Hex): 
 
7340 C242 460C C4C9 A751 36F0 
The CTV was developed using the C-version of vocoder source code executing on a Windows PC.  Use of the source code allowed direct editing of model parameters.  Results were evaluated using Cool Edit Pro, a digital sound editing software package.  Cool Edit Pro allows the display of signals in both time and frequency domains.  The frequency domain plots provided in Figures 3 and 4 were generated using Cool Edit Pro's 65536-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with Blackmann-Harris windowing. 

## E.2.2 Applications

The CTV has the following applications: 

Æ 
Consistent system-wide audio levels, 
Æ 
Characterization harmonic distortion and noise performance, 
Æ 
Equipment standardization (if included in DO-271B MOPS), 
Æ 
Level measurements using simple test equipment (RMS meter), and 
Æ 
Equipment test purposes (factory & field). 

## E.2.3 Summary

The CTV can be used to setup proper VDL Mode 3 receiver audio levels from a digitally generated reference.  It also can be used for characterizing radio harmonic distortion and noise performance. 

## E.3 Compressed Silence Test Vector

VDL Mode 3 radios use the DVSI 4.8 kbps AMBE+TM Vocoder for Air Traffic Communication vocoder to compress voice for digital transmission.   At least one radio manufacturers has suggested that a compressed silence vector would be helpful in testing VDL Mode 3 radios.  This vector could be applied at the RF input to a receiver and used to characterize the operation of the analog output circuitry (e.g., verify noise performance). This paper presents two compressed silence vector (CSV) that will facilitate testing of analog audio circuitry in VDL Mode 3 radio receivers.  The first is a single frame vector that produces a slightly colored noise spectrum with an average RMS energy of -87 dBFS.  The second is a six-frame vocoder vector (one VDL Mode 3 burst) that produces a flat noise spectrum with an average RMS energy of -87.5 dBFS 

## E.3.1 Compressed Silence Test Vector (Csv) Description

Figure E-5 provides a basic block diagram of the VDL Mode 3 receive signal flow highlighting the use of the CSV.  The next two subsections describe the single-frame and multi-frame versions of the CSV. The compressed test vectors generate an output signal with the following characteristics:

The vocoder is designed to work with 16-bit linear voice samples.  The peak values of the output signal are +/- 3 or -80 dBFS.  Figures E-6 and E-7 provide the output spectrum for the single and multiple frame CSVs, respectively. A single vocoder frame of compressed voice data is 96-bits long and represents 20 ms of voice when decoded.  Six vocoder frames of data fill a voice burst slot for VDL Mode 3.

The CSVs were developed using the C-version of vocoder source code executing on a Windows PC.  Use of the source code allowed direct editing of model parameters.  Results were evaluated using Cool Edit Pro, a digital sound editing software package.  The frequency domain plots provided in Figures E-2 and E-3 were generated using Cool Edit Pro's 32768-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with Blackmann- Harris windowing. 

## E.3.2 Summary

Either or both of the CSVs can be used to test the analog audio circuits (e.g., verify noise performance) in VDL Mode 3 radio receivers.
