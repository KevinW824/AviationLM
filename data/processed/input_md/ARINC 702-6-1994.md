## 1.0 Introduction And Description 1.1 Purpose

This document sets forth the characteristics of a Flight Management Computer System specifically designed for installation in new generation commercial transport aircraft.

The system is not designed for retrofit in any aircraft other than those utilizing ARINC 700 series equipment.

## 1.2 Summary Of Operational Characteristics

The Flight Management Computer System
(FMS)
described herein is designed to provide performance data and fuel management display and control functions, and navigation and guidance to a desired flight plan based on energy efficient profiles.

NOTE: This Characteristic describes an FMS which is
capable of providing performance management and navigation/guidance functions from take-off to final approach. It is recognized, however, that a need also exists for a simpler version of the system
designed
to
provide
performance
management combined with limited navigation and guidance.
The intent in developing the
simpler system is to achieve a lower cost system with reduced operating logistics compared with the more sophisticated system described.
It is
anticipated that equipment cost may be reduced by: a. Less complex software design b. Minimum bulk data storage requirements c. Simpler Control Display Unit (CDU)
Operating logistics impact may, in turn, be reduced by:

a. Minimized bulk data cost
b. Less frequent data update c. Reduced crew training needs
It is not the intent herein to develop a
"Characteristic within a Characteristic", nor is it intended to describe two separate systems.

Manufacturers wishing to develop the simpler system should decide which functions are needed for such a system, and design the system in accordance with the relevant sections of this Characteristic.

It should be emphasized, however, that all systems should conform to the interchangeability standards set forth in Section 2 of this Characteristic.

The energy management functions performed by the FMS includes the computation of target parameters, flight profiles and guidance commands to optimize performance during all phases of flight. The optimization should, by selection, be based on cost, time, fuel or range.

Provisions should also be included to enable overall modification of these computations by a factor based on individual airline operating economics, local fuel costs, etc. To achieve this performance optimization within the constraints of the air traffic environment, the energy management functions are integrated with a three dimensional, earth oriented navigation system employing mixing of available navigation sensor system inputs. Primary data for this function are IRS/AHRS, GNSS, air data, and bearing and distance data derived from ground based VORTACS and VOR and/or DME facilities, with provisions for growth inputs from additional sensors. The system provides for the automatic selection and tuning of VOR, DME and ILS systems.

The FMS
receives continuous inputs of altitude, airspeed, ground speed, fuel flow and fuel quantity, Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) or revolution (N1), airplane configuration, etc. as required to support the energy management calculations. A data base is stored in the Flight Management Computer (FMC) unit which may include performance and limit data for a variety of engine types and airplane configurations and navigation data to support the airline requirements. Lateral guidance is computed with respect to great circle paths defined by the flight plan, and to transitional paths between the great circle paths, or to a preset heading or course.

Vertical guidance is computed with respect to altitudes assigned to waypoints, or to paths defined by stored or computed profiles.

Speed control along the desired path is provided during all phases of flight. Lateral and vertical guidance and speed/thrust commands are computed for automatic control through the Flight Control Computer System (FCCS) and Thrust Control Computer System
(TCCS).

Deviation signals are computed for display on flight instruments. Engagement of the FMS modes for automatic flight via the FCCS and TCCS is controlled through the FCCS Controller on the Mode Control Panel (MCP).

Flight planning data entry and flight performance mode selection for FMC
use is performed through the FMS
Control/Display Unit (CDU). The system should be designed with growth potential to add real-time constraints to the guidance modes to provide a four-dimensional (4D) guidance capability. The system also has the optional capability to provide all the necessary signal processing the input/output functions to support a multi-function electronic display.

## 1.3 Brief Description Of The System

The ARINC 702 Flight Management Computer System (FMS) comprises two units, one a rack-mounted computer unit and the other a cockpit-located control and display unit. The computer unit provides storage capability for all data needed for system operation.

## 1.0 Introduction And Description (Cont'D) 1.4 Unit Description 1.4.1 Flight Management Computer (Fmc) Unit

The Flight Management Computer (FMC) unit should contain all of the components, electronic circuitry, memory, etc. incident to the functioning of the system. The unit should also contain, as a minimum, sufficient data storage for all required active engine and airplane performance data, all navigation data required to support the active flight plan, and any alternate flight plan which may have been entered into the system. The design goal should be that the FMC should be capable of storing all data required by the system.

The computer should be designed such that normal and abnormal power switching transients and other primary power interruptions as defined in RTCA Document DO-160 do not cause essential memory contents to be lost.

Provisions should be made in the design of the computer to allow for future growth of the system. Expanding the capabilities of the computer should be possible with a minimum of rework and at a minimum cost to the airline customer. Section 3.6 of this Characteristic describes some possible "growth features".

## 1.4.2 Control/Display Unit (Cdu)

--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The CDU should provide means for manually inserting system control parameters and selecting modes of operation. In addition, it should display various computer outputs as well as for the verification of data entered into memory.

Certain annunciations related to system operation may also be included. When the FMC is used in conjunction with an IRS and/or GNSS Sensor, the CDU may also be used to control this equipment.

Series control may be employed; i.e., the CDU interfaces only to the FMC and all communications with the IRS and/or GNSS are made via the FMC/IRS and/or FMC/GNSS interface. NOTE: This method of series control may also be applied to other systems inputs, such as Omega, referred to in Section 3.6 of this Characteristic.

## 1.5 Interchangeability 1.5.1 General

One of the primary functions of an ARINC Equipment Characteristic is to designate, in addition to certain performance parameters, the interchangeability desired for aircraft equipment produced by various manufacturers. The degree of interchangeability considered necessary is specified in the pertinent ARINC
Equipment Characteristic.

## 1.5.2 Interchangeability Desired For The Arinc 702 Flight Management Computer System

System interchangeability of the FMC and the CDU with respect to the standard aircraft installation is desired, regardless of the manufacturing source.

The standards necessary to ensure this level of interchangeability are set forth in Section 2 of this Characteristic.

## 1.5.3 "Generation Interchangeability" Considerations

The air transport industry desires that future evolutionary equipment improvements and the inclusion of additional functions in new equipments during the next few years do not violate the interwiring and form factor standards set forth in this document.

Provisions to ensure forwardlooking "generation interchangeability" (as best can be predicted) are included in this document to guide manufacturers in future developments.

## 1.6 Integrity And Availability

Since it is anticipated that this equipment may become the primary means of navigation on some aircraft, the utmost attention should be paid to the need for integrity and availability in all phases of system design, production, and installation.

## 1.7 Regulatory Approval

The equipment should meet all applicable regulatory requirements. This Characteristic does not and cannot set forth the specific requirements that an equipment must meet to be assured of approval. Such information must be obtained from the appropriate regulatory authority.

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards 2.1 Introduction

This section of this Characteristic sets forth the specific form factor, mounting provisions, interwiring, input and output interfaces and power supply characteristics desired for the complete Flight Management Computer System. These standards are necessary to ensure the continued independent design and development of both the equipment and the airframe installations. Manufacturers should note that although this Characteristic does not preclude the use of different form factors and interwiring features, the practical problem of redesigning what will then be a standard aircraft installation to accommodate some special system could very well make the use of that other design prohibitively expensive for the customer. They should recognize, therefore, the practical advantages of developing equipment in accordance with the form factor, interwiring and signal standards of this document.

## 2.2 Form Factor, Connectors And Index Pin Coding 2.2.1 Flight Management Computer

The FMC should comply with the dimensional standards in ARINC Specification 600, "Air Transport Avionics Interfaces" for the 8 MCU form factor. The FMC should also comply with ARINC 600 with respect to weight, racking attachments, front and rear projections and cooling. As an alternative, the 4 MCU form factor may be used. Equipment packaged in the 4 MCU form factor should be designated
"ARINC
702S".

The same functional guidelines and interwiring apply. The FMC should be provided with a low insertion force, size 2 shell ARINC 600 service connector.

This connector should be located on the center grid of the FMC
rear panel, and index code 04 should be used. The top and center inserts of the connector (TP and MP) should each provide 150 socket-type contacts. The lower insert (BP) should provide 11 pin-type contacts and spaces for two small diameter coaxial contacts. Attachment 1A to this document shows the connector arrangement.

Attachment 2 shows the pin assignments. If functions not assigned pins on the service connector in Attachment 2 to this document are needed to be brought to the "outside world" to facilitate testing the FMC, they should be assigned pins on an auxiliary connector whose type and location is selected by the equipment manufacturer. The manufacturer should refer to ARINC Specification 600 when choosing the location for this connector and note that, other than to accommodate the needs for equipment identification by the ATE described in this document, he is free to make whatever pin assignments he wishes.

The airlines do not want the unassigned ("future spare") pins of the service connector used for functions associated solely with ATE use.

## 2.2.2 Control/Display Unit (Cdu)

The CDU should be packaged as a standard dzus-mounted control panel 9" high by 5.75" wide. The depth behind the panel should not exceed
10.5", excluding the connector. A connector type M83723/72R18-31N should be used having pin assignments as shown in Attachment 2. Outline drawings showing the connector location are included in Attachment 1B to this Characteristic. More details on CDU design may be found in Section 5.0. NOTE: As stated in Section 1.2 of this Characteristic, a need exists to allow manufacturers the flexibility to develop FMC systems with differing levels of capability in an effort to reduce airline cost and logistic problems.

Part of the system cost reduction may be achieved by developing a smaller, simpler CDU. Differing feelings exist in the industry concerning the relative merits of dedicated key versus shared function alphanumeric keyboards, and also on the trade-off between the amount of keyboard area versus display area.

Thus, equipment manufacturers may be asked by their airline customers to supply CDUs of less than 9" panel height. Airframe manufacturers, however, should design cockpits to accommodate CDUs of the standard 9" height.

## 2.3 Interwiring

The overall interwiring for the ARINC 702 Flight Management Computer System is set forth in Attachment 2. The interwiring for a given installation, however, need only ensure interconnection with the sub-systems chosen to support operation of the FMC system.

Wiring associated with alternate sub-systems shown in Attachment 2 need not be installed.

Equipment manufacturers are cautioned not to rely on special wires, cabling or shielding for their particular units because they will not exist in an ARINC 702 installation.

## Commentary Why Standardize Interwiring?

The standardized interwiring is perhaps the heart of all ARINC Characteristics. It is this feature which allows the airline customer to complete his negotiations with the airframe manufacturer so that the latter can proceed with engineering and initial fabrication prior to airline commitment on

This provides the equipment manufacturer with many valuable months in which to put the final "polish" on his equipment in development.

--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The reader's attention is directed to the interwiring guidance in ARINC Report 414, Section 5.0. This material defines all of the basic standards utilized in airframe wiring installations and all equipment manufacturers should make themselves familiar with it. The reader's attention is also directed to the guidance in Section
2.2.1
and Appendix
1
of ARINC
Specification 429 concerning the basic standards for digital interfaces in airframe wiring installations.

## 2.4 Power Circuitry 2.4.1 Primary Power Input

The FMC and the CDU should be designed to use 115 volt 400Hz single phase power from a system designed for Category
(A)
utilization equipment per ARINC
Specification 413A. The primary power inputs to the FMC and the CDU will each be protected by a circuit breaker of the size shown in Attachment 2 to this Characteristic.

Installation designers should note that the FMC circuit breaker should also be capable of handling the current drain of an ARINC 603 data loader.

When such a device is used with the FMC, it derives its power from the FMC power source. The equipment designer should be aware that severe switching and other transient interruptions to primary power occur during normal aircraft operations. He should ensure that such interruptions do not cause the computer to lose the contents of its memory or impose the need to provide an external battery to maintain operations.

No pilot action should be needed to cause the system to return to normal operation following such normal power interruptions. NOTE: Airframe installation designers should verify that the aircraft power systems satisfy the primary power interruption criteria of ARINC
Specification 413A.

## 2.4.2 Power Control Circuitry

There should be no master on/off power switching within the FMC system. Any user desiring on/off control should provide, through the medium of an external switching function installed in the airframe, a means of interrupting the primary AC power to the system.

## 2.4.3 The Common Ground

The wire connected to the FMC connector pin labelled "Chassis Ground" should be employed as the DC ground return to aircraft structure. It is not intended as a common return for circuits carrying heavy AC currents, and equipment manufacturers should design their equipment accordingly.

## 2.4.4 The Ac Common Cold

The wire connected to the FMC connector pin labelled "115 VAC Cold" will be grounded to the same structure that provides the DC chassis ground but at a separate ground stud. Airframe manufacturers are advised to keep AC ground wires as short as practicable in order to minimize noise pick-up and radiation.

## 2.5 Environmental Conditions

The FMC and CDU should meet the requirements of RTCA Document DO-160.

Attachment 5 of this Characteristic tabulates the relevant environmental categories.

## 2.5.1 Thermal Interface And Design 2.5.1.1 Fmc

The FMC should be designed to utilize, and the airframe installation should provide, cooling air in the manner described in Section 3.5 of ARINC Specification 600. The airflow rate provided to the FMC in the aircraft installation should be 44 Kg per hour and the pressure drop of the coolant airflow through the equipment should be 25 ± 5 mm of water at this rate. The unit should be designed to expend the pressure drop in a manner to maximize the cooling effect within the equipment. Adherence to the pressure drop standard is needed to allow interchangeability of equipment.

The FMC should be designed such that loss of cooling air flow does not produce immediate failure. Having made this statement, the airlines wish to remind airframe manufacturers that they may not interpret it as a release from the need to provide cooling air for the FMC as specified above.

## 2.5.1.2 Cdu

The internal power dissipation of the CDU should not exceed 92W.

The CDU cooling and thermal design should be in accordance with ARINC Specification 408A, Sections 2.3, 3.6 and 3.10.

These sections define case temperature limits, the equipment cooling method, the thermal appraisal procedure and expected high temperature exposure conditions which should be considered for the equipment design.

ARINC 408A defines the standard interface between the aircraft and indicators; however, the thermal interface described should also be applied to the CDU.

## 2.6 Weights

System manufacturers should take note of the guidance information on weights contained in ARINC Specification 600.

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards (Cont'D) 2.7 System Functions And Signal Characteristics

A complete list of the system functions and signal characteristics required to ensure the desired level of interchangeability is set forth in Sections 3.0 and 4.0.

## 2.8 Grounding And Bonding

The attention of equipment and airframe manufacturers is drawn to the guidance material in Section 3.2.4 of ARINC Specification 600 and Appendix 2 of ARINC Specification 404A on the subject of equipment and radio rack grounding and bonding.

A perennial problem for the airlines is the location and repair of airframe ground connections whose resistances have risen as the airframe aged. A high resistance ground usually manifests itself as a system problem that resists all usual approaches to rectification, and invariably consumes a wholly unreasonable amount of time and effort on the part of maintenance personnel to fix.

Airframe manufacturers are urged, therefore, to pay close attention to assuring the longevity of ground connections.

## 3.0 System Design Considerations 3.1 System Configurations

Three different configurations of the ARINC 702 Flight Management Computer System illustrated in Attachment 3 to this Characteristic are described in this section. The FMC
is expected to be capable of operating interchangeably in all three.

## 3.1.1 Single System Configuration

In this configuration, the FMC accepts inputs from one, two or three ARINC 704 IRS or ARINC 705 AHRS, one or two ARINC 743A GNSS Sensors, two each ARINC 706 Air Data System, ARINC 711 VOR, and ARINC 709 DME and one ARINC 710 ILS to compute the lateral and vertical navigation functions. Inputs of fuel quantity, fuel flow and engine and airplane configuration parameters and inputs from the thrust control computer combined with the air data inputs are used to compute the performance data and fuel management display or control outputs. Initial condition inputs may be inserted manually via the CDU or automatically from airplane sensor systems.

## 3.1.2 Single System/Dual Cdu Configuration

In this configuration, the interface is the same as for the single system, with the addition of a second CDU. Both CDUs will have the capability of requesting and displaying data independently, and simultaneously on a time shared basis. NOTE: The question of which CDU is in command, particularly when changing data related to the engaged mode or active leg is one which requires study.

Control authority may be delegated by means of a cockpit mounted switch or by software determination through keyboard action. Manufacturers are urged to review the thoughts of airlines and airframe manufacturers on this subject before a design decision is made. Most airlines will not want the switch, but for those that do, a discrete has been reserved for this function and is defined in Section 4.3.2.2 of this Characteristic.

## 3.1.3 Dual System Configuration

The basic interface for each FMC is the same in the dual configuration as in the single system configuration, except that there is two-way intersystem bus communication between the two FMCs.

This bus permits intersystem comparison for self-test and reasonableness test purposes and also allows retrieval of second system data following loss of a single input sensor. It also provides the means for loading data into both FMCs from entries through one CDU. This configuration should be considered basically as two separate systems, each relating its inputs and outputs to the No. 1 and No. 2 FMCs of the airplane, respectively. Section 4.4 of this document provides guidance concerning the design of the FMC intersystem communications interface.

The vertical and speed/thrust guidance commands will be limited to prevent the airframe and engine limits from being exceeded. The speed limits VMO and MMO will be supplied to the FMC from the Air Data System and the VMin limit from the TCC. The airplane altitude limitations will be stored in the FMC performance data base. The engine limit data will be resident in the TCC and this will be the master reference source for this data. Limit data may also be stored in the FMC for its computation.

It is expected that certain parameters relating to the airplane configuration will be received from another system, such as the TCC, rather than provide individual inputs to the FMC. These parameters are included in Attachment 4 to this Characteristic.

--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 3.2 Basic System Functions 3.2.1 Performance Management 3.2.1.1 General

The Flight Management Computer should have the capability to calculate parameters for display or control purposes, compute the flight profiles and provide the guidance outputs for airplane performance in all phases of flight, including climb, cruise, holding, and descent. These computations may be optimized based on such criteria as:
minimum trip fuel, minimum trip cost, minimum trip time, maximum rate of climb or descent, maximum angle of climb or descent and maximum holding endurance, either singly or in combination. The FMC may also provide data for turbulence penetration and engine-out conditions. These functions will be integrated with the flight planning function of the FMC (see Section 3.3.2 of this Characteristic).

All performance data computations may be modified according to the Cost Index function defined in Section 3.4.1.2.6 of this document.

## 3.2.1.2 Performance Data Base

The FMC should store in its internal memory, a data base which includes aerodynamic and propulsion performance characteristics for one or more airframe/engine combinations.

Provisions should also be included to enable modification of lift-drag characteristics, time and fuel flow, due to degradation during the lift of the airframe. If made, the changes should be annunciated to the crew members and other operational personnel. The pertinent data for a particular installation should be addressed by means of program pins reserved for this purpose as shown in Attachment 2 to this Characteristic.

## 3.2.1.3 Optimum Flight Path

The FMC should compute a flight path using as a baseline the planned lateral path and any established altitude requirements, together with the selected mode or modes of operation as referenced in Section
3.2.1.1
of this Characteristic. Guidance to this path will be implemented by means of a combination of lateral, vertical and speed/thrust commands.

## Commentary 3.0 System Design Considerations (Cont'D) 3.2.1.4 Performance Data Control And Display

The CDU should provide the means for selecting the particular submode of performance data operation required, i.e., maximum rate climb, economy cruise, etc. The CDU should also provide the means for manual entry of any data parameters which are required and are not available via the digital interfaces.

Possible initial data entries are defined in Section 3.4.1.2 of this Characteristic. The CDU should provide the means for selecting the required mode of operation. Performance parameters to aid the flight crew in flight planning, aircraft operation, and optimum flight profile control, will be displayed on the CDU.

These parameters may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:

Takeoff Data Altitude Intercept Distance Altitude Intercept Time Top of Descent Maximum Altitude Optimum Altitude Range Capability to Reserve Fuel Level Range Capability to Empty Tanks Endurance Time Fuel Remaining Over Destination Engine-Out performance Turbulent Air Performance Approach Speeds

## 3.2.2 Lateral Navigation And Guidance 3.2.2.1 Lateral Navigation

Position should be computed in terms of latitude and longitude for display on the CDU. Information will also be available in terms of bearing and distance to any designated fix for display on the CDU, and to the active waypoint for display on the CDU and flight instruments.

## 3.2.2.2 Lateral Guidance

Information related to aircraft position and velocity vector with respect to the desired lateral path should be developed for display on the CDU
and cockpit instrumentation, as well as for use by the flight control computer system.

Such information will include crosstrack deviation, track angle error and a roll angle steering command.

The desired path may be defined from a waypoint sequence or other procedure specified by the flight plan or by any lateral path computed from pilot entry at the CDU.

Means may be provided for lateral path modification, such as a select heading or course input.

## 3.2.3 Vertical Navigation And Guidance 3.2.3.1 Vertical Navigation

The primary signals for vertical navigation computation should be baro-corrected altitude, CAS/Mach, vertical velocity, and along track distance to the bisector. Other data such as flight path angle and vertical acceleration, may also be available.

## 3.2.3.2 Vertical Guidance

Deviation and steering commands with respect to the desired vertical profile should be developed for guidance and display purposes.

The system should also continuously compute the vertical profile (and, optionally, the vertical path angle) necessary to achieve the altitude required at the 'to' waypoint. NOTE: The waypoint altitude requirement applies at the lateral track bisector.

The vertical track deviation signals should be suitable for display on flight instruments.

A vertical steering command should be computed for use by the flight control computer system.

The vertical steering command parameter has not yet been selected, but is expected to be one of the following: vertical speed, vertical acceleration, pitch altitude.

NOTE: System designers must take into account the
integration required between lateral, vertical and performance functions in all phases of operation. This is particularly applicable when any changes made to the lateral or vertical path have effect on the performance computation required to achieve the required flight profile.

## 3.2.4 Thrust Axis Control

The FMC should generate thrust axis limit data and commands consistent with the lateral and vertical navigation and performance specifications of this Characteristic.

This information should include limit mode selection and N1/EPR commands for the TCC and CAS/Mach commands for the FCC and the TCC.

Integration of the vertical and thrust axes is specified in order to prevent excessive throttle activity.

## 3.2.5 4D Guidance (Growth Option)

All lateral, vertical, and speed/thrust guidance functions should be designed in such a manner that they can be integrated to provide growth to full 4D guidance and time control for all segments of the flight profile.

The 4D
guidance function should have the ability to compute and provide guidance to the optimum profile from enroute cruise to the runway, given a time requirement at a specified fix. The system should continuously assess its performance with respect to the various constraints of time, altitude or speed which may be imposed at points along the flight path, and compute and apply the required corrections to make good the 4D profile. A digital clock input to the FMC is reserved for use in computing 4D guidance.

--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 3.0 System Design Considerations (Cont'D) 3.2.5 4D Guidance (Growth Option) (Cont'D)

NOTE: The mechanization of the computer should be such that the system clock is capable of providing an accurate time base for all phases of speed controlled operation along the flight path. However, interruption of the system clock during power interruptions is permitted.

## 3.2.6 Electronic Flight Instrument System Management

The system should have the capability to assemble and format data required to support Electronic Flight Instrument (EFI) system use. NOTE: Interface standards for FMC/EFI operation may be found in Section 8 of this Characteristic.

## 3.2.7 Data Update Interface

The FMC data update port is expected to provide all data base updates to the FMC. These should include the use of the following methods of update, or a combination of them, according to the system configuration:

a.
Transfer of airplane and engine performance and
navigation data to the FMC for use in its computations. This may be implemented by bulk transfer of data for a flight or flight segment.
b.
Transfer of flight plan oriented data contained in a carry-on storage medium, via a cockpit located data read unit, to the FMC.
Provisions should also be made for receipt of flight plans by data link.

c.
Update of integral data storage in the FMC from a portable loader unit, telephone path, etc.
When external means are employed to update integral data storage in the FMC, it is essential that aircraft or engine performance data is protected from change during updating of the navigation data, and vice versa. See also Section 6.2 of this Characteristic.

## 3.2.8 Irs Initialization And Heading Set

The FMC should be capable of initializing up to three ARINC 704 Inertial Reference Systems when called upon to do so by flight crew action at the CDU. In response to this initialize command, the FMC should output on its general data buses a burst of not more than four or less than two initial position latitude/longitude pairs. This data should consist of BCD-encoded "set latitude" and "set longitude" words having the labels and data standards defined for these quantities in ARINC Specification 429. The FMC should also be capable of setting the IRS magnetic heading output to the value entered by the crew at the CDU. The FMC should respond to the set heading command by transmitting a burst of not more than four or less than two BCD-encoded "set heading" words. ARINC Specification 429 defines the applicable label and data standards.

Consult ARINC Specification 704, "Inertial Reference System", for further information on initialization and heading set.

## 3.2.9 Gnss Initialization

The FMC should be capable of initializing up to two ARINC 743A GNSS Sensors when called upon to do so by flight crew action at the CDU.

In response to this initialize command, the FMC should output on its general data buses, current time and date and a burst of not more than four or less than two initial position of a latitude/longitude pair. This data should consist of BNR encoded current "time" in UTC, and BCD encoded current "date", "set latitude" and "set longitude" words.

GNSS Sensors may be indirectly connected to the FMC through the IRS or ADIRS. The GNSS Sensor may also be directly connected to the CDU for initialization.

3.3 Operational Features and Technical Considerations 3.3.1 Performance Management Computation 3.3.1.1 General A primary function of the FMC system is to provide performance management throughout any specified segment of the flight regime, within the constraints of the air traffic control environment and according to the operational requirements of the operator.

This section, therefore, describes the functions regarded as basic to the system. However, this Characteristic neither recommends a specific implementation nor precludes variations on the basic concept. It is assumed that all performance-related calculations will take into account wind data, and will have the capability of being modified by a cost index factor determined by the operating economics of individual operators.

## 3.3.1.2 Take Off Function

This Characteristic does not specify any particular take off functions, nor does it preclude their incorporation into the FMC.

## 3.3.1.3 Altitude Intercept Distance And Time

The FMC should be able to compute an estimate of the ground distance and time to climb or descend to a selected altitude, according to the mode selected by the pilot. These parameters should also be computed on demand for any other altitude entered by the pilot.

## 3.3.1.4 Optimum Climb

The FMC should compute an optimum climb profile based on the climb mode selected by the pilot. 3.3.1.5 Optimum Cruise Altitude The FMC should compute an optimum cruise altitude based on the cruise mode selected by the pilot.

## 3.3.1.6 Maximum Range

The FMC should compute the range capability of the aircraft to reserve fuel levels and also to empty tanks.

COMMENTARY
No attempt is made in this Characteristic to define the meaning of "reserve fuel".

## 3.0 System Design Considerations (Cont'D) 3.3.1.7 Maximum Endurance

The FMC should compute the endurance capability of the aircraft to reserve fuel levels and to empty tanks, based on the selected holding speed and altitude.

## 3.3.1.8 Fuel Remaining Over Destination

When distance to the destination is known, either along the flight plan path or as entered as an estimate via the CDU, the system should compute the fuel remaining over the destination, taking into account the modes selected for each segment of the planned flight.

## 3.3.1.9 Top Of Descent

The system should compute the distance and time to go to a computed top of descent point, based on the selected mode of descent to reach an altitude at a specified waypoint in the flight plan.

## 3.3.1.10 Engine-Out Performance

The FMC should be able to compute aircraft performance for engine-out situations.

## 3.3.1.11 Turbulent Air Performance

This Characteristic does not specify any particular turbulent air performance functions nor does it preclude their incorporation into the FMC.

FMC designers planning such functions should first familiarize themselves with the modes of operation of the FCC gust alleviation feature specified in ARINC Characteristic 701.

## 3.3.2 Flight Planning

The system should allow the pilot to enter the flight plan by various means depending on current conditions and available stored data. The means should range from entry of individual definitive parameters via the keyboard to selection from storage of these parameters, of flight plan segments or of a complete flight plan.

NOTE: Program design and data organization should
ensure that pilot action is kept to a minimum in preparing the system for a normal air carrier operation.
If the FMC does not store all data internally, then it should, as a minimum, contain sufficient integral data storage capacity to store all data required for the active flight plan (including performance profiles) and one complete alternate flight plan. It should be possible, via the CDU, to manually enter or change data in this store.

NOTE: Discretion must be exercised during system
design in determining the philosophy involved in enabling any manually entered changes to the active leg or more of operation.
Provision should also be made to allow the pilot to assemble and verify an alternate or diversionary flight plan without affecting the active flight plan. This flight plan would then be ready for activation upon receipt of the required clearance.

## 3.3.3 Data Retrieval And Verification

The pilot should be able to call up any data from the flight plan or from bulk data storage at all times for inspection or verification, without interrupting or in any way affecting the guidance or display outputs of the system.

## 3.3.4 Supplemental Navigation Information

The FMC should be capable of providing position, distance, time and altitude information relative to a pilotspecified navigation situation.

Typical requests for information are as follows:
Time, distance and altitude abeam a selected navaid or waypoint. Bearing and distance to a specified navaid or waypoint. Latitude (longitude) of a flight plan intersection with a specified longitude (latitude).

System designers should take note that pilots will desire rapid access to this data in specific operational situations.

## 3.3.5 Slant Range Correction

DME slant range data should be automatically corrected for aircraft altitude and station elevation during enroute and terminal area operation.

The provision of redundant air data inputs to the FMC should ensure adequate integrity for the slant range correction function reference data. Complete loss of air data, however, should not cause loss of FMC capability not dependent upon it.

## 3.3.6 Automatic Station Selection And Tuning

The FMC system should provide the capability of automatically selecting VOR, DME and ILS channels in accordance with a stored program procedure, and of tuning the respective receivers. It should be capable of selecting one or more navaids according to available facilities in order to provide the optimum navigational accuracy. The FMC should also be capable of enabling the frequency scanning and frequency diversity modes of an appropriately equipped ARINC 709 DME, and utilizing the range data thus obtained. The pilot should be able to override the autoselection process by manual entry or selection of a navaid identifier at the CDU, or by external switching to manual control by the navaid tuner. One use of manual override is to be able to receive ATIS information broadcast via VOR ground stations.

## 3.0 System Design Considerations (Cont'D) 3.3.6 Automatic Station Selection And Tuning (Cont'D)

A discrete has been reserved for autotune master/slave control for a dual FMC installation and is defined in Section 4.3.2.3. NOTE: The airlines have advised DME manufacturers that they are generally dissatisfied with the DME ident provided within the framework of present DME System Standards. They would like to see more frequent ident transmissions, distance replies provided during ident characters and more information (such as station latitude, longitude and elevation) included in the ident signal. They have even suggested investigating the feasibility and economic sense of translating the Morse code ident received from the ground stations into ISO alphabet #5 characters for output on the DME's digital data output buses.

FMC manufacturers are advised to keep themselves informed on development in the DME ident field so that they can take advantage of them in their computer designs.

## 3.3.7 "Direct To" Function

--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The pilot should be able, at any time, to command a direct leg to any waypoint either in the flight plan or manually selected or entered at the CDU. The specified waypoint will thus replace the active waypoint for the current leg and the flight plan will be modified accordingly.

However, it should also be possible to return to guidance with respect to the original flight plan by simple action at the CDU.

System designers should take precautions to avoid sudden, large deviations in the vertical path guidance arising from the use of this function.

Also, the function should be implemented with turn anticipation to avoid "S" turns during course transitions.

## 3.3.8 Detection Of A Power Interrupt

The program should be designed such that, on detection of a power interrupt, the system should automatically store all flight plan data and all current navigation and performance data.

## 3.3.9 Self Test

The FMC should be designed to perform automatic self tests of its internal operation, and reasonableness tests on input data during normal operation.

The FMC will generate digital output buses which will include malfunction codes to indicate the FMC's assessment of its health, and the status of its interfaces. Means should be provided for initiating a maintenance test through an externally supplied discrete (see Section 4.3.2.5 of this Characteristic). This maintenance test will provide test values on the digital outputs with the appropriate status matrix code for the test condition as defined in ARINC Specification 429.

This test can also exercise internal monitoring and diagnostic routines and provide test formats on the CDU and on a multifunction display. The FMC may also have the capability, via a switch on the front of the FMC, for initiating a maintenance test for ground use only. If this switch is provided, an indicator lamp should also be mounted on the FMC front panel to show the result of the test. The CDU may include a pilot confidence test, initiated by a control on the CDU, which will provide a visual indication that the display and any status annunciators are operating correctly. This test should in no way affect the online performance, navigation and guidance computations or the FMC interfaces.

## 3.3.10 Immunity From Flight Path Perturbation

The navigation and guidance output signals from the FMC system should be derived in such a way that bearing noise, scallops, etc., as well as any perturbations generated within the FMC system itself, or within any of its sensors, are eliminated or reduced to negligibly small proportions. The integrated vertical and speed/thrust command outputs should also be derived in a manner to minimize flight path excursions due to speed control consistent with minimizing throttle activity.

## 3.3.11 Manual Override Inputs

When it is necessary to depart from instructions contained in the stored flight plan, the pilot should be able to enter override inputs at the AFS glare shield controller or the CDU. Section 3.4.1.8 of this document refers.

## 3.4 System Inputs 3.4.1 Management And Control (Pilot And Program Inputs)

The following sections describe the various system initialization, flight plan defining parameters, etc., that are required by the system prior to its utilization in various modes. Such entries may be made manually via the CDU, or automatically from an internal or external source under program control. NOTE: Standards applicable to source data will be found in ARINC Specification 424.

## 3.4.1.1 System Initialization

Following application of power to the FMC system, it should automatically perform an initialization, internal monitoring and test cycle, if appropriate.

Failure to complete the cycle successfully should cause appropriate annunciation on the CDU.

## 3.0 System Design Considerations (Cont'D) 3.4.1.2 Initial Data Inputs 3.4.1.2.1 Present Position

Present position will normally be entered into the system through the CDU in terms of latitude and longitude, with a resolution of 0.1 minute of arc. It may also be read in from bulk data storage referenced to the known physical location of the airplane such as at a gate.

## 3.4.1.2.2 Gross Weight

Airplane gross weight should be computed at all times for performance data functions. Initial gross weight may be entered manually through the CDU or obtained from the aircraft weight and balance system.

The required resolution of the computation is 100 pounds.

## 3.4.1.2.3 Zero Fuel Weight

Zero fuel weight may be entered through the CDU, with a resolution of 100 pounds. This parameter may be used, in conjunction with fuel weight calculated from fuel quantity, in calculating gross weight.

## 3.4.1.2.4 Outside Air Temperature

Outside air temperature prior to takeoff may be entered manually via the CDU or may be obtained from the air data system if aspirated TAT probes are available.

Required resolution is 1oC.

## 3.4.1.2.5 Airport Elevation

This may be entered manually at the CDU or read from bulk data storage, or the air data system. A resolution of 10 feet should be provided.

--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 3.4.1.2.6 Cost Index

Cost index as determined by the operator may be entered manually through the CDU. This should not require an entry prior to each flight.

The cost index may also be pre-stored.

## 3.4.1.2.7 Greenwich Mean Time

If required, this may be entered manually at the CDU, or may be obtained from a digital clock or data link input.

## 3.4.1.3 Waypoint Definition

The parameters required to define a waypoint may be entered into the system manually through the CDU or may be recalled from bulk data storage by entry or selection of the waypoint identifier. The definitive parameters shown in the following sections may be available for display or entry on the CDU on request by the pilot.

Waypoints should be defined by latitude/longitude or by reference fix/bearing/distance.

## 3.4.1.3.1 Waypoint Identifier

The waypoint identifier should be a unique alphanumeric designator.

The waypoint identifier should not exceed seven characters. A waypoint identifier may or may not be assigned to an impromptu waypoint.

## 3.4.1.3.2 Waypoint Latitude And Longitude

Waypoint latitude and longitude are the earth coordinates of the waypoint. The minimum resolution is 0.1 minute of arc over the ranges 0 to 90o North and South for latitude, and 0 to 180o East and West for longitude.

## 3.4.1.3.3 Waypoint Reference Fix

The reference fix used in bearing and distance definition of a waypoint should be the identifier of a navaid or another waypoint.

## 3.4.1.3.4 Waypoint Bearing From Station (Theta)

The bearing of the waypoint from the referenced navaid
(Theta) will have a minimum resolution of 0.1o over the range 0 to 359.9o.

## 3.4.1.3.5 Waypoint Distance From Station (Rho)

Waypoint-to-referenced navaid horizontal distance will have a resolution of 0.1 nautical miles over the range 0 to 200 nautical miles.

## 3.4.1.4 Navaid Definition

The parameters required to define a navaid may be entered into the system manually via the CDU but will normally be recalled from bulk data storage by entry of the navaid identifier.

The parameters listed below should be available for display or entry on the CDU.

## 3.4.1.4.1 Station Identifier

The four alpha/numeric character (max) identifier of the tuned navaid (or navaids).

## 3.4.1.4.2 Station Frequency

The five numeric characters of the active station frequency.

## 3.4.1.4.3 Station Elevation

Station elevation has a minimum resolution of 100 feet and a range of 0 to 15,000 feet.

To denote a station elevation below MSL, a minus sign should be provided for in this parameter.

## 3.4.1.4.4 Station Declination

The resolution for station declination should be 1.0o minimum over a range from 180o East to 180o West.

Station declination is the angular difference between true north and the zero degree radial of the navaid at the time the navaid was last site-checked. For ILS localizers, station declination is the angular difference between true north and magnetic north at the localizer antenna site at the time the magnetic bearing of the localizer course was established.

## 3.0 System Design Considerations (Cont'D)

a. Selected Heading

## 3.4.1.4.5 Station Latitude And Longitude

b. Selected Indicated Airspeed c. Selected Mach Number
Station earth coordinates in latitude and longitude should have a minimum resolution of 0.1 minute of arc over a range of 0 to 90o North and South for latitude and 0 to 180o East and West for longitude.

d. Selected Course (No. 1 and No. 2) e. Selected Altitude

## 3.4.1.5 Cross Track Offset Distance

f. Selected Vertical Speed g. Selected Bank Angle Limit
Cross track offset distance is a distance, entered at the CDU which defines the position of an impromptu track parallel to the original track.

A selected offset should apply to all segments until the pilot either selects another value or cancels the use of the offset capability by any means, including selection of a direct leg to a fix. Initiation of an offset should be restricted to the currently active leg.

Inputs made at the glare shield controller should override the data with which the FMC is working when they are made, but should not result in the stored flight plan being amended.

Inputs made at the CDU should similarly override in-use data but may also cause stored flight plan revisions if appropriate.

## 3.4.2 Sensor Inputs

One nautical mile increments of offset distance to a minimum of 20 nautical miles left and right of the original track should be provided.

Sensor inputs to the FMC system are set forth in Section 4.2.1 of this Characteristic and listed in Attachment 4.

## Commentary 3.4.3 Sensor Warning Inputs

The equipment manufacturer is advised to carefully evaluate the conditions under which crosstrack offset is permitted.

Sensor warning inputs will be implemented as specified in ARINC Specification 429, Section 2.1, in that validity status is contained within the digital word format.

## 3.4.1.6 Along Track Offset Distance 3.5 System Outputs

FMC system outputs are set forth in Section 4.2.2 of this Characteristic and listed in Attachment 4.

Along track offset distance is a distance, entered at the CDU, at which the pilot wishes to reach or depart the reference altitude either prior to or beyond the selected waypoint. The resolution desired is one nautical mile and the range ± 99 nautical miles relative to the waypoint (where "+" is beyond and "-" is prior to the waypoint).

## 3.5.1 System Integrity Monitoring And Failure Warning Outputs Commentary

Discrete outputs in this category are described in Section 4.3.2 of this Characteristic.

All other such alerts and warnings are included in the transmitted digital word as specified in ARINC Specification 429, Section 2.1.

Equipment manufacturers are advised carefully to evaluate the conditions under which along track offset is permitted and also the method of displaying the offset.

## 3.5.2 System Control Signals 3.4.1.7 Assigned Time At A Fix

FMC control inputs and outputs are described in Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of this Characteristic.

This parameter may be manually entered at the CDU and defines a pilot or ATC assigned time at a specified fix along the flight path.

It should be specified in hours, minutes, and optionally in tenths of minutes.

## 3.6 Growth Features 3.4.1.8 Manual Override Inputs

The following is a list of parameters which may be manually entered at the AFS glare shield controller or the CDU.

This list shows typical inputs which may be expected for normal operation but is not intended to preclude others.

The following list of "growth features" has been prepared to assist manufacturers in planning for the possible inclusion of additional features that airlines might desire at some time in the future. Note that the list does not set out to be all-inclusive or to preclude other features. Also, it is possible that one or more of these features may find immediate application in special circumstances.

Later, industry standardization of their use may prove desirable.

## 3.0 System Design Considerations (Cont'D)

In order to make this information as useful as possible at this time, pins have been reserved on the FMC service connectors for these features.

a. Omega Interface b. MLS Interface c. Spares (2)

## 3.7 Sensor Failures

In all cases of sensor input failure, suitable sensor failure warning and degraded status annunciation should be provided.

## 3.8 Fmc Equipment Accuracy

The airlines desire that the airborne FMC equipment contribute as little error as possible to the overall FMC system error. FAA Advisory Circular No. 90-45A is one source of accuracy information.

Equipment designers should be aware, however, that the airlines' accuracy needs may be more demanding than this.

## 3.9 System Status Alert

Any change of status that results in reduced system operational capability or availability should be annunciated to the pilot on, or adjacent to, primary flight instruments. Additional data of use in diagnosing the reason for the change will be of value if it can be displayed on the CDU. Means should be provided to cancel the alert.

The system status alert is designed only to attract the attention of the pilot to the fact that something has happened either within the system or to one of the sensors that has degraded or will degrade the operational viability of the system.

It will be necessary for the pilot to look for further signs to determine the actual problem and whether or not he can correct it.

## 4.0 Standard Signal Characteristics 4.1 General Accuracy And Operating Ranges

The purpose of this section is to set forth the detailed characteristics of the electrical signal standards and interfaces of the Flight Management Computer System. Although the actual applications of these standard signal characteristics were set forth in other sections of this Characteristic, this section tabulates the detailed signal characteristics in order to facilitate their use by the reader. The accuracies specified herein should apply under all combinations of the environmental conditions referenced in Section
2.5
of this Characteristic.

Accuracy measurements should be made on the assumption that the inputs to the FMC are perfect. Accuracies are specified on the basis of 95% of observations and do not include typical reading inaccuracies of the pilot's instruments.

## 4.1.1 Resolution

For the purposes of this Characteristic, the resolution or the function threshold sensitivity, is considered to be the maximum cyclic input change (double amplitude) that can occur without detectable change in the output.

The specific figures set forth for threshold sensitivity of each function should be made without vibration of any kind being applied and it should be checked approaching the reading with signals from either direction.

## 4.1.2 Standardized Signals

As explained in Section 2, all of the electrical inputs and outputs from the system will be in the form of a standard digital format or a standard switch contact.

Standards must be established exactly to assure interchangeability of interwiring, and therefore, the necessary interchangeability of equipment. Certain basic standards will be established herein, applicable to all outputs. Unless otherwise specified in the detailed material of Section 4.2 and 4.3, signals should conform to the standards set forth in the subparagraphs herein.

## 4.1.2.1 Digital Data Standards

All digital data is to be transmitted and received using the standard digital data format as defined in Attachment 2, "Data Standards", of ARINC Specification 429.

## 4.1.2.2 Standard "Applied Voltage"

The standard "applied voltage" is a nominal +27.5 VDC signal. This voltage is considered "to be applied" when the actual voltage under the specified load conditions exceeds 18.5 VDC (+36 VDC maximum) and is considered to "not be applied" when the potential on this lead drops to 3.5 VDC or less, when loaded with 50,000 ohms or more.

## 4.1.2.3 "Standard Ground" Signal

The "Standard Ground" signal may be generated by either a solid state or mechanical type switch. In either case, a
"contact potential" or residual voltage of 3.5 volts or less represents the "grounded" condition.

## 4.1.2.4 "Standard Open" Signal

The "standard open" signal may be generated by a solid state switch or an open circuit.

In either case, the circuitry should be designed such that the impedance is greater than 100,000 ohms when measured at 31 volts DC.

## 4.2 Data Signals

Data signaling for inputs and outputs to the FMC should be in the low speed ARINC 429 formats, except where otherwise specified in the following sections.

The data signals are called out in Attachment
4
to this Characteristic.

## 4.2.1 Fmc Digital Data Inputs

The following sections describe the FMC's digital data input ports. It is unlikely that all of these inputs will be employed in a given installation and those not needed in a particular aircraft type need not be implemented in the computer.

However, hardware, software and computer cycle time capacity should be available to allow all of them to be brought into use if needed.

Providing for FMC interchangeability across different aircraft types in a users fleet may generate the need for the computer to offer more input capacity than needed on any one of those types.

## 4.2.1.1 Vor Input Ports

Two input ports are provided to receive data from dual ARINC 711 VOR Receivers.

## 4.2.1.2 Dme Input Ports

## 4.2.1.3 Ils Input Port

One input port will receive data from an ARINC 710 ILS Receiver.

## 4.2.1.4 Air Data Input Ports

Two input ports will receive data from dual ARINC 706 Air Data Systems.

## 4.2.1.5 Irs/Ahrs Input Ports

Three input ports will receive data from ARINC 704 IRS or ARINC 705 AHRS. These are high speed ARINC 429 inputs.

## 4.0 Standard Signal Characteristics (Cont'D) 4.2.1.6 Flight Control System Input Ports

One input port will receive data from an ARINC 701 Flight Control System glare shield controller.

## 4.2.1.7 Control Display Unit Input Ports

Two input ports are provided to receive data from one or two CDUs. One of these ports is designated the "on-side" port and the other is designated the "off-side" port (see Attachment 2 to this document).

## 4.2.1.8 Data Update Input Ports

Two input ports are dedicated to receive data to update bulk storage integral to the FMC. One of these ports is intended for an interface with a loading device of the type described in ARINC Report 603. The characteristics of the digital data transmission on this bus are defined to the extent necessary in that document.

With certain minor exceptions, this definition follows the rules for file data transfer set forth in ARINC Specification 429. The second input port is dedicated to an input from ACARS air-ground-air data link avionics. The electrical characteristics of this interface should conform to ARINC Specification 429. The data rate, word format and coding standards are defined in ARINC Characteristic 724 (ACARS). Excerpts from that document are reproduced in Attachment 8 for reference.

## 4.2.1.9 Intersystem Data Input Port

One input port provides the intersystem comparison data received from a second FMC.

As an alternative to ARINC 429, a faster intersystem data bus may be necessary.

Also refer to sections
4.2.2.1 and 4.4.

## 4.2.1.10 Propulsion/Configuration Data Input Ports

Six input ports are provided for engine and fuel flow and quantity parameters and data received from the Thrust Control Computer (TCC).

--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
NOTE: It is intended that four of these ports should be assigned for receiving individual engine and fuel flow data from up to four engines or fuel systems.

The remaining two ports would normally receive other data such as thrust limit, fuel quantity and TCC data.

## 4.2.1.11 Electronic Flight Instrument System Input Ports

One input port is provided for data from an Electronic Flight Instrument system. Connector pins are reserved for an input port for data from a second EFI system.

## 4.2.1.12 Digital Clock Input

One input port is provided for data from a digital clock. The clock input may be provided from a GNSS source.

## 4.2.1.13 Reserved Ports For Growth Inputs

Four input ports are reserved for inputs from the following systems: (i) Omega, (ii) MLS, and (iii) Spares (2).

## 4.2.1.14 Gnss Input Ports

Two input ports should receive data from an ARINC 743A GNSS Sensor.

These may be high or low speed ARINC 429 inputs. The ARINC 743A GNSS Sensor is capable of providing ARINC 429 data in high or low speed format.

Some aircraft manufacturers have assigned the GNSS input ports to pins different to those specified in Attachment 2.

## 4.2.2 Fmc Digital Data Outputs

Nine separate, buffered digital data output ports are provided to drive the CDUs and other subsystems requiring FMC system data. These are: (1) Intersystem, (ii) General Data Output (2), (iii) EFI (2), (iv) CDU Output (2), (v) Data Loader, and (vi) ACARS.

The characteristics of the digital data bus(es) carrying data to the CDU(s) are not constrained by this specification, although it is recommended that choices be made which permit the use of ARINC 429, and do not result in a need to make special EMI provisions in the aircraft.

## 4.2.2.1 Fmc Intersystem Output

The FMC should provide a output bus which can be used for intersystem communication from one FMC to another. The characteristics of this bus are constrained by this Characteristic only to the extent that its electrical, logic and timing elements conform to ARINC Specification 429. This is intended to minimize the need for special EMI provisions on the aircraft. Section 4.4 of this document provides guidance on intersystem communications.

It may be necessary to exchange data at higher data rates than possible on an ARINC 429 data bus. In these cases, an alternative data bus may be used.

Any alternative data bus should meet the same EMI requirements of ARINC 429.

## 4.2.2.2 General Data Output #1

This port provides output data from the FMC to Flight Instruments, to radio receivers or frequency management unit for tuning, to the Thrust Control Computer System, Flight Control Computer System and other users. It may also provide initialization data to the IRS.

This bus should be output at the low speed rate defined in ARINC Specification 429. NOTE: The amount of data to be carried on this bus may necessitate the use of high speed operation or a reduction of parameter refresh rates.

## 4.2.2.3 General Data Output #2

This port provides a second independent, buffered output of the data appearing on General Data Output #1 defined in Section 4.2.2.2 above. In a single FMC installation, it provides data for a second set of flight instruments,

## 4.0 Standard Signal Characteristics (Cont'D) 4.2.2.3 General Data Output #2 (Cont'D) 4.3 Control Signals

FCCS and tuning outputs. This bus should operate at the low speed rate defined in ARINC Specification 429.

FMC control signal inputs and outputs will be as specified in ARINC Specification 429, except where otherwise specified in the following section.

## 4.2.2.4 Instrumentation Data Output 4.3.1 Digital Control Inputs

Two ports are dedicated to supplying data for the Electronic Flight Instrument systems. These buses should operate at the high data rate defined in ARINC
Specification 429.

Control inputs to the FMC system should be implemented through the digital input ports specified in Section 4.2.1 of this Characteristic and will be in the format specified in ARINC 429, Attachment 2, Table 4.

NOTE: Such inputs may include FMC Mode Control Inputs from the AFS glare shield controller.

## 4.3.2 Discrete Inputs And Outputs

The specialized design of the FMC/EFI interface (see Chapter 8 of this document for details) makes these outputs unsuitable for supplying other displays such as digital electromechanical instruments. The general data outputs should be used for these purposes.

## 4.3.2.1 Specifically Assigned Fmc Discrete Inputs 4.2.2.5 Cdu Output Port "A" 4.3.2.1.1 Off-Side Cdu Enable

This port provides the means for the FMC to supply data for display, etc. to the primary CDU for the system.

## 4.2.2.6 Cdu Output Port "B"

This input discrete is provided for use if necessary to enable data entry to the FMC from the off-side CDU (the non-"prime" CDU) in a dual CDU configuration. An open circuit condition indicates the off-side CDU input to the FMC is enabled.

This port provides the means for the FMC to supply data to a second CDU, if installed.

## 4.3.2.1.2 Autotune Master/Slave Discrete 4.2.2.7 Data Loader Output

This port provides output data to the data loader, if installed.

## 4.2.2.8 Data Link Output

This input discrete is provided for use, where necessary, in determining which FMC in a dual system configuration has control of navaid autoselection.

An open circuit condition indicates that the FMC to which it is applied is in control.

## 4.3.2.1.3 Oleo Strut Switch

One low speed output port is provided for an interface with the downlink portion of the ACARS air-ground-air data link.

## 4.2.3 Cdu Digital Data Inputs

A "standard ground" input will be supplied to the FMC when the airplane oleo strut switch indicates an "on ground" condition.

## 4.3.2.1.4 Maintenance Test Discrete

The CDU should provide two digital data input ports. These input ports should be connected to the associated FMC output buses defined in Section 4.2.2.5 of this Characteristic. One of these ports should be designated the "A" port and the other designated the "B" port (see Attachment 2 to this document).

The FMC should accept an input discrete for initiating a maintenance test. A "standard ground" condition of this discrete constitutes a test command.

## 4.2.4 Cdu Digital Data Outputs 4.3.2.1.5 Manual/Auto Discretes

The CDU should provide an output bus similar to that described in Section 4.2.2 of this Characteristic, which will communicate with the FMC.

## 4.2.5 Fdsu Digital Data Input (Option)

Two input discretes are provided to determine the states of the captain and first officer Manual/Auto tuning switches. A "standard ground" indicates the selection of manual tune.

Section deleted by Supplement 2.

## 4.3.2.1.6 Mag/True Input Discrete No. 1 4.2.6 Fdsu Digital Data Output (Option)

Section deleted by Supplement 2.

This input discrete is provided to the FMC to indicate whether the navigation outputs should be referenced to magnetic or true north.

A "standard ground" condition indicates the selection of the true north reference.

## 4.0 Standard Signal Characteristics (Cont'D) 4.3.2.1.7 Source/Destination Identifier 4.3.3 Digital Control Outputs

Two input discretes are provided to enable the FMC to recognize/encode the SDI code specified in ARINC Specification 429 (see Attachment 2 to this document).

Control outputs to the CDU and other systems are to be implemented in the digital format specified in ARINC 429, Attachment 2, Table 4.

## 4.3.2.1.8 Navigation Data Base Update Enable 4.3.4 Fmc "Data Loader Connected" Function

This discrete input is supplied by an external data loader when updated information for the FMC's navigation data base is being delivered.

A "standard ground" indicates this condition.

Connection of an external data loader to the FMC will result in a short circuit appearing between pins MP9J and MP9K of the computer's service connector.

This information may be employed in the FMC in any way the designer deems appropriate.

## 4.3.2.1.9 Operating Program Update Enable 4.4 Fmc/Fmc Intersystem Communications

This discrete input is supplied by an external data loader when an updated FMC operating program is being delivered. A "standard ground" indicates this condition.

## 4.3.2.1.10 Performance Data Base Update Enable

As noted in Section 4.2.2.1 describing FMC Intersystem Output, FMC/FMC intersystem communications are not defined in this document. The formats and data content should be optimized by the system implementer to support system synchronization, including, but not limited to, the following:
This discrete input is supplied by an external data loader when updated information for the FMC's performance data base is being delivered.

A "standard ground"
indicates this condition.

Navigation Cross Check - used to monitor independent navigation calculation and improve the integrity of the navigation solution.

## 4.3.2.2 Reserved Fmc Discrete Inputs For Future Specific Assignments

Data Entry Transfer - used to ensure that data entries and selections are reflected in all FMCs.

Three inputs should be reserved for future assignment to specific discrete functions.

Radio Tuning Coordination - used to ensure that each FMC tunes a different set of radio sensors (if possible) to ensure navigation independence.

## 4.3.2.3 Reserved Fmc Discrete Inputs For Application- Unique Functions

Status Information - used to synchronize mode of operation such as phase of flight, active flight plan leg, navigation status and other events. Sensor Data - used to transfer data from some inputs, cross check discretes, confirm sensor faults, etc.

Twenty-three inputs should be reserved for discretes to control unique functions defined by the FMC software. These functions may be standardized among certain aircraft types (e.g., derivatives) of one manufacturer. Their standardization across different manufacturers' aircraft types, however, is unlikely.

## 4.5 Fmc/Acars Interface 4.3.2.4 Fmc Discrete Outputs 4.3.2.4.1 Cdu Message Alert Discrete

The FMC interface with ACARS data link equipment should function as described in ARINC Specification 619, "ACARS Protocols for Avionic End Systems" and Attachment 8A of this Characteristic.

The FMC should provide a "standard ground" output discrete for activating a "CDU message alert" annunciator when it is necessary to draw the flight crew's attention to a message displayed on the CDU.

## 4.3.2.5 Cdu Discretes 4.3.2.5.1 Cdu Active Input Identification Discrete

A discrete input to the CDU should be provided to enable it to determine which FMC data input port to activate. A "standard open" should indicate that it should activate the port connected to the FMC for which it is the primary CDU.

## 4.3.2.5.2 Cdu Primary/Secondary Status Input Discrete

An input discrete to the CDU should be provided to define the CDU as primary or secondary.

An open circuit condition signifies primary status.

## 5.0 Control Display Unit (Cdu) Design 5.1 General 5.6 Mode And Function Controls

The type of mode or function control employed (rotary knobs, push-buttons, reconfigurable keyboards, etc.) is not specified by this Characteristic.

The CDU should contain all the electronic circuitry, etc., required to display all specified input/output parameters, and should provide all necessary controls for complete operation of the FMC System, other than those referred to in Section 4.3.1 of this Characteristic.

NOTE:
The FMC system described by this Characteristic is expected to be part of an avionics system which is considerably more integrated than on current airplanes.

Hence, in choosing a mode control medium, designers should take into account the active and passive roles of the CDU during system cross-fill or cross-control operation, bulk data update, and mode control from other systems, such as the FCCS controller.

## 5.7 Cdu Interface

The CDU is interfaced with the FMC via the inputs and the outputs defined in Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 of this Characteristic, respectively.

There are two optional interface configurations for the CDU:

a.
One CDU dedicated to one FMC.
The CDU display should provide sufficient data display space to provide efficient, yet uncluttered, display of all data required for the mode or function selected. This should take into account such things as required performance parameters for a multiengine transport, flight progress data pages, etc. An object of the design should be to reduce to a minimum the pilot workload in searching through various pages for the required data, while striking a balance with the readability of the data on each page. System designers should provide some form of annunciation on the CDU to indicate when the data page selected for display does not relate to the active leg or engaged mode.

b.
Two CDUs controlled by one FMC.

## 5.2 Form Factor

The FMC may have a discrete input as defined in Section 4.3.2.2 to allow for external selection of a master CDU.

The CDU should be configured as a Dzus-mounted panel as shown in the outline control drawing in Attachment 1B to this document.

## 5.8 Cdu Confidence Test 5.3 Cooling

The CDU may have a test push-button or other means of control which will initiate a pilot confidence test of the CDU display, push-button lights, and status indicators.

The thermal design of the CDU should be in accordance with Sections 2.3.3.6 and 3.10 of ARINC Specification 408A. Unwanted heat generated in the equipment should be conducted to the outer surface of the case, from where it may be removed by convection and radiation (see Section 2.5.1.2 of this document).

## 5.4 Panel Illumination

The Control Display Unit should be of the integrally lighted type designed to operate from the 5 volt panel light dimmer bus. In addition, the CDU should accept a lamp test discrete input from the master bright/dim/test system on the aircraft.

A long-term goal of the airlines is to have all pushbutton, display and panel lighting intensities controlled from a central dimmer.

--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 5.5 Keyboard

The CDU keyboard should have alpha-numeric capability.

During overall system design, manufacturers should investigate methods of reducing crew workload to the minimum consistent with operational needs.

## 6.0 Data Base Storage Considerations 6.1 Performance Data

The airplane performance and engine data should be stored such that it is protected from any change during updating of the navigation data.

Certain of the performance data parameters, as determined by the particular airframe manufacturer and system manufacturer and primarily used for initialization purposes should be accessible for modification at the CDU. The remainder of the stored performance data should be inaccessible for update from the CDU, unless specific precautions are included to ensure that modification to the data can only be performed during ground or bench maintenance action. It should be possible to store some parameters with variations for different airplane or engine types.

These should be differentiated by program pin combinations. The pins reserved for this function are shown in Attachment 2 to this Characteristic.

NOTE:
Should the system designer elect to include, in a single software package, performance data and computation for several aircraft and engine types, even involving different airframe manufacturers, he should take into account the logistic and workload burden which may be imposed when testing the system during maintenance at airline or airframe manufacturer level. He should also be aware of the possible proprietary nature of the performance data which may be included.

## 6.1.1 Performance Data Update

It is not expected that, once installed, performance data will need updating very frequently.

In addition to that data accessible for change via the CDU, means must be provided via ground support equipment for update of all performance data.

However, it is not necessary for all stored performance data to be accessible for verification on the CDU.

## 6.2 Navigation Data

The navigation data base storage capacity should be sufficient to store all navigation data required to support the needs of an air carrier operator.

It should be accessible for update without removing any LRUs from the airplane.

It is imperative that delays in display of data following recall, etc. are reduced to a minimum. Efficient data stacking and consequent reduction in track searching time will help this.

The use of integral data base storage will further assist this and may also reduce the cost of the installed system. In view of the fact that several different technologies now exist to permit design of rapid access storage of sufficient capacity to handle all FMC system data base storage requirements integral with the computer, system manufacturers are urged to investigate such a design. In order to reduce the airline maintenance costs for update of the navigation data, consideration should
--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
be given during system design to provide a separate section of data storage for "tailored" airline data, such as company routes, etc. These are not expected to change as frequently as the normal update cycle and thus may be suitable for maintenance by the airline. It is anticipated that, by this method, all data subject to cyclical update will be
"standard"
published navigation data, thus providing means to further reduce the airline maintenance cost. NOTE:
If this feature is implemented, system designers must provide means for verification of the correct effect of changes made to the tailored data. As an example, if a change is made to a company route, it must be verified that entering the route identifier will result in the assembly of data which is valid and which defines a continuous flight path.

## 7.0 Provisions For Automatic Test Equipment 7.1 General

To enable Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) to be used in the bench maintenance of the ARINC
702
Flight Management Computer, those internal circuit functions not available at the FMC service connector and considered by equipment manufacturers to be needed for automatic test purposes should be brought to pins on an auxiliary connector of a type selected by the equipment manufacturer for this purpose.

This connector may be fitted with only that number of contacts as there are functions to be brought to it, and should be provided with a protective cover suitable to protect these pins from damage, contamination, etc., while the unit is installed in the aircraft. The manufacturer should observe ARINC Specification 600 standards for unit projections, etc., when choosing the location for this auxiliary connector.

## 7.2 Unit Identification

Six pins on the ATE connector insert should be reserved for the implementation of a "resistance coding" scheme for unit identification by the ATE, in which a 1% tolerance resistor is connected from each pin to a common ground in a "star" formation. Values selected should correspond to the standard 10% increments in resistance in order to prevent ambiguities resulting from tolerance build-up and aging.

The power handling capability of each resistor need not exceed 0.1 watt.

## 7.2.1 Pin Allocation

Two pins should be allocated to each of the following functions and one pin to the "star formation common" (i.e., DC chassis ground).

a.
Manufacturer Identification (resistor values to be registered with the AEEC staff when selected)
b.
Part No. or Type No. of the Equipment
c.
Modification Status of the Equipment
IMPORTANT NOTE:
Resistor codes for manufacturer identification will be recorded by the AEEC staff in order to prevent duplication. Such registration, however, should not be confused with assignment. It is the responsibility of each manufacturer to select a code and inform the AEEC staff of his choice.

Code assignments for equipment part number and modification status are entirely the province of the manufacturer and do not require registration with the AEEC staff.

## 7.2.2 Use Of Atlas Language

Equipment manufacturers should note that the airlines desire to have FMC test procedures intended for execution by automatic test equipment written in the ATLAS language described in ARINC
Specification
616,

## 8.0 Electronic Flight Instrument Interface 8.1 Introduction

The navigation data base stored in the ARINC 702 Flight Management Computer may, together with computed guidance data, be used to support the operation of a map display on an electronic horizontal situation indicator or other electronic display in the cockpit.

This section of this Characteristic describes interface standards which will enable any manufacturer's FMC to be used with any manufacturer's electronic display.

The term Electronic Flight Instrument (EFI) will be used to describe such displays generically.

## 8.2 Fmc Outputs To Efi

Two high speed ARINC 429 data output ports are provided on the FMC for instrumentation supply. All of the map background and position updating (dynamic) data for two EFIs will be supplied from both of these ports. In an installation comprising one FMC and two EFIs, the FMC's #1 Instrumentation Output should be connected to the Captain's EFI, and its #2 Instrumentation output to the First Officer's EFI. A possible interconnection scheme in an installation comprising two FMCs and two EFIs is to connect the #1 output of FMC #1 and the #2 output of FMC #2 to the Captain's EFI and the #1 output of the FMC #2 to the #2 output of FMC #1 to the First Officer's EFI.

The foregoing data output arrangements permit one FMC to supply independently organized data to each of two EFIs.

While the word formats of the individual data elements crossing the interface are not map scale dependent, the total number of data words needed to construct the map does vary with the map scale selected.

The FMC can thus accommodate the generation of maps on both sides of the cockpit even when the Captain and the First Officer have selected different scales.

## 8.3 Fmc Inputs From Efi

The FMC provides two low speed ARINC 429 data input ports through which map mode, scale and symbol option selections are transferred from the EFIs to the FMC.

## 8.4 Efi Design Features

The following EFI design features impact the design of the FMC/EFI interface.

## 8.4.1 Map

The EFI will generate a dynamic map positioned relative to the aircraft. The map may be oriented with respect to aircraft track or heading.

## 8.4.2 Plan

The EFI may also generate a north-oriented static map positioned relative to reference points selected at the FMC Control Display Unit (CDU). This may be used by the flight crew to verify the correct insertion of flight plan waypoints and other data.

## 8.4.3 Map Scales

EFI map scales will be a compatible subset of the ARINC 708 Weather Radar, which has selectable ranges, in fivemile increments, from 10 to 320 nautical miles of lookahead.

## 8.4.4 Map Projection

The EFI will transform earth coordinate data received from the FMC into flat plane coordinates for the map display. The accuracy of this transformation will be such that the EFI can be used as a primary instrument for guiding the aircraft along great circle and circular transition flight paths, and provide accurate registration of planar weather radar data on the map display. The map projection method chosen is expected to permit worldwide EFI usage without latitude restrictions. The EFI will also ensure that vector lines and conics which cross display editing boundaries are correctly terminated to ensure a continuous and accurate presentation on the display.

The EFI will translate the map background to account for aircraft motion between map background data block transmissions based on aircraft position and angular data received from the FMC and other systems.

## 8.4.5 Option Selection

The EFI will provide for symbology option selections, including weather radar data overlay on the map. These will allow the flight crew to declutter the map by selectively removing different categories of data, e.g., Navaids, Airfields, Geographic Reference Points, Waypoint Definition Data, etc..

## 8.4.6 Symbol Repertoire

Each category of data shipped from the FMC for display on the EFI will call for a distinctive symbol on the display. A list of potential data categories includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following:

Primary Flight Plan Path Secondary Flight Plan Path Altitude Intercepts Time Schedules Waypoints Waypoint Data (altitude, speed, time) Origin and Destination Airports Special Reference Points Runway Data Marker Beacons Tuned Navaids Navaids,
including
VORTAC,
VOR,
DME/TACAN (high altitude and low altitude) VOR Radials Airports Geographic Reference Points ILS Data MLS Data Non-Directional Beacons (NDB) Navigation Data

## 8.0 Electronic Flight Instrument Interface (Cont'D) 8.4.6 Symbol Repertoire (Cont'D)

The data available for display in a particular installation will depend on the navigation data base content of the FMC. The above data categories fall into the following general symbology types, each of which requires different data parameters for definition via the FMC/EFI interface.

Vectors (straight lines) Conics (circular arc lines) Upright Symbols Rotated Symbols Dynamic Symbols Alpha/Numeric Data Readouts

## 8.4.7 Efi Data Conditioning

The EFI will perform any input data filtering needed to produce a smoothly changing map display, and will condition data used to update readouts on the display.

## 8.5 Fmc Design Features

The following FMC design features impact the design of the FMC/EFI interface.

## 8.5.1 Navigation Data Base

The navigation data base stored in the FMC will be derived from ARINC 424 data, but will be customized by each FMC manufacturer to be compatible with his computer and memory architectures. However, the data base will include standard navigation data types, including VORTAC, VOR, DME/TACAN, airfields, runways, and geographic reference points (GRPs) such as intersections, named waypoints, etc., which can be presented on a map display.

The data base may also contain standard, government-published sequences of waypoints such as airways, SIDS, STARS, etc., as well as tailored waypoint sequences (company routes).

## 8.5.2 Flight Plans

As part of its guidance function, the FMC will have flight plans assembled in its guidance buffers by pilot data entry and selection through the CDU.

Such flight plans will define paths in the sky in two, three and ultimately four dimensions. Accurate representation of aircraft position with respect to the flight plan path is essential when the EFI is used as the primary instrument by which the flight crew controls the aircraft laterally and vertically with respect to a three-dimensional path, and along that path to make good assigned times at waypoints. Flight plan paths can be presented on the EFI as sequences of lines and conics representing great circle paths between waypoints and curved transitions between path legs. Path legs consisting of DME arcs can also be displayed.

The FMC generates the necessary data to define four-dimensional flight plans in its guidance buffers. The guidance algorithms in the FMC calculate the position, speed and time differences between the aircraft state vector and the flight plan, and hence generate the guidance commands to the automatic flight control system (including the auto-throttle) to make good the flight plan.

The guidance data can be used to define the vector lines and conics needed to represent the flight plan path and other guidance symbology on the EFI.

## 8.5.3 Map Display Edit Areas

The FMC should, to the extent of the limitations imposed by the size of the data block (see Section 8.6.2), supply map background data for an area large enough to preclude the appearance of blank screen between transmissions. The EFI will limit the data displayed to that needed for the viewing window.

This limit operation will include vector clipping to ensure the correct display of vector data and associated text.

## 8.6 Interface Design

The design of the FMC/EFI interface is described in the following paragraphs.

## 8.6.1 General

Map background data and position updating and other dynamic data should be interleaved on the FMC
instrumentation output buses.

The FMC should specify the data type to be displayed and the associated positioning and rotation data.

The EFI will control symbology color, size, brightness, blinking and related parameters, and transform map position data received from the FMC into screen coordinates. The FMC should extract the information necessary for the map background from its navigation data base and flight plan buffers. Position data transmitted to the EFI should be in latitude and longitude coordinates. The types of data transmitted should respond to mode symbology options and display range selected by the flight crew on the EFI control panel. The order of the data on the bus should be in general accordance with the priority in which it is to be displayed. The FMC/EFI dynamic data interface should be designed to permit updating of the map background data positions between background data block transmissions without the need for a hand-shaking relationship between the FMC and the EFI symbol generator. The FMC/EFI interface design and map background and dynamic data bus implementation should be such that the EFI can provide a valid map display if map background data transmissions are lost or invalid for periods of up to 10 seconds duration. The display mechanization should accommodate a worldwide map projection. This may result in the need to provide additional and/or special software to project map data in the vicinity of the earth's poles.

## 8.6.2 Map Data Updating

The FMC should supply map data to the EFI in alternating 64-word blocks of background and dynamic data until a complete map background data block
(512
words maximum) has been transmitted (see Attachment 6, Figure 2).

After completion of the map background data transmission, the dynamic data should continue to be

## 8.0 Electronic Flight Instrument Interface (Cont'D)

Typically, the high map scales are used in cruise and the low map scales are used for terminal area operations. Therefore, only high altitude chart data need be transferred across the interface for the larger map scales.

## 8.6.5 Mode Change Response

updated at a rate of 20 times per second (nominal) until a new map background data block is to be transmitted. Map background data should be updated and transmitted once every three seconds (nominal), except that when a mode, scale or option change is made on the EFI, the FMC should update and transmit new map background data within one second (maximum).

The FMC should respond to a mode, scale or symbology option selection change received from the EFI such that the desired data transmission occurs within one second maximum.

Dynamic data update at a rate greater than 16 times per second is needed to avoid undesirable visual effects on the display.

## Commentary 8.6.3 Background Data Prioritizing

Airlines desire the overall (FMC and EFI) response time of a practical system to be less than two seconds.

## 8.6.6 Map Translation And Rotation Data

To ensure that writing time or other internal data processing limitations in the EFI do not result in most wanted map background data not appearing on the display, the FMC should prioritize the information as follows. The EFI should truncate the data, if necessary, in the reverse order of this prioritization.

The FMC should provide the following data to the EFI to support map projection and rotation functions:

## Map Projection

Map Background Data
1. Map reference latitude (plan mode only) 2. Map reference longitude (plan mode only) 3. Map mode/scale
Map Position Data
1. Aircraft present latitude 2. Aircraft present longitude

## Map Rotation

Map Position Data
1. Track (true) 2. Track (magnetic)

1. Flight Plan Data
a. Primary Flight Plan b. Secondary Flight Plan c. Flight Plan Changes d. Waypoints e. Waypoint Data f. Offsets g. Altitude Intercepts h. Flight Plan Events
2. Selected Reference Points 3. Runway Data (may be edited out in some flight
phases but should not disappear because of truncation of the data stream)
4. Origin and Destination Airports 5. Tuned Navaids 6. Navigation Data (may be dynamic rather than
background)
7. Non Flight Plan Navaids 8. General Reference Points (position ordered)
9. Procedures
10. Terrain Data

## 8.6.7 Resolution 8.6.4 Background Data Editing

The resolution of data used to position symbology on the display should be such that a change of binary state of the least significant bit of a position data word produces no visible step movement on the display.

## 8.6.8 Interface Data Errors

An example of the background data editing process is shown in Attachment 6, Figure 1. The FMC should, as a minimum, transmit data for the displayed area plus the area which could appear on the display as a result of aircraft translation and rotation between map background data updates. There is a 1000 to 1 increase in these areas between the expected minimum and maximum map scales of 10 to 320 nautical miles.

The mechanization of the FMC/EFI interface should minimize the visual effects on the map display of occasional data errors.

## 8.6.9 Fmc-To-Efi Data Transfer Protocol

Because the density of data needed for terminal operations could saturate the display at the higher map scales and the volume of data within the edit area overload the EFI symbol generator buffers, the FMC should determine the amount of data it supplies to the EFI from an analysis of the map scale and mode selection information it receives from the EFI.

Because the FMC/EFI interface is dedicated to the transfer of data between the FMC
and the EFI
symbol generator(s), not all of the formatting and protocol standards of ARINC Specification 429, "Mark 33 Digital Information Transfer System (DITS)", have been adopted

for it.

The following Sections indicate where these departures from ARINC Specification 429 have been made.

Although not mentioned hereafter, the electrical and timing standards set forth in Specification 429 for high speed (100 k bits/second) operation and the standard "broadcast" protocol do apply.

## 8.6.9.1 Data Block Format

The first word of each 64-word data block should be a "Start of Transmission" word containing octal code 301 in its label field (bits 1 through 8) if the block contains map background data and octal code 303 in this field if the block contains dynamic data. Bits 9 through 13 of each map background data block "Start of Transmission" word should contain a binary number indicating the position of the block in the sequence of such blocks into which the transmission is divided. In addition, the first such "Start of Transmission" word of a transmission should contain in bits 20 through 29 a binary count of the total number of usable background data words to be contained in the transmission.

(This count should not include "Start of Transmission", "End of Transmission", or fill-in words.) This field should contain binary zeros in all subsequent background data block "Start of Transmission" words of the transmission.

All background data block "Start of Transmission" words should contain binary zeros in bits 14 through 19, while bits 30 and 31 should contain the "control word" code defined in Section 8.6.9.2 and bit 32 should be set to render word parity odd. The "Start of Transmission" word of each dynamic data block should contain binary zeros in bits 9 through 29 and the "control word" code defined in Section 8.6.9.2 in bits 30 and 31.

Bit 32 should be set to render word parity odd.

--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The last word of each 66-word map background data block should be an
"End of Transmission"
word containing octal code 302 in its label field. Bits 9 through
29 of this word should contain binary zeros. Bits 30 and 31 should contain the "control word" code defined in Section 8.6.9.2 and bit 32 should be set to render word parity odd. The 62 usable data words of each map background data block should contain the positional, character and control information used by the EFI to construct the map background. The label codes and word formats defined in Attachment 6 to this document should be used. Bits 30 and 31 should be encoded to indicate word type per Section 8.6.9.2 and bit 32 should be set to render word parity odd. If the final block of the transmission contains less than 62 useful words, it should be padded to this length with fill-in words (binary zeros in bit positions 1 through
32)
and terminated with the
"End of Transmission" word at position 64. Dynamic data blocks should be interleaved with map background data blocks as described in Section 8.6.2. Dynamic data blocks should contain data words labelled and formatted per ARINC Specification 429.

The interleaving on the same bus of blocks of data labelled per ARINC 429 standards and blocks of data labelled per other standards requires the EFI to be capable of changing from one set of standards to the other at appropriate instants during the data transmissions. The EFI is expected to make use of the two "Start of Transmission" words and the background data block "End of Transmission" word in deciding when to make these changes.

## 8.6.9.2 Data Type Word Formats

The general word format defined in ARINC Specification 429 should be employed. Words transmitted by the FMC for which standards are defined in ARINC Specification 429 should employ those standards and their ARINC 429 labels.

Formats of symbol word groups, vector word groups, map reference word groups and dynamic symbol words should differ from ARINC 429 standards in that the label field should be used to encode data type and the sign/status matrix to designate multiple word records within a data type group as follows:

BIT
WORD DESCRIPTION
31
30
0
1
First word of data type group
0
0
Intermediate positional, char-

Attachment 6 to this document sets forth the formats of these non-ARINC 429 words.

## 8.6.10 Efi-To-Fmc Data Transfer

The data sent from the EFI to the FMC will consist of the map mode, scale and symbol option selections made by the flight crew at the EFI control panel. These selections will be encoded into one or more ARINC 429 discrete words, as defined in that specification and in ARINC Characteristic 725, "Electronic Instrument System".

## Attachment 2 (Cont'D) Notes Applicable To The Standard Interwiring

1
Standard Interwiring
The standard interwiring shown in this Attachment is for a single FMC installation comprised of one FMC and one CDU. For the sake of completeness, however, wiring is also shown to enable the FMC to operate with a second CDU (see Section 5.7 of this document), and for a cross-talk bus between this FMC and another one.

2
Shield Grounds
Digital data bus shield grounds should be grounded to aircraft structure at both ends and on both sides of each production break.

3
Off-Side CDU Enable Discrete
Per Section 4.3.2.2 of this document, this discrete tells the FMC which CDU has control of data entry in dual CDU installations in which either may perform this function.

When an open circuit is sensed by the FMC, its "prime" CDU has control. When the wire is connected to ground by means of a cockpit-located switch, or equivalent, the "other" CDU has control.

## 4 Fmc Master/Slave And Manual Auto Tune Discrete

This discrete is used in dual FMC installations to tell one of them that it has control of the navaid autotune function and that the other does not. The use of the function is controlled by the Manual/Auto discretes, as described in Section 4.3.2.6.

## 5 Source/Destination Identifier (Sdi) Encoding

Pins MP1K, MP3K and MP5K are assigned for encoding the location of the FMC in the aircraft (i.e., "system number") per Section 2.1.4 of ARINC Specification 429. If the SDI function is used, the following encoding scheme should be employed, the pins designated being either left open circuit or connected, on the aircraft-mounted half of the connector, to pin MP5K. The wiring of these pins should cause bit numbers 9 and 10 of each digital word transmitted by the FMC to take on the binary states defined in ARINC Specification 429. When the SDI function is not used, both pins MP1K and MP3K should be left open circuit such that bit numbers 9 and 10 are always binary "zeros".

| FMC No.        | Connector Pin   |
|----------------|-----------------|
| MP1K           | MP3K            |
| Not Applicable | Open            |
| 1              | Open            |
| 2              | To MP5K         |
| 3              | To MP5K         |

The foregoing describes the SDI
function performed by a data source. ARINC Specification 429 also discusses the data identification function to be performed by sinks whose "system numbers" are encoded in this way. In summary, the FMC should recognize and accept data words in which bit numbers 9 and 10 are either both "zeros" or form the code defined by pins MP1K and MP3K. All other data may be discarded.

## 6 Wire Sizes

The "I-R" values define the maximum current (I) in amperes and effective resistance (R) in ohms for which the installation and equipment should be designed.

It is anticipated that installation designers will use these figures, together with the lengths of the cable runs in a given airframe, to calculate the gauge of each wire in the installation. Where their calculations reveal the possibility of using higher gauge numbers than #22 AWG, they are asked to stop and consider whether the mechanical strength of this wire is adequate for the installation before deciding to use it.

The airlines report recent sad experiences with such wire, and although they are, of course, interested in the weight saving its use affords, they will quickly point out that these savings are rapidly nullified by maintenance costs if frequent breakages occur.

NOTE:
Wire for which a "D" symbol is shown in place of a current rating may be used for any function ranging from "Dry Circuits" (hence "D") to 5 ampere applications.

Both installation and equipment designers should give due regard to special cases wherein parallel or series-parallel connected circuits may result in higher currents or voltage drop
(effective resistance) than in simple circuits.

Unless otherwise noted, the current limit set forth applies to all elements of parallel or series-parallel circuits.

## Attachment 2 (Cont'D) Notes Applicable To The Standard Interwiring 7 Data Loader Interface

It is expected that the airframe manufacturers will provide, at some convenient location on the aircraft, a connection point for an external data loader of the type described in ARINC Report 603.

This Attachment shows wiring from the FMC to a connector type MS24264-18B-31S or MS24265- 18B-31S
for this purpose, with which the MS24266R-18B-31P connector at the aircraft end of the data loader's pendant cable will mate. Note that the Attachment does not show the 115 VAC and aircraft ground wires to this connector needed in a practical installation.

The reader is referred to ARINC Report 603 for information on these needs. Note also that the three FMC data load enable discrete functions are connected to the data loader's discrete outputs as follows:

1.
Navigation Data Base Update Enable to Data Loader Discrete Output #1.
2.
Operating Program Update Enable to Data Loader Discrete Output #2.
3.
Performance Data Base Update Enable to Data Loader Discrete Output #4 is not used.
For successful
"automatic mode"
data loader operation with the FMC, therefore, users must ensure that navigation data base update information appears on track #1 of the data tape, operating program update information on track #2 of the tape and performance data base update information on track #3.

Track #4 should not be used.

In the
"control mode" of data loader operation, in which the FMC assumes management of the loading process, these restrictions on tape track use do not apply but other considerations do.

See ARINC
Report 603 for full details.

## Attachment 8A Fmc/Acars Information Exchange Section 1 Text-Imbedded Error Check For Ground Computer/Airborne Computer Messages End-To-End Error Check

The FMC should provide the facility to perform an "end-to-end" error check on messages received and transmitted via ACARS. This is accomplished by designating the four characters preceding the suffix character (ETX) of the final block of the message as the "text-imbedded" error control field. This field will be used to verify successful transfer of each message to which the end-to-end error check applies. The allowable character set on which the end-to-end check is performed is defined in Attachment 10 to this Characteristic, entitled "ISO Alphabet No. 5 Subset for Ground Computer/Airborne Computer Message Exchange Via ACARS". In addition, bit patterns of the characters appended to the message by the error checking procedure must be encoded per this ISO subset. The pad bit for each 7-bit character in the message is set to a binary zero prior to encoding or decoding of the error check. The error check to be used in the verification of end-to-end message integrity is a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), described in Section 3 of this attachment, "Character-oriented CRC Calculation". The CRC generator polynomial is the same CCITT polynomial introduced into ARINC Specification 429 by Supplement 12.

The end-to-end error check provides an assurance that a message composed on the ground has been correctly reconstructed by the FMC (and vice versa for messages originated by the FMC). It supplements the message integrity assurance provisions which are employed at various levels during the transfer of data from originator (e.g., the host airline computer) to the FMC. The normal message integrity checks which, on-board the aircraft, include BCS, word count check, parity check, etc. should continue to be exercised in accordance with the appropriate ACARS Characteristic (ARINC 597, 724, or 724B) and this Characteristic.

## Encoding The Crc At The Message Source

The procedure specifying the application of the CRC by the source on the message text is as follows. (See Section 3 of this attachment, "Character-oriented CRC Calculation", for a detailed description and example of this procedure.)

a.
The CRC is to be applied to the message text beginning with the first character of the IMI, and ending with the last text character of the message.
b.
When ordering bits in the message to be CRC'd, the most significant bit (MSB) of the message is the least significant bit of the first character of the IMI.
The least significant bit (LSB) of the message is the most
significant bit of the last text character of the message (excluding the ETX character).
c.
After the source has been determined the CRC code from the 16-bit "remainder", four hexadecimal characters representing these 4-bit bytes will be encoded as ISO #5 characters for the CRC field.
The hexadecimal
characters are determined by assigning 4 bits at a time in the order specified by the table in Section 2 of this attachment. The resulting four characters are placed at the end of the original message text to be transmitted, in the same transmission order as message text characters; i.e., the least significant bit of each character is transmitted first.
d.
For character-oriented file transfer protocols, an ETX character follows the last character of the CRC code.

## Decoding The Crc At The Message Sink

a.
Upon the receipt of a message which is error-free in accordance with the link level protocol, the sink will begin verification of the received message.
b.
In order to verify the value of the CRC, the sink should first ensure each 7-bit ISO #5 character of the message text has the associated pad bit set to a binary zero, such that each character can be assumed to be 8 bits in length. The sink should also ensure any intermediate "end-of-block" characters have been deleted from the message text.

## Attachment 8A (Cont'D) Fmc/Acars Information Exchange Section 1 (Cont'D) Text-Imbedded Error Check For Ground Computer/Airborne Computer Messages

The sink then operates on the four characters representing the CRC code to translate them back to the original 16- bit binary value calculated by the source; i.e., the reverse of the procedure specified in section (iii) above is performed.

Finally, the sink verifies the integrity of the message text by applying either of the verification procedures specified for the receiving system in the following section on "Character-Oriented CRC Calculation".

c.
If the CRC confirms message integrity, the sink should accept the message. If message integrity is not confirmed (the CRC fails), the sink should discard the message. Further action will be defined by the user and will depend on the application of the message.
This CRC scheme is only compatible with uncorrupted messages from the host airline computer to the FMC and vice versa. No intermediate systems may be allowed to modify the message text portion of the transmission by character substitution or insertion (such as line feeds, carriage returns, etc.).

## Attachment 8A (Cont'D) Fmc/Acars Information Exchange Section 3 Character-Oriented Crc Calculation Generation Of The Crc Code

This CRC calculation method is based on the premise that a message may be represented as the coefficients of a polynomial, G(x), having k terms, where k is the number of bits in the message.

The notation used to describe the CRC is based on the property of cyclic codes that a code vector such as
1000000100001 can be represented by a polynomial G(x) = x12 + x5 + 1. The elements of a k element code vector are thus the coefficients of a polynomial of order k - 1. In this application, these coefficients can have the value 0 or 1, and all polynomial operations are performed modulo 2.

To create the polynomial G(x) representing the message, the terms are ordered as follows: The coefficient of the most significant bit of G(x), (xk-1, is the least significant bit of the first character of the message. The coefficient of the least significant bit of G(x), (x0), is the most significant bit of the last character of the message. For example, if the message, G(x), is 'FPR', the first character is 'F' which is represented by the code 46 hex or 01000110 binary. The rightmost bit of 'F', 0 in this example, is therefore the most significant bit of G(x). Similarly, the last character, 'R', is represented by the code 52 hex or 01010010 and the least significant bit of G(x) is the leftmost bit of 'R', which is 0. The message FPR has 24 bits so k has a value of 24. The actual transmission order for the message is most significant bit (MSB) to least significant bit (LSB) as follows: (Note: Slashes (/) are used for octet separation only.)

$$\begin{array}{c c c}{{}}&{{\mathrm{Transmission~Order}}}&{{==>}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\mathrm{LSB}}}&{{}}&{{\mathrm{MSB}}}\\ {{}}&{{010100100100101000000/01000110}}\\ {{}}&{{\mathrm{'R'}}}&{{\mathrm{'P'}}}&{{\mathrm{'F'}}}\end{array}$$
In order to illustrate the mathematical procedure, the entire message is transposed for representation as a bit stream with the most significant bit (MSB) at the left and the least significant bit (LSB) at the right to yield:

| MSB                        |
|----------------------------|
| 01100010/00001010/01001010 |

Expressing the bit stream for this example as a polynomial, G(x), yields:
To generate the CRC code the generator polynomial is defined as: The CRC code is the one's complement of the remainder obtained from the modulo 2 division of: where Q(x) is the quotient and R(x) is the remainder.

## Attachment 8A (Cont'D) Fmc/Acars Information Exchange Section 3 (Cont'D) Character-Oriented Crc Calculation

Note:
The addition of X16G(x) and xk(x15 + x14 +x13 + ... x2 + x + 1) is modulo 2 and is equivalent to inverting the 16 most significant bits of G(x) and appending a bit string of 16 zeroes to the lower order end of G(x). If the 16-bit binary CRC code were appended to the original G(x) the resulting message, M(x), would be of length n, where n = k + 16. This is equivalent to the following operation:
When the 16-bit binary CRC is transformed into four ISO #5 characters (8 bits each), the final message to be transmitted, M*(x) is now of length N* = k + 32, and so Using the above example with 'FPR' as G(x), the CRC calculation gives a remainder of 00111111/11010010, where the left-hand 0 is the most significant bit and the right-hand 0 is the least significant bit.

(See Appendix 7 of ARINC
Specification 429, "Mathematical Example of CRC Encoding/Decoding" for a detailed example of the mathematical operations involved to arrive at this remainder.) The CRC code is the one's complement of the remainder, or 11000000/00101100. This CRC code is converted to a four character (ISO #5) code and appended to the end of the message over which the CRC code was calculated by applying steps 1 through 7 in Section 2 as follows:
--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

1.
Because the message was transposed in this illustration to generate the CRC code, the resultant CRC code
must also be transposed from left to right. Transposing 11000000/00101101 yields 10110100/00000011. This operation returns the CRC code to the same transmission order as the original message, with the most significant bit to the right and the least significant bit to the left.
2-3. Separating the 16-bit transposed value into 4-bit segments and expressing it in hex yields B403. 4-7. The four characters representing this value are coded as ISO #5 characters and appended to the message in
the order: MS to LS character. For this example the order is 3, 0 4, B.
The complete message plus CRC code for this example (read left to right) is:

## Fpr304B

The transmission order of this message is right to left, as:

## B403Rpf ==> Verification (Decoding) Of The Crc Code

At the receiving system, the four characters representing the CRC code are converted back into the original binary CRC code; i.e., the steps in Section 2 are performed in reverse order. At this point, verification (decoding) of the CRC is accomplished by either of the following methods: (1) After conversion back to the binary CRC code, the 16-bit binary CRC is appended to the message G(x) (in the same transmission order as the message) resulting in the message M(x), of length n, where n = k + 16 and

## Attachment 8A (Cont'D) Fmc/Acars Information Exchange Section 3 (Cont'D) Character-Oriented Crc Calculation

M(x) is multiplied by X16, added to the product xn(x15 + x14 +x13 + ... + x2 + x + 1), and divided by P(x) as follows
(where n = k + 16):
--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
This CRC procedure is designed to create a constant remainder for error free messages. If the transmission of the serial incoming bits plus CRC code (i.e., M(x)) is error free, then the remainder, Rr(x) is always:

| MSB               |
|-------------------|
| 00011101/00001111 |

(coefficients of x15 through x0, respectively).

(2) An alternate procedure for the receiving system, which will ensure the same data integrity, is to recompute the CRC code on the received message less the four CRC characters (using the same generator polynomial). The generated CRC code is then compared with the one received. The following steps are performed:
The received message, M*(x), is stripped of the four CRC characters, leaving only G(x).

The four characters representing the CRC code are converted back into the original binary 16-bit CRC code; that is, the steps in Section 2 are performed in reverse order. A binary CRC code is generated for G(x) using the same encoding method described for the message source. The generated binary CRC code is compared with the 16-bit binary CRC code stripped from the message and if they are identical, the message is assumed to be free of errors and exactly represents the message transmitted by the source.

## Attachment 8B Table-Based Formats For Fmc Imi/Iei Messages Section 1 Definition Of Terms Used In Data Link Messages

All uplink and downlink messages are formatted using a consistent set of syntax rules. The following definitions are used to describe parts of a message:

## Imi (Imbedded Message Identifier)

The IMI is a three alphanumeric character identifier. An IMI is placed at the beginning of the text to identify the relative message content. Only one IMI is used per message. The same IMI can be used for both uplinks and downlinks. Examples of IMIs are: FPN, PER, LDI, POS, REJ, etc.

## Iei (Imbedded Element Identifier)

The IEI is a two alpha character identifier that is used to group one or more elements. Examples of IEIs are: FN, RP, RM, CG, RW, etc.

## Element

An element is the smallest omissible part of an uplink or downlink message. It can be a single parameter, or a number of parameters. A single parameter element is defined as either fixed length or variable length with a defined maximum number of characters. Directional elements are single parameter elements that must contain either a single alpha character preceding one or more numeric characters, or one or more numeric characters followed by an alpha character. The alpha character indicates the direction (or qualifier) that is associated with the numeric value. Directional elements can be fixed or variable length. A multi-parameter element is used to group similar or related information. Multi-parameter elements can be fixed length, variable length or a combination of fixed and variable length. However, only one field within a multi-parameter element can be of variable length. There is no delimiter between single data elements within a multi-parameter element. Example:
OAT: P23
The single parameter element, OAT is plus 23 degrees.

V1VRV2: 131139147
The multi-parameter element is composed of V1 = 131 knots VR = 139 knots V2 = 147 knots

## Parameter

A parameter is an element or part of an element that has the following attributes:

1.
Type - Variable or Fixed
2.
Element Type -
Alpha (A - Z)
Alphanumeric (A - Z, 0 - 9, dash) Numeric (0 - 9)
3.
Character Length - Number of Characters
4.
Scaling Factor - Identifies the multiplication factor
5.
Units - Identifies the parameter units

## List

A list is a repeatable group of elements within a data link message. Each list contains one or more elements.

## Message Format Example

The following is an example of a Predicted Wind Information uplink message (the IMI for this message is PWI and the IEI is DD, for Descent Wind Data). Example: PWI/DD350270060.310270045.140260040:060,,,M04,1013

| Descent ISA Deviation   | -4 Degrees C      |
| QNH                     | 1013 Hectopascals |

## Flight Plan Definition

Each independent part of a flight plan is called a flight plan element (FPE). Each FPE is preceded by a Flight Plan Element Identifier (FPEI) which identifies the group of data that follows. These FPEs are used in combination to fully define the FMC flight plan in both the uplinks and downlinks. The flight plan definition is used to create a flight plan (either active or inactive) or modify an existing flight plan.

## Fpei (Flight Plan Element Identifier)

FPEIs are used to identify special elements, which are used in the (Flight Plan) Route IEIs of RP, RI, RM, and RA. Examples of Flight Plan Element Identifiers are :H:, :V:, ".", "..", "DA", etc.

## Fpe (Flight Plan Element)

A Flight Plan Element (FPE) is a special type of variable or fixed length element (or group of elements) used in RP, RI, RM, or RA IEIs. Examples of FPEs (and their corresponding FPEIs) are shown below:

| FPE                | FPEI   | Example            |
|--------------------|--------|--------------------|
| Departure Airport  | :DA:   | KJFX               |
| Arrival Airport    | :AA:   | KLAX               |
| Company Route      | :CR:   | JFKLAX07           |
| Waypoint Spd/Alt   | :V:    | N47W125,250,AT1250 |
| Direct to Waypoint | ..     | BLAKO              |
| Departure Runway   | :R:    | 04O                |
| Airway VIA         | .      | J36                |
| Arrival Procedure  | :A:    | DOWNE              |
| Arrival Transition | .      | HECTR              |
| Arrival Runway     | (XXX)  | (04O)              |

The last four items in the table illustrate the dual role of the special character "." which is context dependent. It can be used as a "VIA" indicator for an airway, or as a transition indicator if it is preceded by an ":A:" (or an ":AP:" or a :D:), as in DOWNE.HECTR(04O).

Example:
F P N / R M..N I A . J 4 8 . B E N N Y , N 3 3 2 4 0 W 1 1 6 2 5 0 : A T : N I A - M0400,280,AT1400:A:BENE3.NIA:AP:ILS32R.EDD

then an along track offset definition of NIA -40.0 with an associated speed restriction of 280 at 14,000 feet
-
followed by a standard arrival BENE3 with a NIA transition
-
and the standard approach of ILS32R with an EDD transition.

## Attachment 8B (Cont'D) Table-Based Formats For Fmc Imi/Iei Messages Section 1 (Cont'D) Uplink And Downlink Delimiters

When constructing an uplink or a downlink message, delimiters are used to consistently identify the information in the message. The delimiters supersede each other in the order given (i.e., '/' has the highest priority).

## Iei Delimiter '/' Solidus, Character 2/15

This character precedes each Imbedded Element Identifier which identifies the beginning of predefined group of elements. This delimiter is always followed by two alpha characters.

## List Terminator ':' Colon, Character 3/10

The colon is an end of list control character. This character is used to terminate a repetitive list structure.

## List Entry Terminator '.' Period, Character 3/11

The period is a list entry terminator. This character is used to terminate each list entry (group of elements). List entries are groups of parameters or elements that are repeated one or more times.

## Element Terminator ',' Comma, Character 2/12

Commas are used to separate elements (unless they have been separated by or terminated with another control character; i.e., '/', ':', '.' or another FPEI in the case of RI, RM, RP, or RAs). Missing elements are denoted by consecutive commas.

## Request Messages

To allow the receiving system to recognize the difference between a message that is transmitting data and a message that is requesting data, a special IMI has been reserved for requests. This IMI ('REQ' is the default) precedes anyrequest message. The data that follows this IMI depends on whether the message is an uplink or a downlink.

## Uplink Request A Downlink

The request IMI is followed by an element which contains the IMI of the "reply". This is optionally followed by a comma (element terminator), which is optionally followed by a list of elements that define the IEIs to be included in the downlink (all separated by a list entry terminator). An IMI, or IEIs following the REQ are considered elements in the uplink.

## Example: Reqprg,Dt.Fn

This example is a request from the ground for the current destination and current flight number which results in a downlink of:
PRG/DTKSEA/FNSFOSEA001

## Downlink Requesting An Uplink

In a downlink request, the request IMI is followed by the requested information.

## Example: Reqfpn/Cokseaksfo02

This example is a request from the FMC for a flight plan, the request includes the entered company route as a data element.

# Supplement 1 To Arinc Characteristic 702 Flight Management Computer System

Published: January 29, 1980
Prepared by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee Adopted by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee: August 29, 1979
--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## A. Purpose Of This Document

This Supplement adds an FMC/map display interface specification to Characteristic 702 and re-designates the applications of certain FMC digital data input and output ports to match the selected map display system architecture. The Supplement also adds guidance material to the Characteristic on computer crosstalk in dual FMC installations and on FMC data base loading. ARINC STAFF NOTE:
Because AEEC adopted this Supplement before Characteristic 702 had been published, its incorporation into the first printing of the Characteristic proved possible.

Thus, no separate distribution of the Supplement will be made.

The changes to the Characteristic made by the Supplement are identified by "¢-1" indicators in the margins of the pages on which they appear.

## B. Changes To Characteristic 702 Introduced By This Supplement

This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Characteristic introduced by this Supplement. Each change or addition is identified by the title and section number currently employed in the Characteristic, or by the title and section number that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.

In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change, and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Characteristic is reproduced for reference.

## 2.2.2 Control Display Unit (Cdu)

CDU connector type changed from MS3112E18-32PX to M83723/72R1831N.

## 3.1.3 Dual System Configuration

Sentence added to refer reader to Section 4.4 for guidance concerning the design of the intersystem bus interface.

## 3.2.4 Thrust Axis Control

Limit mode selection, N1/EPR and CAS/Mach commands specified as thrust axis control commands to the FMC and the TCC.

## Original Text Follows:

The FMC should generate thrust axis limit data and commands consistent with the lateral and vertical navigation and performance specifications of this Characteristic. This information should include a thrust axis command, limit mode selection for the TCC and command for the N1/EPR indicators.

The thrust axis command parameter has not yet been selected. The choice of this parameter should take into consideration the need for a fuel-efficient cruise mode.

This mode may require integration of the vertical and thrust axes in order to prevent excessive throttle activity. AEEC Letter 78-099/SAI-74 refers.

## 3.6 Growth Features

Data link interface and digital clock input removed from list of growth features as the consequence of the elevation of the status of these interfaces to standard FMC features in this Supplement.

## Original Text Follows: 1.3 Brief Description Of The System

The ARINC 702 Flight Management Computer System comprises two units, one a rack-mounted computer unit and the other a cockpit-located control and display unit. The system may also employ an optional Flight Data Storage Unit (FDSU). However, as noted below, a system design goal should be to provide storage for all data required by the system in the FMC itself.

## 1.4.3 Flight Data Storage Unit (Optional)

Section deleted.

## Original Text Follows: 1.4.3 Flight Data Storage Unit (Optional)

A supplementary Flight Data Storage Unit (FDSU) may be used if it is not possible to store all of the required data base within the Flight Management Computer.

The storage medium should be chosen and the storage unit designed such that efficient data stacking and rapid data transfer is possible in order to avoid increased cockpit workload due to delays in displayed data.

As noted in Sections 1.3 and 1.4.1 above, the system designer's goal should be to provide all necessary storage in the FMC.

## 2.2.3 Optional Flight Data Storage Unit (Fdsu)

Section deleted. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS:

## 2.2.3 Optional Flight Data Storage Unit (Fdsu)

The FDSU, if used, should comply with the standards established in ARINC Specification 600 for the 4 MCU form factor, and be provided with a Size 1 shell ARINC 600 series connector with pin assignments as set forth in Attachment 2. An outline drawing showing the location of the connector is shown in Attachment 1C. Index pin code 06 should be used. NOTE: The fact that the FDSU described here refers to a rack mounted unit does not preclude the use of a cockpit mounted data reader unit for insertion of flight plan data, etc.

Section 3.2.7 of this Characteristic addresses such implementations.

## 2.4.1 Primary Power Input

References to FDSU in paragraphs 1 and 2 deleted. Text added to specify needed FMCU breaker capability to handle FMCU and data loader power.

## Original Text Follows:

(Paragraphs 1 and 2 only)

## 2.4.1 Primary Power Input

The FMCU, the CDU and the FDSU (if used) should be designed to use 115 volt 400 Hz single phase power from a system designed for Category (A) utilization equipment per ARINC Specification 413A. The primary power inputs to the FMCU, the CDU and the FDSU (if used) will each be protected by a circuit breaker of the size shown in Attachment 2 to this Characteristic.

## 2.5 Environmental Conditions 4.2 5 Fdsu Digital Data Input (Option)

Reference to flight data storage units deleted.

## Original Text Follows:

The FDSU, if installed as part of the system, should have a digital data input port connected to the FMCU output bus defined in paragraph 4.2.2 of this Characteristic.

## 2.5 Environmental Conditions 4.2.6 Fdsu Digital Data Output (Option)

Section deleted.

## Original Text Follows:

The FMCU, CDU and any flight data storage units should meet the requirements of RTCA Document DO-160. Attachment 5 to this Characteristic tabulates the relevant environmental categories.

## 4.2.6 Fdsu Digital Data Output (Option) 4.2.1.8 Data Update Input Ports

First paragraph of this Section amended to define the ARINC 603 data loader as the source of FMCU bulk storage updates.

The FDSU, if installed as part of the FMC system, should have a digital data output bus similar to that defined in paragraph
4.2.2
of this Characteristic, which will communicate with the FMCU.

## Original Text Follows: 4.3.2 Discrete Inputs And Outputs 4.2.1.8 Data Update Input Ports

Section (made up of sub-sections 4.3.2.1 through 4.3.2.12) revised completely.

## Original Text Follows: 4.3.2 Discrete Inputs And Outputs 4.3.2.1 Program Pins

Two input ports are dedicated to receive data to update bulk storage integral to the FMCU. One of these ports is intended for an interface with a loading device designed specifically for use with that FMCU. The characteristics of the digital data us carrying this data are not constrained by this specification, although it is recommended that choices be made which permit the use of the DITS transmission medium specified in ARINC Specification 429, so that special EMI provisions do not have to be made to accommodate the use of a bulk loading device on the aircraft.

Program pins are incorporated to differentiate between functions of the system dependent on the installation in the airplane. Twenty-nine program pin inputs are reserved in Attachment 2 to this Characteristic.

## 4.2.2 Fmcu Digital Data Outputs 4.3.2.2 Off-Side Cdu Enable

--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
References to FDSU in item (v) and third sentence deleted. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS:
The input discrete is provided for use if necessary to enable data entry into the FMC from the off-side CDU (the non-"prime" CDU) in a dual CDU configuration. An open circuit condition indicates the off-side CDU input to the FMC is enabled.

## 4.2.2 Fmcu Digital Data Outputs 4.3.2.3 Autotune Master/Slave Discrete

This input discrete is provided for use, where necessary, in determining which FMCU
in a dual system configuration has control of NAVAID Autoselection. An open circuit condition indicates that the FMCU to which it is applied is in control.

## 4.3.2.4 Oleo Strut Switch Discrete

Nine separate, buffered digital data output ports are provided to drive the CDUs and other subsystems requiring FMC system data. These are (i) Intersystem, (ii) General Data Output (2), (iii) EFI (2), (iv) CDU Output (2), (v) FDSU/Data Loader and (vi) ACARS.

The characteristics of the digital data bus(es) carrying data to the CDU(s) and FDSU (if used) are not constrained by this specification, although it is recommended that choices be made which permit the use of the DITS transmission medium specified in ARINC Specification 429 and do not result in a need to make special EMI provisions in the aircraft.

A "standard ground" input discrete will be supplied to the FMCU when the airplane oleo strut switch indicates an "on the ground" condition.

## 4.2.5 Fdsu Digital Data Input (Option) 4.3.2.5 Maintenance Test Discrete

Section deleted.

## Original Text Follows:

The FMC should accept an input discrete for initiating a maintenance test. A "standard ground" condition of this discrete constitutes a test command.

## 4.3.2.6 Manual/Auto Discretes

Two input discretes are provided to determine the state of the captain and first officer Manual/Auto tuning switches. A "standard ground" condition indicates the selection of Manual tune.

## 4.3.2.7 Source/Destination Identifier (Sdi)

Three input discretes are provided to enable the FMCU to recognize/encode the SDI code specified in ARINC Specification 429. (See Attachment 2 to this document.)

## 4.3.2.8 Cdu Message Alert Discrete

The FMC should provide a "standard ground" output discrete for activating a "CDU message alert" annunciator when it is necessary to draw the flight crew's attention to a message displayed on the CDU.

## 4.3.2.9 Cdu Active Input Identification Discrete

A discrete input to the CDU should be provided to enable it to determine which FMC data input port to activate. A "standard open" signal should indicate that it should activate the port connected to the FMC for which it is the prime CDU.

## 4.3.2.10 Cdu Primary/Secondary Status Input Discrete

An input discrete to the CDU should be provided to define the CDU as primary or secondary.

An open circuit condition signified primary status.
