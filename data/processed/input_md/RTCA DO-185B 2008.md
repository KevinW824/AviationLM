## Foreword

This document was prepared by Special Committee 147 (SC-147) and the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) Working Group 75 (WG-75) and approved by the RTCA Program Management Committee (PMC) on June 19, 2008.  EUROCAE ED-143 is equivalent to and technically identical with this document.  
This document has four components:  

 
Volume 1 contains the main body of the MOPS.  
 
Volume 2 contains the Collision Avoidance System Requirements Specification (CRS), a detailed specification of the Collision Avoidance System (CAS) component of the TCAS II system using a precise program specification notation called state charts. It is incorporated by reference into the requirements specification in Volume 1. 
 
Attachment A to Volume 2 contains an alternate specification of the CAS logic in the form of a program in a simplified programming language developed specifically for the purpose. Equivalence between this form of the CAS logic and the state charts has been demonstrated by testing implementations based on each specification against the CAS test suite. However, Attachment A is provided for informational purposes only, and is not formally incorporated into Volume 1 as an alternative statement of requirements.  
 
Tests of the CAS logic are specified by computer-readable files which are incorporated by reference into the test procedures in Volume 1.  These tests have been developed using a simulator capable of executing programs specified in state chart format. That simulator is also used to ensure that the test suite exercises each state transition in the state charts.

## 1 Purpose And Scope 1.1 Introduction

This document sets forth minimum operational performance standards for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II) equipment. TCAS II is intended to improve air safety by acting as a last-resort method of preventing mid-air collisions or near collisions between aircraft. By utilizing Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) technology, TCAS II equipment operates independently of ground-based aids and air traffic control (ATC).  Aircraft equipped with TCAS II have the ability to interrogate airborne transponders to monitor range, bearing, and reported altitude of other aircraft in the vicinity and assess the risk of collision.  Non-transponding aircraft are not detected. TCAS II Version 6.0 was first introduced in the United States in 1990 with collision avoidance logic Version 6.0 and later 6.04 and 6.04a.  TCAS II Version 7.0 was introduced in the United States and Europe in 2000 and was subsequently mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for all commercial turbine-powered transport aircraft worldwide having more than 19 passenger seats or having a maximum take-off weight above 5700 kg.  TCAS II is referred to as the Airborne Collision Avoidance System II (ACAS II) in ICAO terminology. TCAS II provides traffic advisories (TAs) and if warranted, resolution advisories (RAs) in the vertical plane.  RAs are indications given to the flight crew recommending maneuvers intended to provide separation from all threats, or restrictions to maneuvers to maintain existing separation.  (In this document the term separation means physical separation, i.e., absence of collision, and should not be confused with the provision of ATC minimum separation.)  TCAS II operating procedures give RAs priority over ATC clearances and instructions, i.e., flight crews are instructed to follow an RA even when it conflicts with ATC guidance.  Controllers have no knowledge of a TCAS RA unless notified by the flight crew via the radio. (RA information is provided by TCAS II to Mode S SSRs, but it is not normally presented to controllers.)  Only wind shear warnings and Ground Proximity Warning System warnings have higher priority than a TCAS RA. Results of United States and European safety studies show that there is a significant safety benefit to be gained from the widespread carriage and operation of TCAS II, specifically, the risk of mid-air collision is reduced by at least a factor of three.  Globally, operational experience has shown that TCAS II has significantly improved the safety of flight. 

Note: There are three members of the TCAS family.  TCAS I is a pilot warning 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
indicator which displays proximate traffic and alerts the crew to other aircraft which may become potential near midair collision threats.  TCAS II in addition provides recommended vertical escape maneuvers to the crew to avert potential near midair collisions. The term TCAS IV is reserved for future TCAS equipment that has additional capabilities beyond those of TCAS II equipment to generate resolution advisories in the horizontal plane (e.g., "TURN RIGHT," "TURN LEFT").  The equipment described by this document does not have horizontal resolution capability.  In this document, TCAS I is denoted "TCAS I"; the use of the unqualified term "TCAS" refers exclusively to TCAS II; and TCAS IV is explicitly denoted "TCAS IV". 

TCAS provides an effective collision avoidance function in traffic densities as high as 0.3 
aircraft per square nautical mile (24 transponder-equipped aircraft within five nautical miles of the TCAS-equipped aircraft). When TCAS operates in traffic densities of 0.3 transponder-equipped aircraft per square nautical mile or higher, it provides protection against collisions with other aircraft that are closing at speeds of less than 500 kt. TCAS is also capable of providing protection against aircraft closing at relative speeds of up to 1200 kt in airspace characterized by densities of less than 0.06 transponder-equipped aircraft per square nautical mile, which is equivalent to eighteen transponder-equipped aircraft within ten nautical miles of the TCAS aircraft. In addition to the minimum standards contained in this document, several options are described herein which will allow TCAS to request and/or receive information from other MODE S-equipped aircraft.  These optional features provide for the exchange of information via the proposed MODE S extended squitter or an air-to-air data link.  The purpose for including these options in this standard is to permit a uniform minimum capability to upgrade or enhance TCAS in the future.  The specific applications for these optional features and the applications' corresponding minimum operational performance characteristics are not part of these standards. Incorporated within these standards are system characteristics that should be of value to users, designers, manufacturers, and installers.  These characteristics are intended to accommodate the requirements of various users. This document is published in two volumes. Section 1.0 of Volume I is intended to provide information needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated in the remaining sections. It describes typical equipment applications and operational goals and is the basis for the standards stated in the document.  Definitions essential to proper understanding of this document are also provided in Section 1.0. Section 2.0 of Volume I contains the minimum performance standards for the equipment. These standards define the required performance under standard operating conditions and stressed physical environmental conditions.  Section 2.0 includes as guidance material an overview of the TCAS collision avoidance algorithms.  It also details the recommended bench test procedures necessary to demonstrate compliance, including specific bench tests for the collision avoidance logic performance. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Section 3.0 of Volume I describes the performance required of the installed equipment. Tests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. Volume II contains the required collision avoidance algorithms.  The algorithms are presented in a state chart formulation with informational commentary text.  In addition, Attachment A of Volume II contains both high and low level pseudocode representations of the collision avoidance algorithms which have been formally proven to be in accordance with the state chart formulation. Both Volumes I and II contain certain standards and performance requirements that are intended to ensure that TCAS II is fully interoperable (see 1.7.5) with other airspace elements and equipment.  It is mandatory that all interoperability provisions be met without exception or deviation.  Other technical and performance requirements stated herein that were derived from the particular implementation approach that formed the basis for the development of this MOPS may be waived if the manufacturer or installer provides evidence of equivalent system performance for an alternative method of implementation and if the alternative implementation does not violate interoperability provisions. Since the measured values of equipment performance characteristics may be functions of the methods of measurement, standard test conditions and methods of test are recommended in this document. "TCAS equipment" as used herein includes all components or units necessary (as determined by the manufacturer or installer) for the equipment to perform its function properly with the exception of the Mode S transponder.  It should not be inferred that each TCAS equipment design will necessarily have all components or units in separate packages.  This will depend on the specific design chosen by the manufacturer.  The transponder capabilities may also be implemented as part of the TCAS avionics package but the term "TCAS equipment" will refer only to the TCAS portion of this package. Additional functions and components that may provide expanded equipment capabilities are identified.  Other equipment features that are beyond the scope of this document may be described in future RTCA documents. If the equipment implementation includes a computer software package, compliance with the guidelines contained in RTCA/DO-178B, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, December 1, 1992, and all changes thereto, is required. 

## 1.2 System Overview

The TCAS equipment in the aircraft interrogates air traffic control transponders on aircraft in its vicinity and listens for the transponder replies.  By computer analysis of these replies, the airborne TCAS equipment determines which aircraft represent potential collision threats and provides appropriate display indications (or advisories) to the flight crew to avoid collision. The TCAS equipment described in this document is capable of providing two classes of advisories.  Resolution advisories (RAs) indicate vertical maneuvers that are predicted to either increase or maintain the existing vertical separation from threatening aircraft. Traffic advisories (TAs) indicate the positions of intruding aircraft that may later cause resolution advisories to be displayed.  All TCAS equipment described in this document display traffic and resolution advisories. The resolution advisories described herein do not indicate horizontal escape maneuvers and therefore are not intended to increase horizontal separation.  Vertical separation is based upon predictions from own and intruder altitude data supplied to the TCAS unit assuming that the intruder does not maneuver. Traffic advisories indicate the range, range rate, altitude, altitude rate and bearing (when available) of the intruding aircraft relative to own aircraft.  Traffic advisories without altitude information are also provided on non-altitude reporting, transponder-equipped aircraft. 

TCAS has been designed to provide a back-up collision avoidance service for the existing conventional air traffic control system while minimizing the number of unwanted alarms in encounters for which the collision risk does not warrant escape maneuvers.  The operation of TCAS is not dependent upon any ground-based systems. 

TCAS is most readily understood by visualizing its operation in flight.  When airborne, the TCAS equipment periodically transmits interrogation signals.  These interrogations are received by Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) or Mode S altitude reporting transponders.  In reply to the interrogations, the transponder transmits a signal which reports its altitude.  The TCAS equipment computes the range of the intruding aircraft by using the round-trip time between the transmission of the interrogation and the receipt of the reply. Altitude, altitude rate, range, range rate, range acceleration and bearing are determined by tracking the reply information.  These data, together with the current TCAS sensitivity level (which specifies the protected volume around the aircraft), are used to determine whether the intruding aircraft is a threat.  Each threat aircraft is processed individually to permit selection of the minimum safe resolution advisory based on track data and coordination with other TCAS-equipped aircraft with a resolution advisory generating capability. If the threat detection logic in the TCAS computer determines that a nearby aircraft represents a potential collision or near-miss encounter, the computer threat resolution logic determines the appropriate vertical maneuver or vertical maneuver restriction that will ensure the safe separation of the TCAS aircraft.  The appropriate maneuver is one that ensures adequate vertical separation assuming that the threat aircraft does not maneuver to thwart the resolution advisory. If the threat aircraft is itself equipped with TCAS equipment that generates resolution advisories, a coordination procedure via the air-to-air Mode S data link is performed. This procedure assures that the aircraft resolution advisories are compatible. The resolution advisories displayed to the pilot can be divided into two categories: Corrective advisories, which instruct the pilot to deviate from the current flight path (e.g., "DON'T CLIMB" when the aircraft is climbing); and preventive advisories which do not require a modification to the current flight path (e.g., "DON'T CLIMB" when the aircraft is in level flight). The traffic advisories displayed to the pilot describe the positions of aircraft that are, or could become, collision threats.  The display of traffic advisories alerts the flight crew to the presence of threat, or potential threat aircraft, and may improve the ability of the crew to respond to subsequent resolution advisories.  In addition, traffic advisories may improve the ability of the flight crew to visually acquire the traffic. TCAS has the capability to communicate with the ground-based air traffic control system when a ground-based Mode S sensor equipped with the necessary complementary features has been installed.  The TCAS can provide the Mode S ground system with the resolution advisories that are displayed to the pilot.  These resolution advisories may be displayed to the air traffic controller if desired.  In addition, airborne TCAS equipment can receive sensitivity level commands from ground-based Mode S sensors. 

## 1.3 System Description 1.3.1 Minimum Tcas

The equipped aircraft carries TCAS surveillance electronics and interrogates and receives replies from Mode S and ATCRBS transponders on other aircraft.  It has a TCAS computer, associated displays, and aircraft interfaces.  TCAS is capable of resolving encounters with aircraft equipped with Mode S transponders as well as with aircraft equipped with the internationally standardized ATCRBS altitude reporting transponders.   
Note: Figure 1-1 depicts the functional components of TCAS as well as the ancillary functional components of the TCAS-equipped aircraft and the functional components of other aircraft and the ground Air Traffic Management system which enable full TCAS operation.  In Figure 1-1, the system components on the TCAS-equipped are depicted in the box labeled "Own Aircraft".  These include:  

 
Aircraft Discretes - Discrete inputs such as those which cause TCAS to alter its RA processing when own aircraft is climb inhibited because it is at its ceiling 
altitude. 
 
Radio Altimeter and Pressure Altitude Inputs. 
 
Display Unit - Displays for TCAS RAs and TAs. 
 
TCAS Processor Unit - The principal TCAS functional unit which includes the TCAS Performance Monitor, Collision Avoidance System (CAS) logic and the Surveillance Subsystem, including the TCAS Receiver and Transmitter. 
 
The "Other Aircraft" box in Figure 1-1 depicts the equipage on other aircraft which is necessary for TCAS to track and to issue RAs and/or TAs against them. Finally, Figure 1-1 provides an indication that "Ground Stations" (e.g.,  a MODE S ground sensor or a specially designed ground receiver) may provide commands to or receive information from TCAS. 
TCAS equipment complying with the characteristics described in the following subparagraphs meets the definition of Minimum TCAS II for collision avoidance. 

## 1.3.1.1 Mode S Transponder With Altitude Encoder

The TCAS-equipped aircraft carries a Mode S air traffic control transponder (whose replies include encoded altitude when appropriately interrogated).  The Mode S transponder performs the functions of existing ATCRBS (Modes A & C) transponders and provides Mode S air-to-air communications for coordinating the resolution of encounters between TCAS-equipped aircraft.  The Mode S transponder is also used for communications with the ground-based Mode S sensor for surveillance and air-to-ground data link purposes. 

## 1.3.1.2 Bearing Estimation

This feature enables TCAS equipment to determine the approximate bearing of intruder aircraft.  Bearing estimates are used by the collision avoidance algorithm which determines if the predicted horizontal separation at closest point of approach is large enough not to declare the intruder a threat.  Bearing estimates are also used to display traffic advisories in the cockpit of the TCAS aircraft.  These traffic advisories would then indicate the range, altitude, and bearing of the threat up to 15 seconds before the time a resolution advisory is displayed.  Traffic advisories may assist the flight crew of the TCAS aircraft in the following ways: 

a. Alert the crew to the presence of potentially threatening traffic and provide intruder 
position data that can aid visual acquisition. 
b. Provide the crew a graphic depiction of the conflict situation prior to the time the 
resolution advisory is displayed, thereby facilitating a reduction in the time taken by a pilot to respond to the resolution advisory. 

## 1.3.1.3 Surveillance In Airspace Having High Transponder-Equipped Aircraft Traffic Densities

TCAS is designed to operate in airspace having a maximum traffic density of 0.3 transponder-equipped (Mode S, or ATCRBS Mode A/C) aircraft per square nautical mile (24 aircraft within a five-NM radius). 

## 1.3.1.4 Surveillance Of Aircraft Without Altitude Encoders

Some aircraft are equipped with air traffic control transponders but do not have altitude encoders.  TCAS cannot generate resolution advisories in conflicts with such aircraft because, without altitude information, a collision threat assessment cannot be made. TCAS aircraft can generate traffic advisories on such aircraft, describing their ranges and bearings.

## 1.3.2 Optional Features

The following optional features are described in these standards to enable a uniform approach to future TCAS upgrades and enhancements.  Inclusion of these features in any implementation is not required; however, if these features are included in an implementation, they must comply with all the applicable requirements of these standards. 

## 1.3.2.1 Detection Of Extended Mode S Squitter

TCAS II may detect the presence of Mode S-equipped aircraft by listening to Mode S transmissions with DF=17 (Extended Squitter) as described in subparagraph 2.2.3.10.2.1. Implementation of this option does not remove the requirement to detect the presence of Mode S-equipped aircraft by listening to Mode S transmissions with DF=11 also as described in subparagraph 2.2.3.10.2.1. 

## 1.3.2.2 Reception And Decoding Of Extended Squitters From Mode S Transponders

TCAS may be implemented to receive and decode the content of the ME field in the Extended Squitters containing the aircraft identification message as described in subparagraph 2.2.3.10.7. 

## 1.3.2.3 Mode S Crosslink Capability

TCAS may be implemented with the capability to request and receive ground-initiated Comm-B register information from Mode S transponders able to provide this information as described in subparagraph 2.2.3.10.6. 

## 1.3.2.4 Use Of Altitude Alerter

TCAS may be implemented with an input from the Altitude Alerter as described in subparagraph 2.2.3.13.3.1 and in the collision avoidance algorithms in Volume II.  When this option is chosen, TCAS shall consider the altitude provided by the Altitude Alerter when posting weakened Resolution Advisories to ensure that any weakened RAs are consistent with the aircraft's clearance altitude.  The selected altitude from the altitude alerter will also be used to strengthen an RA to level the aircraft at the selected altitude if the desired vertical miss distance has been attained.  TCAS will make no use of the Altitude Alerter input when posting any Resolution Advisories other than weakenings or strengthenings. 

## 1.4 Operational Applications 1.4.1 Tcas Operates Independently Of The Ground Atc System

TCAS operates independently of the ground Air Traffic Control (ATC) system and will be used as a backup to the ATC system. 

## 1.4.2 Control Of Interaction With The Air Traffic Control System

The TCAS threat detection and resolution logic provides a variable protection volume. The process of selecting progressively smaller protected volumes as a TCAS enters low altitude airspace is called sensitivity level control. 

## 1.4.3 Effectiveness Of Collision Avoidance Maneuvers

If a threat is detected, the TCAS equipment generates a resolution advisory some time before the closest approach of aircraft.  The time depends on the protected volume selected for TCAS system use.  The nominal advisory time before closest approach used by TCAS varies from 15 to 35 seconds.  If the aircraft detected by the TCAS is not also TCAS-equipped, it is not aware that a TCAS-equipped aircraft has issued an advisory against it.  However, since TCAS is able to strengthen and reverse RAs, it will be able to provide timely updated RA guidance even if the intruding aircraft performs typical climb or descend maneuvers.  Thus, if the TCAS aircraft receives a resolution advisory and maneuvers in accordance with the specified vertical maneuver, the TCAS aircraft will be able to avoid the intruding aircraft unless the intruding aircraft suddenly and aggressively outmaneuvers the TCAS aircraft. When both aircraft are equipped with TCAS systems that generate resolution advisories, cooperative resolution advisories are assured by the TCAS logic through use of an air-to-air exchange of data. 

## 1.5 Operational Goals

The general operational goals of TCAS are described in the following subparagraphs. The detailed requirements for the equipment are provided in Sections 2.0 and 3.0 of this document.  Implementation of new ATC system elements under development will improve communication, surveillance, and data management.  This will increase the effectiveness of the existing ground-based air traffic control system.  It is also apparent that a single, ground-based ATC system cannot meet the requirements of all flight conditions because of the absence of coverage in oceanic and other low traffic-density airspace.  Thus, there is a need to provide an air-to-air collision avoidance capability on aircraft, which is independent of the ground-based system.  Such a system must remain compatible with the ATC system when operating in controlled airspace.  As a minimum, equipment providing this capability must achieve the following operational goals: 

a. The system must be capable of providing timely and effective resolution advisories to 
a pilot to permit avoiding other air traffic equipped with an ATCRBS or Mode S altitude reporting transponder.  This capability must be assured throughout airspace having a maximum traffic density of 0.3 transponder-equipped aircraft per square nautical mile. 
b. Operation must be compatible with the existing ATC system and with planned 
evolution of the ATC system. 
c. The system design must ensure that the system does not have characteristics that 
could adversely affect the safety of flight or interfere with other aircraft systems on the aircraft or installed on other nearby aircraft. 
d. Maneuvers expected in response to resolution advisories provided by the system 
should be acceptable to both pilots and air traffic controllers. 
e. The system must contain a comprehensive performance monitor function that will 
monitor automatically, on a continuous basis, the operating integrity of the system. 

## 1.6 Assumptions And Limitations 1.6.1 Improvements Or Alternative Techniques

It is recognized that developments will continue which may have the potential of producing improved operational performance.  However, this MOPS defines performance standards and test procedures based on proven and validated TCAS requirements that were developed under FAA sponsorship.  It is not feasible to describe a generic way of meeting most TCAS requirements and also write specific test procedures that should be used to validate them.  Thus, specific means of accomplishing each desired result are described by this document. Manufacturers are reminded that the TCAS algorithms specified in Volume II have been proven via extensive validation and verification efforts.  Any deviations from these algorithms must therefore be validated and verified to the same extent or at least be shown to be equivalent to the requirements in Volume II.  New features in addition to those specified in Volume II are permissible, providing that these do not interfere with the functions defined by the existing requirements and are subjected to the same degree of validation and verification. 

## 1.6.2 Enhancements

Future developments may provide additional operational features, such as horizontal resolution advisories.  If such enhancements are successful and prove useful, they may be addressed by another minimum operational performance standard document. 

## 1.6.3 Degree Of Protection Provided

The TCAS system described in this document is intended to provide reliable aircraft collision avoidance capability against aircraft which are equipped with altitude-reporting transponders.  If both aircraft are TCAS equipped, this collision avoidance capability may be enhanced. 

## 1.6.4 Transponder Population

As TCAS installations are made and Mode S transponders are installed, the population of transponders will slowly change from ATCRBS to Mode S.  However, it is assumed that ATCRBS transponders will be part of the environment throughout the life of the TCAS equipment described in this document. 

## 1.6.5 Density Of Transponder-Equipped Aircraft

Studies indicate that the maximum traffic density of transponder-equipped aircraft may increase to 0.3 aircraft per square nautical mile. 

## 1.6.6 Tcas Performance Monitor

The performance monitoring capability described in this document is intended to discontinue or limit TCAS operation if a TCAS function has failed.  If the TCAS 
performance monitor determines that the TCAS is not operating properly, the transponder reports that the aircraft is carrying only a Mode S transponder, with no resolution advisory generation capability. 

## 1.6.7 Altimeter Operation

To support the vertical conflict resolution maneuver used by TCAS, the altimetry system that provides own pressure altitude to the TCAS equipment must meet the requirements of paragraph 3.2.8.  Collision avoidance may be degraded by errors in intruder pressure altitude as reported by the transponder of the intruder aircraft. 

## 1.6.8 Aircraft Performance Limitations

Aircraft performance limitations constrain the magnitude of the escape maneuver that the flight crew can safely execute in response to a resolution advisory.  It is possible for these limitations to preclude a successful resolution of the conflict. 

## 1.7 Test Procedures

The test procedures and associated limits specified throughout this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the minimum acceptable performance parameters.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the test activity. These alternative procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information. In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternative procedures. The order of tests suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of different tests as it moves from design and design qualification into operational use.  For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2.0 should have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section 3.0.  The tests normally are performed once for each model of equipment to demonstrate compliance with the minimum operational performance standard. 

## 1.7.1 Environmental Tests

Environmental tests are specified in Subsection 2.3.  The tests and associated requirements are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations.  Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance, in preparation of installation instructions and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture. 

## 1.7.2 Bench Tests

Bench test procedures are specified in Subsection 2.4.  These tests are conducted at the equipment level and are intended to provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Subsections 2.1 and 2.2.  Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture. 

## 1.7.3 Installed System Tests

The installed system test procedures and their associated limit requirements are specified in Section 3.0.  Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included in the installed system tests, their successful completion is a precondition to completion of the installed tests.  In certain instances, however, installed system tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from or to other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc.  Installed tests are normally performed on one model of each aircraft under two conditions: 

a. With the aircraft on the ground and using simulated or operational system inputs. b. With the aircraft in flight using operational system signals appropriate to the 
equipment under test. 
Test results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the environment in which the equipment is intended to operate. 

## 1.7.4 Computer Performance Verification Test

Bench tests and environmental tests include computer verification tests as specified in paragraph 2.4.3. 

## 1.7.5 Interoperability

Interoperability with other elements of the National Airspace System is a mandatory requirement for all TCAS II equipment and is independent of implementation alternatives.  Interoperability, for purposes of this MOPS, is defined to include all requirements and provisions stated herein that impact the technical and/or operational relationship of the TCAS II equipment with the following: ATCRBS:  TCAS II is required to interoperate with ATCRBS transponder equipment. This interoperability is ensured by compliance of the TCAS II with all applicable ATCRBS signals-in-space requirements of the Minimum Operational Characteristics- Airborne ATC Transponder Systems, RTCA/DO-144. Mode S:  TCAS II is required to interoperate with Mode S transponder equipment. This interoperability is ensured by compliance of the TCAS II with all applicable Mode S signals-in-space and protocol requirements of the Minimum Operational Performance Standards for the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System/Mode Select (ATCRBS/MODE S) Airborne Equipment, RTCA/DO-181A and all revisions thereto. 

TCAS:  TCAS II is required to interoperate with all RA-generating TCAS equipment.  In addition, the TCAS II must interface with its associated Mode S transponder such that all data exchange requirements are met as defined herein.

Alarm - An aural signal to the pilot that recommends immediate attention to the display(s). Alert - A message given to the pilot containing information relevant to collision avoidance.  This term is synonymous with advisory. Altitude Crossing - Encounters in which own aircraft and the threat aircraft are projected to cross in altitude prior to reaching closest point of approach. Altitude Crossing RA - A resolution advisory is altitude crossing if own TCAS II aircraft is currently more than 100 ft below or above the threat aircraft for upward or downward sense advisories, respectively. Altitude, Relative - The altitude of own aircraft measured upward from the intruder aircraft, i.e., relative altitude is positive when own is higher and negative when own is lower. Altitude Separation - The absolute value of relative altitude. Bearing - The horizontal angle of an intruder aircraft relative to the nose of the TCAS aircraft, sometimes expressed as a clock position. Broadcast - Unsolicited transmission to a non-specific destination. Cancel Vertical Resolution Advisory Complement (CVC) - Information sent from one TCAS to another via a coordination interrogation to cancel the Vertical Resolution Advisory Complement (VRC) previously sent. Closest Point of Approach (CPA) - The occurrence of minimum range between own TCAS aircraft and the intruder. Thus, range at closest approach is the smallest range between the two aircraft and time of closest approach is the time at which this occurs. Coasted Track - A track that is continued based on previous track characteristics in the absence of surveillance data reports. 

Collision Avoidance System (CAS) - Collision avoidance logic subsystem within TCAS. 

Coordination - The process by which two TCAS II-equipped aircraft select compatible (non-conflicting) Resolution Advisories by the exchange of Vertical Resolution Advisory Complements. 

Coordination Interrogation - A Mode S interrogation (uplink transmission UF=16) transmitted by a TCAS II containing a TCAS Resolution Message. Coordination Reply - A Mode S reply (downlink transmission DF=16) acknowledging the receipt of a coordination interrogation by a TCAS II. Corrective Advisory - A resolution advisory that instructs the pilot to deviate from current vertical rate, e.g., DON'T CLIMB when the aircraft is climbing. Critical Interval - Critical interval is the period of time when the horizontal separation between own and the threat aircraft is minimal. It is the interval between true TAU and modified TAU. Normally the critical interval is very short, only a second or two. However, in cases of slow closure, as in a tail chase scenario, horizontal separation may be minimum for a long time. Desensitization - TCAS sensitivity level (threat volume) reduction. Displayed Resolution Advisory - An RA already displayed to the flight crew. Distance Modification (DMOD) - Safety factor incorporated in range measurements to account for possible accelerations by the intruder. The value of distance modification varies with the sensitivity level for this own intruder set. The value is chosen such that a sustained acceleration of g/3 will produce this displacement in range threshold time. Effective Sensitivity Level - Sensitivity level of an aircraft derived from a composite of its pilot input, any ground station (up to 15) uplink, and altitude-based sensitivity level. This composite level is derived using the set of rules specified by the TCAS requirements. This level is used in determining the sensitivity of performance of the collision avoidance logic. Established Threat - An intruder that has been declared a threat, and still merits a Resolution Advisory. Established Track - A track generated by TCAS air-to-air surveillance that is treated as the track of an actual aircraft. Extended Squitter - A method of determining the position and/or state of an aircraft by having a transponder on board the aircraft periodically broadcast position and/or state information. False Advisory - An advisory caused by a false track or a TCAS malfunction. False Track - A track created by erroneous surveillance data. FRUIT - Transponder replies unsynchronized in time.  See Garble, Nonsynchronous. Garble, Nonsynchronous - Reply pulses received from a transponder that is being interrogated from some other source. Also called FRUIT. 

Garble, Synchronous - An overlap of the reply pulses received from two or more transponders answering the same interrogation. Horizontal Miss Distance (HMD) - The horizontal range between two aircraft at the point of closest approach. 

ICAO 24-bit Aircraft Address - A unique 24-bit address assigned to each Mode S equipped aircraft.  It is included in Mode S replies and broadcasts in order to uniquely identify the aircraft. It allows Mode S interrogators (SSRs or TCAS II) to interrogate one aircraft at a time by specifying that aircraft's ICAO aircraft address in the interrogation. Historically this was called the Mode S discrete address or Mode S address or Mode S ID, and similar terminology still appears in some places in this document. ICAO Aircraft Identification - The three letter ICAO designator for the aircraft operating agency followed by the flight number (e.g., BAW123); or the Registration Marking of the aircraft (e.g., FGZCF). Increased Rate Resolution Advisory - A resolution advisory that advises the pilot to increase the altitude rate to a value exceeding that of a previous positive RA. Intruder - A transponder-equipped aircraft within the surveillance range of TCAS for which TCAS has an established track. Minimum Trigger Level (MTL) - The minimum input power level that results in a 90% ratio of decoded to received replies. Mode A - A type of ATCRBS transmission which requests (via Mode A interrogations) or reports (via Mode A replies) aircraft identity information. Mode C - A type of ATCRBS transmission which requests (via Mode C interrogations) or reports (via Mode C replies) aircraft altitude information.  ATCRBS transponders which do not have Mode C capability respond to Mode C interrogations with standard ATCRBS framing pulses but no altitude information. Mode S - A type of SSR transmission which contains a unique ICAO 24-bit aircraft address, thus allowing interrogations to be addressed to individual aircraft.  Mode S transmissions can be short (56 bits) or long (112 bits), with long transmissions containing a 56-bit "message" field. Mode S Beacon System - A secondary surveillance radar (SSR) system having groundbased interrogators and airborne transponders and capable of using Mode S transmissions.  Mode S ground interrogators are evolutionary in that they transmit Mode S interrogations to aircraft equipped with Mode S transponders but also transmit Mode A and C interrogations to aircraft equipped with ATCRBS transponders. Modified TAU - Time to closest point of approach determined by incorporating the safety factor DMOD into the measured range to an intruder.  See Distance Modification. Near Midair Collision (NMAC) - Two aircraft simultaneously coming within 100 ft vertically and 500 ft horizontally. Negative Advisory - One of the following resolution advisories: DON'T CLIMB, DON'T CLIMB FASTER THAN 500 FPM, DON'T CLIMB FASTER THAN 1,000 FPM, DON'T CLIMB FASTER THAN 2,000 FPM, DON'T DESCEND, DON'T DESCEND 
FASTER THAN 500 FPM, DON'T DESCEND FASTER THAN 1,000 FPM, DON'T 
DESCEND FASTER THAN 2,000 FPM.  All negative advisories can be preventive.  In addition, DON'T CLIMB and DON'T DESCEND can be corrective.  LIMIT CLIMB TO 
xx FPM is used as a synonym for DON'T CLIMB FASTER THAN xx FPM, with LIMIT CLIMB TO 0 FPM being the same as DON'T CLIMB.  Similarly for LIMIT DESCENT 
and DON‖T DESCEND.  Vertical speed limit (VSL) is another term used for a negative advisory. When used with a specific vertical rate, e.g., VSL 0 FPM, it specifies the limiting vertical speed but not the vertical sense (LIMIT CLIMB, LIMIT DESCENT) of the RA. Operational Mode - TCAS has three operational modes; standby, TA-Only, and TA and RA (TA/RA). Own Aircraft - The TCAS-equipped reference aircraft. Performance Monitoring - A feature of the TCAS equipment that implements the function of measuring critical physical or software TCAS quantities to determine the operating capability of the TCAS equipment.  The performance monitoring function is initiated routinely and automatically by the TCAS equipment; no flight crew or external stimulation is required.  The performance monitor feature of the TCAS equipment also provides to the pilot an indication of the operating status of the equipment. Positive Advisory - One of the following resolution advisories: CLIMB, DESCEND, INCREASE CLIMB, INCREASE DESCENT, REVERSAL TO CLIMB, REVERSAL TO 
DESCEND, MAINTAIN 
CLIMB, MAINTAIN 
DESCENT, ALTITUDE

Potential Threat - An intruder that has passed the Potential Threat classification criteria for a TA and does not meet the Threat Classification criteria for an RA. Preventive Advisory - A resolution advisory that instructs the pilot to avoid certain deviations from current vertical rate, as for example a DON'T CLIMB when the aircraft is level. Proximate Traffic - Nearby aircraft within 1,200 feet and 6 nautical miles which do not meet either the threat or the potential threat classification criteria. 

Range At Co-altitude - Range when own and intruder aircraft are at the same altitude. Report - A message containing surveillance data on a target aircraft. Resolution Advisory - A display indication given to the pilot recommending a maneuver to either increase or maintain the existing vertical separation relative to an intruding aircraft.  Positive and negative advisories constitute the resolution advisories.  A resolution advisory is also classified as corrective or preventive. Resolution Maneuver - Maneuver resulting from compliance with a Resolution Advisory. Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) - A radar system in which the return signal is radiated from a transmitter on board the target. Self-Test - Tests of the TCAS equipment and displays which are initiated by the flight crew and are used to determine the operational status of the equipment.  Self-test differs 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
from Performance Monitoring in that it is initiated by the flight crew, may use external stimuli, and is not performed continually or automatically. Sense - A direction that a resolution advisory may take: Either up or down. 

Sense Reversal - A change to the sense opposite that of the original Resolution Advisory. Sensitivity Level (SL) - A set of parameters used to specify the size of the protected volume around the TCAS-equipped aircraft for threat detection.  The size of the protected volume and hence the Sensitivity Level varies with altitude. Sensitivity Level Command - An instruction given to the TCAS equipment for control of its threat volume. Squitter - Spontaneous transmission generated by Mode S transponders. Standby Mode - TCAS mode in which advisories are not issued and surveillance interrogations are not made. TA-Only Mode - TCAS mode in which TAs are displayed and RAs are not generated or displayed. TA/RA Mode - TCAS operation in which both TAs and RAs are issued as specified. Target - A transponder-equipped aircraft within the surveillance range of TCAS. TCAS Broadcast - A long Mode S air-air surveillance interrogation (UF=16) with the broadcast address. TCAS Processing Cycle - A nominal one second interval which encompasses all TCAS surveillance, collision avoidance and supporting functions. TCAS Resolution Message - The message containing the Vertical Resolution Advisory Complement (VRC). Threat - A target that has satisfied the threat detection logic and thus requires a resolution advisory. Total Radiated Power (TRP) - The effect of TCAS transmissions on the beacon environment is measured in terms of the total radiated power.  For a lossless antenna, the TRP is equal to the net power delivered to the antenna input terminals.  If the antenna is not lossless, but has a vertical pattern that is similar to that of a matched quarter-wave stub, the TRP may be approximated as: 

$$T R P=P\cdot G\cdot(B W/360\mathrm{deg})\,,$$
where P is the net power delivered to the antenna input terminals, G is the peak antenna gain relative to the peak gain of a matched quarter-wave stub on a vertical ground plane, and BW is the three dB azimuth beam width in degrees (BW=360 deg. for an omnidirectional antenna). Track - Estimated position and velocity of a single aircraft based on correlated surveillance data reports. 

Traffic Advisory - Information given to the pilot pertaining to the position of another aircraft in the immediate vicinity.  The information contains no suggested maneuver. Traffic Density (aircraft per square NM) - The number of transponder-equipped aircraft within R NM of own aircraft, divided by  * R2.  Transponder-equipped aircraft include Mode S and ATCRBS Mode A/C, and exclude own aircraft. Transponder - The receiver-transmitter portion of a secondary surveillance radar system that sends an identifying coded signal, in response to a transmitted interrogation. Transponder Equipage - Indication of type of transponder, whether ATCRBS or Mode S. True TAU - Actual time to closest point of approach assuming unaccelerated flight by both own-aircraft and the intruder. Vertical Miss Distance - The relative altitude between own and intruder aircraft at closest point of approach. Vertical Resolution Advisory Complement (VRC) - Information provided by one TCAS to another via a coordination interrogation to ensure complementary maneuvers by restricting the choice of maneuvers available to the TCAS receiving the VRC. Vertical Speed Limit (VSL) Advisory - See Negative Advisory. Warning Time - The time interval between potential threat or threat detection and closest approach when neither aircraft accelerates. Whisper-Shout - A sequence of ATCRBS interrogations and suppressions of varying power levels transmitted by TCAS equipment to reduce the severity of synchronous interference and multipath.

## 2.1.7.1 Operation Of Controls

The operation of controls intended for use during flight, in all possible combinations and sequences, shall not result in a condition whose presence or continuation would be detrimental to the continued performance of the equipment or other equipment installed on the aircraft. 

Note: The operation of controls, intended for use during flight, should be evaluated to 
ensure they are logical and tolerant to human error. In particular, where functions are integrated with other system controls, the manufacturer should 
ensure that unintentional mode switching (i.e. "ON to "STANDBY" or "OFF") is 
minimised. This may take the form of a confirmation of mode switching, required 
by the flight crew. Typically "Line Select" Keys, "Touch Screen" or "Cursor 
Controlled/Tracker-ball" methods used to change modes should be carefully designed to minimize crew error. 

 
All possible positions, combinations and sequences of pilot accessible controls should not result in a condition detrimental to the continued performance of the 
equipment or continued safe flight of the aircraft. 
 
The flight crew should be aware, at all times, of the equipment mode. If either the operational state selection or fail warning of the equipment are not visible to the flight crew any change of transponder mode should be annunciated to the flight crew via suitable means. An installation evaluation may be required to determine the adequacy of the annunciation means. 
 
Controls which are not intended to be operated in flight should not be readily accessible to the flight crew. 

## 2.1.7.2 Accessibility Of Controls

Controls that are not normally adjusted in flight shall not be readily accessible to flight crew personnel. 

## 2.1.7.3 Minimum Flight Crew Control Functions

As a minimum, the following control functions shall be provided manually through flight crew action. 

a. Means of selecting either a "TA/RA" mode in which sensitivity levels (see 
subparagraph 2.2.6.5.1) are automatically selected based on own aircraft altimetry, or to turn off the TCAS function, or to select a "TA-ONLY" mode in which only traffic advisories, not resolution advisories, can be issued. 
Note: When the TCAS function is turned off, the TCAS unit is essentially in a 
stand-by condition.  The term "Stand-by" may be used to designate this selection.  This does not place the transponder(s) on board the TCAS aircraft 
in a stand-by condition.  TCAS equipment may use additional 
manually-selectable inputs to designate a sensitivity level for TA/RA mode operation. 
 
When a "TA-ONLY" mode is selected, the input to the TCAS logic from the control panel has a value of 2.  The TCAS logic recognizes this value as meaning "TA-ONLY Mode" and selects the appropriate sensitivity level using other inputs, such as barometric and radio altitude.  In this way, TCAS will generate traffic advisories at the thresholds appropriate for the altitude regime of own aircraft. 
b. Means of initiating the self test (paragraph 2.1.4). 

## 2.1.8 Display Functions 2.1.8.1 Minimum Display Functions

The following display functions shall be provided as a minimum for a Minimum TCAS (paragraph 1.3.1) in accordance with the algorithms of Volume II: 

a. Means of displaying the Resolution Advisory information required in Section 2.2.6.2. b. Means of displaying to the flight crew that own TCAS equipment has failed 
(paragraphs 2.1.4 and 2.1.5). 
c. Means of displaying to the flight crew that the TCAS equipment or a TCAS function 
has been inhibited either automatically or through flight crew action. 
d. Means of displaying the traffic information required in Section 2.2.6.1. e. Means of displaying traffic advisories for at least three targets including range, 
altitude, and bearing of intruding aircraft. 

## 2.1.9 Equipment Configuration

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
It is the intention of this specification to permit a manufacturer to establish interfaces between TCAS elements and obtain regulatory approval of these components of the total system.  It is the intention of this specification to allow interchangeability of system components thus defined.  For example, TCAS with a remote control panel may have several panel configurations available to meet the needs of various aircraft types.  The manufacturer is allowed to establish control panel interface standards and receive approval of the various panel designs without performing tests on the total system for each panel design. 

## 2.1.10 Mode S Transponder Capabilities

The TCAS-equipped aircraft Mode S transponder shall have the capabilities defined in Ref. B. 

## 2.1.10.1 Performance Compatibility With Own Aircraft Tcas

All of the requirements of a Mode S transponder stated in Ref. B shall be met when the transponder is operating in conjunction with an operating TCAS unit with the possible exception of those times that the TCAS transmitter is active.  The active state of the TCAS transmitter is defined as either: a) the time interval between 10 microseconds prior to the leading edge of the first transmitted pulse of an interrogation and 10 microseconds after the trailing edge of the last transmitted pulse of that interrogation; or b) the time interval during which a mutual suppression occurs, whichever, a) or b), is greater. 

## 2.1.11 Tcas Combined With Other Aircraft Systems

This specification does not preclude combining the TCAS with any other aircraft system, or the use of multifunction antennas, displays, or controls.  However, any such combination shall not degrade the general performance requirements of the TCAS equipment, the general performance requirements of the system with which the TCAS is combined, any technical performance specification stated elsewhere in this MOPS nor any technical performance standard for the other system. 

## 2.1.12 Aural Annunciation

Aural annunciations shall be generated when the traffic advisory and/or the first resolution advisory of an encounter is displayed and each time a subsequent change in the resolution advisory is displayed (strengthened or weakened). 

Note: The TCAS logic also has the capability to indicate that an RA is either corrective 
or preventive. 
An aural annunciation shall also be provided to the flight crew to indicate that the TCAS aircraft is clear of conflict with all threat aircraft.  This annunciation shall occur when the resolution advisory is cleared. Finally, no aural annunciation shall be issued when the TCAS aircraft is below 400 ft Above Ground Level (AGL) or while either a wind shear or GPWS warning is active. 

## 2.1.13 Effects Of Tests

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The design of the equipment shall be such that the application of bench and environmental tests will not result in any discernible condition detrimental to the reliability of equipment manufactured in accordance with that design. 

## 2.2 Minimum Performance Standards 2.2.1 Definition Of Standard Conditions

Unless otherwise specified, the signal levels specified in this document are defined at an RF reference point at the antenna end of the cable that connects the TCAS II interrogator/receiver equipment to its antenna.  This reference is based on an antenna gain that is 0 dB relative to a matched quarter-wave stub antenna.  Specification values in this document are based upon an antenna transmission line loss equal to the maximum for which the TCAS II equipment is designed. 

Note: The TCAS II may be installed with less than the designed maximum transmission 
line loss.  Nevertheless, the standard conditions of this document are based on the maximum design value.  Insertion loss internal to the antenna should be included as part of the net antenna gain. 
These performance standards, where applicable, are specified for an avionics configuration that includes both a Mode S transponder and TCAS II equipment.  Design specifications that may exist at a possible interface between the Mode S transponder and the TCAS II equipment are not covered in detail. 

## 2.2.1.1 Measurement Conventions

Pulse Amplitude is measured at the pulse peak. Pulse Duration is measured between the half voltage points of the leading and trailing edges. Pulse Rise Time is measured as the time between 10 percent of peak amplitude and 90 percent of peak amplitude on the leading edge of the pulse. Pulse Decay Time is measured as the time interval between 90 percent of peak amplitude and 10 percent of peak amplitude on the trailing edge of the pulse. Pulse-to-Pulse Intervals are measured between the half voltage points of their leading edges. Phase Reversal Location is the 90-degree point of the phase transition. Phase Reversal Duration is measured between the 10-degree and the 170-degree points of the phase transition. Phase Reversal Intervals are measured between the 90-degree points of the phase transition. Range is defined as the slant range to an intruder aircraft. Altitude is defined as the absolute pressure altitude of an aircraft referenced to 29.92 inches of mercury. Bearing is defined as the relative bearing of an intruder aircraft referenced to the nose of the TCAS II aircraft. 

## 2.2.1.2 Operational Environment

Note: This section defines the maximum aircraft transponder population and the 
electromagnetic interference levels under which TCAS II is expected to achieve the surveillance performance specified in subparagraph 2.2.2.2. 

## 2.2.1.2.1 Aircraft Density

Note: Aircraft traffic density is a function of a Radius of Uniform Density, Ro, and is 
defined as the number of transponder-equipped aircraft within Ro NM of own 
aircraft, N(Ro), divided by  *(Ro )2.  Transponder-equipped aircraft include 
Mode S and ATCRBS aircraft, and exclude own aircraft.  For purposes of this 
characterization, traffic density is uniform in area within Ro and falls off linearly 
with increasing range beyond Ro.  Specifically, the traffic count within any circle of radius R, where R is greater than Ro, is given by N(R)=N(Ro)*R/Ro.   
 
The value of Ro and the maximum traffic density for which TCAS II is expected to 
achieve the surveillance performance of subparagraph 2.2.2.2 depends on whether TCAS II is operating in lower altitude or higher altitude airspace. Lower altitude airspace is characterized by relatively higher traffic densities and lower maximum aircraft speeds.  Higher altitude airspace is characterized by 
lower traffic densities and higher maximum aircraft speeds.   
 
Table 2-1 summarizes the relationship between the type of airspace and 
associated maximum closing speed and the value of Ro and maximum traffic 
density for which TCAS II must meet the requirements of subparagraph 2.2.2.2.  

| Max. Traffic Density    | Ro              |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Airspace                |                 |
| Max. Closing Speed      |                 |
| Knots                   | A/C per sq. NM. |
| Lower                   | 500             |
| Altitude                |                 |
| Higher                  | 1200            |
| Altitude                |                 |

## 2.2.1.2.2 Aircraft Equipage

Note: TCAS II surveillance performance is influenced by the number of TCAS II-
equipped aircraft within 30 NM. of TCAS II and the proportion of transponderequipped aircraft that carry Mode S transponders.  A maximum density of 0.3 aircraft per sq. NM. in lower altitude airspace results in 24 aircraft within 5 NM. of TCAS II and 141 aircraft within 30 NM. of TCAS II.  Theoretically, all of these aircraft could be TCAS II-equipped in which case they would also have a Mode S transponder.  Analysis has shown that TCAS II, designed according to the requirements of this document, is able to perform satisfactorily in lower altitude airspace in a density of 0.3 aircraft per sq. NM. under any mix of ATCRBS, Mode S and TCAS II-equipped aircraft. 
 
In higher altitude airspace, a density of 0.06 aircraft per sq. NM. results in 19 
aircraft within 10 NM. of TCAS II and 56 aircraft within 30 NM. of TCAS II, all of which can be equipped with TCAS II and a Mode S transponder.  
 
The actual distribution of aircraft equipage in lower altitude airspace of 0.3 aircraft per sq. NM. density is expected to be at least 60% Mode S transponderequipped (85 Mode S aircraft within 30 NM. of TCAS II) and at least 40% TCAS II-equipped (56 TCAS II aircraft within 30 NM. of TCAS II). 

## 2.2.1.2.3 Interrogator Environment

Note: This section defines the maximum design level of electromagnetic interference to 
TCAS II that results from interrogations caused by ground and airborne interrogators. 

## 2.2.1.2.3.1 Maximum Atcrbs Fruit Rate

Note: The surveillance requirements referenced in subparagraph 2.2.2.2 are applicable 
when TCAS II is operating in an ATCRBS fruit environment in which the fruit rate received at the TCAS II RF reference point is defined by the reply power distribution shown in Table 2-2. 

| Reply Power Level    |
|----------------------|
|                     |
| -71 dBm              |
| 30,000               |
|                     |
| -68 dBm              |
| 15,000               |
|                     |
| -65 dBm              |
| 7,500                |

## 2.2.1.2.3.2 Intruder Transponder Availability

Note: In an aircraft density of 0.3 aircraft per sq. NM. and in the most severe 
interrogator environment in which TCAS II is expected to operate, measurements indicate that an intruder transponder will be subject to a maximum ground beacon radar interrogation rate of 200 per second and a ground beacon sidelobe suppression rate of 1000 per second.  These ground transmissions will cause an intruder transponder to be unavailable for a successful TCAS II surveillance interrogation 5% of the time, assuming nominal recovery times for transponder interrogations and suppressions.  In addition, the unavailability of an intruder transponder to a successful TCAS II interrogation because of other TCAS II interrogations is limited to a maximum of 2% by the TCAS II interference limiting function. 
 
The combined ground beacon radar and airborne TCAS II interrogation and suppression rates in the most severe interrogator environment will cause no more than a 7% intruder transponder reply failure rate to TCAS II surveillance interrogations. 

## 2.2.1.2.4 Maximum Level Of Atcrbs Synchronous Garble Interference

Note: The degree of ATCRBS synchronous garble depends on the number of ATCRBS 
transponder aircraft that are within 1.7 NM. of one another relative to the TCAS II interrogator.  In an aircraft density of 0.3 aircraft per sq. NM., as specified in 2.2.1.2.1, the maximum level of synchronous garble interference to surveillance of an ATCRBS transponder-equipped aircraft will occur when the aircraft is at approximately 5 NM. range to TCAS II.  In this density and at a range of approximately 5 NM. from TCAS II, the maximum number of other ATCRBS transponder aircraft within ±1.7 NM. of the ATCRBS target-of-interest is 22 when 100% of the transponder aircraft are ATCRBS equipped. 
 
In reality, the percentage of aircraft that are ATCRBS-equipped is expected to be much less than 100% (2.2.1.2.2) and will decrease further as more aircraft are fitted with Mode S transponders, therefore reducing the level of synchronous garble.  Also, the percentage of ATCRBS-equipped aircraft in an airspace will 
vary from region to region.  Subparagraph 2.2.4.5.4 addresses requirements that allow TCAS II to optimize its Mode C surveillance based on an estimate of the expected level of synchronous garble in a particular airspace. 

## 2.2.1.2.5 Maximum Level Of Multipath Interference 2.2.1.2.5.1 Transponder Reply

Note: Received transponder replies used for TCAS II surveillance will be subject to 
interference from delayed and distorted replicas of the same replies reflected from ground and water surfaces.  The degree of interference depends on the type of reflecting surface and whether the TCAS II antenna used for reception and the target transponder antenna used for transmission are top- or bottom-mounted. 
 
Measurements have shown that the largest multipath signal amplitudes, relative to the direct signal, occur when the reply path is from the bottom intruder antenna to the bottom TCAS II antenna and the reflection results from smooth water surfaces.  For this situation, the reflected multipath signal level can equal, and occasionally exceed, the level of the direct reply.  Use of a top-mounted TCAS II antenna will generally reduce the level of the multipath signal reflected from smooth water surfaces to approximately -15 dB relative to the direct reply.   
 
The surveillance requirements referenced in subparagraph 2.2.2.2 apply when TCAS II is subjected to this level of multipath interfering signals. 

## 2.2.1.2.5.2 Tcas Ii Interrogation

Note: TCAS II interrogation of transponders will be subject to interference from 
delayed replicas of the same interrogating signal reflected from ground and water surfaces.  The effect can produce conversion of a TCAS II Mode C interrogation to a transponder suppression signal or a Mode A interrogation. 
 
The relative levels of interrogation multipath signals on the interrogation link 
are the same as those described in subparagraph 2.2.1.2.5.1 for the reply link.  
The surveillance requirements referenced in subparagraph 2.2.2.2 apply when TCAS II is subjected to these interfering signals. 

## 2.2.1.3 Target-Of-Interest

Note: A target-of-interest is defined as a transponder-equipped intruder aircraft with 
altitude reporting capability. 
 
A target-of-interest is further defined by the following parameters. 

## 2.2.1.3.1 Maximum Closing Speed

Note: In lower altitude airspace the maximum relative closing speed between a targetof-interest and TCAS II is 500 knots and occurs when both aircraft are flying directly towards each other.  
 
In higher altitude airspace the TCAS II surveillance requirements referenced in subparagraph 2.2.2.2 are applicable for those intruder targets-of-interest that have maximum relative head-on closing speeds of up to 1200 knots.  The presence of closing speeds greater than 1200 knots will not affect the performance required against intruders closing at speeds of up to 1200 knots. 
 
 Lower altitude airspace is defined as being below 10,000 feet AGL and higher altitude airspace is defined as being at or above 10,000 feet AGL. 

## 2.2.1.3.2 Closing Speed As A Function Of Azimuth

Note: For given target-of-interest and TCAS II aircraft speeds, the maximum value of 
the relative closing speed for which TCAS II must satisfy the provisions of subparagraph 2.2.2.2 will occur only when the intruder aircraft is flying towards TCAS II and the relative velocity vector is aligned at 0 degrees azimuth with 
respect to TCAS II.  As the azimuth of the relative velocity vector changes from 0 degrees, the value of the relative closing speed for which TCAS II surveillance requirements referenced in subparagraph 2.2.2.2 apply will decrease. 
 
In lower altitude airspace, variable aircraft speeds up to a maximum value of 250 knots will result in an expected relative closing speed of no greater than 229 knots for intruders approaching from the side and no greater than 150 knots for intruders approaching from the rear. 
 
In higher altitude airspace, variable aircraft speeds up to a maximum of 600 knots will result in an expected relative closing speed of no greater than 566 knots for intruders approaching from the side and no greater than 400 knots for intruders approaching from the rear. 

## 2.2.1.3.3 Elevation Angle Relative To Tcas Ii

Note: The elevation angle associated with a target-of-interest is within ±10 degrees 
relative to the TCAS II aircraft flight path vector. 

## 2.2.1.3.4 Altitude Relative To Tcas Ii

Note: The altitude of a target-of-interest is within ±3000 feet relative to TCAS II. 

## 2.2.1.3.5 Minimum Agl Altitude

Note: The altitude of the target-of-interest is at least 200 feet above ground level. 

## 2.2.2 System Performance

Note: When operating within the maximum aircraft transponder population and 
electromagnetic interference levels defined in subparagraph 2.2.1.2, TCAS II will provide a level of performance for active surveillance of targets-of-interest that will support the requirements for generation of collision advisory information. 
 
Specifically, TCAS II will generate a surveillance track in range and altitude on a target-of-interest at the range and with the track probability and range accuracy specified below.  This is to ensure that a correct resolution advisory can be issued in time for the pilot to maintain adequate vertical separation at closest-point-of-approach. 
 
TCAS II will also generate, whenever possible, a surveillance track in range and altitude on a target-of-interest at the range and with the track probability and range accuracy specified below such that a correct traffic advisory can be issued as a precursor to the resolution advisory. 
 
In addition to the surveillance requirements to support generation of resolution and traffic advisories, TCAS II will display the range and, if available, the altitude and bearing position information on targets that generate advisories. The bearing position information will be generated according to the accuracy requirement specified below. 
 
TCAS II will also generate for display, whenever possible, surveillance range, altitude and bearing position information on Mode C and Mode S aircraft that are within the range specified below and within ±10,000 ft altitude relative to TCAS II. 

## 2.2.2.1 Surveillance Range 2.2.2.1.1 For Generation Of Resolution Advisories

Note: In higher altitude airspace the maximum intruder relative closing speed for 
TCAS II operation is 1200 knots.  Applying the threat logic parameter values associated with this airspace, the greatest range at which TCAS II will ever be required to generate a resolution advisory is 11.67 NM.  To allow time to establish a track, the maximum range for surveillance of a target-of-interest in higher altitude airspace and closing head-on is 14 NM.  Because of the reduction in the closing speed for intruders approaching from directions other than headon, the maximum surveillance range will be less.  For example, the maximum 
surveillance range for intruders approaching from the side is 8.8 NM. and from the rear, 5.0 NM. 
 
In lower altitude airspace the maximum range for surveillance of a target-ofinterest with a head-on closing speed of 500 knots is 4.0 NM.  For intruders approaching from the side and rear, the maximum surveillance range is 2.5 NM. and 1.4 NM. respectively. 
 
TCAS II will be able to maintain active surveillance in range and altitude on targets-of-interest to a minimum range of 1000 feet and on targets-of-interest that transition through closest-point-of-approach (CPA) when CPA equals or exceeds 1000 feet.   

## 2.2.2.1.2 For Generation Of Traffic Advisories

Note: The CAS logic specifies that a traffic advisory should be generated prior to a resolution advisory.  The limit on TCAS II radiated power due to ATC 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
electromagnetic compatibility considerations may prevent reliable surveillance for generation of timely traffic advisories on targets-of-interest that are closing at the maximum rates. 

 
Whenever possible and within the constraints imposed by TCAS II interference 
reduction power limiting (subparagraph 2.2.3.6), TCAS II will establish a surveillance track on a target-of-interest at a range that is consistent with the time that a traffic advisory is to be generated relative to the time of the resolution advisory. 

## 2.2.2.2 Surveillance Performance Objectives

Note: The TCAS equipment will meet or exceed the surveillance performance for both 
ATCRBS and Mode S targets as summarized in 2.2.2.2, if each of the specific surveillance requirements in 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 and the flight test requirement 
referenced in 2.2.2.2.2 are satisfied.   

## 2.2.2.2.1 General Surveillance Performance

Note: When operating within the environment defined in subparagraph 2.2.1.2, TCAS 
II will provide the following level of surveillance track reliability and accuracy on targets-of-interest (2.2.1.3) at the ranges specified in subparagraph 2.2.2.1 for generation of resolution advisories. 

## 2.2.2.2.1.1 Probability Of Track

Note: The probability that a surveillance track on an actual aircraft, consisting of 
either an updated or coasted value for range and altitude, exists on a given cycle will be equal to or greater than 90%. 

## 2.2.2.2.1.2 False Track Rate

Note: A false track is defined as a track for which an aircraft does not exist and can be 
the result of multipath interference, synchronous garble, fruit, noise, etc. 
 
The probability that a Mode S transponder-equipped aircraft track exists in the absence of an actual Mode S aircraft will be less than 0.1%. 
 
The probability that an ATCRBS transponder-equipped aircraft track exists in the absence of an actual ATCRBS aircraft will be less than 1.2%. 

## 2.2.2.2.2 Flight Test Surveillance Performance

Note: In addition to the general surveillance performance objectives of 2.2.2.2.1, TCAS 
II will provide the level of surveillance track performance specified in paragraph 3.4.4, "Certification Flight Test Procedures." 

## 2.2.2.2.3 Range Accuracy

Note: The overall range accuracy achievable by TCAS depends on the following error 
contributions to the measurement of reply arrival time: 
a. transponder reply delay and jitter b. apparent reply jitter due to the signal delay difference between the diversity 
transponder top and bottom antenna channel (including cable and antenna location) 
c. apparent reply jitter due to  transmit and receive delay differences between 
the TCAS top and bottom antenna channel (including cable and antenna location) 
d. TCAS range clock quantization e. TCAS system noise 
 
The first two error sources are associated with the transponder and are not under control of the TCAS manufacturer. Never-the-less, for received power levels at least 6 dB above MTL and for transponders meeting the characteristics specified in Mode S MOPS, DO-181A or later, TCAS should be able to achieve an overall range measurement with an error not exceeding 50 ft rms jitter for both Mode C and Mode S reports and 250 ft bias for Mode C reports and 125 ft bias for Mode S reports. 
 
Independent of transponder effects, the TCAS-only range measurement error (considering only c, d and e above) will not exceed 35 ft rms jitter for either Mode C or Mode S reports for received power levels at least 6 dB above MTL. 

## 2.2.2.2.4 Bearing Accuracy

Note: The error associated with the TCAS II measurement of target bearing is as 
specified in 2.2.4.6.4. 

## 2.2.3 Compatibility With Other Systems

The following subparagraphs of 2.2.3 address specific design features that are required of a TCAS II in order to comply with the ATCRBS, Mode S and TCAS II National Standards regarding electromagnetic and signal compatibility with elements of the Air Traffic Control System and to ensure standardization of interface signals between TCAS II and other systems on the TCAS II-equipped aircraft. 

## 2.2.3.1 Radiated Output Power

The power-gain product or Effective Radiated Power (ERP) in the forward direction associated with each radiated transmission pulse shall be a maximum of +56 dBm (400 W), and a minimum of +52 dBm (160 W), assuming full power operation. 

The power-gain product is related to Total Radiated Power (TRP), a variable used in the interference limiting algorithms, according to the following expression: 

$$T R P=P\cdot G\cdot(B W/360\mathrm{deg})$$
where P is the net power delivered to the RF reference point, G is the peak azimuth antenna gain at 0 degrees elevation relative to a matched quarter wave stub (
G
P 
 is the power-gain product), and BW is the 3 dB azimuth beamwidth in degrees.  The specified limit on radiated power is intended to prevent an excessive power transmission from causing premature interference limiting and in turn an unnecessary reduction in the dynamic range of the whisper-shout sequence.  

## 2.2.3.2 Unwanted Output Power

When the TCAS II interrogator is in the inactive state, the RF power at 1030 ±3 MHz at the terminals of the antenna shall not exceed -70 dBm.  The inactive state is defined to include the entire period between ATCRBS and/or Mode S interrogations less 10 microsecond transition periods, if necessary, preceding and following the extremes of the interrogation transmission. 

Note: This power restriction is necessary to ensure that TCAS II does not prevent the on-board Mode S transponder from meeting its sensitivity and interference rejection requirements. It assumes that the isolation between the TCAS II antenna and the Transponder antenna exceeds 20 dB. 

## 2.2.3.3 Interrogation Spectrum

The spectrum of a TCAS II Mode S or ATCRBS interrogation shall not exceed ththat specified in Table 2-3.

## 2.2.3.4 Interrogation Jitter

The transmission time of each ATCRBS interrogation sequence and each TCAS II Broadcast Interrogation shall be intentionally jittered about their nominal update interval.  
The jitter shall vary randomly, and be sufficient to prevent synchronous interference with other ground-based and airborne interrogators.  The maximum value of the jitter shall not exceed ±10% of the nominal update interval as defined in subparagraphs 2.2.4.1 and 2.2.3.10.2.4. 

Note: It may not be necessary to intentionally jitter Mode S surveillance interrogations 
if the Mode S interrogation scheduling process used has an inherently random nature. 

## 2.2.3.5 Transmit Frequency And Tolerance

The transmission frequency shall be 1030 ±0.01 MHz. 

## 2.2.3.6 Interference Limiting

The surveillance and collision avoidance functions of the TCAS II equipment will be capable of reliable operation in the traffic densities described in 2.2.1.2.  However, the TCAS II equipment must operate in regions of high traffic density without degrading the ATC electromagnetic environment.  The following paragraphs specify means for controlling electromagnetic interference to ATC by limiting interrogation rates and powers. 

## 2.2.3.6.1 Interference Limiting Formulas

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
TCAS II equipment at or below 18,000 ft barometric altitude shall control its interrogation rate or power or both to minimize interference effects; and it shall conform to a set of three specific inequalities, which are a means of ensuring that all interference effects resulting from these interrogations, together with the interrogations from all other TCAS II airborne interrogators in the vicinity, are kept to a low level. The limits on interrogation rate and power are functions of the local airborne environment.  In the process of checking for compliance with the limits, TCAS II shall count the number of other TCAS II airborne interrogators in the vicinity.  This count (NTA) shall be obtained by monitoring Mode S TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages with uplink format UF=16 (2.2.3.9.3.2.4.2, 2.2.3.10.2.4).  This transmission indicates that the aircraft is equipped with a TCAS II interrogator currently interrogating.  The MU field of this interrogation includes the 24-bit ICAO aircraft address of the transponder on the TCAS II aircraft.  Each TCAS II that is currently interrogating shall spontaneously transmit these interrogations at nominal 10-second intervals and at full power.  Each TCAS II shall monitor the receipt of such interrogations by own Mode S transponder to determine the number of other TCAS II units within detection range (nominally 30 NM).  Once each second, NTA shall be updated as the number of distinct TCAS II addresses monitored within the previous 20-second period. In addition to knowledge of NTA, proper operation of inequality 1 also depends on knowing the distribution of TCAS II interrogators in close vicinity.  Using this information and NTA, interference limiting inequality 1 can be matched to the local TCAS II environment.  Each scan, TCAS II shall estimate the distribution of other TCAS 
II aircraft by using range information derived from Mode S surveillance of those aircraft from which TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages have been received.  In order to achieve an accurate estimate of the distribution regardless of the level of interference limiting, TCAS II shall include only those TCAS II aircraft that are within 6 NM range. 

Each scan, the TCAS II distribution function within 30 NM and within 6 NM shall be characterized in the following manner. The distribution of TCAS II within 30 NM shall be computed as the ratio of the number of TCAS II within 30 NM to the number within 6 
NM. This ratio is proportional to a TCAS II distribution factor, 2, according to the following formula: 

$$\alpha_{2}{=}\log_{10}\biggl[N T A\Bigl/_{N T A_{6}}\biggr]\Bigl/\log_{10}25\ ,$$
where NTA is the TCAS II count derived from monitoring all TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages and NTA6 is the number of aircraft from which TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages have been received that are estimated to be within 6 NM. The distribution of TCAS II within 6 NM shall be computed as the ratio of the number of TCAS II within 6 NM to the number within 3 NM. This ratio is proportional to a TCAS 
II distribution factor, 1, according to the following formula: 

$$\alpha_{1}=1/4\ [N T A_{6}/N T A_{3}],$$
where NTA3 is the number of aircraft from which TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages have been received that are estimated to be within 3 NM. TCAS II aircraft that are operating on the ground or at or below a radio altitude of 2000 ft AGL shall include both airborne and on-ground TCAS II in the value for NTA3 and NTA6. Otherwise, TCAS II shall include only airborne TCAS II in the value for NTA3 and NTA6.  
Identification and surveillance of on-ground TCAS II can be accomplished by examining the VS field in the DF=0 acquisition reply to a UF=0 acquisition interrogation and by correlating the ICAO 24-bit aircraft address associated with the reply with the address received in the TCAS Broadcast Interrogation.    
The maximum value of 1 and 2 shall not exceed 1 which defines a uniform-in-area TCAS II distribution and the minimum value of 1 and 2 shall not be allowed to decrease below 0.5 which defines a uniform-in-range TCAS II distribution.  These constraints on 1 and 2 are imposed to ensure that the TCAS II surveillance range is always adequate for collision avoidance and that the maximum allowable interrogation power-rate product is always maintained at a reasonable level regardless of the measured distribution. 

The value of 1 shall be further constrained according to the following logic expressions: 
IF [(NTA61) OR (NTA6  4 AND NTA3   2 AND NTA > 25)] THEN 1 = 1.0 
IF [(NTA3 > 2) AND (NTA6 >2NTA3) AND (NTA < 40)] THEN 1 = 0.5 
The first expression addresses the case in which the measured TCAS II aircraft count within 6 NM is so low as to provide an unreliable estimate of the distribution factor, 1, 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
whereas the total TCAS II count within 30 NM is large enough relative to NTA6 to indicate a uniform-in-area distribution. The second expression addresses the case in which the measured TCAS II count within 3 and 6 NM indicates a localized uniform-inarea distribution but the total TCAS II count within 30 NM is low enough relative to NTA3 to indicate an overall uniform-in-range distribution. 

In order to minimize scan-to-scan variations in the value of 1 or 2 due to track fluctuations, the value of 1 or 2 shall be updated each scan using the following recursive filter: 
 = last scan +0.2(this scan - last scan) 
The value of  used in interference limiting inequality 1) shall be selected as the minimum of the smoothed values of 1 and 2. 

The three inequalities are: 

$\sum_{i=1}^{I}\left[\frac{P(i)}{250\,\text{watts}}\right]^{\alpha}\leq\text{thesmallerof}\left[\frac{280}{NTA+1},\frac{11}{\alpha^{2}}\right]$

$\sum_{i=1}^{I}M(i)\leq0.01\,\text{second}$

$\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left[\frac{PA(k)}{250\,\text{watts}}\right]\leq\text{thesmallerof}\left[\frac{80}{NTA+1},3\right]$
Variables in these inequalities are defined as follows: I is the total number of interrogations excluding air-to-air coordination interrogations transmitted by own TCAS II in a surveillance update interval. i is the index number for all interrogations other than coordination interrogations; i=1, 2, …, I. P(i) is the total radiated power (in watts) from the antenna for the i-th interrogation. NTA is the number of airborne TCAS II interrogators detected with a transponder receiver threshold of -74 dBm. B is the beam sharpening factor (ratio of interrogation beamwidth to reply beamwidth resulting from interrogation sidelobe suppression). M(i) is the duration of the mutual suppression interval for own transponder associated with the i-th interrogation. K is the total number of Mode C interrogations transmitted by own TCAS II in a surveillance update interval. k is the index number for Mode C interrogations; k=1, 2, …, K. 

PA(k) is the total radiated power (in watts) from the antenna for the k-th Mode C 
interrogation.  is a variable derived from surveillance of TCAS II aircraft and is used to match inequality 1) to the measured distribution of nearby TCAS II aircraft. 

Notes: 1. 
The factor B is approximately 1.2 for a four-beam directional antenna. 
2. 
The three inequalities are associated with the following physical mechanisms:  1) reduction in "on" time of other transponders caused by TCAS II interrogations, 2) reduction in "on" time of own transponder caused by mutual suppression during transmission of interrogations, and 3) ATCRBS fruit caused by TCAS II Mode C interrogations.  Inequality (1) ensures that a "victim" transponder will never detect more than 280 TCAS II interrogations in a one-second period from 
all the TCAS II interrogators within 30 NM.  The left-hand side of the inequality allows a TCAS II unit to increase its interrogation rate if it transmits at less than 250 W since low-power transmissions are detected by fewer transponders.  The denominator of the first term on the right-hand side of this inequality accounts for other TCAS II interrogators in the vicinity and the fact that all TCAS II units must limit their interrogation rate and power in a similar manner so that, as the number of TCAS II units in a region increases, the interrogation rate and power from each of them decreases and the total TCAS II interrogation rate for any nearby transponder remains less than 280 per second.  If the victim is taken off the air for 35 microseconds by suppression or reply dead time whenever it receives a TCAS II interrogation, the total "off" time caused by TCAS II 
interrogations will then never exceed 1%. The term 11/2 on the right-hand side 
ensures that an individual TCAS II unit with a four-beam directional interrogation antenna and operating in a uniform-in-area TCAS II distribution 
(i.e., =1) never transmits more average power than it would if there were 
approximately 26 other TCAS II units nearby or if operating in a uniform-inrange distribution (i.e., =0.5) never transmits more average power than it 
would if there were approximately 6 other TCAS II units nearby. 
 
Inequality (2) ensures that the transponder on board the TCAS II aircraft will not 
be turned off by mutual suppression signals from the TCAS II unit on the same aircraft more than 1% of the time. 
 
Inequality (3) ensures that a victim ATCRBS transponder will not generate more than 40 ATCRBS replies in a one-second period in response to interrogations from all the TCAS II interrogators within its detection range.  Like inequality (1) it includes terms to account for reduced transmit power, to account for the other TCAS II interrogators in the vicinity, and to limit the power of a single TCAS II unit.  40 ATCRBS replies per second is approximately 20% of the reply rate for a transponder operating without TCAS II in a busy area of multiple ATCRBS ground sensor coverage. 

## 2.2.3.6.2 Interference Limiting Procedures

At the beginning of each surveillance update interval,  and NTA shall be determined as indicated in subparagraph 2.2.3.6.1.  The value  shall then be used to: 

a. modify each normalized Mode C and Mode S interrogation value in the left hand 
limits of inequality 1) prior to its summation over the surveillance update interval, and 
b. modify the fixed term in the right-hand limits of inequality (1). 
NTA shall then be used to evaluate the current right-hand limits in inequalities (1) and (3). Smoothed values (8 second averages) of the Mode S contributions to *P(i)* and *M(i)* shall also be used to calculate the left hand limits of inequalities 1) and 2).  Air-to-air coordination interrogations shall be transmitted at full power.  These interrogations need not be included in the summations of Mode S interrogations in the left-hand terms of these inequalities.  If the smoothed value of the left-hand side of either inequality (1) or (2) equals or exceeds the current limit and own TCAS aircraft is below 18,000 ft barometric altitude, both the Mode S and the Mode C surveillance parameters shall be modified to satisfy the inequalities.  If the left-hand side of inequality (3) exceeds the current limit and own TCAS is below 18,000 ft barometric altitude, Mode C surveillance shall be modified to satisfy the inequality. In both cases, hysteresis of ±500 ft relative to the 18,000 ft altitude boundary shall be applied to prevent fluctuations in interference limiting due to small altitude deviations. Mode C surveillance sensitivity shall be modified by reducing the interrogation power and by increasing the receiver MTL during the Mode C listening period.  If a high resolution whisper-shout interrogation sequence is used (2.2.4.5.4.1.2), Mode C surveillance shall be modified by sequentially eliminating steps from the whisper-shout sequence.  If the minimum basic whisper-shout interrogation sequence or a single interrogation is used (2.2.4.5.4.1.1 or 2.2.4.5.4.1.5 respectively), Mode C surveillance shall be modified by reducing the power level of each step within the whisper-shout sequence or each single interrogation sequentially for each beam.  Each whisper-shout or power reduction step is uniquely associated with a receiver MTL setting.  Thus, the receiver sensitivity in Mode C surveillance periods will be automatically tailored to match these power reductions. The overall surveillance sensitivity for Mode S targets shall be reduced by reducing the interrogation power and by increasing the receiver MTL during all Mode S squitter listening periods.  Once such a change has been made the only change allowed during the ensuing 8 seconds is a reduction in the number of whisper-shout steps if such is needed to satisfy Inequality (3).  This 8-second freeze allows the effect of the Mode S changes to become apparent since the 8-second averages used in Inequalities (1) and (2) then will be determined by the behavior of the system since the change.   

Note: This will indirectly reduce the Mode S interrogation rate by reducing the target 
count.  Many Mode S interrogations are acquisition interrogations transmitted to targets of unknown range.  It is thus not effective to directly control the Mode S interrogation rate simply by dropping long-range targets from the track file. 
The Mode C and Mode S surveillance sensitivity reductions shall be accomplished such that the TCAS II equipment is not prematurely limited and has the capability of using at least 75% of the allowance specified in the three limiting equations for all mixes of target types and for all densities up to the maximum density capability of the system.  When the value of any of the smoothed limits is exceeded, the appropriate action shall be taken to limit interference within one surveillance update interval.  Means shall be provided for gradually restoring the surveillance sensitivity when the environment subsequently improves enough to allow the interference limits to be relaxed. 

The maximum allowed interference limiting power reduction for each top antenna beam for an airborne TCAS shall be 10 dB for Mode S interrogations and 7 dB for Mode C interrogations. Section A.1 in Appendix A describes one possible implementation of the interference limiting procedure. 

## 2.2.3.6.3 Interrogations From Tcas On The Ground

Whenever the TCAS aircraft determines that it is on the ground, TCAS interrogations shall be limited by setting the NTA count in the interference limiting inequalities to a value three times the measured value. This value will ensure that a TCAS operating on the ground does not add unnecessary interference by transmitting at power levels greater than is necessary to provide local area surveillance prior to departure. The modified value of NTA will provide an approximate surveillance range of 3 NM. in the highest density terminal areas to support reliable ground TCAS surveillance of local airborne traffic and a 14 NM range in very low density airspace to provide wide area surveillance in the absence of an SSR. The interference limiting adjustment of interrogation power and receiver MTL for TCAS on the ground shall be accomplished as described in 2.2.3.6.2 except that the Mode C interrogation power and sensitivity in the forward top beam shall be reduced first until the forward whisper-shout sequence matches the sequence in the right and left beams. The forward, right and left beam interrogation powers and sensitivities shall then sequentially be reduced until they match the rear beam interrogation power and sensitivity. Further interference limiting shall be accomplished by sequentially reducing the forward, side and rear beam interrogation power and sensitivity. The maximum allowed interference limiting power reduction for a TCAS on the ground shall be as follows: 

a. Forward beam:  
13 dB for Mode S and 10 dB for Mode C. 
b. Side beam:  
 
13 dB for Mode S and 6 dB for Mode C 
c. Rear beam:  
 
13 dB for Mode S and 1 dB for Mode C 
A TCAS aircraft shall recover the surveillance range capability that would ordinarily result using interference limiting with a direct value of NTA and an alpha () value equal to one within three surveillance update intervals following the transition from an on-theground status to an airborne status. The value of alpha shall then be allowed to achieve its normal value according to 2.2.3.6.1. Appendix A, Section A.12 describes one acceptable method of ensuring that TCAS recovers its normal airborne surveillance range capability in a timely manner following a transition from on-the-ground status to an airborne status.  

## 2.2.3.6.4 Interrogations From Tcas Above 18,000 Ft Barometric Altitude

Whenever the TCAS aircraft is flying above 18,000 ft barometric altitude, TCAS shall not be subject to interference limiting inequality 2) or to the increased interference limiting provided by inequalities 1) and 3) due to the added presence of other nearby TCAS aircraft (NTA).  A revised form of interference limiting is still necessary in order to prevent each TCAS from transmitting unlimited power during each surveillance update interval.  To retain the fixed upper limit on interrogation power and rate contained within inequalities 1) and 3) in 2.2.3.6.1, TCAS equipment above 18,000 ft barometric altitude shall conform to the following revised forms of interference limiting inequalities 1) and 
3) which have been modified to eliminate the terms 280/(NTA+1) and 80/(NTA +1) and to fix  equal to 1 regardless of the distribution of TCAS:   
 

$$4)\ \sum_{i=1}^{I}\left[{\frac{P(i)}{250\,{\mathrm{watts}}}}\right]\leq1\,1$$
 

$$5)\ {\frac{1}{B}}\ \sum_{k=1}^{K}\left[{\frac{P A(k)}{250\,{\mathrm{watts}}}}\right]\leq3$$

## 2.2.3.7 Subparagraph Not Used 2.2.3.8 Transmit Pulse Characteristics 2.2.3.8.1 Mode C Transmissions

Mode C interrogations from TCAS II equipment shall employ the "Mode-C-Only All-
Call" format which consists of three pulses P1, P3, and P4.  This shall normally be preceded by a Mode C "whisper-shout" suppression pulse designated S1 (see subparagraph 2.2.4.5.4.1).  Sidelobe suppression is accomplished by transmitting a P2 
pulse via a separate control pattern.  These formats are illustrated in Figure 2-1.  The pulses shall have shapes and spacings as tabulated below except that the rise and decay time may be less than shown in the table, providing the side-band radiation does not exceed the spectral limits tabulated in subparagraph 2.2.3.3.  The amplitude of P3 shall be within 0.5 dB of the amplitude of P1, and the amplitude of P4 shall be within 0.5 dB of the amplitude of P3.  The amplitude of S1 is specified in subparagraph 2.2.4.5.4.1.

P1 to P3  21 ±0.10 microseconds;

Note: The tolerance values on these pulse widths, spacings, and amplitudes are smaller than the signal-in-space tolerance values defined in Ref. B in order to provide margin for waveform distortion due to multipath. 

## 2.2.3.8.2 Mode S Transmissions

Mode S transmissions shall consist of P1, P2, and P6 pulses as shown in Figure 2-2. The pulses shall have shapes and spacings as tabulated below except that the rise and decay time may be less than shown in the table, providing the side-band radiation does not exceed the spectral limits tabulated in subparagraph 2.2.3.3.

The short (16.25-microsecond) and long (30.25-microsecond) P6 pulses shall have internal modulation consisting of possible 180-degree phase reversals of the carrier at designated times.  The first phase reversal in the P6 pulse is the sync phase reversal and is always present.  The presence or absence of a subsequent phase reversal indicates a one or zero in the transmitted code respectively. 

Note 1: The sync phase reversal is the timing reference provided to identify chip positions to Mode S interrogation decoders. 

The duration of a phase reversal in P6 shall be less than 0.08 microsecond as measured between the 10-degree and 170-degree points of the phase transition.  The interval between the 80-percent points of the amplitude transient associated with the phase reversal shall be less than 0.08 microsecond. 

The tolerance on the 0- and 180-degree phase relationships in P6 shall be ±5 degrees. 

The 90-degree point of each data phase reversal in P6 shall occur only at a time (N x 0.25) 
±0.02 microsecond (N .GE. 2) after the 90-degree point of the sync phase reversal. 

Note 2: 56 or 112 data phase reversals can occur in the 16.25 and 30.25-microsecond P6 
pulses respectively.  This results in a 4 Mbit/sec data rate within the P6  pulses. 
The spacing from P1 to P2 shall be 2 ±0.04 microseconds between leading edges.  The spacing from the leading edge of P2 to the 90-degree point of the sync phase reversal of P6 shall be 2.75 ±0.04 microseconds.  The leading edge of P6 shall occur 1.25 ±0.04 
microseconds before the sync phase reversal. 

 

Note 3: The P1-P2 pair preceding P6 suppresses replies from ATCRBS transponders to 
avoid synchronous garble due to random triggering of ATCRBS transponders by 
Mode S interrogations.  A series of "chips" containing the information within P6 
starts 0.5 microsecond after the sync phase reversal.  Each chip is of 0.25 microsecond duration and is preceded by a possible phase reversal.  If preceded 
by a phase reversal, a chip represents a logic "1".  There are either 56 or 112 
chips.  The last chip is followed by a 0.5 microsecond guard interval which 
prevents the trailing edge of P6  from interfering with the demodulation process. 
The radiated amplitudes of P2 and the initial first microsecond of P6 shall be greater than the radiated amplitude of P1 minus 0.25 dB.  The maximum envelope amplitude variation between successive phase modulation chips in P6 shall be less than 0.25 dB. 

Note 4: The tolerance values on these pulse widths and spacings and the location of the 
sync phase reversal are smaller than the signal-in-space tolerance values defined in Ref. B in order to provide margin for waveform distortion due to multipath reflections. 

## 2.2.3.9 Mode S Message Field Formats

Note: Ref. B describes the message formats and coding that are used in specified Mode S transmissions.  The following paragraphs further define Mode S formats and information coding used for the transmission of TCAS II messages. 

## 2.2.3.9.1 Data Blocks

The Mode S interrogation and reply data blocks can contain either 56 or 112 bits. 

## 2.2.3.9.2 Format Structure

Mode S transmission formats consist of 56 or 112 bits of which 24 bits are used for address/parity information and the remainder are used for data transfer.  The interrogation and reply formats that are used by TCAS II or can contain TCAS II information are presented in Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4. 

Note: Fields shown in these figures that do not specifically pertain to TCAS II are not 
described in this document, but are described in Ref. B.   

## 2.2.3.9.2.1 Bit Numbering And Sequence

In the description of the information fields contained in Mode S transmissions, bits are numbered consecutively with bit 1 being transmitted first.  Numerical values encoded by groups of bits are encoded with the most significant bit (MSB) transmitted first.  Bits designated as "not assigned" are transmitted as all 0s, and are reserved for assignment in the future.   

## 2.2.3.9.2.2 Fields

Information is coded in fields that consist of one or more bits.  The decimal equivalent of the binary code formed by the bit sequence within a field is used as the designator of the field function. 

Note: As an example, the 5-bit UF field is used to designate the uplink format type.  A 
surveillance interrogation requesting identity has in its UF field position the bit 
sequence 00101.  Since 001012 = 510, this format is designated as UF=5. 
Codes designated as "not assigned" or "unassigned" are reserved for future assignment. Fields containing numeric data are encoded in positive binary notation unless otherwise noted.  The least significant bit (LSB) value and the allowed range of values are included for all numeric quantities.  Unless otherwise noted, when the value of a numeric quantity is outside the indicated range of values, it will be encoded as equal to the nearest end point of the range.  Unless otherwise noted, the coded value of a numeric quantity is the quantized value nearest the actual value of the quantity (i.e., the value is rounded off rather than truncated).  If the actual value is half way between the two nearest quantized values, the larger of the two quantized values shall be used. 

## 2.2.3.9.2.2.1 Essential Fields

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Each Mode S transmission contains two essential fields.  The first essential field is a format descriptor which occurs at the beginning of the transmission.  This field is designated UF (Uplink Format) for interrogations and DF (Downlink Format) for replies. The UF and DF codes pertinent to this MOPS are given in Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4 respectively.  The second essential field is a 24-bit field which contains either the Mode S

Notes: (1) ( XX:  M) denotes a field designated "XX" which is assigned M bits. 
(2) ---N--- denotes unassigned coding space, N bits; must be set to all ZEROs. 
 
(3) The format number in the above downlink formats (DF) corresponds to the binary code in the first 5 bits of the  
 
 
reply. 
 
address or the ground interrogator identity overlaid on parity as described in Ref. B, 2.2.16.2.1.  This field is either designated AP (Address/Parity) or PI (Parity/Identity) and is located at the end of the transmission.   

## 2.2.3.9.2.2.2 Mission Fields

The remaining coding space is used to transmit the mission fields.  For specific missions, a specific set of fields is prescribed.   
Note: All mission fields described in this MOPS are assigned two-letter designators. 

## 2.2.3.9.2.2.3 Subfields

Subfields may appear within mission fields.  The name, length (number of bits) and coding of a defined subfield are the same wherever the subfield appears; however, the location and protocol for use may vary. 

Note: Subfields of mission fields are labeled with three-character alphanumeric 
designators within this MOPS.  Subfields of three-character designator subfields are labeled with four-character alphanumeric designators within this MOPS. 

## 2.2.3.9.3 Field Descriptions

For all mission fields and subfields processed by the airborne TCAS II equipment, the location and coding are described in the following paragraphs.  This description duplicates the description found in Ref. B.  Mission fields and subfields defined in Ref. B are described in subparagraph 2.2.3.9.3.1.  Mission fields and subfields that are further defined in this document are described in subparagraph 2.2.3.9.3.2.  Table 2-6 provides an index of all described fields and the three-character designator subfield groups (if any) within them.   

## 2.2.3.9.3.1 Fields And Subfields Defined By Reference B.

Location and coding of mission fields and subfields that are required for transmission of TCAS II information and that are specified by Ref. B are described in alphabetical order in the following paragraphs. 

Note: Certain codes in the mission fields described below that are designated "not 
assigned" in Ref. B are assigned for TCAS II use and are specified in this section. TCAS II mission fields not defined by Ref. B are defined in subparagraph 2.2.3.9.3.2.  

## 2.2.3.9.3.1.1 Aa Address, Announced

This 24-bit (9-32) downlink field contains the aircraft address in the clear and is used in DF=11, the All-Call reply, and in DF=17, the Extended Squitter. 

## 2.2.3.9.3.1.2 Ac Altitude Code

When operated in the Mode S system, the 13-bit AC field (bits 20-32 transmitted in the short and long special surveillance reply, the altitude surveillance reply, and the altitude Comm-B reply) contains the encoded altitude of the aircraft.  The altitude is encoded as follows: 

a. Bit 26 is designated as the M bit, and is ZERO if the altitude is reported in feet.  M 
equals ONE is reserved for possible future use to indicate that the altitude reporting is in metric units. 
Note: Use of the M bits as defined here does not alter any conventions regarding the X bits in ATCRBS replies. 

b. If M equals ZERO, bit 28 is designated as the Q bit.  Q equals ZERO is used to 
indicate that the Mode S altitude is reported in 100 ft. increments as defined in c. below.  Q equals ONE is used to indicate that the altitude is reported in 25 ft. increments as defined in d. below. 
Note: Bit 28 (Q) corresponds to the D1 pulse of a Mode C reply and is not used in the ATCRBS altitude code. 

c. If M and Q both equal ZERO, the altitude is coded according to the pattern of Ref. A, 
2.7.13.2.5.  Starting with bit 20, the sequence is C1, A1, C2, A2, C4, A4, ZERO, B1, ZERO, B2, D2, B4, D4. 
d. If M equals ZERO and Q equals ONE, the 11-bit field represented by bits 20 to 25, 
27 and 29 to 32 represents a binary-coded field whose least significant bit has a value of 25 feet.  The binary value of the decimal number N is used to report pressure altitudes in the range (25xN-1000 ±12.5) feet. 
Note: The most significant bit of this field is bit 20.  This code is able to provide code values only between -1000 ft. and +50,175 ft.  The coding used for Mode C replies in c. above must be used to report pressure altitudes greater than 50,175 ft. 

e. ZERO is transmitted in each of the 13 bits of the AC field if altitude information is 
not available. 

## 2.2.3.9.3.1.3 Aq Acquisition, Special

This 1-bit (14) uplink field appears in special surveillance formats UF=0, 16.  This field is used to designate the UF=0 or 16 interrogation as an acquisition transmission (2.2.3.10.2.2.1). The codes are: 
0 = Non-acquisition interrogation. 1 = Acquisition interrogation. 

This bit is repeated as received by the transponder in bit 14 of the RI field of DF=0, 16 (2.2.3.9.3.1.14). 

## 2.2.3.9.3.1.4 Bds: Comm-B Data Selector

This 8-bit (15-22) uplink field appears in short special surveillance format UF=0. It contains the identity of the ground-initiated Comm-B register whose contents are requested to appear in the MV field of the corresponding reply. 

Note: A GICB request containing BDS=8 will cause the resulting reply to contain the aircraft identification message in its MV field.  

## 2.2.3.9.3.1.5 Ca Capability

This 3-bit (6-8) downlink field reports transponder capability and is used in DF=11, the All-Call reply, and in DF=17, the Extended Squitter. The codes reported by RTCA/DO-181 transponders are: 

 
0 = No extended capability report available. 1 = Comm A/B and extended capability report available. 2 = Comm A/B/C and extended capability report available. 3 = Comm A/B/C/D and extended capability report available. 
4-7 = Not assigned. 
 
The codes reported by RTCA/DO-181A or later transponders are: 
 

0 = Signifies no communications capability (surveillance only), no ability to 
set CA code 7, either on the ground or airborne. 
1 = Not used. 2 = Not used. 3 = Not used. 4 = Signifies at least Comm-A and Comm-B capability, ability to set CA 
code 7, on the ground. 
5 = Signifies at least Comm-A and Comm-B capability, ability to set CA 
code 7, airborne. 
6 = Signifies at least Comm-A and Comm-B capability, ability to set CA 
code 7, either on the ground or airborne. 
7 = Signifies DR is NOT equal to zero (Ref. B, 2.2.14.4.8), or FS equals 2, 3, 
4, 5, either on the ground or airborne (2.2.3.9.3.1.8).

## 2.2.3.9.3.1.14 Ri Air-To-Air Reply Information

This 4-bit (14-17) downlink field appears in special surveillance formats DF=0, 16.  This field contains information pertaining to replying aircraft.  Where airspeed is reported (2.2.3.10.2.3.1), the maximum true airspeed flown in normal operations is given using the coding shown below. The RI field reports "No On-board TCAS" (RI=0) if the TCAS unit has failed or sensitivity level is 1.  The RI field reports "On-Board TCAS with no resolution capability" (RI=2) if resolution advisories are inhibited (sensitivity level is 2 or TA-Only mode has been selected). 

The codes are: 
0 = No on-board TCAS. 1 = Not assigned. 2 = On-board TCAS with no resolution capability. 

3 = On-board TCAS with vertical-only resolution capability. 4 = On-board TCAS with vertical and horizontal resolution capability 
5-7 = Not assigned. 

8 = No maximum airspeed data available. 9 = Airspeed .LE. 75 knots. 

10 = Airspeed .GT.  75 knots and .LE. 150 knots. 11 = Airspeed .GT. 150 knots and .LE. 300 knots. 12 = Airspeed .GT. 300 knots and .LE. 600 knots. 13 = Airspeed .GT. 600 knots and .LE. 1200 knots. 14 = Airspeed .GT. 1200 knots. 15 = Not assigned.  

## 

Bit 14 of this field replicates the AQ bit (2.2.3.9.3.1.3) of the interrogation.  That is, codes 0-7 indicate that this is a reply to an air-to-air non-acquisition interrogation; codes 8-15 indicate that this is an acquisition reply.   

## 2.2.3.9.3.1.15 Rl Reply Length

## 2.2.3.9.3.1.17 Sd Special Designator

When the Designator Identification field (DI, bits 14-16) has a code value of 1 or 7, the Special Designator field (SD, bits 17-32) of each Comm-A interrogation is used to obtain the Interrogator Identifier Subfield (IIS) and the Linked Comm-A Subfield (LAS). 

Subfields in SD: 

IIS: 
Interrogator Identifier - This 4-bit (17-20) subfield contains the selfidentification code of the ground interrogator and may take on the values 0 through 15.  IIS=0 is not a valid interrogator identifier code for 
multisite purposes.   
LAS: Linked Comm-A Subfield - This 3-bit (30-32) subfield contains coding 
for the linking of Comm-A message segments.  LAS=0 indicates a single segment Comm-A message.  A TCAS Sensitivity Level Command (2.2.3.9.3.2.2) is transmitted only in a single segment Comm-A message; i.e., TCAS should ignore Comm-A messages if LAS0. 

## 

Note: The 4-bit TMS subfield previously used for linking of Comm-A messages is now 
composed of a spare bit (bit 29) and the 3-bit LAS subfield (bits 30-32).  When checking for LAS=0, care must be taken to examine only the three LAS bits, not 
bit 29 also.  See Ref. K. 

## 2.2.3.9.3.1.18 Vs Vertical Status

This 1-bit (6) downlink field appears in special surveillance formats DF=0, 16. The codes are: 
0 = aircraft airborne 1 = aircraft on the ground 

## 2.2.3.9.3.2 Tcas Ii Fields And Subfields

The following paragraphs describe the location and coding of those mission fields and subfields that are not defined in Ref. B, but are used by aircraft equipped with TCAS II. 

## 2.2.3.9.3.2.1 Subparagraph Not Used 2.2.3.9.3.2.2 Ma Fields Used By Tcas Ii

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Ground-based Mode S sensors may use the MA field of Comm-A interrogations (2.2.3.9.3.1.9) to transmit a TCAS Sensitivity Level Command Message to airborne TCAS II equipment. Subfields in MA for a TCAS Sensitivity Level Command Message DP: Data Packet Type - This 1-bit (33) subfield indicates the data packet type.  For the TCAS SLC Message, DP=0 (indicating that the type is MSP, or Mode S Specific Protocol). MP: MSP Packet Type - This 1-bit (34) subfield indicates the MSP packet type (short or long).  For the TCAS SLC Message, MP=0 (indicating that the type is short). M/CH: MSP Channel Number - This 6-bit (35-40) subfield identifies the type of information contained in the MSP packet.  For the TCAS SLC Message, M/CH=5. 

Note: Bits 33-40 were formerly referred to as the ADS subfield.  The three subfields shown above serve the identical function for TCAS purposes.  See Ref. K. 

SLC: TCAS Sensitivity Level Command - This 4-bit (41-44) subfield contains a sensitivity level command for the TCAS II aircraft. 

The codes are: 
0 = No command issued 1 = Not assigned. 2 = Select TA-Only mode of TCAS operation. 3 = Set TCAS sensitivity level to 3. 4 = Set TCAS sensitivity level to 4. 5 = Set TCAS sensitivity level to 5. 6 = Set TCAS sensitivity level to 6. 7 = Set TCAS sensitivity level to 7. 

8-14 = Not assigned. 

15 = Cancel previous sensitivity level command from this site. 

Notes: 

1. 
The SD field (2.2.3.9.3.1.17), containing subfields IIS and LAS, is also used in a TCAS Sensitivity Level Command Message. 
2. 
The structure of MA for a TCAS Sensitivity Level Command Message is: 

| Position     |   # of Bits  | Subfield     | Remarks      |

## 2.2.3.9.3.2.3 Mb Fields Used By Tcas Ii

TCAS II uses the MB field (2.2.3.9.3.1.10) of Comm-B replies to transmit RA Reports and Data Link Capability Reports to Mode S sensors.  This field always contains the 8-bit BDS (B-Definition Subfield). 

Note: DO-185A,B TCAS II units are expected to operate properly when connected to 

DO-185A,B compatible Mode S transponders and also to FAA TSO-C119A 
compatible Mode S transponders.  As described in 2.2.3.13.2.1.1, the capability 
of the TCAS/transponder system is limited to the capability of either the 
transponder or the TCAS unit having the least capability.  DO-185A,B 
compatible systems use the formats in 2.2.3.9.3.2.3.1.1 and 2.2.3.9.3.2.3.2.1.  
FAA TSO-C119A compatible systems use the formats in 2.2.3.9.3.2.3.1.2 and 
2.2.3.9.3.2.3.2.2.  Formats in 2.2.3.9.3.2.3.1 and 2.2.3.9.3.2.3.2 are common to 
both systems. 

## 2.2.3.9.3.2.3.1 Subfields In Mb For Ra Report

BDS: B-Definition Subfield - This 8-bit (33-40) subfield defines the data contained in the remainder of MB.  For convenience in coding, BDS is expressed in two groups of 4 
bits each, BDS1, 33 through 36, and BDS2, 37 through 40.  An RA Report is indicated by BDSl=3 and BDS2=0, the combination of which is equivalent to BDS=48. 

Note:  For 18 ±1 seconds following the end of an RA, all MB subfields in the RA Report 
(with the exception of bit 59 (RAT) for DO-185A,B systems) are "frozen," i.e., retain the information reported at the time the RA was last active. 

## 2.2.3.9.3.2.3.1.1 Subfields In Mb For Ra Report - Do-185A,B Systems

ARA: Active RA - This 14-bit (41-54) subfield indicates the currently active RA (if any) generated by own TCAS II unit against one or more threat aircraft.  The bits in ARA have meanings determined by the value of the MTE subfield and the value of bit 41 of ARA. The meaning of bit 41 of ARA is as follows: 

0 = Different vertical senses have been generated in a multi-threat situation 
(when MTE=1); or no RA has been generated (when MTE=0). 
1 = The same vertical sense has been generated in a single or multi-threat 
situation. 
When ARA bit 41=1 and MTE=0 or 1, bits 42-47 have the following meanings:

| 48-54   | Reserved for TCAS IV                                       |

## 

Note: When ARA bit 41=0 and MTE=0, no vertical RA has been generated. 

RAC: RA Complements - This 4-bit (55-58) subfield indicates the currently active RA complements (if any) received from all other TCAS aircraft equipped with an on-board resolution capability. The bits in RAC have the following meanings: 

| Bit               |     | RAC                |
|-------------------|-----|--------------------|
| 55                |     | Do not pass below  |
| 56                |     | Do not pass above  |
| 57                |     | Do not turn left.  |
| 58                |     | Do not turn right. |
|                   |     |                    |

A bit set to '1' indicates that the associated condition is active.  A bit set to '0' indicates that the associated condition is inactive. RAT: RA Terminated indicator - This 1-bit (59) subfield indicates when an RA previously generated by TCAS has ceased being generated. Coding: 
0  = The RA indicated by the ARA subfield is currently active. 1  = The RA indicated by the ARA subfield has been terminated. 

Notes: 

1. 
After an RA has been terminated by TCAS, it is still required to be reported by the Mode S transponder for 18±1 seconds.  The RA Terminated indicator may be used, for example, to permit timely removal of an RA indication from an air 
traffic controller's display, or for assessments of RA duration within a particular airspace. 
2. 
RAs may terminate for a number of reasons: normally, when the conflict has been resolved and the threat is diverging in range; or when the threat's Mode S transponder for some reason ceases to report altitude during the conflict.  The RA terminated indicator is used to show that the RA has been removed in each of these cases. 
MTE: Multiple Threat Encounter - This 1-bit (60) subfield indicates whether two or more simultaneous threats are currently being processed by the TCAS threat resolution logic. Coding: 

0 = One threat is being processed by the resolution logic (when ARA bit 
41=1); or no threat is being processed by the resolution logic (when ARA bit 41=0). 
1 = Two or more simultaneous threats are being processed by the resolution 
logic. 
TTI: 
Threat Type Indicator - This 2-bit (61-62) subfield defines the type of identity data contained in the TID subfield. Coding: 

0 
= No identity data in TID 
1 
= TID contains a Mode S transponder address 
2 
= TID contains altitude, range, and bearing data 
3 
= Not assigned 
TID: 
Threat Identity Data - This 26-bit (63-88) subfield contains the ICAO 24-bit aircraft address of the threat or the altitude, range, and bearing if the threat is not Mode S equipped.  If two or more threats are simultaneously processed by the TCAS resolution logic, TID contains the identity or position data for the most recently declared threat.  If TTI=1, TID contains in bits 63-86 the ICAO 24-bit aircraft address of the threat, and bits 87 and 88 are set to ZERO.  If TTI=2, TID contains the following three subfields. TIDA: Threat Identity Data Altitude - This 13-bit (63-75) subfield contains the most recently reported Mode C altitude code of the threat. Coding:

## 2.2.3.9.3.2.3.1.2 Subfields In Mb For Ra Report - Faa Tso-C119A Systems

ARA: Active RA - This 14-bit (41-54) subfield indicates the currently active RA (if any) generated by own TCAS II unit against one or more threat aircraft.   
Each bit in the ARA subfield is a dedicated bit representing a specific condition.  The bits in ARA have the following meaning: 

|    Bit   | ARA                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| 41       | Climb.                              |
|  42      | Don't descend.                      |
|   43     | Don't descend faster than 500 FPM.  |
|  44      | Don't descend faster than 1000 FPM. |
| 45       | Don't descend faster than 2000 FPM. |
| 46       | Descend.                            |
| 47       | Don't climb.                        |
| 48       | Don't climb faster than 500 FPM.    |

| 54       | Don't turn right.                   |

A bit set to '1' indicates that the associated condition is active.  A bit set to '0' indicates that the associated condition is inactive.  In RA Reports transmitted by TCAS systems without horizontal resolution capability, bits 51 through 54 are set to '0'. RAC: RA Complements - This 4-bit (55-58) subfield indicates the currently active RA complements (if any) received from all other TCAS aircraft equipped with an on-board resolution capability. Each bit in the RAC subfield is a dedicated bit representing a specific condition.  The bits in RAC have the following meaning: 

|    | Bit     | RAC                |
|----|---------|--------------------|
| 55 |         | Do not pass below  |

Bits 69, 70: 
On-Board Resolution Capability Bits - Bits 69 and 70 form a capability code subfield which indicates aircraft's on-board resolution advisory generation capability. 
The codes are: 

0 = No on-board resolution advisory generation capability. 1 = An on-board vertical-only resolution advisory generation capability 
exists.  
2 = An on-board vertical and horizontal resolution advisory generation 
capability exists (not applicable to FAA TSO-C119A systems). 
3 = Not assigned.  

## 2.2.3.9.3.2.4 Mu Fields Used By Tcas Ii

TCAS II uses the MU field (2.2.3.9.3.1.12) of a long special surveillance interrogation (UF=16) to transmit three types of messages: (1) TCAS Resolution Messages for air-toair coordination, (2) TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages to indicate own presence and identity for the purpose of controlling interference caused by TCAS II interrogations, and (3) RA Broadcast Interrogation Messages to allow monitoring of TCAS RA activity. 

## 2.2.3.9.3.2.4.1 Subfields In Mu For A Tcas Resolution Message

UDS: U-Definition Subfield - This  8 bit (33-40) subfield defines the data content and coding in the remainder of MU.  For convenience in coding, UDS is expressed in two groups of 4 bits each, UDS1, 33 through 36, and UDS2, 37 through 40.  TCAS Resolution Messages shall be identified by UDS1=3 and UDS2=0, the combination of which is equivalent to UDS=48. MTB: Multiple Threat Bit - This 1-bit (42) subfield indicates a multiple threat. The codes are: 
0 = Interrogating TCAS II has no more than one threat. 1 = Interrogating TCAS II has more than one threat. 

 
CVC: Cancel Vertical Resolution Advisory Complement - This 2-bit (43-44) subfield is used by airborne TCAS II equipment to cancel a vertical resolution advisory complement sent to an equipped threat aircraft. The codes are: 
0  = No cancellation. 1  = Cancel, don't descend. 2  = Cancel, don't climb. 3  = Not assigned. 

 
VRC: Vertical Resolution Advisory Complement - This 2-bit (45-46) subfield is used by airborne TCAS II equipment to send a vertical resolution advisory complement (don't climb or don't descend) to the equipped threat aircraft. The codes are: 
0 = No vertical resolution advisory complement sent. 1 = Don't descend. 2 = Don't climb. 3 = Not assigned. 

 
CHC: Cancel Horizontal Resolution Advisory Complement - This 3-bit (47-49) subfield is used by TCAS with horizontal on-board resolution equipment to cancel a horizontal resolution advisory complement sent to an equipped threat aircraft.  In TCAS Resolution Messages transmitted by TCAS without horizontal resolution capability, CHC is set to the zero code. 

The codes are: 

0 
= No cancellation. 
1 
= Cancel, don't turn left. 
2 
= Cancel, don't turn right. 
3-7 = Not assigned. 
 
HRC: Horizontal Resolution Advisory Complement - This 3-bit (50-52) subfield is used by TCAS with horizontal on-board resolution equipment to send a horizontal resolution maneuver complement (don't turn left or don't turn right) to the equipped threat aircraft. In TCAS Resolution Messages transmitted by TCAS without horizontal resolution capability, HRC is set to the zero code. The codes are: 

0 
= No horizontal resolution advisory complement sent 
1 
= Other TCAS sense is turn left; don't turn left 
2 
= Other TCAS sense is turn left; don't turn right 
3-4 = Not assigned 5 
= Other TCAS sense is turn right; don't turn left 
6 
= Other TCAS sense is turn right; don't turn right 
7 
= Not assigned 
 
HSB: Horizontal Sense Bits - This 5-bit (56-60) subfield is a parity coding field used to protect the six horizontal sense bits (47-52).  The originating TCAS will include bits 56- 60 in all TCAS Resolution Messages sent.  The receiving TCAS will examine bits 56-60 in TCAS Resolution Messages received.  If bits 47-52 are not in agreement with bits 56- 60 as shown in the table below, the receiving TCAS will assume there is an error in the message and will not use the message contents.

## 2.2.3.9.3.2.5 Mv Fields Used By Tcas Ii

TCAS II uses the MV field of a long special surveillance reply (2.2.3.9.3.1.13) to transmit a Coordination Reply Message to the requesting TCAS aircraft.   
Note: DO-185A,B TCAS II units are expected to operate properly when connected to 

DO-185A,B compatible Mode S transponders and also to FAA TSO-C119A compatible Mode S transponders.  As described in 2.2.3.9.2.1.1, the capability of the TCAS/transponder system is limited to the capability of either the transponder or the TCAS unit having the least capability.  DO-185A,B compatible systems use the formats in 2.2.3.9.3.2.5.1.1.  FAA TSO-C119A compatible systems use the formats in 2.2.3.9.3.2.5.1.2.  Formats in 2.2.3.9.3.2.5.1 are common to both systems. 

## 2.2.3.9.3.2.5.1 Subfields In Mv For A Coordination Reply Message

VDS: V-Definition Subfield - This 8-bit (33-40) subfield defines the data content and coding in the remainder of MV.  For convenience in coding, VDS is expressed in two groups of 4 bits each, VDS1, 33 through 36, and VDS2, 37 through 40.  The airborne TCAS equipment is a source of long special surveillance reply MV messages containing the VDS1=3 code.  A Coordination Reply Message is indicated by VDS1=3 and VDS2=0, the combination of which is equivalent to VDS=48.

## 2.2.3.9.3.2.6 Sl Tcas Ii Sensitivity Level Report

This 3-bit field (9-11) appears in special surveillance reply formats DF=0, 16.  This field reports the sensitivity level at which the TCAS II unit is currently operating.   
The codes are: 
0 = No TCAS II sensitivity level reported. 1 = TCAS II is operating at sensitivity level 1. 2 = TCAS II is operating at sensitivity level 2. 

3 = TCAS II is operating at sensitivity level 3. 4 = TCAS II is operating at sensitivity level 4. 5 = TCAS II is operating at sensitivity level 5. 6 = TCAS II is operating at sensitivity level 6. 7 = TCAS II is operating at sensitivity level 7. 

## 2.2.3.9.3.2.7 Unassigned Coding Space

Unassigned coding space, as indicated in Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4, is reserved for future use.  Zeroes are to be transmitted by interrogators and transponders in these bit positions.   

Note: This rule ensures that future assignments in this coding space define a "zeroblock" as a default code, i.e., no message is sent and/or no capability exists.   

## 2.2.3.10 Tcas Ii Signal Protocol 2.2.3.10.1 Mode C Surveillance Signals 2.2.3.10.1.1 Atcrbs-Only All-Call Interrogation

For surveillance of aircraft equipped with ATCRBS transponders, the ATCRBS-Only All-Call interrogation shall be used (Ref. B, 2.1.11.3.2).   

Note: This interrogation format causes all ATCRBS-only equipped aircraft to reply and 
all Mode S equipped aircraft not to reply.  The absence of replies from Mode S transponders is desirable since such replies would add to the interference environment.  Absence of these replies from the TCAS II synchronous 
interference environment is particularly beneficial.   

## 2.2.3.10.2 Mode S Surveillance Signals

Note: The following paragraphs describe the interactions between an airborne TCAS II 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
and a Mode S equipped aircraft required for the proper functioning of the TCAS II Mode S surveillance tasks. 

## 2.2.3.10.2.1 Detection

TCAS II detects the presence of Mode S-equipped aircraft by listening at 1090 MHz to Mode S transmissions with DF=11 (All-Call reply).  TCAS II may also detect the presence of Mode S-equipped aircraft by optionally listening to Mode S transmissions with DF=17 (Extended Squitter).  Mode S transponder transmissions with DF=11 may occur in response to Mode S ground sensor All-Call interrogations or as squitters at a maximum period of 1.2 seconds.  Mode S transponder transmissions with DF=17 occur as extended squitters at a maximum period of 0.6 seconds. 

Note: The option to acquire Mode S transponders through use of the Extended Squitter 
is likely to become a requirement in the future. 
The Capability field, CA, in DF=11 transmissions from RTCA/DO-181A or later transponders (2.2.3.9.3.1.5) indicates whether the vertical status of the Mode S equipped aircraft is airborne, on the ground, or unknown.  TCAS shall make use of the CA field information from DO-181A or later transponders to prevent interrogations to aircraft that are on the ground that do not have an operational TCAS II. The altitude of Mode S-equipped aircraft not indicated to be on the ground or aircraft with DO-181 transponders is then determined by passively monitoring transmissions received from that aircraft with DF=4 (surveillance reply with altitude) or with DF=0 (short special surveillance), or by actively interrogating the aircraft to elicit a short special surveillance reply. TCAS II derives the ICAO 24-bit aircraft address of Mode S-equipped aircraft from the AA field of the All-Call reply.  Additionally, TCAS II shall examine the Vertical Status field, VS, in the DF=0 transmissions from the aircraft in order to minimize interrogations and prevent tracking of aircraft on the ground.   

Note: If the aircraft is on the ground and is under Mode S ground surveillance, TCAS II 
may also be able to determine that the aircraft is on the ground by monitoring the FS field in downlink formats DF=4, 5, 20, 21   (2.2.3.9.3.1.8).   

## 2.2.3.10.2.2 Surveillance Interrogations 2.2.3.10.2.2.1 Acquisition

TCAS II shall use the short special surveillance interrogation, UF=0, for range acquisition.  TCAS II shall set AQ=1 in acquisition interrogations.  This serves as an aid in distinguishing the reply to own interrogation from replies elicited by other TCAS II equipment.  In addition, TCAS II shall set RL=0 in acquisition interrogations to command short acquisition replies, DF=0.   

## 2.2.3.10.2.2.2 Tracking

TCAS II shall use the short special surveillance interrogation, UF=0, for tracking (nonacquisition) interrogations.  TCAS II shall set AQ=0 and RL=0 (to command a short reply, DF=0) in tracking interrogations. 

## 2.2.3.10.2.3 Surveillance Replies

On receipt of a short special interrogation, UF=0, or a long special interrogation, UF=16, the interrogated Mode S transponder replies with a short special reply, DF=0, or a long special reply, DF=16, depending on the code contained in the RL field of the interrogation.  In this reply, the sensitivity level and the air-to-air reply information are reported in the SL and RI fields.  Operating airborne TCAS II equipment shall cause the SL field to be set appropriately to indicate the sensitivity level at which it is currently operating (2.2.3.9.3.2.6).  Non-operating airborne TCAS II equipment shall cause RI=0 to be set.  If RI=0 is set, the SL field has no meaning.   

## 2.2.3.10.2.3.1 Acquisition

On receipt of a short or long special surveillance interrogation containing a '1' in the AQ field (acquisition interrogation), the interrogated Mode S transponder reports only the maximum airspeed capability of the aircraft in the RI field (2.2.3.9.3.1.14) of the reply; codes 0 through 7 are not used in this reply.   
Note: The protocol described above for the RI field implicitly identifies the reply as an acquisition reply through RI because the first bit of RI is effectively an echo of AQ(=1) received in the acquisition interrogation.   

## 2.2.3.10.2.3.2 Tracking

On receipt of a short or long special surveillance interrogation containing a '0' in the AQ field (non-acquisition interrogation), the interrogated aircraft sets, as appropriate, a code in the 0 through 7 block of codes in the RI field of the reply; codes 8 through 15 are not used in this reply.   
Note: The protocol described above for the RI field implicitly identifies the reply as a tracking (non-acquisition) reply through RI because the first bit of RI is effectively an echo of AQ(=0) received in the tracking interrogation.  

## 2.2.3.10.2.4 Tcas Broadcast Interrogations

TCAS II shall use the long special surveillance interrogation, UF=16, with UDS=50 and a broadcast address to transmit periodic TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages (2.2.3.9.3.2.4.2) to other TCAS II equipment within its range.  A broadcast address with UF=16 causes transponders associated with TCAS II equipment to accept the transmission without replying and to present the interrogation content at the transponder/TCAS interface (Ref. B, 2.2.17.1.11).  TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages contain the ICAO 24-bit aircraft address of the interrogating TCAS II aircraft and allow the interrogating TCAS II to determine the number of other TCAS II-equipped aircraft within its detection range for the purpose of limiting interference (2.2.3.6.1). TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages shall be transmitted at full power and shall be transmitted such that, for any other TCAS II aircraft within 30 NM. and at any azimuth, the nominal rate of own TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages arriving at that TCAS II is 1 per 8 to 10 seconds. 

## 2.2.3.10.3 Coordination With Other Aircraft

Note: The following paragraphs describe the actions required for TCAS II in order to carry out the air-to-air coordination function. Corresponding requirements are placed upon the Mode S transponder associated with each TCAS II. These transponder requirements appear in Ref. B, 2.2.20.  

## 2.2.3.10.3.1 Transmission Of Coordination Interrogations To Other Tcas Aircraft

When TCAS II declares another aircraft reporting RI=3 or 4 to be a threat, interrogations to that aircraft shall be transmitted for resolution advisory coordination.  Coordination interrogations shall use the TCAS Resolution Message format and shall be transmitted each update period to the other aircraft as long as the other aircraft remains a threat. If necessary, the TCAS II equipment shall re-interrogate to accomplish successful transmission of the TCAS Resolution Message.  In this case, interrogations shall be transmitted within a 100 ±5 millisecond period and shall consist of not less than six nor more than twelve interrogation attempts nominally spaced at equal intervals over the duration of this period.  Interrogations shall be randomly jittered about the nominal spacing by at least 360 microseconds in order to prevent synchronous interference with other ground-based and airborne interrogators. If the maximum number of attempts is made and no reply is received, TCAS II shall continue its resolution process without further attempts to coordinate with this threat during the current update period. A TCAS Resolution Message sent by TCAS II shall use the long special surveillance interrogation, UF=16, with the MU field containing the fields specified in 2.2.3.9.3.2.4.1 and the following codes: 

 
AQ  
= 0  (non-acquisition interrogation). 

RL  
= 1  (respond with long reply). 

HRC  = 0  (no horizontal complement sent). CHC  = 0  (no horizontal complement to be canceled). 

HSB  = 0  (Parity associated with combined HRC, CHC fields).  

 
Coordination interrogations shall also be transmitted to an aircraft declassified from threat status within one update period following cancellation of the resolution advisory with respect to that threat.  In this case, the CVC subfield shall contain a cancellation code for the previously sent VRC. 

## 2.2.3.10.3.2 Processing Of Coordination Interrogations Received From Other Tcas Aircraft

TCAS II shall have the capacity to retain information corresponding to at least ten concurrent threats for any mix of Mode C- and Mode S-equipped threats.  For coordination purposes, this means that TCAS II shall be able to store incoming TCAS Resolution Messages corresponding to at least ten unique ICAO 24-bit aircraft addresses. TCAS II shall prevent simultaneous access to data by different processes within TCAS II by means of a coordination lock state.  TCAS II shall enter the coordination lock state before accessing any data for which the potential for simultaneous data access exists. When in the coordination lock state TCAS II shall prevent access to such data except by the process that initiated the coordination lock state. 

Notes: 

1. 
Processing of a TCAS Resolution Message consists of storing the received VRC corresponding to a particular TCAS aircraft and updating the RA Complements (RAC), a composite of all received VRCs. 
2. 
A more general restatement of the above requirement follows.  Care must be taken to prevent simultaneous data access by concurrent processes.  A process that is interrupted or suspended while another task executes is considered concurrent with the interrupting or suspending task.  The potential for simultaneous data access exists because incoming TCAS Resolution Messages are received asynchronously to background TCAS processing, effectively interrupting this processing. 

## 2.2.3.10.3.3 Coordination Timing Requirements

Note 1: TCAS Resolution Messages from other TCAS aircraft are received by own TCAS 
II's Mode S transponder and passed to own TCAS II via the transponder/TCAS interface. 
The TCAS II processor must be able to receive TCAS Resolution Messages from the transponder and process these messages at a continuous rate of 16.6 milliseconds (60 per second).  Of the 60 messages per second, at most 10 messages per second are unique. 

Note 2: The 60 message-per-second requirement derives from the requirement for TCAS 
II to retain information for at least ten concurrent threats.  If all of these threats were TCAS-equipped, and if each threat transmitted the maximum of 12 TCAS Resolution Messages per second, theoretically 120 TCAS Resolution Messages per second could be received.  The requirement for reception of TCAS Resolution Messages was set at half the theoretical maximum. 
TCAS Resolution Messages received from the transponder shall be available for TCAS processing within 6 milliseconds of receipt by the TCAS II processor. 

Notes: 

3. 
This requirement assumes a maximum input rate from the transponder of one message every 16.6 milliseconds (60 per second). 
4. 
Assuming a new message arrives every 16.6 milliseconds, 16.6 milliseconds should be the maximum lag in queuing a received message for processing.  In order to provide clear specifications for testing, the approximately 16 milliseconds has been divided between the transponder and the TCAS II processor as follows: ten milliseconds from receipt by the transponder to delivery to the TCAS II processor and 6 milliseconds from receipt by the TCAS II processor until the message is queued, ready for processing.  
If own aircraft is the initiator of a coordination lock state (e.g., if it is performing coordination processing for a particular threat), it shall not remain in the coordination lock state longer than 0.03 second nominally.  If own aircraft is responding to a coordination initiated by an intruder (i.e., if own aircraft is processing an incoming TCAS Resolution Message), it shall not remain in the coordination lock state longer than 0.01 second nominally unless several TCAS Resolution Messages are processed sequentially in a single coordination lock state, in which case the duration of the lock state shall not exceed 0.01 second nominally per message. 

## 2.2.3.10.4 Communication With Mode S Ground Sensors

Note: The TCAS II processor provides information to its associated  Mode S 
transponder for inclusion in replies to a Mode S ground sensor.  TCAS II requirements associated with downlinking information to a Mode S ground sensor are stated in subparagraphs 2.2.3.10.4.1 and 2.2.3.10.4.2 below and in subparagraph 2.2.3.13.2.2.  Corresponding transponder requirements are given in  Ref. B, 2.2.20.1.2.1, 2.2.20.1.2.2, and 2.2.20.3.4, a. and b. 

 
Information transmitted by a Mode S ground sensor to a TCAS II is received by the TCAS II's associated Mode S transponder and passed to TCAS II via the transponder/TCAS interface.  TCAS II requirements associated with receiving 
and processing uplinked information from a Mode S sensor are stated in subparagraph 
2.2.3.10.4.3 
below 
and 
in 
subparagraph 
2.2.3.13.2.3.  
Corresponding transponder requirements are given in  Ref. B, 2.2.20.1.1. 

## 2.2.3.10.4.1 Ra Report

Whenever a TCAS RA exists, i.e., whenever there is an active RA, the TCAS II processor shall indicate this fact to its associated Mode S transponder and shall provide the necessary MB subfields to the transponder for inclusion in an RA Report (2.2.3.9.3.2.3.1).  In addition, the TCAS II processor shall provide a means for the transponder to determine when the RA is no longer active. For DO-185A,B systems, an active RA shall be indicated by use of an RA Indicator (RAI) bit.  RAI = '0' indicates that there is an active RA; RAI = '1' indicates that there is no active RA.  For FAA TSO-C119A systems, an active RA shall be indicated by a nonzero ARA subfield; a zero ARA subfield indicates there is no active RA. 

Note: Following the end of an RA, the transponder retains the RA Report for an additional 18±1 seconds in order to allow read-out by a ground sensor's rotating antenna. 

## 2.2.3.10.4.2 Data Link Capability Report

The TCAS II processor shall provide TCAS capability information to its associated Mode S transponder for inclusion in a Data Link Capability Report (2.2.3.9.3.2.3.2). 

## 2.2.3.10.4.2.1 Tcas Unit Part Number And Tcas Software Part Number

If the DO-185B TCAS unit is paired with a Mode S transponder reporting DO-185A,B compatibility (see 2.2.3.13.2.1.1), then TCAS shall determine whether the ―software part number enable‖ discrete input is enabled.  If so, TCAS shall transmit its TCAS unit part number to transponder register E5 hex and shall transmit its TCAS software part number to transponder register E6 hex.  TCAS shall initiate the E5 and E6 transmissions to the transponder once per 10 seconds with a tolerance of plus one or minus one second.  
Formats for transponder registers E5 and E6 are defined in Attachment 19L of ARINC 
Characteristic 735B [Ref. L]. 

## 2.2.3.10.4.3 Tcas Sensitivity Level Control

Control of the TCAS sensitivity level can be accomplished by one or more ground-based Mode S sensors through the transmission of Comm-A interrogations, UF=20, 21, containing TCAS Sensitivity Level Command Messages (2.2.3.9.3.2.2) to the TCAS II aircraft.  The interrogator identification information required to correlate the sensitivity level command (SLC) with a particular originating ground-based Mode S sensor site is contained in the IIS subfield (2.2.3.9.3.1.17) of SD of the same Comm-A.  Upon receipt of a TCAS SLC Message, TCAS II shall store the TCAS sensitivity level value by site. TCAS II shall time each site's SLC separately and shall cancel the SLC if it is not refreshed by another Comm-A TCAS SLC Message from that site within 240 seconds. TCAS II shall immediately cancel a site's SLC if SLC code 15 is received from that site.  

## 2.2.3.10.5 Communication With Other Ground Equipment 2.2.3.10.5.1 Ra Broadcast Interrogations

TCAS shall use the long special surveillance interrogation, UF=16, with UDS=49 and a broadcast address (i.e., 24 ONES) to transmit RA Broadcast Interrogations.  RA Broadcast Interrogations shall be transmitted at full power from the bottom antenna at jittered, nominally 8-second, intervals for the period that the RA is active.  Additionally, one interrogation, indicating RA termination, shall be transmitted immediately after the RA is concluded.  The RA Broadcast Interrogation shall include the MU field as specified in 2.2.3.9.3.2.4.3 and shall describe the most recent RA that existed during the preceding 8-second period.  Installations using directional antennas shall operate such that complete circular coverage is provided nominally every 8 seconds and the same RA sense and strength is broadcast in each direction. 

Note: This allows RA activity to be monitored in areas where Mode S ground station 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
surveillance coverage does not exist by using special RA broadcast signal receivers on the ground.  RA broadcasts are normally destined for ground equipment but are defined as uplink transmissions. 

## 2.2.3.10.6 Mode S Crosslink Capability

TCAS may optionally be implemented with the capability to request and receive groundinitiated Comm-B register information from Mode S transponders able to provide this information.  The following paragraph describes the interaction required between an airborne TCAS with this optional capability and a Mode S-equipped aircraft to properly carry out the Mode S crosslink function. TCAS identifies those Mode S transponders able to support the crosslink capability by examining the CC field in short special surveillance format DF=0 replies.  TCAS can then request the contents of a specific Comm-B register in a Crosslink-capable Mode S transponder by setting RL=1 and designating the identity of the register in the BDS field of a short special surveillance format UF=0 interrogation addressed to that transponder. In response to this request, the Mode S transponder will reply with a long special surveillance format DF=16 in which the MV field contains the requested Comm-B 
register data. In particular, in response to a UF=0 with RL=1 and BDS=8, the transponder will reply with a DF=16 in which the MV field contains the aircraft identification message (B: 
Appendix 1, Section 4.0).  In response to a UF=0 with RL=1 and BDS=0, the transponder will reply with a DF=16 with an MV field of all 0s. 

## 2.2.3.10.7 Extended Squitter With Aircraft Identification Message

TCAS may optionally be implemented to receive and decode the content of the ME field in format DF=17 Extended Squitters containing the aircraft identification message.  The aircraft identification message is identified by format type code 1, 2, 3 or 4 in the first five bits of the message field, and the contents of the message are defined in Ref. G. 

## 2.2.3.11 Compatibility With Own Mode S Transponder

The TCAS II equipment will operate in conjunction with and in close proximity to a Mode S transponder.  This imposes design requirements on the Mode S transponder that are not covered in Ref. B so that TCAS II requirements stated herein can be met. Similarly, the functions of TCAS II equipment shall not in any way cause the Mode S transponder to fail to meet its performance requirements as specified in Ref. B. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to identify all areas where incompatibilities may arise and to design and construct his equipment so that the requirements of Ref. B. and this document are met when both equipment are operating. Two general areas of potential incompatibility are identified below as examples; others may be found to exist in accordance with specific equipment designs. 

a. The first area of possible incompatibility concerns the methods used to interface the 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

transponder and the TCAS II equipment.  It is not within the scope of this document to control or test specific interface design details within the TCAS II.  It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to verify that his equipment does in fact interface in such a way that all overall logical, protocol, timing and other requirements or constraints imposed on the combined operation of the two functional entities have been fulfilled under any possible combination of operating conditions. 
This may be accomplished by conducting all testing with both functions fully operative and performing their normal functions by means of simulated inputs and/or outputs.  For example, when tests are under way to verify that the TCAS II equipment requirements of this document are met, the Mode S transponder could be periodically interrogated by simulated input signals near its MTL level. 

b. The second area of potential incompatibility concerns electromagnetic interference.  
Since each unit generates transmission signals at the receiver frequency of the other, it is possible for signals from one to degrade the performance of the other.   
All of the TCAS II requirements stated in this document shall be met when the TCAS II equipment is operating in conjunction with an operating Mode S transponder with the possible exception of those times that the Mode S transponder is active.  The active state of the Mode S transmitter is defined as either the time interval between the leading edge of the first transmitted pulse of a reply minus 10 microseconds and the trailing edge of the last transmitted pulse of that reply plus 10 microseconds, or the time interval during which a mutual suppression occurs, whichever is greater. 

## 2.2.3.12 Aircraft Suppression Bus

The TCAS II equipment shall issue a 70 ±1 microsecond suppression pulse to other on-board aircraft equipment beginning at each interrogation transmitted from the topmounted antenna.  The TCAS II equipment shall issue a 90 ±1 microsecond suppression pulse to other equipment for each interrogation from the bottom antenna. The TCAS II equipment shall be designed to accept and respond to interference suppression pulses from other electronic equipment in the aircraft (to disable it while the other equipment is transmitting). The TCAS equipment shall regain normal sensitivity, within 3 dB, not later than 15 microseconds after the end of the applied interference suppression pulse. 

Note: The suppression duration must be longer than the interrogation to ensure the on-

board transponder does not respond to reflections of the TCAS II interrogations from the ground.  The durations specified above have been determined experimentally to be adequate for this purpose.  This document does not establish the design parameters of the interference suppression system other than the durations.  However, it is recommend that all sources of interference suppression pulses be DC coupled and sinks be AC coupled.  This standardization will prevent source or sink failures from disabling all users of the interference suppression pulses. 

## 2.2.3.13 Interfaces With Other Systems 2.2.3.13.1 Mode S Transponder Related Interfaces

The TCAS II equipment shall accept the following from its associated Mode S transponder: 

a. The aircraft ICAO 24-bit aircraft address. 
b. The aircraft Pressure Altitude from the source that is the basis for own Mode S 
altitude replies.  If coarse altitude is indicated, TCAS shall round the altitude to the 
nearest 100 feet. 
c. Quantization for pressure altitude (fine [10 ft or less] or coarse [more than 10 ft]). 
Note: DO-181A and later versions state that: (1) when selecting the altitude source used for Mode S replies and for TCAS, the transponder shall use the source that is valid and provides the finest quantization, and (2) the altitude data shall be provided to TCAS at the finest quantization available. 

d. The aircraft Mode A Identity Code. 

## 2.2.3.13.2 Tcas Ii Interface With Mode S Transponder

The TCAS II equipment shall maintain two first-in-first-out input queues, high priority and low priority, in which to store messages received from the Mode S transponder via the transponder/TCAS interface.  TCAS Resolution Messages shall be placed in the high priority Resolution Message queue.  All other messages (TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages, Sensitivity Level Command Messages, and periodic own aircraft data messages) shall be placed in the low priority Mode S Message queue. 

Note: The manufacturer may combine the functions of the Mode S transponder with 
those of the TCAS II system in a single unit with internal interfacing or may implement these functions in two separate units connected via a remote interface. The requirements below apply in either case. 

## 2.2.3.13.2.1 General Requirements Of The Interface To The Mode S Transponder 2.2.3.13.2.1.1 Tcas/Transponder System Capability Determination

TCAS shall annunciate to its associated Mode S transponder that TCAS is DO-185A,B compatible.  Likewise, TCAS shall receive from its associated Mode S transponder an annunciation stating either that the transponder is DO-185A,B compatible or that it is FAA TSO-C119A compatible.  The capability of the TCAS/transponder system shall be limited to the capability of either the TCAS unit or the transponder having the least capability.  That is, if the transponder is DO-185A,B compatible, then the TCAS/transponder system shall be considered DO-185A,B compatible; if the transponder is FAA TSO-C119A compatible, then the TCAS/transponder system shall be considered FAA TSO-C119A compatible. The RF formats for RA Reports, Data Link Capability Reports, and Coordination Reply Messages are different for DO-185A,B systems and FAA TSO-C119A systems. Therefore, when providing information to the transponder for inclusion in an RA Report, Data Link Capability Report, or Coordination Reply Message, TCAS shall use the format and protocol appropriate for the determined TCAS/transponder system capability.   
Note: It is expected that the TCAS II equipment will be able to properly function in a two-transponder aircraft configuration in which the pilot can switch from a DO- 185A,B compatible transponder to an FAA TSO-C119A compatible transponder and vice versa. 

## 2.2.3.13.2.1.2 Data Reception

No other processing shall prevent the receipt by the TCAS II equipment of an incoming message on the transponder/TCAS interface.  Incoming TCAS Resolution Messages shall be processed before any other messages on the transponder/TCAS interface, in the order in which they are received.  Messages received on the transponder/TCAS interface other than TCAS Resolution Messages shall be processed in the order in which they are received after all TCAS Resolution Messages have been processed. 

## 2.2.3.13.2.1.3 Data Integrity

The interface between the TCAS II equipment and the transponder shall be designed to provide communication in the normal operational aircraft environment for that class of TCAS II equipment while assuring error rates of less than one detected error in 10**3 messages and less than one undetected error in 10**7 messages for transfers in both directions.  Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated either by direct test in a simulated operational environment or by analysis based on the known characteristics of proven interface techniques. The TCAS II equipment shall provide a means to acknowledge all non-periodic messages sent to or received from the Mode S transponder.  A failure in the acknowledgment procedure shall be recognized by TCAS II as a loss of integrity and shall be treated as a TCAS II failure. 

Note: Incomplete data transmission can result in erroneous execution of the CAS logic algorithms. 

## 2.2.3.13.2.2 Data Provided By The Tcas Ii Equipment To The Mode S Transponder 2.2.3.13.2.2.1 Data Provided To Own Transponder For Use In Special Surveillance Replies (Df=0, 16)

a. Contents of the SL Field 
The TCAS II equipment shall provide to the Mode S transponder an SL value as specified in 2.2.3.9.3.2.6.  The interface between TCAS II and the Mode S transponder shall be such that a changed value of sensitivity level will be reported in any special surveillance reply, DF=0, 16, made one second or more after the change occurs within TCAS II. 

b. Contents of the RI Field 
The TCAS II equipment shall provide to the Mode S transponder an RI value as specified in 2.2.3.9.3.1.14.  The interface between TCAS II and the Mode S transponder shall be such that a changed resolution capability will be reported in any special surveillance reply, DF=0, 16 made one second or more after the change occurs within TCAS II. 

## 2.2.3.13.2.2.2 Data Provided To Own Transponder For Use In Altitude And Identity Surveillance And Comm-B Replies (Df=4, 5, 20, 21)

a. Contents of the DR Field 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Whenever a TCAS RA exists, the TCAS II equipment shall indicate this fact to its associated Mode S transponder.  This will cause the transponder to set the 'TCAS' bit in the DR field in appropriate replies.  The interface between TCAS II and the Mode S transponder shall be such that a changed DR code will be reported in any DF=4, 5, 20, or 21 reply made one second or more after the corresponding RA change occurs within TCAS II. 

## 2.2.3.13.2.2.3 Data Provided To Own Transponder For Use In Long Special Surveillance Replies (Df=16)

a. Coordination Reply Message 
The TCAS II equipment shall provide to the Mode S transponder MV subfield values as specified in 2.2.3.9.3.2.5. 

Note: MV subfield values transmitted by the transponder in a Coordination Reply Message reflect the most recent  MV subfield values received from the TCAS II. 

## 2.2.3.13.2.2.4 Data Provided To Own Transponder For Use In Altitude And Identity Comm-B Replies (Df=20, 21)

a. RA Report 
The TCAS II equipment shall provide to the Mode S transponder MB subfield values as specified in 2.2.3.9.3.2.3.1. 

Note: Following the end of an RA, the transponder retains the RA Report for an additional 18±1 seconds in order to allow read-out by a ground sensor's rotating antenna. 

b. Data Link Capability Report 
The TCAS II equipment, when operating correctly, shall provide to the Mode S transponder TCAS capability information as specified in 2.2.3.9.3.2.3.2.  If the performance monitoring function determines that TCAS II is no longer able to operate or the TCAS II capability is turned off, TCAS II shall be capable of conveying this fact to the transponder no later than 1 second after such failure. 

Note: Ref. B: 2.2.17.1.12.8 specifies that the transponder will recognize a change in TCAS capability and will automatically initiate a revised basic data link capability report by Comm-B broadcast. 

## 2.2.3.13.2.3 Data Received By The Tcas Ii Equipment From The Mode S Transponder 2.2.3.13.2.3.1 Data Received In Long Special Surveillance Interrogations (Uf=16) From Other Tcas Aircraft Via Own Mode S Transponder

a. TCAS Resolution Message 
TCAS II shall receive from the Mode S transponder values for MTB, CVC, VRC, CHC, HRC, HSB, VSB, and MID as specified in 2.2.3.9.3.2.4.1.  

b. TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Message 
TCAS II shall receive from the Mode S transponder values for MID as specified in 2.2.3.9.3.2.4.2. 

## 2.2.3.13.2.3.2 Data Received In Altitude And Identity Comm-A Interrogations (Uf=20, 21) From Mode S Ground Stations Via Own Mode S Transponder

a. Sensitivity Level Message  
TCAS II shall receive from the Mode S transponder values for SLC as specified in 2.2.3.9.3.2.2 and values for IIS and LAS as specified in 2.2.3.9.3.1.17. 

## 2.2.3.13.3 Other Interfaces

The following additional interfaces shall be provided to the TCAS II equipment: 

a. A manual input for control of sensitivity levels. b. An input of height above ground from a radio altimeter, i.e., radio altitude. In 
addition, if the radio altimeter has its own integral failure monitor, e.g., as required by Ref. E, the outputs from such an integral failure monitor shall also be provided (subparagraph 2.2.7.2.5.2.1).  The minimum operational range for radio altimeters used with TCAS shall be [0 ft, 1,850 ft] AGL.   
c. Track file output of surveillance track data for use in evaluating the success or failure 
of test procedures specified in Subsection 2.4. 

## 2.2.3.13.3.1 Optional Interfaces

As an option, additional inputs from the aircraft may be provided to the TCAS  II equipment 

a. Altitude alerter input. 
Note: The collision avoidance algorithms in Volume II contain provisions for such 
an altitude alerter. It is recommended that the algorithms be implemented with these provisions.  However, the actual furnishing of this input to TCAS 
is an option.  The collision avoidance algorithms in Volume II have been 
designed to function even when the altitude alerter input is not available. 
b. The on-the-ground indicator. 

## 2.2.4 Surveillance Requirements 2.2.4.1 Surveillance Update Rate

The nominal surveillance update rate for all aircraft that satisfy the requirements for generation of a traffic or resolution advisory shall be 1 per second.  That is, the nominal "surveillance update interval" is one second. The total interrogation rate shall be controlled by the interference limiting procedures of subparagraph 2.2.3.6. 

## 2.2.4.2 System Delay

The TCAS II equipment shall display the correct resolution advisory within 1.5 seconds after receipt of the first reply that causes the target's track to indicate the need for a Resolution Advisory. 

## 2.2.4.3 Differential Channel Delay

The total difference in mean transmitter delay between the top and bottom antenna channels (including the TCAS II-to-antenna transmission lines) shall not exceed 0.05 microsecond. The total difference in mean receiver delay between the top and bottom antenna channels (including the TCAS II-to-antenna transmission lines) shall not exceed 0.05 microseconds for equal amplitude replies received at signal levels between MTL + 3 dB and - 21 dBm. 

## 2.2.4.4 Signal Reception 2.2.4.4.1 Receiver Sensitivity And Bandwidth 2.2.4.4.1.1 In-Band Acceptance

Given a valid transponder reply signal in the absence of interference or overloads, the minimum trigger level (MTL) is defined as the minimum input power level that results in a 90% ratio of decoded to received replies. 

a. The MTL for ATCRBS and Mode S signals over the frequency range of 1087 to 
1093 MHz shall be -74 dBm ±2 dB. 
Note: This provides adequate link margin for reliable detection of near-co-altitude aircraft in level flight at a range of 14 NM. 

b. For an input signal power of level -78 dBm or less, no more than 10% of ATCRBS 
and Mode S signals shall be decoded. 
c. The decoding ratio shall be at least 99% for ATCRBS and Mode S signals between 
MTL +3 dB and -21 dBm. 
If the antenna gain is not as specified in 2.2.4.7, the MTL shall be adjusted to account for the antenna gain. 

Note: For example, if the antenna gain were 3 dB higher than specified, the nominal MTL would be raised by 3 dB to -71 dBm. 

## 2.2.4.4.1.2 Out-Of-Band Rejection

The selectivity of the receiver shall be such that an RF CW signal at the receiver input shall result in the receiver output levels relative to center frequency as a function of input signal frequency offset that are specified in Table 2-10. 

| Input Signal Frequency    | Output Signal Level    |

## 2.2.4.4.2 Reply Detection And Decoding

The following pulse decoder characteristics shall apply over the RF input signal level range from MTL to -21 dBm: 

## 2.2.4.4.2.1 Mode C Reply Reception

All performance requirements shall be met for pulses having the following characteristics: 

 
Pulse amplitude variation:  up to ±2 dB, relative to F1 amplitude. 
 
Pulse rise time:   0.05 to 0.1 microsecond. 
 
Pulse decay time:  0.05 to 0.2 microsecond. 
a. Description of Mode C Received Signals.  The Mode C received signal is illustrated 
in Figure 2-5.  The Mode C received signal consists of a pair of framing pulses spaced 20.3 ±0.1 microseconds apart.  The code pulse positions begin 1.45 microseconds after the leading edge of the first framing pulse, and are spaced at 1.45- microsecond intervals thereafter.  Each code pulse position has a tolerance of ±0.1 microsecond relative to the first framing pulse and ±0.15 microsecond  relative to every other pulse within the reply.  All pulses have a width of 0.45 ±0.1 microsecond. A one or zero in the reply code is indicated by the presence or absence of a code pulse, respectively. 
 
b. Criteria for Mode C Pulse Detection.  Mode C decoding shall be based on pulse 
leading edges.  The occurrence of a leading edge shall be determined directly from 
the positive slope of a clear leading edge, or inferred from the pulse width and trailing edge positions associated with overlapping pulses.  An actual leading edge is defined as an event for which:  the signal rises at a rate exceeding 48 dB per microsecond to a level above the receiver threshold, AND 0.121 microsecond later the rate of rise is less than 48 dB per microsecond.  An inferred leading edge is defined as an event in which a leading edge is assumed to exist in order to account for a pulse whose width implies the existence of overlapping pulses.  The first qualifying criterion for reception of a Mode C signal shall be the occurrence of a pair of bracket pulse leading edges spaced 20.3 ±0.121 microseconds apart.  The pulses 
shall not be accepted as a bracket pair if their spacing deviates from 20.3 
microseconds by 0.242 microsecond or more, OR if either of the bracket pulses occurs within 0.242 microsecond of a previous bracket pulse, OR if the width of either of the pulses is 0.242 microsecond or less.  A Mode C code pulse shall be accepted if its leading edge occurs within 0.121 microsecond of a nominal code pulse position relative to the leading edge of the first bracket pulse. The code pulse shall be rejected if the time of occurrence of its leading edge deviates from a nominal code pulse position by 0.242 microsecond or more, OR if the width of the pulse is 0.242 microsecond or less. 

c. Criteria for Acceptance of Garbled Mode C Replies.  The TCAS II equipment shall 
be capable of correctly determining arrival times and detecting reply brackets and reply codes for at least three valid overlapping Mode C replies whose code and bracket pulses are interleaved, i.e., they fall into the spaces between the other reply code pulses.  The equipment shall also be capable of determining arrival times and detecting brackets and reply codes for valid Mode C replies with overlapping pulses. As a minimum, the probability of correctly decoding three valid overlapping replies shall be as specified below for the following conditions of reply pulse overlap:

* - When averaged over all relative arrival times between reply 3 and replies 1 and 2. 

Note: Attempting to detect overlapping reply pulses requires that the TCAS II 
equipment be capable of resolving pulses in situations where overlapped pulse edges are clearly distinguishable, and reconstructing the position of hidden pulses in situations where overlapping pulses of nearly the same amplitude cause the following pulses to be obscured.  The TCAS II equipment should be designed to reliably decode overlapping replies with any number of code pulses.  The reason for basing this specific quantitative requirement on replies with 3 code pulses is that a realizable decoding probability has been determined experimentally for the specific case of 3 code  pulses. 

d. Phantom Rejection.  The TCAS II equipment shall reject all replies whose brackets 
could possibly be pulses of preceding or following replies. 
Note: It is recommended that the Mode C reply processing function be disabled for the duration of a long Mode S reply if a Mode S reply preamble is received during a Mode C listening period.  This will prevent the data block of the asynchronous Mode S reply from generating a string of false Mode C fruit replies during the Mode C listening window. 

## 2.2.4.4.2.2 Mode S Squitter And Reply Reception

All performance requirements shall be met for pulses having the following characteristics: 
Pulse amplitude variation: up to ±2 dB, relative to the amplitude of the first preamble pulse. Pulse rise time: 0.05 to 0.1 microsecond Pulse decay time: 0.05 to 0.2 microsecond 

a. Description of Mode S Received Signals.  The Mode S received signal, illustrated in 
Figure 2-6, consists of a preamble and a data block.  The preamble consists of four 0.5 ±0.05-microsecond pulses.  The second, third, and fourth pulses are spaced 1, 3.5, and 4.5 microseconds respectively from the first transmitted pulse.  The data block begins 8 microseconds after the first preamble pulse.  Either 56 or 112 onemicrosecond bit intervals are assigned to each data block.  A pulse with a width of 0.5 ±0.05 microsecond is transmitted in the first half of each interval to indicate a binary one and the second half of each interval to indicate a binary zero.  If a pulse transmitted in the second half of one bit interval is followed by a pulse transmitted in the first half of the next bit interval, the two pulses are merged and a 1 ±0.05 microsecond pulse is received. 
b. Criteria for Preamble Acceptance.  The first qualifying criterion for reception of a 
Mode S signal shall be the detection of a Mode S preamble.  A preamble shall be accepted if each of the four pulse positions of the preamble waveform contains a pulse that is above the receiver threshold for at least 75% of its nominal duration, AND the last three pulses are within ±0.125 microsecond of their nominal positions relative to the first pulse, AND at least two of the four preamble pulses have actual leading edges (as defined in 2.2.4.4.2.1b.) that occur within ±0.125 microsecond of their nominal edge positions and there are no earlier leading edges associated with those pulses. 
c. Criteria for Data Block Acceptance in Squitter and Asynchronous Transmissions.  
The initial detection of the Mode S target address is accomplished by monitoring Mode S squitter transmissions, in the Mode S All-Call format.  These Mode S squitters contain 56 data bits.  In addition to monitoring squitters in the All-Call 
format, initial detection of the Mode S target address may also be accomplished by optionally monitoring Mode S squitter transmissions in the Mode S extended squitter format. These Mode S squitters contain 112 data bits. Each bit of the Mode S data block shall be decoded by comparing the received signal with a 0.5-microsecond delayed replica of itself to determine the difference between the signal amplitudes at the centers of the two possible pulse positions for that bit. 
In the All-Call or extended squitter format, the target address is protected by an independent parity field.  The TCAS II equipment shall make use of the parity coding in the Mode S squitter to detect and correct squitter messages that are received in error.  One means of implementing error correction is described in Appendix A, Section A.3.  Except as specified in the following sentence, the TCAS II equipment shall accept only those Mode S squitters that contain the code 01011 in the first 5 bits of the data block and that contain the correct Mode S All-Call address.  If the TCAS II equipment optionally chooses to monitor Mode S squitter transmissions in the Mode S extended squitter format, it shall also accept those Mode S squitters that contain the code 10001 in the first 5 bits of the data block and that contain the correct Mode S All-Call address. Detection of the Mode S altitude is accomplished by either actively interrogating to elicit a DF=0 reply or by passively monitoring Mode S asynchronous reply transmissions in the DF=0 or DF=4 formats.  An asynchronous reply transmission shall be accepted as a valid Mode S altitude reply if:  the first 5 bits of the data block contain either the code 00000 or the code 00100, AND the encoded altitude bits conform to either of the encoding standards specified in 2.2.3.9.3.1.2 AND, if the 26th bit and the 28th bit are ZERO, bits 20, 22 and 24 do not assume one of the illegal code combinations shown in Table 2-11.

AND no more than 34 data bits, of which no more than seven are consecutive, fail the following high confidence test: Sample the received signal eight times during the one-microsecond bit interval to determine if the amplitude of the received signal is above or below the dynamic minimum triggering level of the receiver.  The data bit shall be declared a highconfidence bit if, between the first and second of the two possible pulse positions for that bit, the difference in the number of samples for which the signal is above DMTL is at least three AND the sign of this difference agrees with the decoded value of the bit. 

d. Additional Criterion for Data Block Acceptance in Discrete Transmissions.  
Responses to Mode S interrogations include known addresses protected by an independent parity field.  The TCAS II equipment shall make use of the parity field to correct discrete messages that are received in error.  One means of implementing error correction is described in Appendix A, Section A.3.  The TCAS II equipment 
shall confirm that the address of the Mode S reply is correct. 
Note: If two or more acquisition replies requiring error correction are received within the Mode S range acquisition window, it may be impractical to apply error correction to more than the first received reply.  None of the acquisition replies need to be corrected when this occurs. 

## 2.2.4.5 Interference Rejection And Control

TCAS II shall employ the necessary means of interference rejection and control in order to achieve the system performance requirements specified in paragraph 2.2.2 on targetsof-interest as defined in subparagraph 2.2.1.3 when operating in the environment defined in subparagraph 2.2.1.2. The following subparagraphs define specific requirements associated with each of the interference conditions defined in subparagraph 2.2.1.2. 

## 2.2.4.5.1 Multipath Rejection 2.2.4.5.1.1 Interrogation Link Interference

The equipment shall employ means of preventing the multipath signals defined in subparagraph 2.2.1.2.5.2 from causing Mode conversion or transponder suppression on the interrogation link. The use of the whisper-shout interrogation sequence specified in subparagraph 2.2.4.5.4.1, is one means of reducing the effect of uplink multipath to an acceptable level by causing transponders to be interrogated at power levels close to their MTL values. Since most signal-to-multipath ratios are high, most multipath signals will be reduced to levels below transponder MTL by use of the whisper-shout interrogation sequence. 

## 2.2.4.5.1.2 Reply Link Interference

The equipment shall employ  means of rejecting the low level multipath signals defined in subparagraph 2.2.1.2.5.1.  Specifically, the equipment shall be able to successfully detect and decode valid replies under the following simultaneous conditions of reply signal level and multipath signal level: 

a. ATCRBS Reply Link 

| Minimum reply signal level                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Maximum multipath signal level  =  Reply level - 10 dB |

b. Mode S Reply Link 

| Minimum reply signal level                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Maximum multipath signal level  =  Reply level - 7 dB |

Section A.2 in Appendix A describes one means of rejecting low level multipath signals on the reply link. 

## 2.2.4.5.1.2.1 Narrow Pulse Discrimination

If the means for rejecting low level multipath signals involves receiver desensitization, this means shall not be responsive to pulses that have a width of less than 0.3 microseconds.  

## 2.2.4.5.1.2.2 Tacan And Dme Discrimination

If the means for rejecting low level multipath signals involves receiver desensitization, this means shall not be responsive to pulses that have a rise time exceeding 0.5 microsecond. 

## 2.2.4.5.2 Narrow Pulse Rejection

The TCAS II equipment shall reject any received ATCRBS bracket or code pulses that have a width of 0.242 microseconds or less. 

## 2.2.4.5.3 Tacan And Dme Signal Rejection

The TCAS II equipment shall reject any received pulse with a rise time exceeding 0.5 microsecond. 

## 2.2.4.5.4 Control Of Atcrbs Synchronous Garble

The equipment shall provide a means of controlling ATCRBS synchronous garble to a level that will enable TCAS II to achieve the system requirements of paragraph 2.2.2 on a target-of-interest as defined in subparagraph 2.2.1.3 when operating in the environment defined in subparagraph 2.2.1.2. ATCRBS synchronous interference can be controlled by the use of a Mode C whispershout interrogation sequence and by the use of a directional transmitting antenna.  The degree to which synchronous interference can be reduced depends on the ATCRBS transponder density, the resolution of the whisper-shout interrogation sequence and the azimuth directionality of the transmitting antenna.  For a given antenna directionality and degarble performance, the required degree of resolution is directly proportional to the ATCRBS transponder density; i.e., the lower the ATCRBS density the less resolution is required to provide an equivalent reduction in the level of synchronous interference. TCAS II equipment shall employ at least a four-beam top-mounted directional interrogation antenna as specified in 2.2.4.5.4.2. In conjunction with a four-beam antenna, TCAS II shall use the Minimum Basic 6-level whisper-shout sequence (2.2.4.5.4.1.1), the high resolution whisper-shout sequence (2.2.4.5.4.1.2) or a single interrogation (2.2.4.5.4.1.5) according to the selection criteria specified in 2.2.4.5.4.1.4 or 
2.2.4.5.4.1.5. Alternative whisper-shout designs that are either more or less capable than those specified above may be implemented so long as the combination of the whispershout resolution and the azimuth directionality result in degarbling performance that equals or exceeds the minimum required to satisfy the system requirements of 2.2.2. 

The following subparagraphs define the important parameters of a whisper-shout interrogation sequence and an antenna interrogation pattern that will enable a manufacturer to select an acceptable design for control of synchronous garble.  The improvements in degarbling performance of various whisper-shout sequences and antenna beam widths are presented relative to the degarbling performance of the required minimum whisper-shout interrogation sequence specified in subparagraph 2.2.4.5.4.1.1 and to the degarbling performance of an omnidirectional interrogation antenna, respectively. 

## 2.2.4.5.4.1 Control Of Synchronous Garble By Whisper-Shout

To control ATCRBS synchronous interference and also to reduce the severity of multipath effects on the interrogation link (subparagraph 2.2.4.5.1.1), a sequence of interrogations at different power levels shall be transmitted during each surveillance update period.  Each of the interrogations in the sequence, other than the one at lowest power, shall be preceded by a suppression pulse (designated S1) 2 microseconds preceding the P1 pulse.  The combination of S1 and P1 shall serve as a suppression transmission.  S1 shall be at a power level lower than that of P1.  The minimum time between successive interrogations shall be 1 millisecond.  All interrogations in the sequence shall be transmitted within a single surveillance update interval. 

Note: Because the suppression transmission in each step is always at a lower power 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
level than the following interrogation, this technique is referred to as whispershout.  The intended mechanism is that each aircraft replies to only one or two of the interrogations in a sequence.  The lowest power interrogation is not preceded by an S1 suppression pulse to ensure that each transponder will respond to at least one of the interrogations in the sequence.  A typical population of ATCRBS transponders at any given range may have a large spread in effective sensitivity due to variations in receivers, cable losses, and antenna shielding.  Typically, each transponder in the population will respond to two interrogations in the sequence, and will be turned off by the higher power suppression transmissions accompanying higher-power interrogations in the sequence.  Given a situation in which several aircraft are near enough to each other in range for their replies to synchronously interfere, it is unlikely they would all reply to the same interrogation and, as a result, the severity of synchronous interference is reduced.  

## 2.2.4.5.4.1.1 Minimum Basic Whisper-Shout Sequence

Figure 2-7 defines the minimum basic whisper-shout sequence that shall be used. Figure 
2-8 illustrates the timing for the sequence in the forward beam. This design is the shortest whisper-shout sequence that has been developed, tested and shown to be effective, when used with a four-beam top-mounted directional antenna, in providing an acceptable level of degarbling performance in a moderate ATCRBS transponder density of approximately 0.05 ATCRBS-equipped aircraft per sq. NM. Five distinct sub-sequences are defined for use in the four beams of the top-mounted antenna and for the bottom-mounted omnidirectional antenna in accordance with 2.2.4.5.4.1.4. The interrogations may be transmitted in any order.  When interrogation power is reduced to limit interference (2.2.3.6.2), each interrogation and its related receiver MTL, as indicated in the last column of Figure 2-7 shall be reduced by 1 dB in the order shown in the column labeled *Interference Limiting Priority* with the lowest number reduced first. 

Note: Most of the interrogations are transmitted from the top antenna because it is less susceptible to multipath interference from the ground.  

## 2.2.4.5.4.1.2 Higher Capability Whisper-Shout Sequences For Improved Degarbling Performance

The extent to which a whisper-shout interrogation sequence reduces synchronous garble depends on the resolution of its interrogation steps.  The resolution of a whisper-shout sequence is best described in terms of "bin-width," which is the difference in dB between an interrogation and the associated suppression.  For example, the bin-width of the minimum basic 6-level sequence illustrated in Figure 2-7 is 10 dB.  Table 2-12 provides improvement factors for higher resolution whisper-shout sequences relative to the minimum basic 6-level sequence.

As an example, a whisper-shout sequence with a bin-width of 2 dB will provide somewhat greater than 3 times the degarbling capability provided by the 6-level sequence.

Figure 2-9 defines the high resolution whisper-shout sequence that shall be used in conjunction with a four-beam top-mounted directional antenna for high density ATCRBS surveillance.  This sequence, when used with a top mounted four-beam directional antenna, has been verified to operate successfully in densities up to 0.3 aircraft per square NM.  Five distinct sub sequences are defined for use in the four beams of the topmounted antenna and the bottom-mounted omnidirectional antenna in accordance with 2.2.4.5.4.1.4.  The interrogations may be transmitted in any order. When the sequence is truncated to limit interference (2.2.3.6.2), the steps shall be dropped in the order shown in the column labeled *Interference Limiting Priority.*  The lowest numbered steps shall be dropped first.  The timing of individual pulses and steps in the sequence shall be as defined in Figure 2-8. All whisper-shout sequence designs must satisfy the following requirements: 

a. The total extent of the sequence in the forward direction must span a dynamic range 
of at least 24 dB where dynamic range is defined as the product of the number of whisper-shout steps and step increment.  For example, for a dynamic range of 24 dB, the 6-level whisper-shout sequence specified in 2.2.4.5.4.1.1 has a step increment of 4 dB. 
b. The nominal power level of each of the interrogation pulses, if arranged in a 
monotonic sequence, shall increment linearly throughout the entire power range.  The transmission of the interrogation steps can actually occur in any order without affecting the degarbling performance of the whisper-shout sequence. 
c. The tolerance associated with each of the interrogation pulses shall be the smaller of 
±2 dB or 1/2 of the nominal step increment size of a monotonically arranged sequence.  The tolerance associated with the nominal bin-width shall be the smaller of ±2 dB or 1/4 of the nominal bin-width. 
d. The power level of the highest powered interrogation shall be such as to provide 
adequate coverage at the cross-over points of adjacent beams of a directional antenna. For a four-beam antenna the Effective Radiated Power of the highest powered interrogation shall be at least +52 dBm. 
e. The level of the suppression pulse relative to the preceding interrogation pulses shall 
be within ±0.5 dB of the difference between the step increment value and the binwidth value.  
f. The MTL used in the reply listening period following each interrogation shall be 
related to the interrogation power in such a fashion as to maintain a balance between the uplink and downlink surveillance performance. 
g. The MTL values are based on the assumption that replies to all interrogations are 
received omnidirectionally.  If a directional-receive antenna is used, the MTL values must be adjusted to account for the antenna gain.  For example, for a net antenna gain of +3 dB, all MTL values would be raised by 3 dB relative to the values associated with an omnidirectional antenna. 
h. Although the steps in the sequence may be transmitted in any order, the steps shall be 
dropped in order of decreasing power level when the sequence is truncated as a result of interference limiting.

## 2.2.4.5.4.1.3 Determination Of Whisper-Shout Based On Synchronous Garble

Each scan, TCAS shall determine the appropriate whisper-shout sequence (i.e., the high resolution sequence or the minimum basic sequence) to be used with each top antenna directional beam according to criteria based on the expected level of synchronous garble within the reliable TCAS surveillance range of that beam. The reliable TCAS surveillance range in the absence of interference limiting is considered to be nominally 14 NM in the forward beam, 8.8 NM in the left and right beams and 5.0 NM in the aft beam (2.2.2.1.1).  When interference limiting is imposed, the reliable surveillance range used in each beam to determine the relative range of Mode C aircraft and Mode C aircraft density (see below) is reduced by a factor equivalent to the square root of the interference limiting power reduction for that beam. For example, if the largest interrogation in the forward beam is reduced 6 dB because of interference limiting, the reliable surveillance range is reduced from 14 NM to 7 NM. The reliable surveillance range used to determine the level of low confidence bits in each received Mode C reply is always 14 NM in the forward beam, 8.8 NM in the side beams and 5.0 NM in the aft beam regardless of the level of interference limiting. The following information on Mode C aircraft within each antenna beam and within the reliable TCAS surveillance range defined above, shall be determined each scan in order to select the proper whisper-shout sequence for that beam: 

a. The level of low confidence bits in each received Mode C reply, b. The relative range of Mode C aircraft, c. The Mode C aircraft density. 
The whisper-shout sequence for a specific top directional beam is determined and selected solely on the garble situation in that beam and is independent of the situation or use in the other beams.  In other words, beams can simultaneously have different levels of degarbling capability.  When interference limiting calls for the elimination of a whisper-shout step or a 1-dB reduction in the interrogation power level, the order of priority in a mixed-beam-interrogation-sequence follows the order specified in Figures 2-7 and 2-9 for the specific interrogation sequence and beam.  For example, regardless of sequence used, the forward beam priority always follows 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 etc., the side beam priorities always follow 2&3, 6&7, 10&11, 14&15 etc., the rear beam priority always follows 4, 8, 12, 16 etc., and the bottom always follows 80, 81, 82, and 83.  

## D. Low Confidence Bit Measurement (Cl)

Each scan, TCAS shall examine successive Mode C replies from an intruder for the existence of low-confidence altitude code bits in order to provide an early detection of synchronous garble, particularly during Mode C intruder acquisition, and to indicate whether a switch to an appropriate whisper-shout interrogation sequence is necessary.  The existence of low-confidence code bits in an intruder reply must persist for two or more successive scans to qualify for synchronous garble and to eliminate fruit interference. If two successive replies from an intruder contain at least one low-confidence altitude code bit, regardless of its position in each reply, a flag shall be set for that beam to indicate synchronous garble.  This information is then used in 2.2.4.5.4.1.4 to select the appropriate interrogation sequence for that beam. 

Note: During reply decoding, the confidence flag for a reply pulse position is set LOW whenever there exists another received reply (either real or phantom) 
that could have had a pulse within ±0.121 us of the same position. Otherwise, the confidence flag is set HIGH.  
Appendix A, Section A.4 describes one acceptable algorithm for the low-confidence bit measurement of synchronous garble. 

## E. Intruder Range Track Comparison (Tc)

Each scan, TCAS shall compare the tracked range of Mode C intruders within the reliable surveillance range of each directional beam to determine whether synchronous garble in that beam is possible, and if so, to indicate whether a switch to a less capable whisper-shout interrogation sequence is acceptable. If two Mode C intruders within the same beam are determined to be separated in range by less than 1.7 NM, a flag shall be set for that beam to indicate synchronous garble.  This information is then used in 2.2.4.5.4.1.4 to select the appropriate interrogation sequence for that beam. Appendix A, Section A.4 describes one acceptable algorithm for the intruder track comparison. 

## F. Mode C Aircraft Density Measurement ()

Each scan, TCAS shall determine the density of ATCRBS aircraft within the reliable surveillance range of each directional interrogation beam.  The density () for N*ATCRBS* 
ATCRBS aircraft within the reliable surveillance range of a beam is: 

$$\rho\,=\,{\frac{N_{A T C R B S}}{r_{N}}}$$
where rN is the range to the most distant (Nth) aircraft within the reliable surveillance range. The ATCRBS density () is then compared to the threshold shown below to determine which whisper-shout sequence is acceptable for a specific directional beam.  This information is then used in 2.2.4.5.4.1.4 to select the appropriate interrogation sequence for that beam. A switch is acceptable from High Resolution W-S to Minimum Basic W-S when  
 < 6/14 per NM. 

## 2.2.4.5.4.1.4 Criteria For Selection Of A Specific Whisper-Shout Sequence

Each scan, TCAS shall use the results of the measurements described above to provide an indication of ATCRBS synchronous garble activity or potential garble activity within each directional beam.  This information shall be used to select the appropriate whispershout sequence to meet the surveillance performance requirements referenced in 2.2.2. The switching criteria must be able to quickly recognize the current and anticipated ATCRBS aircraft density and distribution and select for use the next scan the most capable degarbling interrogation sequence for that situation.  Specifically, each scan TCAS shall select a whisper-shout sequence for a beam according to the following criteria: 

a. Select the high resolution whisper-shout sequence if the (Cl) flag is set. 
b. Select the Minimum Basic whisper-shout sequence if: 
1. the (Cl) flag is not set AND no more than one ATCRBS aircraft exists within the 
reliable surveillance range, OR  
2. the (Cl) flag is not set AND the (Tc) flag is not set AND () indicates a switch to 
the next lower level is acceptable. 
Exceptions to the above rules for whisper-shout selection occur under the following circumstances: 

a. When TCAS is powered on, the high resolution whisper-shout sequence shall be used 
for all top directional beams and the bottom omni for the first 60 seconds to allow track acquisition and stabilization. 
b. When a Traffic Advisory is issued on a Mode C intruder, the high resolution whispershout sequence shall be used in the beam providing surveillance on the threat for the duration of the advisory. 
c. When a Resolution Advisory is issued on a Mode C intruder, the high resolution 
whisper-shout sequence shall be used in all beams for the duration of the advisory.  

## 2.2.4.5.4.1.5 Surveillance In Areas Of No Atcrbs Intruder Aircraft

When there are no ATCRBS aircraft within the TCAS surveillance region of a directional or omnidirectional beam, it is not necessary to transmit a whisper-shout interrogation sequence in that beam for degarbling purposes.  However, it is still necessary to transmit a single interrogation in a beam in order to detect the presence of an ATCRBS-equipped aircraft and to initiate whisper-shout interrogations for Mode C acquisition and tracking. TCAS shall transmit a single Mode C interrogation from a top-mounted directional beam or from the bottom omnidirectional beam only if an established or candidate Mode C track does not exist within the full TCAS surveillance range of that beam.  The power level of the single interrogation in a specific beam and the corresponding MTL shall be equivalent to the highest whisper-shout level transmitted in that beam if using the high resolution sequence defined in Figure 2-9.  When interrogation power is reduced to limit interference (2.2.3.6.2), each single interrogation and its related receiver MTL shall be reduced by 1 dB in the order shown for the beams in the column labeled Interference Limiting Priority in Figure 2-7 with the lowest number reduced first.  The timing of individual pulses in each interrogation is as defined in Figure 2-1 except that a whispershout suppression pulse is not transmitted. 

TCAS shall switch from a single interrogation within a beam to the Minimum Basic whisper-shout sequence in that beam whenever: 

a. two successive Mode C replies correlate in range such that the second Mode C reply 
occurs within a 5000 ft range correlation window centered either at the measured 
range of the previous Mode C reply or at a range offset by ±13 µsec from the measured range of the previous reply, or 
b. an established Mode C track or a Mode C track in the process of being acquired 
traverses into that beam from another beam. 
Mode C track initiation (2.2.4.6.2.1.2) shall only be accomplished through use of a whisper-shout interrogation sequence. TCAS shall switch back to the single interrogation after 10 surveillance update intervals in which no established Mode C track or Mode C track in the process of being acquired was present within the beam and no two successive correlating replies, indicating the potential for initiation of a Mode C track, were received within the beam. 

Note: Single Mode C interrogations are susceptible to uplink mode conversion due to 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

multipath and may result in a mixture of Mode A and Mode C replies from an intruder that are separated by 13 µsec. A switch from a single Mode C interrogation to a whisper-shout sequence is based on a successful range correlation between two consecutive replies in order to reduce the possibility of a switch due to a fruit reply. Mode C tracks are established only through use of whisper-shout interrogations in order to prevent multipath induced mode conversion.  

## 2.2.4.5.4.2 Control Of Synchronous Garble By Directional Interrogation

A minimum four-beam directional interrogation antenna mounted on the top of the aircraft is required for reliable TCAS II surveillance of ATCRBS targets in aircraft densities up to 0.3 aircraft per square NM.  The required azimuth resolution of the directional antenna for reply degarbling depends on the specific whisper-shout sequence used.  A high-resolution whisper-shout sequence will reduce the need for high resolution in azimuth and vice-versa.  The following discussion of antenna requirements and definition of antenna characteristics will enable the manufacturer to determine the degarbling benefits to be gained as a function of azimuth resolution. 

## 2.2.4.5.4.2.1 Directional Interrogation Beamwidth Control

In order to reduce synchronous garble, the interrogation beamwidth shall be limited by transmission of a P2 sidelobe suppression pulse following each P1 interrogation pulse by 2 microseconds.  The P2 pulse shall be transmitted on a separate control pattern and shall have the same shape as the other pulses specified in 2.2.3.8.  The azimuth and elevation patterns of all beams shall be as specified in 2.2.4.7. 

Interrogation beamwidth limiting, using the P2 suppression pulse, shall be controlled to prevent transponder reply gaps between adjacent directional beams.  The minimum required reply beamwidth is defined as the maximum amount of beamwidth limiting that still causes a maximum-suppression transponder located at any azimuth angle and between +20 degrees and -15 degrees elevation to reply to interrogations from at least one of the directional beams.  A maximum-suppression transponder is defined as one that, when interrogated by a whisper-shout interrogation sequence, replies only when the received ratio of P1 to P2 exceeds the whisper-shout bin-width as defined in 2.2.4.5.4.1.2. When the relative P2 power level is adjusted to satisfy the above conditions, the required reply beamwidth is optimally minimized resulting in a maximum amount of degarbling. 

## 2.2.4.5.4.2.2 Directional Interrogation Radiated Power

The TCAS II effective radiated power (ERP) level in any azimuth direction shall be sufficient to satisfy the system requirements of paragraph 2.2.2.  Effective radiated power is defined as the product of the net power delivered to the antenna terminal times the gain of the antenna at 0 degrees elevation and at the azimuth of interest, where antenna gain is specified relative to a matched quarter-wave stub. For a directional interrogation top antenna, the ERP at the azimuth peak of each beam shall be selected to maintain adequate range coverage, as defined by the product of the appropriate closing speed and time to closest-point-of-approach, at the crossover point of two adjacent beams. For a four-beam directional top antenna with a 90 degree azimuth beamwidth, the ERP associated with the largest whisper-shout step in the forward beam shall be at least +52 dBm in order to provide the necessary coverage at the crossover points of the two adjacent beams.  The ERP associated with the largest whisper-shout step in each of the side beams shall be -4 dB relative to the forward beam and the ERP associated with the largest whisper-shout step in the rear beam shall be -9 dB relative to the forward beam in order to account for the lower closing speeds in those directions. In terms of effective radiated power level, the largest interrogation transmitted from the bottom omni-directional antenna shall be no larger than -18 dB relative to the largest whisper-shout step in the forward beam of the top antenna in order to minimize multipath interference and to reduce the impact of interference limiting.  

## 2.2.4.5.4.2.3 Degarbling Performance As A Function Of Azimuth Resolution

The degarbling improvement factor associated with directional interrogations can be estimated by determining the "average beamwidth" which is defined as that azimuth beamwidth over which an average transponder will reply to an interrogation.  Since the minimum and maximum reply beamwidths are bounded by P1/P2 = bin-width and 0 dB, the average transponder can be considered to reply when its received P1 to P2 ratio equals one-half of the bin-width.  Although the average directional beamwidth is a good indicator of the quantity of valid replies received, it does not predict the total quantity actually observed through experience.  Use of whisper-shout means that transponders are being interrogated near their threshold level.  This fact occasionally causes the P2 pulse and P4 pulse of an interrogation that occurs outside of the main beam to trigger the transponder into replying with a delayed Mode C reply.  These unwanted replies, which account for 20% of the valid replies, add to the synchronous garble problem and must be accounted for.  An "effective beamwidth" is defined which is 1.2 times the average beamwidth described above.  The degarbling improvement factor associated with a specific directional antenna system relative to an omni antenna is then:

## 2.2.4.5.5 Atcrbs And Mode S Fruit Rejection

The equipment shall provide means for rejection of ATCRBS and Mode S replies received in response to interrogations by other TCAS II interrogators and by groundbased beacon interrogators. Effective methods of rejecting ATCRBS and Mode S fruit are represented by the surveillance requirements in subparagraph 2.2.4.6.2 and the associated implementations suggested in Appendix A, Sections A.5 through A.8. 

## 2.2.4.6 Surveillance Tracking Requirements

In order to support the system performance specified in 2.2.2, TCAS II shall provide the following surveillance functions in order to generate position reports on Mode C and Mode S targets that are: 

a. Closing at speeds of up to 1200 kt and at relative altitude rates of up to 10,000 ft/min. b. Within 14 NM. of TCAS II. c. Within ±3000 ft and whenever possible within ±10,000 ft altitude relative to TCAS 
II. 
The maximum closing rate capability may be increased beyond 1200 kt and/or the surveillance range capability may be increased beyond 14 NM.  provided that the number or power of interrogations are not currently reduced by the interference limiting algorithms of subparagraph 2.2.3.6.  When the algorithms of subparagraph 2.2.3.6 indicate that the number or power of interrogations must be reduced, the number or power of interrogations to aircraft closing at rates in excess of 1200 kt and/or to aircraft beyond 14 NM. must be reduced first. 

## 2.2.4.6.1 Surveillance Target Track Capacity

The TCAS II tracking function shall have the capacity for active surveillance of at least 30 aircraft which can include any mix of Mode C- and Mode S-equipped targets. 

Note: A density of 0.06 aircraft per sq. NM. in higher altitude airspace will result in 26 
targets within the required surveillance range of 14 NM.  In lower altitude airspace, a density of 0.3 aircraft per sq. NM. will result in 24 targets within the required surveillance range of 5 NM.  A peak capacity of 30 targets will allow for sufficient margin. 

## 2.2.4.6.1.1 Surveillance Overload

If the number of targets under active surveillance exceeds the surveillance target capacity specified in 2.2.4.6.1, the excess targets shall be deleted in order of decreasing range without regard to target type. 

## 2.2.4.6.1.2 Estimate Of Ground Level

TCAS shall use radio altitude data, when available, and barometric altitude data to estimate ground level in order to reduce interrogations to and prevent advisories against aircraft that are on the ground. If radio altitude data is available, an estimate of ground level shall be determined each scan as follows: 
ground level = own tracked barometric altitude - own tracked radio altitude Radio altitude data is used for this purpose only if: 

a. The data is credible (subparagraph  2.2.7.2.5.2.2), and b. The data is less than 10 seconds old, and  
 
c. The radio altitude value indicates less than 1700 ft. 
Notes: 

1. 
Own barometric altitude is received from the TCAS own altitude tracker (2.2.4.8.2) 
2. 
In order to prevent erratic radio altitude input from causing undue jitter in the availability of the ground level estimate, at least ±50 ft of hysteresis should be applied in making a determination as to declaring the radio altitude value above or below 1700 ft.  
If the criteria for establishing a ground level is no longer satisfied, TCAS shall declare a ground level estimate to be unavailable. 

## 2.2.4.6.1.3 Determination Of Intruder Air-Ground Status 2.2.4.6.1.3.1 Determination For Newly Initiated Tracks

All newly initiated tracks shall be placed in the ON-GROUND state until TCAS determines their true Air-Ground condition. TCAS shall determine the true Air-Ground state for a newly initiated track at the time the track is declared established as in 2.2.4.6.2.1.2 and 2.2.4.6.2.2.2. 

## 2.2.4.6.1.3.2 Determination For Intruders Equipped With Mode S Transponders

A Mode S-equipped intruder shall be declared ON-GROUND by TCAS if its CA field, FS field, or VS field indicates on the ground. Otherwise, a Mode S-equipped intruder shall be declared IN-AIR by TCAS. 

Notes: 

1.  
On rare occasions, an airborne Mode S intruder may incorrectly report on-theground status in its VS, FS, and/or CA fields due to a failure in the source of the 
air-ground discrete. In such cases, if the Mode S intruder is also equipped with a DO-185A,B compatible TCAS II, the TCAS can remain fully operational since it uses radio altitude to determine its own air-ground status instead of the airground discrete used by the transponder. 

2.  
As a strongly recommended option, TCAS may do additional monitoring to determine if a TCAS- equipped intruder reporting on-the-ground status in its VS, FS, and/or CA fields is, in fact, likely to be airborne. TCAS may monitor Mode S DF=0 replies from the intruder. If the intruder"s RI field indicates RA capability, then the intruder can be assumed to be airborne. 

## 2.2.4.6.1.3.3 Determination For Intruders Equipped With Mode C (Atcrbs) Transponders 2.2.4.6.1.3.3.1 Determination For Intruders Equipped With Mode C (Atcrbs) Transponders And Reporting Pressure Altitude

For intruders equipped with such Mode C transponders: An intruder that is in the ON-GROUND state shall transition to the IN-AIR state if any of the following occur: 

a1. The intruder's tracked barometric altitude is 400 ft above the ground level estimate 
determined in 2.2.4.6.1.2. 
b1. The intruder's tracked barometric altitude is 250 ft above the ground level estimate 
determined in 2.2.4.6.1.2 AND there has been at least one positive altitude transition that has persisted for three consecutive reports or longer AND the intruder's reported barometric altitude is greater than 100 ft. above its lowest reported barometric altitude. 
c1. There is no ground level estimate. 
Otherwise, the intruder shall remain in the ON-GROUND state. An intruder that is in the IN-AIR state shall transition to the ON-GROUND state if either of the following occurs: 

a2. Own aircraft is in the IN-AIR state AND the intruder's tracked barometric altitude 
has been less than 360 ft. above the ground level estimate determined in 2.2.4.6.1.2 for 20 seconds AND its reported barometric altitude has not increased by more than 100 ft. from its lowest reported barometric altitude for the same 20-second period. 
b2. The intruder's tracked barometric altitude is less than 150 ft above the ground level 
estimate determined in 2.2.4.6.1.2 
Otherwise the intruder shall remain in the IN-AIR state. 

## 2.2.4.6.1.3.3.2 Determination For Intruders Equipped With Mode C (Atcrbs) Transponders And Not Reporting Pressure Altitude

A Mode C intruder not reporting altitude shall be in the IN-AIR state. 

## 2.2.4.6.1.3.4 Summary Of Rules For Determining Air-Ground Status

The following summarize the rules for determining Air-Ground status. 

A Mode C equipped intruder's status shall be determined in accordance with Table 2-12A.

2.2.4.6.1.3.3.1 
A newly initiated track's status shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.2.4.6.1.3.1. A Mode S transponder equipped intruder's status shall be determined in accordance with Section 2.2.4.6.1.3.2. 

## 2.2.4.6.2 Range And Altitude Estimation 2.2.4.6.2.1 Mode C Targets 2.2.4.6.2.1.1 Reply Merging

The TCAS II equipment shall merge into one surveillance target report all replies that correlate with each other.  This is necessary because aircraft may respond to more than one interrogation during each surveillance update interval. 

## 2.2.4.6.2.1.2 Track Initiation

The TCAS II equipment shall initiate surveillance on Mode C transponder-equipped aircraft if and only if the conditions in a., b., and c. below are satisfied. 

a. Initially, a Mode C reply is received from the aircraft in each of three consecutive 
surveillance update intervals, and: 
1. The replies do not correlate with established tracks. 
2. The magnitude of the range rate indicated by the two most recent replies is less 
than 1200 kt. 
3. The oldest reply is consistent with the above range rate in that its range lies 
within 312.5 feet of a straight line passing through the two most recent replies. 
4. The replies correlate with each other in their altitude code bits. 
Appendix A, Section A.5 describes a successful method that is recommended for assessing correlation of reply code bits and determining the initial altitude code estimate for a target. 

b. A fourth correlating reply is received within five surveillance update intervals 
following the third reply of the three consecutive replies in a. above and is within ±200 ft of the predicted altitude code estimate determined in a.(4) above. 
c. The altitude indicated by the four correlating replies is within ±10,000 ft relative to 
TCAS II. 
TCAS II shall not use a reply to satisfy a. and b. above if the direction of arrival for that reply is outside of the required interrogation beamwidth as defined in subparagraph 2.2.4.5.4.2.1 for a maximum suppression transponder. A track is considered to be established for an aircraft when b. above is satisfied.  All established tracks except as follows are made available to the collision avoidance logic including the information in the four correlating replies used for establishment. Mode C target reports that are identified as having been formed by replies from aircraft that are on the ground (2.2.4.6.1.3) shall be used to initiate tracks but shall not be made available to the CAS logic.  

## 2.2.4.6.2.1.3 Maintenance Of Established Tracks

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Established tracks shall be updated using replies that meet the following criteria as a minimum: 

a. The reply range occurs within a range window centered on the range predicted from 
previous reply history. 
b. The reply altitude occurs within an altitude window of ±200 ft centered on the 
altitude predicted from previous reply history. 
TCAS II shall not use a reply to satisfy a. and b. above if the direction of arrival for that reply is outside of the required interrogation beamwidth as defined in subparagraph 2.2.4.5.4.2.1 for a maximum suppression transponder. The TCAS II equipment shall delete the established track on a Mode C transponderequipped aircraft after the sixth surveillance update interval following receipt of the last valid correlating reply. 

Appendix A, Section A.6 describes one acceptable set of algorithms for maintenance of Mode C target tracks. 

## 2.2.4.6.2.1.4 Multipath False Tracks

Mode C target reports that are identified as having been formed by replies specularly reflected from the ground shall be used to initiate and maintain tracks but shall not be made available to the CAS Logic. Appendix, Section A.7 describes one set of algorithms that have been successfully used to identify image tracks. 

Note: Image tracks should be evaluated each second to see if reclassification as a real 
track is warranted. 

## 2.2.4.6.2.2 Mode S Targets

Note: In accordance with the aircraft address allocation scheme established by ICAO, 
each aircraft equipped with a Mode S transponder will have a unique ICAO aircraft address and no ICAO aircraft address will be all 0s nor all 1s. 

## 2.2.4.6.2.2.1 Squitter Processing

The identity of Mode S targets shall be determined by passively monitoring transmissions received with DF=11 (squitter transmissions).  As an option, the identity of Mode S targets may also be determined by passively monitoring transmissions received with DF=17 (Extended Squitter).  Error detection and correction (2.2.4.4.2.2c) shall be applied to the received squitters to reduce the number of unnecessary interrogations.  Squitters that contain an all 0s or all 1s ICAO aircraft address or an address identical to that of own aircraft transponder shall be rejected.  The CA field in squitters from DO-181A or later transponders shall be used to determine whether the aircraft is on the ground as described in 2.2.4.6.1.3.  The equipment shall not interrogate an aircraft for acquisition in the following two cases: (1) the aircraft's CA field indicates that the aircraft is currently on the ground and the aircraft does not have an operational TCAS II, or (2) the aircraft's CA field indicates that the aircraft is currently on the ground, the aircraft has an operational TCAS II, but own TCAS is above 2000 feet AGL.  For Mode S targets with DO-181 transponders from which a squitter has been received or Mode S targets with DO-181A or later transponders from which a squitter has been received that indicates the target to be airborne, altitude shall be determined by monitoring transmissions received with DF=0 or DF=4 (Mode S altitude reporting replies) or, in the absence of such reply transmissions, by actively interrogating to elicit a short special surveillance reply.  The equipment shall monitor squitters and altitude replies to other interrogations whenever it is not transmitting or receiving replies to its own interrogations.  Monitoring shall be accomplished using an antenna capable of simultaneous reception over 360 degrees of azimuth. To reduce the number of unnecessary interrogations, no interrogations shall be transmitted to a target if so few squitters and altitude replies are received from it to indicate an unreliable RF link. Also, the equipment shall not interrogate for acquisition a target whose altitude is determined from DF=0 or DF=4 replies or continue to interrogate for acquisition a target whose altitude is determined by an active interrogation unless the altitude information indicates that it is within ±10,000 ft of own altitude.  Targets that are within ±10,000 ft of own altitude and that indicate a reliable RF link are called valid targets. In order to provide timely acquisition of targets that transition the altitude surveillance boundary, the altitude of targets that are indicated to be outside of ±10,000 ft of own altitude shall continue to be monitored using DF=0 or DF=4 replies or, in the absence of such replies, by interrogating once every 10 seconds. The TCAS II aircraft shall interrogate targets from which it does not receive altitude information but does continue to receive error-free squitters. The TCAS II squitter processing function shall have memory capacity for at least 150 ICAO aircraft addresses. 

Note: Although the maximum required surveillance range of TCAS II is 14 NM., 
Mode S squitters will typically be received from targets out to the nominal detection range of 30 NM.  In a density of 0.3 Mode S aircraft per sq. NM., there 
will be about 141 aircraft within 30 NM. of TCAS II.   
Appendix A, Section A.8 describes one acceptable method of processing squitters and altitude replies to reduce unnecessary interrogations. 

## 2.2.4.6.2.2.2 Acquisition

The equipment shall transmit an acquisition interrogation (UF=0, AQ=1) to determine the range of each valid target as defined above, or from which inadequate altitude information has been received.  Error correction decoding (2.2.4.4.2.2d) shall be applied to the received replies.  If two or more valid replies are received in response to a single Mode S acquisition interrogation, only the reply that is closest in range shall be retained. If an acquisition interrogation fails to elicit a valid reply, additional interrogations shall be transmitted.  The total number of acquisition interrogations addressed to a single target shall not exceed three within a single surveillance update cycle and a total of nine within the first six surveillance update cycles.  The first acquisition interrogation shall be transmitted using the top antenna.  If two acquisition interrogations to a target fail to elicit valid replies, the next two acquisition interrogations to that target shall be transmitted using the bottom antenna.  If acquisition interrogations fail to elicit replies within 6 surveillance update intervals, the acquisition process shall cease until enough additional squitters/fruit are received to indicate that successful acquisition is likely enough to warrant a subsequent acquisition attempt. One acceptable means of accomplishing this is described in Appendix A, Section A.8. If additional attempts are made to acquire the target, they shall conform to the pattern described in the requirement above for the first attempt except that: 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

a. On the second and third attempt, only one interrogation is made during each single 
surveillance update interval; and in the absence of valid replies, six interrogations are transmitted during the first six surveillance update intervals. 
b. Any further attempts consist of a single interrogation during the entire six 
surveillance update intervals. 
When a valid acquisition reply is received, the VS field in the reply shall be used to determine whether the aircraft is on the ground as described in 2.2.4.6.1.3.  Mode S aircraft that are determined to be on the ground according to the VS field shall be monitored either passively with DF=0 or DF=4 replies or by actively interrogating once every five surveillance update intervals as long as the aircraft remains on the ground and continues to transmit squitters. In addition, if own aircraft is at or below 2000 feet AGL, the range of Mode S aircraft that are determined to be both on the ground according to the VS field and TCAS-equipped according to the TCAS Broadcast Interrogation shall be measured by using the active interrogation once every five surveillance update intervals. Monitored information shall not be made available to the CAS logic. Following successful receipt of a valid acquisition reply from an airborne aircraft, one or more additional interrogations shall be transmitted to the target in order to confirm the reliability of the altitude data and the altitude quantization bit and to determine whether to establish track. When two replies have been received (which may include the acquisition reply) that are within 500 ft of each other, have identical Q-bit values and have the correct ICAO aircraft address, the track is considered established and periodic surveillance interrogations shall be initiated for that target according to 2.2.4.6.2.2.3. 

## 2.2.4.6.2.2.3 Maintenance Of Established Tracks

Established tracks shall be updated using replies that meet the following criteria as a minimum: 

a. The ICAO aircraft address, following the error correction decoding process of 
subparagraph 2.2.4.4.2.2d, corresponds to an established track. 
b. The reply range occurs within a range window centered on a range predicted from 
previous reply history. 
c. The reply altitude occurs within an altitude window centered on the altitude predicted 
from previous reply history.  In no case shall the altitude window be larger than 500 ft. 
Note: The altitude reporting status of a track may change from non-altitude reporting 
to altitude reporting and from altitude reporting to non-altitude reporting.  Item c applies only if the established track is an altitude reporting track and the reply contains altitude data. 
If own aircraft is on the ground, Mode S intruders with established tracks shall continue to be tracked as long as the intruder is airborne according to 2.2.4.6.1.3. The range and altitude correlation window process described in Appendix A, Section A.6 for Mode C targets is acceptable for Mode S targets. In the event that two or more surveillance tracks are associated with the same ICAO aircraft address, only the track that is closest in range shall be retained. The range of the target shall be used with its estimated range-rate relative to TCAS to determine its potential threat to TCAS and whether it can be interrogated less frequently than the nominal 1-second rate. Each scan, the potential threat level (TAU) of the target shall be calculated as follows: 

$$T A U=-\,{\frac{r-{\frac{S M O D}{r}}}{\operatorname*{min}(-6\,\mathrm{kt},r d o t)}}$$
where r is the tracked range, *rdot* is the estimated relative range rate and *SMOD* is a surveillance distance modifier which for this purpose shall be equivalent to 3 NM.  This value of *SMOD* ensures that TCAS will always use the nominal 1-second update rate in situations where TAU can change rapidly, such as in a parallel approach.  The denominator ensures use of the reduced rate for diverging intruders beyond *SMOD*. All intruders shall be interrogated at least once every five surveillance update intervals. An intruder with a TAU value of equal to or less than 60 seconds shall be interrogated at the nominal surveillance update rate of once every surveillance update interval.  An intruder with a TAU value greater than 60 seconds shall be interrogated at a rate of no more than once every five surveillance update intervals if: 

a. the tracked barometric altitude of own aircraft is less than 18,000 ft, and b. the tracked altitude of the intruder aircraft is less than 18,000 ft. 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
A hysteresis of ±500 ft shall be applied to the above 18,000-ft altitude boundary in order to prevent rapid oscillations between two different interrogation rates.   
Note: The above statement is not intended to prohibit re-interrogation(s).  If a tracking 

interrogation fails to elicit a valid reply from a target being updated at a 5- second rate, additional interrogations are transmitted as specified below, i.e., surveillance should not wait five seconds to re-interrogate.   
Each scan surveillance makes available to the CAS logic the data specified in section 2.2.4.8.1. Appendix A, Section A.11 describes one acceptable algorithm for tracking of aircraft with a 5-second interrogation rate. If, during active surveillance, a tracking interrogation fails to elicit a valid reply, additional interrogations shall be transmitted.  The total number of tracking interrogations addressed to a single target shall not exceed five during a single surveillance update interval or sixteen distributed over six successive surveillance update intervals.  The first tracking interrogation shall be transmitted using the antenna that was used in the last successful interrogation of that target.  If two successive tracking interrogations fail to elicit valid replies from a target, the next two interrogations to that target shall be transmitted using the other antenna. The TCAS II equipment shall delete the established track on a Mode S transponderequipped aircraft after the sixth surveillance update interval (5 coasts) following receipt of the last valid correlating reply if the track was maintained with interrogations transmitted once every surveillance update interval, or after the tenth surveillance update interval (9 coasts) following receipt of the last valid correlating reply if the track was maintained with interrogations transmitted once every five surveillance update intervals. The TCAS II equipment shall also delete the established track on a Mode S transponderequipped aircraft following five consecutive replies in which the VS field indicated the aircraft to be on the ground.  Any subsequent squitters and replies from that aircraft are subject to the squitter processing requirements of subparagraph 2.2.4.6.2.2.1.  The ICAO aircraft address associated with the deleted surveillance track shall be retained an additional four surveillance update intervals so as to enable immediate reacquisition if a squitter is received within that period. 

## 2.2.4.6.2.2.4 Power Programming

The transmit power level of Mode S tracking interrogations to targets (but not air-to-air coordination interrogations) shall be automatically reduced as a function of range for targets within 10 NM as follows: 

$$P T=P_{m a x}+20\log{\frac{R}{10}}$$
where PT is the adjusted power level.  Pmax is the nominal power level, which is transmitted to targets at ranges of 10 NM or more, and R is the predicted range of the target in NM.  The actual transmitted power is the lesser of PT and the limit imposed by the interference limiting procedures of subparagraph 2.2.3.6. Air-to-air coordination interrogations shall always be transmitted at full power. 

## 2.2.4.6.3 Non-Altitude-Reporting Aircraft

Replies from non-altitude-reporting aircraft shall be tracked using range and bearing information. Appendix A, Section A.9 describes one method that has been used successfully to track altitude unknown targets. 

## 2.2.4.6.4 Bearing Estimation

The TCAS II equipment shall provide a bearing estimation function with the following requirements to obtain bearing data for a traffic advisory display. 

## 2.2.4.6.4.1 General Requirements

The bearing estimation function shall be realized using a top-mounted direction-finding antenna.  The bottom antenna can be an omnidirectional (not direction finding) antenna. Targets meeting the criteria for a traffic advisory or a resolution advisory shall be displayed even if there is no bearing estimate available. 

Note: The bearing estimate is used by the flight crew of the TCAS II aircraft to visually 
locate intruder aircraft. TCAS II bearing accuracy is not adequate to support horizontal resolution maneuvers. 
Mode C surveillance uses this bearing estimation capability to support the identification and rejection of replies received from outside the interrogated azimuth sector 
(subparagraph 2.2.4.6.2.1.2). The bearing estimate can also assist the Mode S 
surveillance function in the acquisition of Mode S intruders when associated with a Mode S interrogation capability (subparagraph 2.2.4.7.3).   

## 2.2.4.6.4.2 Bearing Accuracy With Standard Ground Plane 2.2.4.6.4.2.1 Accuracy, -10 Deg. To +10 Deg. Elevation

Bearing error shall not exceed nine degrees RMS or 27 degrees peak over all azimuth angles and over elevation angles from -10 degrees to +10 degrees in the absence of interference and multipath, using Mode S replies or Mode C replies having five or more code pulses (in addition to the framing pulses), when the antenna is installed at the center of a minimum 1.2 m (4 ft.) diameter circular ground plane that can be either flat or cylindrical. 

## 2.2.4.6.4.2.2 Accuracy, Greater Than 10 Deg. To +20 Deg. Elevation

For elevation angles greater than 10 degrees to +20 degrees the bearing error shall not exceed 15 degrees RMS or 45 degrees peak over all azimuth angles under the conditions of subparagraph 2.2.4.6.4.2.1. 

Note: The bearing estimation system may include a built-in automatic bearing bias 

correction capability if the bearing bias can become inconsistent with these requirements due to drift or component change.  If provided, the automatic calibration should be accomplished immediately after every power turn-on event and should be capable of maintaining bearing bias correction during any flight leg. 

## 2.2.4.6.4.3 Bearing Accuracy In The Presence Of Interference

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The requirements in the following subparagraphs apply under the same conditions as defined in subparagraph 2.2.4.6.4.2.1 except as expressly defined herein. 

## 2.2.4.6.4.3.1 Mode C Interleaved Replies

The RMS bearing error for a Mode C reply containing five code pulses shall not increase by more than one degree when that reply is interleaved with another reply of the same amplitude containing five code pulses. 

Note: This requirement ensures that pulse bearing measurements are correctly associated with the correct reply in an interleaved garble situation. 

## 2.2.4.6.4.3.2 Mode C Overlapped Replies

The RMS bearing error for a Mode C reply containing seven code pulses shall not increase by more than one degree when that reply is interfered with by another reply of the same amplitude such that any two of the code pulses in the first reply are garbled. 

Note: This requirement ensures that garbled pulse bearing measurements are not used 
in developing a reply bearing estimate. 

## 2.2.4.6.4.3.3 Mode S Overlapped Replies

The RMS bearing error for Mode S reply shall not increase by more than three degrees when interfered with by a Mode A or Mode C reply whose power is 7 dB below the Mode S reply power. 

Note: This requirement ensures that an interfering Mode A or Mode C fruit reply does 
not significantly degrade the Mode S reply bearing measurement when the interference power is -7 dB relative to the Mode S reply power. 

## 2.2.4.6.4.4 Bearing Filter Performance

The Mode S and Mode C angle of arrival reply measurements for each intruder aircraft shall be filtered to reduce angular fluctuations.  The technique used to develop smoothed target bearing estimates shall be consistent with and, where required, subservient to the range and altitude surveillance algorithms. The bearing filter shall produce new estimates of target bearing once each surveillance update interval. 

## 2.2.4.6.4.4.1 Bearing Filter

The bearing filter shall produce continuous, smoothed target bearing estimates for Mode S targets or Mode C targets containing one or more ungarbled pulses.  The estimates shall have an RMS error of less than five degrees and a peak error of less than ±15 degrees from five seconds after valid reply bearing measurements begin until valid reply measurements terminate, when interference, multipath and systematic antenna errors are not present and when the actual target bearing rate does not exceed one degree per second.  Valid reply bearing measurements for this requirement are derived from Mode C replies using up to seven ungarbled pulses or Mode S replies for which the address is correctly decoded. The bearing filter shall produce target bearing estimates that lag valid reply bearing measurements by no more than five seconds for steady-state bearing rates of three degrees per second. 

Note: The maximum constant bearing rate of practical significance is three degrees per 
second, due to own aircraft heading changes during standard turns.  Higher short-term rates can occur during the lateral passage of an aircraft.  When an aircraft flies by at close range, its bearing changes by nearly 180 degrees within a few seconds.  The resulting angular acceleration is difficult to track continuously with a bearing tracker alone.  For this reason, it is recommended that the algorithm for predicting bearing be based on Cartesian position estimates rather than polar position estimates. 
Appendix A, Section A.10 describes a Cartesian alpha-beta estimation algorithm that has been used successfully to develop smoothed target bearing estimates. 

## 2.2.4.6.4.5 Dynamic Range And Reply Frequency

The TCAS II bearing estimation function shall meet the requirements of subparagraphs 2.2.4.6.4.2.1 and 2.2.4.6.4.2.2 for input signal levels between MTL and -21 dBm and input signal frequencies between 1087 MHz and 1093 MHz. 

## 2.2.4.7 Antenna System

The equipment shall transmit interrogations and receive replies from top mounted and bottom mounted antennas. 

Note: A TCAS II unit and Mode S transponder may share a single pair of antennas. 

## 2.2.4.7.1 Polarization

The antennas shall be vertically polarized. 

## 2.2.4.7.2 Radiation Pattern 2.2.4.7.2.1 Transmit Radiation Pattern

The TCAS II equipment shall be capable of providing directional interrogations from topmounted antennas for surveillance of Mode C targets in densities up to 0.3 aircraft per sq. NM.  An omnidirectional bottom transmit antenna is sufficient for TCAS II since most of the interrogations are transmitted from the top antenna in order to reduce susceptibility to multipath interference from the ground.  The use of a bottom directional transmit antenna and the use of directional interrogations for surveillance of Mode S targets and for transmission of TCAS II Broadcast interrogations is optional. The directional interrogation antenna shall generate an azimuth beam that is sequentially positioned to provide adequate surveillance coverage over 360 degrees azimuth.  To ensure adequate coverage, the directional antenna 3 dB beamwidth in azimuth shall not be less than the separation between adjacent azimuth beam positions. Beamwidth control is further provided by the P2 suppression pulse as defined in subparagraph 2.2.4.5.4.2.1. Also, the shapes of the antenna azimuth patterns shall be controlled such that a minimumsuppression transponder, defined as one that replies when the received ratio of P1 to P2 exceeds 0 dB, shall reply to interrogations from no more than two adjacent directional beams.  The requirements of this paragraph shall apply for each elevation angle between +20 degrees and -15 degrees. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The shape of the elevation pattern at the azimuth peak-of-beam of each directional beam should match the shape of the elevation pattern of a matched quarter-wave stub within ±1 dB over 90% of the region from -15 degrees to +20 degrees in elevation when installed at the center of a 1.2 m (4 ft.) diameter (or larger) circular ground plane that can be either flat or cylindrical. The gain of an omni-directional transmit pattern (if employed) should not be less than the gain of a matched quarter-wave stub minus one dB over 90% of a coverage volume from 0 to 360 degrees in azimuth and -15 to +20 degrees in elevation when installed at the center of a 1.2 m (4 ft.) diameter (or larger) circular ground plane that can be either flat or cylindrical. If the antenna gain is not as specified above, the transmitted power shall be adjusted to satisfy the power requirements specified in subparagraphs 2.2.3.1 and 2.2.4.5.4.2.2. 

## 2.2.4.7.2.2 Receive Radiation Pattern

A TCAS II that employs an omni-directional receive pattern shall meet all of the gain requirements specified in subparagraph 2.2.4.7.2.1 for an omni-directional transmit pattern. A TCAS II that employs a directional receive pattern consisting of four simultaneous directional beams shall meet the following pattern requirements when installed at the center of a 1.2 m (4 ft.) diameter (or larger) circular ground plane that can be either flat or cylindrical.  The shape of the elevation pattern at the azimuth peak-of-beam of each directional beam shall match the shape of the elevation pattern of a matched quarter wave stub within ±1 dB over 90% of the region from -15 degrees to +20 degrees in elevation. The gain at the crossover points between adjacent directional beams shall not be less than the adjacent peak-of-beam gain minus 4 dB from -15 degrees to +20 degrees in elevation. A TCAS II that employs a receive pattern consisting of more than four simultaneous directional beams shall meet the elevation pattern requirement stated above for the fourbeam antenna.  The gain, relative to peak-of-beam, at the crossover points between adjacent directional beams of this antenna shall match, within 1 dB, the gain required to account for the maximum closing speed that occurs in the direction of the crossover point. If the antenna gain is not as specified above, the nominal receiver MTL shall be adjusted to account for the antenna gain. 

Note: For example, for a relative peak-of-beam antenna gain of -3 dB, the MTL value associated with a reply received via this beam shall be lowered by 3 dB. 

## 2.2.4.7.3 Use Of A Directional Antenna For Mode S Interrogations

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Availability of bearing information will allow Mode S interrogations to be made using a directional antenna.  If a directional antenna is used for transmission of Mode S interrogations, the transmit radiation pattern shall be as specified in subparagraph 2.2.4.7.2.1 with the exception that side-lobe suppression is not used. 

## 2.2.4.7.4 Antenna Selection 2.2.4.7.4.1 Squitter Listening

The equipment shall monitor squitters via top and bottom antennas that are capable of simultaneous reception over 360 degrees of azimuth.  If reception is switched, the switching times shall be controlled to avoid undesirable synchronism with the squitters transmitted by Mode S diversity transponders. 

Note: This can take the form of simultaneous reception using two receivers and two 
decoders or switched reception using a single receiver.  Mode S transponders alternate the antennas used for squitter transmissions at nominal 1-second intervals.  It is acceptable for TCAS II to switch antennas for squitter monitoring after two successive surveillance update periods. 

## 2.2.4.7.4.2 Interrogations And Replies

The equipment shall transmit each Mode C or Mode S interrogation via one or the other of two antennas.  Interrogations shall not be transmitted simultaneously via both antennas.  Replies shall be received from the same antenna that was used to transmit the interrogation.  

## 2.2.4.8 Surveillance Interfaces 2.2.4.8.1 Data Provided By Surveillance To The Cas Logic A. Surveillance Report

Each surveillance update interval, surveillance shall provide to the CAS logic the following information on all established intruder surveillance tracks with fewer than 6 consecutive coasted reports (fewer than 10 consecutive coasted reports for tracks with 5-second update rates):

Note: Measured bearing is used by the miss distance filter. 

For newly established tracks, the above information shall be provided for each reply used to establish track.  The two Mode S replies or the four Mode C replies used to establish track are required as a minimum.  Information shall not be provided to the CAS logic for aircraft that are determined to be on the ground as specified in 2.2.4.6.1.3. 

If a Mode S track changes its altitude reporting status, no action shall be taken by surveillance other than changing the altitude reporting flag and either starting or stopping the altitude data in the Surveillance Report to CAS.  If a Mode S track changes its altitude quantization bit, no action shall be taken by surveillance other than changing the altitude quantization bit in the Surveillance Report to CAS.  (That is, in both of the above cases, surveillance retains the original surveillance track number for that track.) 
Note: As described in 2.2.4.6.2.1 and 2.2.4.6.3, an ATCRBS track cannot change its altitude reporting status since replies subsequent to the change would not correlate with replies prior to the change.  The track would automatically coast out, and a new track would be started. 

If a track changes status from 5-second update rate to 1-second update rate or from 1- second update rate to 5-second update rate, no action shall be taken by surveillance other than changing the update rate flag in the Surveillance Report to CAS.  

b. Surveillance Complete Report 
Surveillance shall provide a means for the CAS logic to recognize when all surveillance reports have been received for this surveillance update interval. 

c. Ground Level Report 
Each surveillance update interval, surveillance shall provide to the CAS logic a ground level estimate (2.2.4.6.1.2) and a status indicating whether the ground level estimate is valid or invalid. 

## 2.2.4.8.2 Data Received By Surveillance From The Cas Logic

Surveillance shall be capable of receiving the following data from the CAS logic each surveillance update interval: 
Interrogation mode (interrogate, don't interrogate) Own tracked barometric altitude Own tracked radio altitude Own air status (on-ground, airborne) Radio altitude status (credible, not credible) (subparagraph 2.2.7.2.5.2.2 ) 
For each ATCRBS track currently generating a TA or RA: 
Surveillance track number TA/RA status (i.e., either TA or RA) 

## 2.2.4.8.3 Data Received By Surveillance From The Monitor

Surveillance shall be capable of receiving the following data from the Monitor at least once per surveillance update interval: 
TCAS operational status (operational, not operational) 

## 2.2.4.8.4 Surveillance Interrogation Mode Selection

Surveillance shall not transmit interrogations if: 

a. the interrogation mode provided to surveillance by the CAS logic is "don't 
interrogate,"  or 
b. the TCAS operational status provided to surveillance by the Monitor is "not 
operational."  
Upon receiving either of the above indications, surveillance shall clear intruder track data and cease providing Surveillance Reports (2.2.4.8.1a) to the CAS logic.  Surveillance shall continue to provide Surveillance Complete Reports (2.2.4.8.1b) and Ground Level Reports (2.2.4.8.1c) to the CAS logic once per surveillance update interval. 

## 2.2.5 Collision Avoidance System Requirements

The equipment shall include collision avoidance algorithms that meet the requirements specified in the Collision Avoidance System Requirements Specification (CRS) contained in Volume II. At a minimum, the collision avoidance algorithms shall implement the following functions:  

a. Collision avoidance tracking. b. Potential threat and threat detection. 
c. Threat resolution. d. Communication and coordination. e. Determination of Traffic Advisory and Resolution Advisory data to be passed to the 
displays. 
Data for execution of the collision avoidance functions listed above shall be obtained from on-board aircraft subsystems, the Mode S transponder and the monitoring and surveillance functions as specified in paragraphs 2.2.3 and 2.2.4. The five functions listed above shall be standardized to ensure that airborne TCAS units interact satisfactorily with each other, with ground-based separation assurance systems such as Conflict Alert and with the air traffic control system.  Parameters used in the logic shall be adjusted automatically to maintain collision avoidance protection with minimal interference to normal ATC operations.   
Note: The remainder of paragraph 2.2.5 provides explanatory material.   

## 2.2.5.1 Collision Avoidance Tracking 2.2.5.1.1 Own Aircraft Altitude

Note: The altitude tracking requirements specified in Volume II use inputs of own 
altitude that are provided by an on-board source and that meet the requirements of paragraph 3.2.8.  These altitude inputs may be quantized more finely than are Mode C or Mode S altitude reports.  If finely quantized data are available, an alpha-beta tracker is used; otherwise, the same nonlinear vertical tracker used for tracking intruder altitude reports quantized to 100 ft is used.  Credibility of own altitude data is assessed prior to use of the data within the tracker.  In addition, provision has been made for switching tracking methods if a change in 
own aircraft"s altitude quantization is detected and the indicated quantization 
remains stable for a specified period of time. 

## 2.2.5.1.2 Control Of Sensitivity Level

Note: The collision avoidance logic employs seven distinct performance or "Sensitivity 
Levels" (SLs) identified by the numbers 1 through 7, which correspond to increasing logic parameter values.  For Sensitivity Level 1, the logic threshold values are effectively zero.  Sensitivity Level 1 is a standby condition in which TCAS does not interrogate and therefore does not perform any surveillance or resolution.  This level is used only when TCAS has no collision avoidance responsibilities.  In Sensitivity Level 2, TCAS continues surveillance but is inhibited from declaring threats (and thus issuing a resolution advisory).  TCAS 
may generate traffic advisories in Sensitivity Level 2. 
 
The sensitivity level is determined by the following three different types of inputs: 
a. Manual, from the cockpit switch. b. Command, from ground-based Mode S sensors. 
c. Automatic, from on-board barometric and radio altimeters. 
 
The rules for combining these various sensitivity level inputs are as follows:  
a. Select a provisional SL based on altitude (Table 2-13). When TCAS is on the ground, the logic will select SL 2 if display of traffic is permitted on the ground and the pilot has not selected Standby mode (SL 1). Otherwise, SL 1 will be selected.  In flight, automatic selection of SL 2 normally occurs when the TCAS aircraft is below 900 ft AGL.  Automatic selection of SL 2 also occurs if own aircraft is configured such that both CLIMB and DESCEND resolution advisories are inhibited (e.g., between 900 and 1000 ft AGL with insufficient climb performance).  
b. Read the manual input from the cockpit switch.  If the pilot has selected 
AUTOMATIC mode (manual input = 0), then the altitude-based sensitivity level will be used in comparisons to determine the final level. 
c. From all sensitivity level commands, if any, received from Mode S ground 
stations, select the lowest having a value greater than one. 
d. If neither the manual input nor the Mode S ground station input selects the 
TA_ONLY mode of operation (input value = 2 from either source), then the 
lowest of all inputs is chosen (with Resolution Advisories being enabled in sensitivity levels 3 through 7).  Otherwise, TA-ONLY mode is selected, using the altitude-based provisional sensitivity level for traffic advisory thresholds, and resolution advisories are inhibited.  (Exceptions to this rule are discussed below.) 
 
Table 2-13 provides rules for automatically selecting sensitivity levels based on barometric and radio altitude and provides the values of the more important parameters associated with those sensitivity levels.  TCAS uses these values against all threats unless it is evaluating a conflict against a TCAS-equipped threat that is reporting a higher sensitivity level than own aircraft.  In that case, 
the parameters for the high sensitivity level are used for that conflict only.  For resolution advisories, this exception does not apply when TCAS is operating in Sensitivity Levels 1 and 2, or when resolution advisories have been inhibited because it is in TA-ONLY mode.  For traffic advisories, this exception does not apply when TCAS is operating in Sensitivity Level 1.  Once a resolution advisory has been issued against a TCAS-equipped threat, the sensitivity level for that conflict is not permitted to decrease during that conflict in order to maintain continuity of the displayed advisory, except the transition to Sensitivity Level 2 is allowed at the resolution advisory inhibit threshold.  In addition, a resolution advisory against either an equipped or unequipped threat is not removed just because a Mode S ground site has selected TA-ONLY mode for own aircraft. Instead, the advisory will be retained until the aircraft either diverge in range, or the miss-distance filter removes the RA at which time the ground site selection of TA-ONLY mode will be applied.

Pressure altitude is referenced to the standard atmospheric pressure reference 
datum of 1013.25 millibars (29.92 inches of mercury).  When radio altitude and 
pressure altitude imply different sensitivity levels, TCAS selects the lower sensitivity level.

Alarm Times (TAU and TAUTA) and Incremental Protected Volume (DMOD) are selected according to the higher of own and threat Sensitivity Level, unless own Sensitivity Level is two or less. 

## 2.2.5.1.3 Other Aircraft Tracking

Note: Altitude reports from other aircraft are tracked using either a level-occupancytime algorithm or an alpha-beta tracker, depending on the indicated quantization and vertical rate. 

 
The level-occupancy tracker derives altitude and altitude rate by tracking the time intervals between changes of the Mode C altitude reports, which are quantized to 100 ft, as well as the altitude reports in Mode S replies that indicate they are also quantized to 100 ft.  When the altitude rate exceeds 6000 feet per minute, the level-occupancy tracker is complemented by an alpha-beta tracker, which is more accurate in handling higher vertical speeds.  The collision avoidance logic automatically switches between the level-occupancy and alphabeta trackers as needed.  For Mode S altitude reports that are quantized to 25 ft, an alpha-beta tracker is used. In addition, provision has been made for switching tracking methods from the 100 ft tracker to the 25 ft tracker and vice versa if a change in the intruder aircraft"s altitude quantization is detected and the indicated quantization remains stable for a specified period of time. 

 
Both trackers perform a confidence test on other aircraft's altitude rate.  This test classifies the tracked rate as high or low confidence and determines a range within which the rate must fall to allow later selection of escape direction. During periods when this rate is changing (a "low confidence interval"), certain other logic functions may be inhibited. 
 
Range measurements are tracked using an alpha-beta-gamma tracker, the outputs from which are used in algorithms that inhibit resolution advisories against aircraft that are predicted to pass with large horizontal miss-distances and in calculating the time-to-closest-approach. 
 
Intruder aircraft that are determined by surveillance to be on the ground are not passed to the collision avoidance logic.  Therefore, resolution and traffic advisories are not able to be issued for such traffic. 

## 2.2.5.2 Threat Detection

Note: A Miss Distance Filter has been incorporated, which reduces the number of 
alerts against intruder aircraft having large horizontal separations at closest approach.  The filter can also cause earlier removal of a resolution advisory that has already been issued and so help to minimize displacement.  The filter tracks the range measurements of all intruders to derive estimates of the range, range rate and range acceleration for each track.  Using these estimates, the filter calculates the horizontal miss distance that will occur at closest approach, and if 
the miss distance exceeds a specified threshold, inhibits the logic from issuing an 
advisory against the intruder aircraft.  Turn and speed change detection algorithms are used to shut the filter off and allow a resolution advisory to be issued.  This is done because such changes in the encounter geometry can cause unreliable estimates of the miss distance to be calculated, and would have possibly resulted in further delays in issuing an otherwise necessary RA. 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

 
When it is not excluded by miss-distance filtering, an aircraft will be declared a collision threat to the TCAS aircraft if its current or projected relative position within a specific prediction time simultaneously violates slant range and relative altitude boundaries.  (The algorithms that apply these criteria are known as the range test and altitude test, respectively.)  These boundaries are chosen to make TCAS sensitive to abnormal deviations from separations typically maintained by air traffic control or procedural flight rules. 
 
Generally, a threat aircraft will produce a collision warning in advance of closest approach by the amount of the prediction time (15 to 35 seconds).  
Additional time is provided for accelerating encounters by means of an incremental protected volume (DMOD) about own aircraft. 

 
To be declared a threat, an aircraft's expected altitude separation at the point of closest approach must be less than an altitude threshold (ZTHR).  Other altitude 
tests are also used, which are designed to bias against issuance of altitudecrossing resolution advisories, for example by allowing early threat declaration if a noncrossing advisory can be issued in a crossing geometry even if the expected altitude separation exceeds ZTHR; and by delaying threat declaration until TCAS and the intruder aircraft are close in altitude when no other option except crossing exists.  The latter feature in most cases avoids the crossing advisory entirely because own aircraft and the threat are given more time to level off, as intended. 
 
Once an aircraft has been declared a threat and causes a resolution advisory to be displayed, it will remain classified as a threat until both aircraft either begin 
to diverge in range or the miss-distance filter removes the RA, even though the altitude separation may exceed ZTHR feet. 
 
The detection logic also includes algorithms to bias against potential selection of resolution advisories which would result in the TCAS aircraft crossing through a threat aircraft's altitude.  In such instances, threat declaration will be deferred until the situation either can be satisfied by a noncrossing advisory or certain thresholds have been satisfied, warranting immediate issuance of a resolution advisory. 
 
If a TCAS-equipped intruder has sent own aircraft an altitude-crossing intent and if the range test has been passed, the logic will immediately declare that aircraft a threat regardless of the result of the altitude test.  The logic will also declare a TCAS-equipped intruder a threat if the intent it sent is noncrossing, but only if it has also passed the altitude test.  In addition, if own aircraft has the lower ICAO aircraft address and the received intent is altitude-crossing, the logic will disregard the intent and select its own resolution advisory sense provided the intent  was received within the last three seconds.  In this case, if a complementary crossing sense is not selected, the low ICAO aircraft address 
aircraft will force the high address aircraft to reverse its sense to noncrossing 
(see subparagraph 2.2.5.3.1.1, Sense Reversals). 
 
Additionally, own aircraft is not allowed to immediately declare a TCAS- equipped intruder a threat, if own aircraft has not been RA capable for more than two seconds.  This allows time to receive any current intent messages and prevents a low ICAO aircraft address TCAS, which has been switched from TA- ONLY mode to resolution advisory mode from causing an unnecessary sense reversal in a high address TCAS whose resolution advisory has already been displayed for some time. 
 
Finally, threat declaration is inhibited against intruder aircraft having vertical rates in excess of 10,000 fpm. This requirement reflects the design limit of the TCAS logic. 

## 2.2.5.3 Resolution Advisory Selection

Note: When a threat is declared, a resolution advisory is selected.  This process is 
accomplished in two phases, as described below in 2.2.5.3.1 and 2.2.5.3.2. 

## 2.2.5.3.1 Advisory Sense Selection

Note: The first phase is the selection of the climb or descend sense of a collision 
avoidance maneuver.  The climb sense results in a resolution advisory such as CLIMB, LIMIT DESCENT to 0 fpm or LIMIT DESCENT to 500 fpm so that TCAS may pass above the threat.  The descend sense is used when TCAS is to pass below the threat. 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

 
Threat declaration and advisory sense selection may be inhibited during an interval in which there is low confidence in the threat's vertical rate.  However, 
when a maneuver with one sense gives adequate projected separation against an intruder having a vertical rate falling anywhere in the confidence test range, that sense is selected without delay.  (Selection of an altitude-crossing sense is not permitted unless the two aircraft are sufficiently close in altitude such that the advised maneuver would generate adequate separation.  If the two aircraft are not close in altitude, the noncrossing sense may be selected if it provides adequate separation, albeit less than that achievable by crossing altitude.)  On the other hand, processing of a TCAS-equipped threat for which an intent message has been received is allowed to proceed without delay even if confidence in the threat"s vertical rate is low. 
 
When TCAS is able to select its RA sense based on the encounter geometry (i.e., against an unequipped threat or against an equipped threat for which an intent message either has not been received or is such that independent sense selection can be made), it uses range-altitude coordinates to model the path of the threat aircraft based on the tracked data of the threat.  TCAS also models for itself the path that would result if TCAS maneuvered to a climb and that which would result if TCAS maneuvered to a descent.  The path model in all cases consists of a linear segment, followed by a constant-acceleration altitude rate change, 
followed by a linear segment.  The linear escape rate modeled is nominally 1500 
fpm.  The model will use a higher rate for one direction when own aircraft"s 
current vertical rate exceeds the computed rate in that direction (up to a maximum of 4400 feet per minute) or a lower rate when constrained by current resolution advisories. 
 
In certain regimes of flight, TCAS may determine that the TCAS aircraft cannot execute the nominal climb escape maneuver.  This determination may be made according to unique characteristics of the aircraft on which TCAS is installed and the regime of flight and may use on-board inputs not otherwise required by TCAS.  Path modeling will substitute level flight for the climb maneuver in such instances. 
 
Similarly, radio altimeter data is used to recognize when TCAS is too near to the ground to issue a descend advisory.  Path modeling recognizes this condition and substitutes level flight at the appropriate altitude.   
 
TCAS computes the predicted vertical separation for each of the two sense selection options.  The directional sense that gives the greater predicted vertical separation from the threat aircraft at the time of closest approach is normally selected as the preferred sense of the resolution advisory caused by this threat. 
 
In the following cases, due to additional considerations, the preferred sense may not be the direction that gives the greatest modeled separation: 
a. Against a TCAS threat that has already selected its sense, own TCAS will 
select a complementary sense choice, unless own TCAS has the lower ICAO aircraft address, the intent is crossing and was received within the past three seconds, in which case own TCAS will select its RA sense independently.  If the resultant sense is noncrossing, the higher address threat will be forced to reverse the sense of its RA to noncrossing (see below). 
b. Against an unequipped intruder, when own is in a multi-aircraft situation 
and the two sense choices give adequate or approximately equal separation, own will select the same sense selected due to another simultaneous threat.   
c. Against any intruder, when the noncrossing sense is chosen because that 
sense will result in adequate separation at closest approach. 

## 2.2.5.3.1.1 Sense Reversals

Note: In most encounter situations, the resolution advisory sense, selected according to 
the algorithms described above, will be maintained for the duration of an encounter with a threat aircraft.  However, under certain circumstances it may be necessary for that sense to be reversed. 
 
For example, a conflict between two TCAS-equipped aircraft will with very high probability result in selection of complementary advisory senses because of the coordination protocol between the two aircraft.  However, if coordination communications between the two aircraft are disrupted at the critical time of sense selection, both aircraft may choose their advisories independently.  This could possibly result in sense selection of incompatible senses. 
 
Should a sense incompatibility be discovered by the TCAS logic, the logic will rectify the situation by having the TCAS with the higher ICAO aircraft address reverse its sense.  (The TCAS with the lower ICAO aircraft address retains its original sense.) 
 
The logic permits sense reversals of either crossing or noncrossing resolution advisories based on changes in encounter geometry, which indicate that the original advisory is being thwarted.  Such geometry-based reversals can occur both in TCAS-unequipped and TCAS-TCAS encounters. 
 
For the most part, the reversal logic for unequipped threats applies as well to the TCAS-TCAS case. However, some additions and changes have been made to make this logic more robust for TCAS-TCAS encounters because of the effect when both aircraft are maneuvering.  For example, the need for a reversal must be indicated on two out of three cycles.  Reversals from noncrossing to crossing are also inhibited in TCAS-TCAS encounters. 
 
After the original resolution advisory has been issued, the resolution logic monitors the progress of the encounter.  If it detects a substantial change in the encounter geometry, indicating that the intruder has begun to level-off or accelerate, or that own pilot is disregarding the original resolution advisory, it models pilot response to the reversed-sense advisory.  If the predicted result of 
that response exceeds the farthest predicted altitude of the intruder at closest approach (using the confidence test rate bounds) and retention of the existing RA sense will not provide adequate (ALIM) separation, the advisory sense is reversed. 
 
In all cases, after the decision to reverse sense is made, normal advisory strength selection occurs. 
 
Whenever the sense of a displayed advisory is reversed, the old advisory is removed, the new advisory is posted and the reversal is annunciated.  In a TCAS- TCAS encounter, a TCAS which has reversed its advisory sense will also send an 
intent message to the other TCAS containing both the reversed intent and cancellation of the previously sent intent. 

## 2.2.5.3.2 Advisory Type Selection

Note 1: The second phase of resolution processing is the computation of the least 
disruptive vertical flight profile that TCAS can fly to achieve safe separation.  
TCAS may select an advisory from one of the following types: 

| RA Class               | RA Type                   | Displayed Vert. Speed    |
|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
|                        |                           |                          |
| Positive               | CLIMB, DESCEND            | 1500 fpm                 |
|                        | MAINTAIN CLIMB or DESCENT | >1500 fpm                |
|                        | INCREASE CLIMB or DESCENT | 2500 fpm                 |
|                        |                           |                          |
| LIMIT CLIMB or DESCENT | 0, 500, 1000, 2000 fpm    | Negative                 |
| (Vert. Speed           |                           |                          |
| Limit (VSL))           |                           |                          |

Note 2: If a CLIMB, DESCEND, MAINTAIN CLIMB or MAINTAIN DESCENT RA 
involves crossing a threat"s altitude, it is annunciated as such. CLIMB and 
DESCEND RAs can also be issued as a result of a sense reversal and are also distinguished in that instance by a unique annunciation. 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

 
TCAS will generate a positive advisory either if the threat is projected to be within the positive advisory altitude threshold (ALIM) at the time of closest approach or if maintenance of the current vertical rate provides better separation over that of the opposite sense advisory, which will not result in ALIM separation.  This threshold value is smaller than the altitude boundary used in threat declaration and is derived from the measure of altitude separation that is considered safe at the time of closest approach.  An exception to this occurs when two TCAS-equipped aircraft are converging vertically with opposite rates and are currently well-separated in altitude.  In this instance, the logic will first issue a Vertical Speed Limit (VSL) 0 fpm (LIMIT CLIMB or LIMIT DESCENT 
TO 0 fpm) advisory to reinforce the pilots" likely intention to level off at their cleared flight levels.  This avoids an unnecessary and highly disruptive positive RA to maneuver opposite to the current vertical rate.  If no response to the VSL 0 fpm RA is detected after a sufficient period of time has elapsed, or if either aircraft accelerates toward the other, the initial VSL 0 fpm RA is allowed to strengthen as necessary. 

 
TCAS will select the least disruptive negative (VSL) advisory if one of these types achieves safe separation.  Otherwise, a positive advisory is generated.  If a VSL is selected and is corrective, it is later posted as a VSL 0 fpm advisory (see 2.2.5.5).  If safe separation depends on own aircraft maintaining an existing vertical rate of at least 1500 feet per minute, a "maintain" indication will be given.  The rate used by the modeling algorithm is also provided.  The maximum displayable vertical rate is limited by typical display capabilities, however, to 
4400 feet per minute.  If own aircraft"s current rate exceeds the maximum, the 
modeling algorithms will project own altitude as though it had reduced its rate to 
4400 feet per minute. 
 
TCAS recomputes the selection of an advisory on every processing cycle (approximately every second).  The sense or type of advisory may change as the geometry of the conflict changes.  Display changes to a less restrictive advisory are delayed for several seconds.  Advisory recomputation is inhibited when TCAS has low confidence in the threat's vertical rate. 
 
If a positive advisory (CLIMB or DESCEND) is called for, TCAS assumes that the pilot can achieve the modeled nominal rate (1500 fpm) or maintain the current rate, if higher than 1500 fpm (up to a maximum of 4400 fpm) in the appropriate direction.  Logic modeling of potential aircraft maneuvers accounts for acceleration and a delay for pilot observation and reaction to the advisory display. TCAS never assumes that the aircraft can climb or descend faster than the modeled nominal rate unless that aircraft's track shows it is already doing so. TCAS does not display a CLIMB RA when it has been determined that the TCAS aircraft cannot climb, unless a sense reversal to a CLIMB advisory is required. 

## 2.2.5.3.2.1 Advisories To Increase The Vertical Rate

Note: The logic also includes an algorithm to detect situations in which either the 
intruder aircraft increases its vertical rate toward the TCAS aircraft or own pilot does not respond in the prescribed manner to the displayed advisory, such that the TCAS aircraft, in executing its nominal escape maneuver, will not be able to obtain sufficient vertical separation.  Once it has detected this situation, the logic models own aircraft response to an Increase Rate (INCREASE CLIMB or INCREASE DESCENT) RA and if sufficient separation would be generated over that provided by the nominal escape maneuver, displays an advisory to increase the vertical rate from 1500 fpm to 2500 fpm in the existing sense. 
 
An advisory to increase vertical rate is permissible if the current resolution advisory is noncrossing or insufficient time remains in a crossing situation for successful execution of a sense reversal.  If the intruder is a TCAS aircraft, an increase rate RA is permitted whether or not the encounter involves crossing altitudes.  
 
The Increase Rate logic has been designed to be very robust to avoid unnecessary display of these RAs.  For example, the need for an increase must be indicated on two out of three cycles whenever time to closest approach is long enough to permit the extra delay,  increase rate RAs are inhibited in favor of reversing sense when it appears that own aircraft is disregarding its original 
noncrossing RA in a conflict with a nonequipped aircraft, and hysteresis is applied to the increase-descent inhibit altitude in order to prevent fluctuations in the capability of the logic to issue an INCREASE  DESCENT RA. 

## 2.2.5.3.3 Multi-Aircraft Logic

Note: Special rules are invoked when a TCAS-equipped aircraft is involved in a 

multiple-aircraft encounter.  The pilot of the aircraft with "projected clear airspace above" is told to CLIMB, and the pilot of the aircraft with "projected clear airspace below"  is told to DESCEND.  Aircraft "projected in the middle" 
are told not to climb and not to descend until the aircraft above or below are no longer in conflict. 
 
The selection of a positive DESCEND advisory in a multi-aircraft situation is also subject to the performance limitations of the TCAS aircraft when it is near the Descend Inhibit altitude threshold.  In this case, a negative DON'T CLIMB will be selected instead of DESCEND. 
 
The multi-aircraft logic has been designed to prevent premature level-off RAs when own is to pass between two threats vertically.  This requires retention of a positive RA until certain criteria have been met so that vertical separation is maximized.  The multi-aircraft logic also includes the ability to model and select Increase Rate RAs and sense reversals to better resolve situations that are deteriorating due to adverse maneuvers by own aircraft or one of the threats. (The ability to generate an Increase Rate RA is subject to the INCREASE CLIMB and INCREASE DESCENT inhibit indications and thresholds.)  The logic also performs an unbiased evaluation of all new threats to select the optimum RA against all rather than constraining the RA to be selected against the second or third threat by the initial choice against the first. 

## 2.2.5.4 Tcas Communications Interface 2.2.5.4.1 Communication Of Resolution Advisory Information

Note: TCAS communicates its resolution advisory to the pilot of own TCAS aircraft by means of the RA display and aural annunciation subsystems.  TCAS also communicates its displayed RA to other TCAS-equipped aircraft in replies to coordination messages received from those aircraft.  (This composite RA information is not used by the other TCAS aircraft for any purpose other than an acknowledgment that its intent message was received.)  TCAS also communicates its composite resolution advisory to a Mode S ground sensor by means of a Resolution Advisories Report when so requested by the sensor.  In addition, TCAS periodically broadcasts its resolution advisory information (RA Broadcast) for reception by ground-based systems that may monitor resolution advisories in airspaces not covered by full-capability Mode S ground sensors.  The RA 
Broadcast includes the Mode A identity code and Mode C altitude code for own aircraft. 

 
The RA Broadcast begins when the RA is initially issued and is updated and rebroadcast every 8 cycles thereafter.  When the RA display ceases in the 
cockpit, the RA Terminated (RAT) indicator is set and the most recent RA information is broadcast for the next 18±1 seconds. 
 
The Active Resolution Advisories (ARA) field in the RA Broadcast, co-ordination reply and RA Report contains detailed information on the sense, strength and classification of the displayed RA.  The Multi-threat Encounter (MTE) flag is also included for use in interpreting the contents of the ARA field, depending on the encounter situation.  The RA Report also includes the Threat Type Indicator (TTI) fields and subfields.  For Mode S threats, TTI contains the ICAO aircraft address; for ATCRBS threats, TTI contains the relative range, altitude and bearing of the most recent threat. 

## 2.2.5.4.2 Communication (Coordination) With Threat Aircraft Equipped With Tcas Onboard Resolution Capability

Note: When a TCAS-equipped aircraft is in an encounter with a threat that is also 
equipped with TCAS having on-board resolution capability, TCAS communicates to the threat the sense of its advisory with respect to that threat.  The 
communication is in the form of a negative command (e.g., Don"t Climb or Don"t 
Descend) and is referred to as the aircraft's resolution advisory complement (RAC) or, less formally, its "intent."  That is, if one aircraft has selected a climb sense advisory against a TCAS-equipped threat, it will send a Don"t Climb RAC to that threat.  Likewise, if it has selected a descend sense advisory against a TCAS-equipped threat, it will send a Don"t Descend RAC to that threat. Coordination interrogations use the same 1030/1090 MHz channels as surveillance and are transmitted at a nominal rate of once per second by each aircraft for the duration of the encounter, i.e., an aircraft transmits a coordination interrogation to the other aircraft once per second as long as it perceives the other aircraft to be a threat.  The coordination interrogations sent by own TCAS are received by the threat"s Mode S transponder, which sends a 
Coordination Reply Message as a technical acknowledgment and passes the 
information on to the threat"s TCAS unit for processing. (The threat aircraft may 
also detect own TCAS as a threat.  If so, the threat initiates communication and the roles are reversed.)  Because intent messages can be received at any time during the threat processing cycle, the collision avoidance logic ensures data integrity by preventing simultaneous access to the same information. 
 
The basic rule for sense selection in an encounter with a TCAS-equipped threat is that before selecting a sense, each TCAS must first check if it has received an intent message from the threat.  If no intent has been received, TCAS will select a sense based on the encounter geometry (subparagraph 2.2.5.3.1).  If an intent has been received, in most cases TCAS will immediately select the complementary RA sense.  However, if own TCAS" ICAO aircraft address is lower in value than that of the threat and the threat has sent an altitude-crossing intent within the preceding three seconds, own TCAS will select its RA sense independently.  If that sense is noncrossing, the threat will be forced to reverse 
the sense of its RA upon receipt of own TCAS" intent message, displaying and announcing the reversed RA to the pilot. 

 
In the vast majority of cases, two TCAS aircraft will see each other as threats at slightly different moments in time.  Coordination proceeds in a straightforward 
manner with the first aircraft selecting and transmitting its (geometry-based) sense and, slightly later, the second aircraft selecting and transmitting the opposite sense.  In the event of simultaneous coordination, i.e., if both aircraft select a sense independently based on the perceived encounter geometry, and if the senses turn out to be incompatible, then the aircraft with the higher ICAO aircraft address will reverse its sense, displaying and announcing the reversed RA to the pilot. 

## 2.2.5.4.2.1 Coordination Processing Within Own Tcas

Note: The coordination process (including sense selection and transmission of coordination interrogations) plus display of the advisory is depicted in Figure 2-10. 

## 2.2.5.4.2.2 Coordination Interactions Between Two Tcas-Equipped Aircraft

Note: Figures 2-11 and 2-12 illustrate the coordination process, emphasizing the interactions between the two aircraft.  The format for the two figures is the same: 
The two vertical columns represent the two TCAS aircraft; events in the columns represent the main logic features that pertain to coordination.  Horizontal lines between the two aircraft represent messages transmitted on the RF link. Rectangles indicate times during which an aircraft is performing coordination processing.  Figure 2-11 illustrates a standard (nonsimultaneous) coordination; Figure 2-12 illustrates a simultaneous coordination. 

 
In Figure 2-11, at the top of the page, aircraft 1 (having the higher ICAO aircraft address) has detected aircraft 2 as a threat and has determined that aircraft 2 is a TCAS-equipped threat.  Aircraft 1 begins the sense selection process.  If aircraft 2 has previously communicated its intent, then aircraft 1 simply selects 
the opposite sense.  If, as shown, aircraft 2 has not communicated its intent, then aircraft 1 selects a sense based on the encounter geometry.  Aircraft 1 then selects a specific RA and sends its intent to aircraft 2.  Aircraft 2 sends a reply and then stores the received intent.  At a later time, aircraft 2 detects aircraft 1 as a threat.  Aircraft 2 begins the sense selection process.  Because aircraft 2 has the lower ICAO aircraft address, it is capable of forcing the higher address aircraft to reverse its sense, if necessary.  If, as illustrated in Figure 2-11, aircraft 1 has previously communicated its intent within 3 seconds of aircraft 2 detecting aircraft 1 as a threat and if that intent is altitude-crossing, aircraft 2 will select sense based on its perception of the encounter geometry.  If the selected sense is also altitude-crossing, the senses are compatible; if the selected sense is nonaltitude-crossing, aircraft 1 will be forced to reverse its RA sense from crossing to noncrossing.  If the preceding conditions are not met, aircraft 2 will simply select the sense that is compatible with the intent received from aircraft 1.  Aircraft 2 then selects a specific RA and sends its intent to aircraft 1. Aircraft 1 sends a reply and then stores the received intent.  Each aircraft displays its selected RA at the end of its processing cycle. 
 
On subsequent scans, aircraft 1, because it has the higher ICAO AIRCRAFT ADDRESS, checks the intent  received from aircraft 2 to see if aircraft 2 has sent 
an incompatible sense.  If so, aircraft 1 reverses its sense in order to be 
compatible.  Aircraft 2, because it has the lower ICAO AIRCRAFT ADDRESS, does not check the intent received from aircraft 1 for compatibility.  Again, each aircraft displays its selected RA at the end of its processing cycle. 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

 
One item of note:  In general, as a part of its regular processing cycle, the TCAS with the lower ICAO aircraft address now has the ability to reassess its sense selection and reverse its sense based on geometry considerations.  If the TCAS with the lower ICAO aircraft address reverses sense, then according to the process described at the beginning of the previous paragraph, the TCAS with the higher ICAO aircraft address will also reverse sense in order to be compatible.  
 
Figure 2-12 shows simultaneous coordination.  Each aircraft independently selects a sense (based on geometry) and an RA.  Each aircraft then sends its intent to the other aircraft and displays the RA.  As described above, on subsequent scans, aircraft 1 (the higher ICAO AIRCRAFT ADDRESS) checks the intent received from aircraft 2 to see if aircraft 2 has sent an incompatible sense. If so, aircraft 1 reverses its sense in order to be compatible. 

## 2.2.5.5 Display Of Resolution Advisories

Note: Resolution advisories against all threats detected by own TCAS are combined for 
pilot display, such that the most demanding resolution advisory of those active is 
displayed for each sense (up/down). 
 
The logic indicates whether a displayed advisory requires corrective action by the pilot, or merely warns against initiating an action that could lead to inadequate vertical separation.   
 
All positive RAs (CLIMB, DESCEND, INCREASE CLIMB/DESCENT, MAINTAIN CLIMB/DESCENT) are displayed and announced as corrective RAs, with a green "fly-to" indication being shown on the RA display.  Positive RAs are only permitted to weaken to VSL 0 fpm RAs (LIMIT CLIMB and LIMIT DESCENT to 0 fpm RAs) once adequate (ALIM) separation has been achieved. This logic behavior reflects the observed behavior of pilots who will generally 
cause own aircraft to level off rather than initiating a maneuver towards a threat even when the logic calculates that the maneuver is safe.  In a similar fashion, initial negative (VSL) RAs (0, 500, 1000 and 2000 fpm) are not permitted to weaken at all. 
 
The logic also permits TCAS to use on-board altitude alerter information solely for the purpose of making the resolution advisories more consistent with the aircraft"s altitude clearance once the immediate collision threat has been resolved.  This means that at the point when the logic normally would weaken the RA from positive to VSL 0 fpm, the weakening would not take place if the positive RA would continue to direct own aircraft toward its clearance altitude.  If own aircraft is nearing its cleared altitude before closest approach has been reached, the logic will weaken the RA to a corrective VSL 0 fpm.  Of course, the conflict may be finished before the altitude clearance is reached, in which case the RA will end and "Clear of Conflict" will be announced.  The use of altitude alerter information is an implementation option. 
Pilot reactions that were unintentionally opposite to corrective VSL 0, 500, 1000 and 2000 fpm RAs have been operationally observed.  To prevent future occurrences, the display unit  replaces these RAs with a single level-off RA (VSL 
0 fpm) accompanied by the annunciation "Level Off, Level Off." 

 
Finally, TCAS will not display a Maintain Rate RA that calls for a vertical rate in excess of 4400 fpm.  This is because the RA display on the Instantaneous Vertical Speed Indicator (IVSI) cannot place a green "fly-to" arc to accurately indicate such high rates.  Instead, the logic will model own aircraft reducing its current vertical rate to 4400 fpm for the response to the Maintain Rate RA and select the sense that provides the best separation, even if it means that an RA will be chosen that is opposite to the current vertical direction. 

## 2.2.5.6 Traffic Advisories

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Note: TCAS selects intruder aircraft for generating traffic advisories by using 
algorithms analogous to those used in threat detection but with larger thresholds. The traffic advisory normally precedes the resolution advisory in time.  The logic classifies intruding traffic with four levels of priority to support symbology 
indicating their priority and to ensure that the highest ones are displayed.  The highest priority is given to a threat causing a resolution advisory to be generated.  All targets causing resolution advisories are displayed, even if there is no bearing estimate currently available.  The next priority is given to other potential threats, including targets without altitude reports.  The next priority is given to traffic satisfying a proximity test but not a tau-based detection test. The lowest priority is given to other traffic that is being tracked but which does not meet any of the criteria for the previous classifications. 

## 2.2.6 Displays And Controls 2.2.6.1 Traffic Displays 2.2.6.1.1 Functions

Note: The traffic display provides the following functions: 

a. Aid in the visual acquisition of traffic and differentiation of intruder threat 
levels. 
b. Provide situational awareness. c. Instill confidence in the displayed resolution advisories (RA). 

## 2.2.6.1.2 Characteristics 2.2.6.1.2.1 General Characteristics 2.2.6.1.2.1.1 Own Aircraft Symbol

The traffic display shall contain a symbol representing the location of the own aircraft. The color of the symbol shall be either white or cyan and different than that used to display proximate or other traffic (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1.3).   
Note: Cyan is the preferred color of the own aircraft symbol. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.2 Range Rings

One or more range rings shall be placed at specified radii from the own aircraft symbol. The inner range ring shall not be solid and shall be comprised of discrete markings at each of the twelve clock positions, except in the EXPANDED mode of the navigation display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.7) or on the weather radar when both weather and TCAS information are being displayed (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7.1).  The markings shall be the same color as the own aircraft symbol and of a size and shape that will not clutter the display.  If TCAS information is shown on a shared display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7) which does not provide range rings (or markings), range rings shall be provided when the TCAS information is selected. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.3 Threat Symbology

a. The symbol for an RA shall be a red filled square. 
b. The symbol for a TA shall be an amber or yellow filled circle. c. The symbol for Proximate Traffic shall be a white or cyan filled diamond.  The color 
of the Proximate Traffic symbol should be different than that used for the own aircraft symbol (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1.1) to ensure the symbol is readable.   
Note: White is the preferred color for this symbol. 

d. The symbol for Other Traffic shall be a white or cyan diamond, outline only.  The 
color of the Other Traffic symbol should be different than that used for the own aircraft symbol (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1.1) to ensure the symbol is readable.    
Note: White is the preferred color for this symbol. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.4 Off-Scale Symbology

RA or TA traffic which is beyond the selected display range of the traffic display shall be indicated by placing one half the appropriate symbol at the edge of the display area at the measured bearing of the traffic.  Data tags and appropriate vertical trend arrows shall remain fixed in the position relative to the traffic symbol defined in subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1.5 and in subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1.6, even if a portion of the information is masked by the edge of the active display area. On shared displays (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7), the off scale symbology described in this paragraph shall be used unless the symbology is inconsistent with that used for other functions of the shared display.  In these cases, a message of either ―TRAFFIC OFF- SCALE‖, ―OFFSCALE‖, or ―OFF-SCALE‖ shall be used.  These messages shall be written in the colors specified in 2.2.6.1.2.1.3 which correspond to the traffic's threat level. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.5 Altitude Data Tag

A data tag shall indicate the relative altitude, if available, of the intruder aircraft and shall consist of two digits indicating the altitude difference in hundreds of feet.  For an intruder above own aircraft, the tag shall be placed above the traffic symbol and preceded by a ―+‖ sign; for one below own aircraft, the tag shall be place below the traffic symbol and preceded by a ―-‖ sign.   
Note: It is recommended that the "+" or "-" character be emphasized by using a slightly larger character set than that used for the digits. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The tag for co-altitude traffic shall be displayed as the digits ―00‖.  The ―00‖ characters should be placed above the symbol if the intruder aircraft closed from above; below the symbol if the intruder aircraft closed from below.  If no trend information is available, the co-altitude ―00‖ symbol should be placed below the traffic symbol. The color of the data tag shall be the same as the symbol. 

The display shall be capable of displaying relative altitudes of up to a maximum of ±9900 
feet. As an option, the data tag may indicate the intruder's reported altitude instead of the relative altitude between the two aircraft.  If this option is implemented, a switch shall be provided to permit a pilot to select this type of altitude data tag.  If the actual altitude is to be shown on a continuous basis after selection by the flight crew, it shall be corrected for the local barometric pressure using the same correction used by the flight crew.  If the actual altitude is not corrected for the local barometric pressure, the display of this type of data tag shall be limited to a maximum of 30 seconds if the own aircraft is below 18,000 feet (FL180) before it automatically reverts back to the display of relative altitude.  When the display of the actual altitude is selected, it shall be clearly annunciated on the traffic display.  If implemented, the actual altitude shall be displayed as a three digit number representing hundreds of feet, MSL.  For example, 007 represents 700 feet MSL and 250 represents 25,000 feet MSL (FL250).  Actual altitude tags shall be positioned above or below the traffic symbol in a manner consistent with the relative altitude data tags.  As with the display of relative altitude, the display shall be capable of displaying tracked traffic up to a maximum of ±9900 feet of the own aircraft. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.6 Intruder Vertical Speed Arrow

A vertical arrow shall be placed to the immediate right of the traffic symbol if the vertical speed of the intruder (as determined by the TCAS tracker) is equal to or greater than 500 fpm, with the arrow pointing up for climbing traffic and down for descending traffic. The color of the arrow shall be the same as the traffic symbol. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.7 Non-Altitude Reporting Intruders

Neither a data tag nor a trend arrow shall be associated with the traffic symbol for an intruder that is not reporting altitude.  The colors described in subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1.3 for various threat levels shall be used for the display of non-altitude reporting intruders. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.8 No-Bearing Advisories

Advisories issued against an intruder for which bearing information is not available (No- Bearing advisories) shall be presented for traffic generating either a TA or an RA.  The No-Bearing advisory shall be displayed on the traffic display.  The advisory shall be an alpha-numeric string which presents the information in the following order:  threat level (TA or RA); range in NM; relative altitude (hundreds of feet); and the intruder vertical speed arrow.  For example, ―TA 5.2 -06‖ represents an intruder causing a TA at 5.2 NM with a relative altitude of -600 feet, and climbing.  The alpha-numerics shall be written in the colors corresponding to the level of the threat, i.e., red for an RA and amber or yellow for a TA.  The No-Bearing advisory may also be written using slashes to separate the different information fields and using NM after the range, e.g., ―TA/5.2 NM/-06. The altitude data in a No-Bearing advisory shall be consistent with the selected altitude mode, i.e., relative altitude or actual altitude. When a No-Bearing TA is issued against an intruder that is not reporting altitude, the altitude field of the message and the intruder vertical trend arrow shall be dropped.  For example, a TA issued against a non-altitude reporting intruder at a range of two NM 
would be annunciated as ―TA 2.0‖. The capability shall exist to display at least two No-Bearing advisories simultaneously. 

The recommended location of the No-Bearing advisories is dependent on the implementation of the traffic display and is defined in Table 2-14. If an intruder for which bearing information is available is being displayed in the same area as the No-Bearing advisory, the intruder with the higher priority, as defined by CAS, shall remain readable.

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.9 Display Of Traffic

Whenever an RA or a TA is displayed, all intruders causing an RA or TA and all Proximate Traffic within the selected display range, subject to any limitations to the maximum number of intruders that can be shown on the display, shall be displayed.  It is recommended that Other Traffic within the selected display range also be displayed whenever an RA or TA is displayed to maximize the probability of the pilot visually acquiring the intruder causing the RA or TA. The traffic display shall have the capability to display a minimum of eight intruder aircraft.  All intruders being tracked by TCAS are ranked by the CAS logic and the intruder information is sent to the display in a prioritized order.  The display shall display the intruders in the order received from CAS to ensure the intruders most relevant to collision avoidance are displayed.  The number of intruders to be displayed shall be fixed and not variable. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.10 Altitude Band For The Display

The normal altitude band for the display of traffic having an established surveillance track shall be ±2700 feet from the own aircraft.  If an intruder causing a TA or RA is outside this altitude band, it shall be displayed with the appropriate relative or reported altitude displayed.   Proximate and Other traffic outside the normal altitude band may also be displayed while a TA or RA is displayed. As an option, a pilot selectable mode may be provided to permit the expansion of the normal altitude band.  If this option is implemented, two additional modes, ―Above‖ and ―Below‖, shall be provided.  In the ―Above‖ mode, tracked traffic shall be displayed if it is within the altitude band from 2700 feet below the own aircraft up to a maximum that shall not exceed 9900 feet above the own aircraft.  In the ―Below‖ mode, tracked traffic shall be displayed if it is within the altitude band from 2700 feet above the own aircraft down to a maximum that shall not exceed 9900 feet below the own aircraft. The upper and lower bounds of the ―Above‖ and ―Below‖ mode shall be fixed and not variable. As a further option, a pilot selectable mode may be provided to permit the simultaneous selection of the ―Above‖ and ―Below‖ mode. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.11 Tcas Operating Mode And Selected Display Range Annunciation

The selected modes of TCAS operation shall be annunciated on the traffic display.  The TCAS operating mode may be manually selected by the pilot using the TCAS Control Panel (subparagraph 2.2.6.5) or automatically by the CAS logic.  In addition, the selected display range shall be annunciated on the traffic display. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.12 Ra Annunciations

With the exception of the red traffic symbology described in subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1.3 and subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1.8, no RA maneuver information shall be displayed on the Traffic Display.   
Note: This requirement does not apply to the TA/RA/VSI display defined in subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7.4 or to displays in which the TA and RA information are shown in separate sections of a display. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.13 Lighting Control

The lighting intensity of the traffic display shall either be automatic or controllable by the pilot.  For night operations, the brightness shall be controllable to a dim enough setting such that outside vision is not impaired while maintaining an acceptable presentation. For day operations, the display shall be readable in all sunlight conditions described in Paragraph 16.a.(3) of reference H. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.1.14 Status And Failure Annunciations

Whenever status and failure annunciations are written in text on the traffic display, the annunciations shall be consistent with any existing annunciations shown on the display and shall have a single meaning for all available display modes. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.2 Fixed Range Displays 2.2.6.1.2.2.1 Display Range

Note: It is recommended that the scale of the display area be between five and seven NM to the front and at least 2.5 NM to the rear of the own aircraft symbol. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.2.2 Range Ring

A two mile range ring shall be provided. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.3 Variable Range Displays 2.2.6.1.2.3.1 Display Range

A variable range display shall provide a display range whose full scale display range is approximately five NM to the front and at least 2.5 NM to the rear. 

Note: The requirement of 2.5 NM to the rear is only applicable to dedicated displays. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.3.2 Range Selection

A range selector shall provide for the setting of different full range scales. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.3.3 Range Rings

A range reference (ring or markings) shall be provided at either two or three NM for scales of 12 NM or less.  For display ranges greater than 12 NM, at least one range reference (ring or markings) shall be provided.  If the variable range display is also a shared display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7) which already provides range rings (or markings), the TCAS range references specified by this subparagraph are not required. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.4 Part Time (Pop-Up) Displays 2.2.6.1.2.4.1 Activation

A part time display shall either activate (pop-up) the appropriate traffic symbology or display the written text ―TRAFFIC‖ , ―TFC‖, or ―TCAS‖ (e.g., on a navigation  display, see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7.2) whenever a TA or an RA occurs.  The words 
―TRAFFIC‖, ―TFC‖, or ―TCAS‖ shall be written in amber or yellow for a TA and in red for an RA.  If TCAS is issuing both a TA and an RA simultaneously, the word shall be written in red.  Provisions shall be provided which can be used by the pilot to select a display mode capable of displaying the traffic symbology in implementations using the words ―TRAFFIC‖, ―TFC‖, or ―TCAS‖. 

The traffic information or the written text shall be displayed within one-half second of receipt of the information from the TCAS processor. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.4.2 Information Displayed

Once activated, the display shall remain active until the TA or RA is completed unless the selected display mode is changed by the pilot.  The display shall meet the requirements of subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1 when activated. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.4.3 Display Format

A part time display may be a dedicated display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.6) or a shared display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7). A part time display may be either a fixed range display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.2) or a variable range display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.3). 

## 2.2.6.1.2.4.4 Pilot Selection

If a display implementation provides the pilot the capability to manually switch between a part-time and a full-time display of traffic, the position of the switch used to make this selection shall be readily discernible by inspection. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.5 Full Time Displays 2.2.6.1.2.5.1 Display Format

A full time display may be a dedicated display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.6) or a shared display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7). A full time display may be either a fixed range display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.2) or a variable range display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.3). 

## 2.2.6.1.2.6 Dedicated Displays

Note: A dedicated display is a display or a display mode in which the only information shown on the display or on a designated section of the display is TCAS traffic information. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.6.1 Display Format

A dedicated display may be either a part-time display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.4) or a full-time display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.5).  A dedicated display shall meet the requirements of subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.6.2 Own Aircraft Symbol And Location

The own aircraft symbol shall be centered horizontally on the display and approximately 1/3 of the height from the bottom of the display. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7 Shared Displays

Note: A shared display is a display or a display mode in which TCAS information is 

shown simultaneously with any other information.  It is possible for a display to provide multiple display modes, some of which have the characteristics of a dedicated display and others which have the characteristics of a shared display. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.1 Shared Weather (Wx) Radar Displays 2.2.6.1.2.7.1.1 Display Modes

A shared weather radar display shall provide at least one of the following display modes. The other mode may be provided.  When traffic information is shown on a shared display, the information shall comply with the requirements of subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1. 

a. WX/TCAS Mode.  This is a part time display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.4) in which 
either a TA or an RA shall cause the display to show TCAS information.  The TCAS information may be shown with either a fixed range or a variable display range. When a TA or an RA is displayed, all weather information shall be removed from the display.  If the TCAS information uses a variable range display, the TCAS information shall be displayed at the selected range of the weather radar display. When the encounter is over, the display shall revert back to the display of weather information at the selected radar range.  If the TCAS information is implemented on a variable range basis and the display range is changed while traffic information is displayed, the newly selected range shall be retained when the display reverts back to the display of weather information. 
b. WX-and-Traffic Mode.  A TA or RA condition shall cause the traffic information to 
be displayed and shall preempt any other shared services (e.g., checklists or ACARS information).  It is permissible for navigation information to remain displayed.  If traffic is displayed at the same location as weather information, the traffic information shall be readily discernible and readable.  The traffic information shall be displayed at the range selected for the weather radar. 
Note: It is recommended that the range selection for both the TCAS and the 
weather information be combined into a single switch, or series of push buttons. 
If a TA or RA is issued for an aircraft that is between the three o'clock and the nine o'clock positions (in a clockwise direction), a written message of ―TA BEHIND‖ or ―RA 
BEHIND‖ shall be annunciated on the display to alert the pilot a change in display configuration is required to display the traffic.  The message ―TA BEHIND‖ shall be written in amber or yellow; the message ―RA BEHIND‖ shall be written in red.  As an option, the message ―TRAFFIC‖ or ―TFC‖ may be used and shall be written in amber or yellow when a TA is displayed and in red when an RA is displayed. This mode may be implemented on either a part time (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.4) or full time (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.5) basis.  This mode requires the implementation of a variable range traffic display. In addition to the modes described above, optional display modes may be provided, as follows.  If these modes are provided, they shall adhere to the following requirements. 

a. WX-Only Mode.  In this mode, no TCAS information shall be displayed without a 
crew action.  The TA and RA aural annunciations (see subparagraph 2.2.6.3) shall be provided to alert the crew that traffic information is available for display.  The crew shall be able to display the traffic at a pre-set or defaulted range scale with a single action.  When the encounter is completed, the display shall revert back to WX-Only mode at the previously selected range. 
b. Traffic-Only Mode.  In this mode, traffic within the selected range and altitude band 
(see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1.10) shall be displayed on a full time basis.  This mode may be implemented using either a fixed range display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.2) or a variable range display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.3). 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.1.2 Own Aircraft Symbol And Location

The own aircraft symbol shall be located in the following position for each of the required and optional display modes. 

a. In the WX/TCAS mode, the own aircraft symbol shall be centered horizontally on the 
display and approximately 1/3 of the height from the bottom of the display. 
b. In the WX-and-Traffic mode, a unique own aircraft symbol shall not be displayed.  
The own aircraft reference of the weather radar shall be used as the own aircraft symbol. 
c. In the Traffic-Only mode, the own aircraft symbol shall be centered horizontally on 
the display and approximately 1/3 of the height from the bottom of the display. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.2 Shared Navigation Displays (Nd) Or Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (Ehsi) 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.1 Display Characteristic

The display of TCAS information may be provided on either a part-time (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.4) or a full time (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.5) basis. 

If desired, the pilot can be provided with a means of selecting whether the display of traffic is shown on a part time or a full time basis. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.2 Failure Annunciations

TCAS failures shall be annunciated in accordance with subparagraph 2.2.6.6 on the ND or EHSI if the display of traffic has been selected. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.3 Traffic Display

TCAS traffic information shall be displayed in the MAP mode.  TCAS traffic information may be displayed in the EXPANDED, North-up, and horizontal situation indicator (HSI) modes. 

Note: Sample depictions of the MAP, EXPANDED, HSI, and North-up modes are shown in Figure 2-13.  The exact nomenclature of the display modes implemented differs from manufacturer to manufacturer.  Thus, all references made to specific display implementations in this subparagraph also apply to display implementations having similar characteristics, but different names. 

When a mode is selected which does not display traffic, a written message of either 
―TRAFFIC‖, ―TFC‖, or ―TCAS‖ shall be displayed to indicate a TA or an RA is in progress.  The message shall be written in amber or yellow for a TA and in red for an RA.  Provisions shall be provided which can be used by the pilot to select a display mode capable of displaying the traffic symbology in implementations using the words ―TRAFFIC‖, ―TFC‖, or ―TCAS‖. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.4 Tcas And Weather Information

When a mode is selected which displays both TCAS traffic and weather information, the traffic information shall be readily discernible. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.5 Tcas And Navigation Information

Whenever TCAS information is displayed at the same location as navigation data, it shall be readily discernible and readable. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.6 Hsi Display Mode 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.6.1 Display Characteristics

If traffic information is displayed while the HSI mode is selected, it may be implemented on either a part time (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.4) or full time (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.5) basis.   

Note: The HSI mode requirements apply to both the display of ILS and VOR navigation 
data. 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.6.2 Own Aircraft Symbol And Location

A unique own aircraft symbol shall not be displayed for TCAS.  The own aircraft symbol of the HSI, located at the center of the HSI, shall be used for TCAS. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.7 Expanded Mode 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.7.1 Display Characteristics

If traffic information is displayed when the EXPANDED mode is selected, it may be implemented on either a part time (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.4) or full time (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.5) basis.  If traffic information is displayed in this mode, it shall not be with a fixed range.   
Note: The EXPANDED mode requirements apply to both the display of ILS and VOR

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.3.4 Restrictions

The display of traffic shall not be shared with the primary engine display. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.4 Ta/Ra/Vsi Displays 2.2.6.1.2.7.4.1 General Requirements 2.2.6.1.2.7.4.1.1 Format

This display combines the functions of a vertical speed indicator (VSI) with the Resolution Advisory (RA) display described in subparagraph 2.2.6.2 and the traffic display described in subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2 through 2.2.6.1.2.6. This type of display shall be implemented only on round dial presentations of the VSI. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.4.1.2 Vsi Requirements

The length and width of the VSI needle shall be adequate to support quick and accurate interpretation of the actual vertical rate and vertical rate trends by peripheral vision only. The stem of the VSI needle shall overlap traffic information, but still allow traffic information to be readable. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.4.2 Traffic Display Function 2.2.6.1.2.7.4.2.1 Display Characteristics

Traffic information may be displayed on either a part time (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.4) or a full time (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.5) basis. Traffic information may be displayed with either a fixed range (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.2) or with a variable range (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.3). 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.4.2.2 Own Aircraft Symbol And Location

The own aircraft symbol shall be centered horizontally on the display and approximately 1/3 of the height from the bottom of the available display area. 

## 2.2.6.1.2.7.4.2.3 Interference With Vertical Speed Scale

Traffic information (symbols, data blocks, vertical trend arrows, annunciations, or No- Bearing advisories) shall not overwrite any portion of the vertical speed scale. 

## 2.2.6.2 Ra Displays 2.2.6.2.1 General

Note: The RA display provides guidance on the vertical speed or pitch angle to be 
flown, and the range of vertical speeds or pitch angles to be avoided, to attain or maintain the desired vertical miss distance from an aircraft causing an RA. 

## 2.2.6.2.2 Ra/Vsi (Round Dial Vsi)

This implementation shall indicate the vertical speeds to be flown and avoided using a series of red, green, and black arcs displayed around the periphery of the VSI. 

Note 1: The term "black arcs" refers to the area of the VSI scale, usually the background 
of the scale, that is not illuminated by the lighted red and green arcs. 
The scale of the VSI shall have sufficient range to display the required red and green arcs for all RAs which can be generated by the collision avoidance logic.  This will require a range of ±6000 fpm.   

Note 2: If the VSI does not have a range of 6000 fpm, a means shall be provided to 
display all  corrective and preventive RAs, as well as the own aircraft"s actual 
vertical speed. 

## 2.2.6.2.2.1 Ra Display Characteristics 2.2.6.2.2.1.1 Red Arcs

The red arcs on the RA/VSI shall indicate the vertical speed range that must be avoided to maintain or attain the TCAS-desired vertical miss distance from one or more intruders. The red arcs shall have the capability of displaying a resolution no larger than 500 fpm for maintain rate RAs issued by the CAS logic.  If the display is capable of displaying a finer resolution, it shall be used.  The red arcs shall be able to accurately depict all vertical speed limit (VSL) RAs shown in Table 2-16.  The red arcs shall be readily discernible and distinguishable.  The length of the red arc shall be adjusted as appropriate when the RA is strengthened or weakened by the CAS logic. 

## 2.2.6.2.2.1.2 Green Arcs

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
A green ―fly-to‖ arc shall be used to provide a target vertical speed whenever a change in the existing vertical speed is desired or when an existing vertical speed (not less than 1500 fpm) must be maintained.  Thus, a green arc shall be displayed for all RAs except initial preventive RAs.   
Note: Maintain Rate RAs are classified as corrective RAs.   
The nominal size of the green arc shall be approximately that defined by the distance between the 1500 and 2000 fpm marks on the VSI scale.  The size of the green arc shall remain constant no matter where the arc is placed on the display, with the exception of the multi-aircraft encounter described in subparagraph 2.2.6.2.2.1.4. The green arcs shall be readily discernible and distinguishable.  In addition, the green arc shall either be wider than the red arc or offset from the red arc to assist in visually differentiating between the red and green arcs. The green arc shall remain displayed for the entire duration of the RA.  Its position shall move to the appropriate position when an RA is strengthened or weakened by the CAS logic. 

## 2.2.6.2.2.1.3 Black Arcs

The portions of the VSI scale not covered by either a red or green arc shall remain black. 

## 2.2.6.2.2.1.4 Multi-Aircraft Encounters

For the special situation where a multi-aircraft encounter results in an RA where neither a climb nor descent is permitted, a green arc shall be displayed from approximately -250 fpm to +250 fpm.  The remainder of the VSI scale shall be illuminated with red arcs. 

## 2.2.6.2.2.2 Vsi Characteristics

Note: It is recommended that inertial quickening of the vertical speed function be 
provided.  

## 2.2.6.2.2.3 Lighting Control

The lighting intensity of the red and green arcs shall either be automatic or connected to an adjustable lighting control for other similar alerting indicators.  For night operations, the brightness should be controllable to a dim enough setting such that outside vision is not impaired while maintaining an acceptable presentation.  For day operations, the display shall be readable in all sunlight conditions described in Paragraph 16.a.(3) of reference H.  The lighting controls shall meet the requirements of reference I, Subsection 5.5. 

## 2.2.6.2.3 Ra/Vsi (Integrated Tape Vsi On A Primary Flight Display [Pfd])

This implementation shall indicate the vertical speeds to be flown and avoided using a series of red, green, and black zones displayed within the vertical speed tape portion of the PFD. 

Notes: 

1. 
The requirements of this subparagraph apply only when the sole means of displaying RA guidance information is shown on an Integrated Tape VSI on the PFD. 
2. 
The term "black zones" refers to the area of the VSI scale, usually the 
background of the scale, that is not covered by either a red or green zone. 

## 2.2.6.2.3.1 Ra Display Characteristics 2.2.6.2.3.1.1 Red Zone

The red zone on the RA/VSI shall indicate the vertical speed range that must be avoided to maintain or attain the TCAS-desired vertical miss distance from one or more intruders. The red zone shall be readily discernible and distinguishable.  The length (height) of the red zone shall be adjusted as appropriate when the RA is strengthened or weakened by the CAS logic. 

## 2.2.6.2.3.1.2 Green Zone

A green ―fly-to‖ zone shall be used to provide a target vertical speed whenever a change in the existing vertical speed is desired and when an existing vertical speed (not less than 1500 fpm) must be maintained.  Thus, a green zone shall be displayed for all RAs except initial preventive RAs.   
Note: Maintain Rate RAs are classified as corrective RAs.   
The nominal size of the green zone shall be approximately that defined by the distance between the 1500 and 2000 fpm marks on the VSI scale. The size of the green zone shall remain constant no matter where the zone is placed on the display, with the exception of the multi-aircraft encounter described in subparagraph 2.2.6.2.2.1.4. The green zone shall be readily discernible and distinguishable.  In addition, the green zone shall be wider than the red zone to assist in visually differentiating between the red and green zone. The green zone shall remain displayed for the entire duration of the RA.  Its position shall move to the appropriate position when an RA is strengthened or weakened by the CAS logic. 

## 2.2.6.2.3.1.3 Black Zones

The portions of the VSI scale not covered by either a red or green zone shall remain black. 

## 2.2.6.2.3.1.4 Multi-Aircraft Encounters

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
For the special situation where a multi-aircraft encounter results in an RA where neither a climb nor descent is permitted, a green zone shall be displayed from approximately -250 fpm to +250 fpm.  The remainder of the VSI scale shall be illuminated with red zones. 

Note: When the RA is corrective, it is also acceptable to allow a nominal length green arc beginning at 0 fpm in the corrective sense. 

## 2.2.6.2.3.2 Vsi Characteristics

Note: It is recommended that inertial quickening of the vertical speed function be 
provided. 

## 2.2.6.2.3.3 Vsi Scale

The scale of the VSI tape shall have sufficient range to display the required red and green zones for all RAs which can be generated by the collision avoidance logic.  This will require a range of ±6000 fpm. 

Note: If the vertical speed tape does not have a range of 6000 fpm, a means shall be 
provided to display all  corrective and preventive RAs, as well as the own aircraft"s actual vertical speed. 

## 2.2.6.2.3.4 Lighting Control

The lighting intensity of the red and green zones shall either be automatic or connected to an adjustable lighting control for other similar alerting indicators.  For night operations, the brightness should be controllable to a dim enough setting such that outside vision is not impaired while maintaining an acceptable presentation.  For day operations, the display shall be readable in all sunlight conditions described in Paragraph 16.a.(3) of reference H. 

## 2.2.6.2.4 Pitch Cues On The Pfd

This implementation shall indicate the pitch angles to be flown and avoided while responding to an RA using the symbology as follows.  A representation of a typical pitch cue implementation on the PFD is shown in Figure 2-14. 

Note 1: The requirements of this subparagraph are applicable whenever pitch cues are 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

used to provide RA guidance information.  This subparagraph does not require 
the implementation of pitch cues for RA guidance on all PFDs. 
Note 2: In this document, the term "PFD" refers to the display used to show the 
aircraft's relationship to the horizon.  The requirements for a PFD are also applicable to similar types of displays that may be referred to by different nomenclature. 
 

## 2.2.6.2.4.1 No-Fly Pitch Angles

A red trapezoid overlaying the other information on the PFD shall indicate the range of pitch angles that must be avoided to maintain or attain the TCAS-desired vertical miss distance from one or more intruders.  When the trapezoid is displayed, the other information shown on the PFD shall remain readily discernible and readable.  The trapezoid shall begin at the bottom of the PFD and extend upward to the desired pitch angle for up sense RAs; for down sense RAs, the trapezoid shall begin at the top of the PFD and extend downwards to the desired pitch angle.  The closed end of the trapezoid shall correspond to the pitch angle which will provide the vertical speed desired by TCAS. 

Note 1: The use of a trapezoid in this subparagraph is not intended to preclude the use of 
other geometric shapes, e.g., a rectangle, to depict the pitch angles to be avoided 
to attain or maintain the TCAS-desired vertical miss distance.  If other geometric 
shapes are used to display TCAS RA guidance, the requirements shown here for trapezoids shall be met. 
The red trapezoid shall remain displayed for the entire duration of the RA.  It shall move as appropriate when an RA is strengthened or weakened by the CAS logic. The symbology used in the TCAS trapezoid shall be readily discernible and distinguishable from any other information displayed on the PFD. 

Note 2: The use of a green "fly-to" target is permitted to provide a target pitch angle 
whenever a change in the existing vertical speed is desired.  If implemented, a green band or box shall be displayed at the top (up sense RA) or bottom (down sense RA) of the red trapezoid for all RAs except initial preventive RAs. If implemented, the green pitch target shall be readily discernible and distinguishable, and shall remain displayed for the entire duration of the RA.  It shall move to the appropriate position when an RA is strengthened or weakened by the CAS logic. 

## 2.2.6.2.4.2 Mode Annunciation

When an RA is displayed, a written annunciation of ―TCAS‖, ―TFC‖, or ―TRAFFIC‖, written in red, shall be displayed in the primary field of view of each pilot.  The exact implementation of the annunciation shall be compatible with the implementation of other mode annunciations. 

## 2.2.6.2.4.3 Multi-Aircraft Encounters

For the special situation where a multi-aircraft encounter results in an RA where neither a climb nor descent is permitted, two red trapezoids shall be simultaneously displayed. One shall begin at the top of the PFD and extend downwards to the pitch angle that will result in level flight, while the other shall begin at the bottom of the PFD and extend upwards to the pitch angle that will result in level flight.  There shall be sufficient room left between the two trapezoids to permit the own aircraft reference on the PFD to fit between the two trapezoids. 

## 2.2.6.2.5 Flight Director Guidance 2.2.6.2.5.1 Tcas Guidance Enabling

Flight director guidance may be provided to aid in following RAs.  If a flight director RA mode is made available, the mode change shall be pilot selectable and a suitable mode annunciation shall be provided to both pilots. 

## 2.2.6.2.5.2 Return To Flight Path

Flight director guidance may be used to assist in returning to the flight path and altitude being maintained prior to the display of a corrective RA.  Provisions should be included to inhibit an RA recovery mode if, at the initiation of a corrective RA, the flight director was in the Glide Slope capture mode. 

## 2.2.6.2.6 Heads-Up Display

This implementation shall indicate the vertical flight path to be flown and avoided using a unique display symbology on the HUD. 

## 2.2.6.2.6.1 No-Fly Zone

A trapezoid overlaying the other information on the HUD shall indicate the flight path that must be flown to maintain or attain the TCAS-desired vertical miss distance from one or more intruders.  When the trapezoid is displayed, the other information shown on the HUD shall remain readily discernible and readable.  The trapezoid shall begin at the bottom of the display and extend upward to the desired flight path angle for up sense RAs; for down sense RAs, the trapezoid shall begin at the top of the display and extend downward to the desired flight path angle.  The closed end of the trapezoid shall correspond to the flight path which will provide the vertical speed desired by TCAS. 

The TCAS trapezoid shall be readily discernible and distinguishable from any other information displayed on the HUD. The trapezoid shall remain displayed for the entire duration of the RA.  It shall move as appropriate when an RA is strengthened or weakened by the CAS logic. 

## 2.2.6.2.6.2 Mode Annunciation

When an RA is displayed, the HUD shall display a written annunciation of ―TCAS‖ or 
―TRAFFIC‖.  The exact implementation of the annunciation shall be compatible with the implementation of other mode annunciations on the HUD. 

## 2.2.6.2.6.3 Flight Path Target

A flight path target shall be provided whenever a change in the existing vertical speed is desired.  A box consisting of lines twice the width of the lines comprising the trapezoid shall be displayed at the top (up sense RA) or bottom (down sense RA) of the trapezoid for all RAs except initial preventive RAs. The flight path target shall be readily discernible and distinguishable. The flight path target shall remain displayed for the entire duration of the RA.  It shall move to the appropriate position when an RA is strengthened or weakened by the CAS logic. 

## 2.2.6.2.6.4 Multi-Aircraft Encounters

For the special situation where a multi-aircraft encounter results in an RA where neither a climb nor descent is permitted, two trapezoids shall be simultaneously displayed.  One shall begin at the top of the display and extend downwards to the flight path angle that will result in level flight, while the other shall begin at the bottom of the display and extend upwards to the flight path angle that will result in level flight.  There shall be sufficient room left between the two trapezoids to display the flight path target box.  This distance shall nominally permit the own aircraft reference on the HUD to fit between the two trapezoids. 

## 2.2.6.2.6.5 Display Decluttering

When an RA is displayed, the display may be automatically decluttered by removing certain data and symbols.  Items such as ground speed, mach, wind speed and direction, digital heading, digital selected course, and digital selected heading may be removed if this does not interfere with the pilot's ability to comply with the RA or operate the aircraft in compliance with the appropriate regulations and requirements.  The navigation data, as well as the guidance cue, shall remain displayed at all times. 

## 2.2.6.2.6.6 Ra Guidance Availability

RAs shall be displayed in all display modes. 

## 2.2.6.3 Aural Annunciations 2.2.6.3.1 General 2.2.6.3.1.1 Announcement Methodology

Aural alerts shall be presented by voice announcements only. 

## 2.2.6.3.1.2 Aural Annunciation Generation

An aural annunciation shall be generated when the first RA of an encounter is displayed and each time a subsequent change in the advisory is displayed (strengthened or weakened).  An aural annunciation shall also be provided to indicate that the TCAS aircraft is clear of conflict with all threatening aircraft. 

Note 
The CAS logic determines when any RA will be displayed and will provide the information required to initiate the aural annunciation. 

## 2.2.6.3.1.3 Aural Annunciation Duration

The aural annunciations used shall conform with the content and duration (repetitions) shown in Table 2-15.  An annunciation shall be interrupted before it is completed if the CAS logic determines that a higher priority aural annunciation, e.g., ―Increase Climb, Increase Climb‖, should be announced.  The CAS logic sets a flag to indicate that a higher priority aural annunciation condition has occurred.  

## 2.2.6.3.2 Quality

Aural alerts shall be announced in a high fidelity, distinguishable voice that is audible in all expected flight deck ambient noise conditions. 

Note: Automatic volume adjustment for ambient conditions is highly recommended.  
The volume level of the automatic adjustment shall provide a range of 0 to 4 watts RMS at 1000 Hz into 8 ohms for a speaker output.  The automatic adjustment shall provide a range of 0 to 40 milliwatts at 1000 Hz into a 600 ohm audio distribution system. 

## 2.2.6.3.3 Aural Annunciation Inhibit

Notes: 

1. 
Aural annunciations are automatically inhibited by annunciations issued by reactive and predictive wind shear systems, and ground proximity warning systems (GPWS), which have a higher priority, and below an altitude determined by the CAS logic. 
2. 
When a higher priority warning system (wind shear or GPWS) has an active warning, TCAS is placed into the TA-Only mode of operation. 

## 2.2.6.3.4 Tas

When a TA is initially issued, the aural annunciation ―TRAFFIC-TRAFFIC‖ shall be spoken once.  No aural annunciation shall be issued when an RA against an intruder reverts to a TA at the end of an encounter. The ―TRAFFIC-TRAFFIC‖ annunciation shall be pre-empted by any annunciation associated with an RA. 

## 2.2.6.3.5 Ras

The annunciations shown in Table 2-15 are spoken whenever the indicated RA is issued by TCAS. The annunciations for an RA reversal and for an increase rate RA indicate the previously annunciated RA has reversed or been increased in strength, respectively.  These aural annunciations shall be spoken with a sense of urgency. Table 2-16 provides the mapping between the aural annunciations, the type of RA, CRS Variables, and the contents of ARINC Word Label 270. 

## 2.2.6.4 Visual Alerts 2.2.6.4.1 Tas

Note: An independent amber or yellow visual alert, i.e., a dedicated glare shield or 
instrument panel light, for TAs is optional.

## Notes For Table 2-16:

1. This flag is set for any positive, altitude crossing RA, but is only used to indicate when the aural annunciation "Maintain Vertical Speed, Crossing Maintain" is to be annunciated. This 
flag is set by the CAS logic. 
 
2.  
The relationship between the contents of ARINC Label 270 and the CRS Variables and their expected values are shown below:

3.  These bits correspond to the CRS Variable Own_Goal_Alt_Rate. 4. When the combination of the Up Advisory bits (Climb_RA) and the Down Advisory bits (Descend_RA) indicate Do Not Descend (VSL0) and Do Not Climb (VSL0), respectively (a dual 
VSL 0 RA), the display is required to insert a green arc between ±250 fpm when a VSI or VSI tape display is used.  The green fly-to area shall be displayed even though the RA is 
classified as preventive.  When pitch guidance is used for the display of RAs, the display shall leave sufficient room between the two trapezoids for the own aircraft reference symbol. 
 
5. These two RAs are also considered dual negative RAs.  As such, it is recommended that a green fly-to arc or zone be displayed between ±250 fpm for VSI-type displays and it is 
recommended that a green fly-to target be displayed between the two RA trapezoids when pitch guidance is used.  It is also acceptable to allow a nominal length green arc beginning at 0 fpm in the corrective sense. 6. Any combination of the Up Advisory bits (Climb_RA) and the Down Advisory bits (Descend_RA) can be set for a multi-aircraft encounter which is an initial preventive RA.  This gives a 
total of 16 possible composite RAs that can be displayed in a multi-aircraft encounter which requires only initial preventive RAs. 7. In a multi-aircraft encounter, Crossing_Out may be either True or False depending on the encounter geometry.  If the maintain rate RA requires the TCAS aircraft to cross through the 
intruder aircraft"s altitude, Crossing_Out will be set to True, the RA will be corrective and the aural annunciation will be "Maintain Vertical Speed, Crossing Maintain".  If the TCAS aircraft will not cross through the intruder"s altitude, Crossing_Out will be set to False, the RA will be preventive and the aural annunciation will be "Maintain Vertical Speed, Maintain".  The "Label 270 Contents" for the corrective version of this advisory will be different from those in Table 2-16. 
 

## 2.2.6.4.2 Ras

A red visual alert shall be provided in the primary field of view for each pilot.  The red arcs on an RA/VSI display will fulfill this requirement.  Likewise, conspicuous illumination of the red zones on the vertical speed tape, appropriate pitch guidance, or suitable written message (termed a Visual Alert) on a PFD will fulfill this requirement. 

## 2.2.6.4.3 Message On Pfd

If a written message is shown on the PFD, it shall flash or otherwise be highlighted using the guidance provided by Paragraph 31.f.(4) of reference H.  If a written message is shown on the PFD, it shall be the message shown in Table 2-15.  If necessary, the message may be written on two lines.  Abbreviations may be used if they are unambiguous. If the written message "CLEAR OF CONFLICT" is shown on the PFD, it shall not be shown in red nor amber nor yellow. 

## 2.2.6.4.4 Visual Alert Inhibit

Note: All RA visual alerts shown in Table 2-15 are automatically inhibited below the RA inhibit altitude as determined by the CAS logic. 

## 2.2.6.5 Controls 2.2.6.5.1 Tcas/Mode S Controls

Means shall be provided to select the following modes of operation. 

a. Operation of Mode S transponder only.   
Note: The selection of this mode places TCAS into Standby. 

b. Operation of the Mode S transponder and TCAS in the TA/RA mode. c. Operation of the Mode S transponder and TCAS in the TA-Only mode. 
Note: In this mode, all RAs are inhibited by the CAS logic. 

d. TCAS Self Test. 
It is recommended that the controls for the Mode S transponder and TCAS be located on a single control panel.  The exact implementation of the TCAS controls shall be compatible with the flight deck design philosophy. The position of all control switches shall be readily discernible by inspection. 

## 2.2.6.5.2 Traffic Display Controls

The traffic display controls will depend on the type of display used and the features available on the display.  The following types of controls may be used as appropriate.  If these controls are provided, they shall comply with the requirements shown in the following subparagraphs.  The position of all control switches shall be readily discernible by inspection.  

a. Altitude Range Selector.   If the traffic display provides an option for displaying 
proximate and other traffic with relative altitudes between ±2700 and a maximum of ±9900 feet (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1.10), a switch shall be provided to permit a pilot to control the vertical range of the display.  The control panel markings for this selector shall use the annotations of ―Above‖, ―Normal‖, and ―Below‖, or a suitable abbreviation of these words.  When the ―Above‖ or ―Below‖ mode is selected, it shall be annunciated on the traffic display. 
b. Range Selector.  On variable range displays (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.3), a switch 
shall be provided to permit the desired display range to be selected. 
c. Actual Altitude.  If the traffic display provides an option for displaying the actual 
altitude of an intruder (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.1.5), a switch shall be provided to select between the display of relative and actual altitude in the intruder's altitude data block. 
d. Traffic Override.  On shared displays (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7), a switch shall 
be provided to override the traffic display and the traffic that has popped-up and is no longer required for visual acquisition, e.g., return an EICAS/SYSTEMS display to its normal function. 
e. Display Mode Selector.  On displays which provide both a full-time and a part time 
display mode, a means shall be provided to permit a pilot to select the desired display mode. 

## 2.2.6.5.3 Traffic Display Controls On Shared Weather Radar

When TCAS traffic information is implemented on a shared weather radar display (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7.1), at least one of two display modes are required.  An additional two modes may be implemented. 

## 2.2.6.5.3.1 Wx/Tcas Mode

If this mode is implemented, a means shall be provided to select the WX/TCAS mode of operation (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7.1.1).  The position of the selection mechanism shall be readily discernible by inspection. 

## 2.2.6.5.3.2 Wx-And-Traffic Mode

If this mode is implemented, a means shall be provided to select the WX-and-Traffic mode of operation (see subparagraph 2.2.6.1.2.7.1.1).  The position of the selection mechanism shall be readily discernible by inspection. 

## 2.2.6.5.3.3 Optional Mode Selection

If implemented on the display, a switch shall be provided to select the WX-Only and the TCAS-Only mode of operation.  The position of the switch shall be readily discernible by inspection. 

## 2.2.6.6 Status And Failure Annunciations

Note: Additional information related to status and failure annunciations, as determined 
by the Monitor, is shown in subparagraph 2.2.7.2.4. 

## 2.2.6.6.1 General

Visual annunciations shall be provided to indicate the normal operating and the failure modes of TCAS.  Additional or more specific annunciations may be provided as long as they do not present confusing or distracting information to the flight crew. The color of the annunciations shall conform to reference J information (level 0) or advisory (level 1) annunciation, as appropriate.  The color of the level 1 annunciation shall be amber or yellow.  All TCAS status and failure annunciations should be consistent with any other annunciations provided by the display on which they are shown and shall have only one meaning for all available display modes. 

## 2.2.6.6.2 Traffic Display Annunciations

The TCAS Traffic Display shall be capable of annunciating the following TCAS operating modes and failure conditions: 

a. TCAS in Standby or turned off.  (Level 0 annunciation) b. TCAS operating in the TA-Only mode.  (Level 0 annunciation) c. TCAS has failed.  (Level 1 annunciation) 
d. The Traffic Display is unable to display traffic.  (Level 1 annunciation) e. A pilot initiated Self Test is in progress.  (Level 0 annunciation) 

## 2.2.6.6.3 Ra Display

The RA display shall provide the capability to annunciate the following TCAS operating modes and failure conditions: 

a. TCAS in Standby or turned off.  (Level 0 annunciation) b. TCAS operating in the TA-Only mode.  (Level 0 annunciation) c. The RA display has failed.  (Level 1 annunciation) 
d. TCAS has failed.  (Level 1 annunciation) 
e. A pilot initiated Self Test is in progress.  (Level 0 annunciation) 
Notes:  

1. 
The annunciations shown in 2.2.6.6.2 and 2.2.6.6.3 do not have to be individually annunciated, or displayed on both the traffic and RA display, if that is 
inconsistent with the aircraft"s warning and caution display implementation.  The 
status of the overall TCAS system and each display should be readily discernible to the crew. 
2. 
Augmentation of the TA-Only annunciation shown in 2.2.6.6.2 and 2.2.6.6.3 is permissible when a TA is issued. 

## 2.2.6.7 Display And Control Interfaces 2.2.6.7.1 Display And Control Outputs

The TCAS displays and controls shall provide the information shown in Tables 2-17, 2-18 and 2-19 to the other components and functions of TCAS. 

## 2.2.6.7.2 Display And Control Inputs

To function in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2.2.6, the information and data shown in Tables 2-20, 2-21 and 2-22 shall be provided to the TCAS displays and controls

## 2.2.7 Monitor Requirements

An automatic performance monitoring system, the Monitor, shall be implemented. 

Note: 
The purpose of performance monitoring is to detect malfunctions that degrade or preclude TCAS II protection.  Particular attention should be given to monitoring functions whose failure could result in close vertical proximity (100 ft vertical separation or less) and close horizontal proximity (500 ft. horizontal separation or less) at the point of closest approach when such vertical and horizontal proximity would not have occurred had the aircraft not carried TCAS II.   

## 2.2.7.1 General Requirements 2.2.7.1.1 Failure Response

When a failure is detected, i.e., when the Monitor declares a TCAS II failure, the Monitor shall: 

a. Indicate to the flight crew that an abnormal condition exists. b. Cause any Mode S transmissions that report own aircraft status to show that own 
aircraft has no on-board resolution capability (2.2.3.9.3.1.14 and 2.2.3.9.3.2.3.2). 
c. Prevent interrogations by own aircraft TCAS II. d. Deactivate the normal TCAS II display functions. 
The Monitor shall indicate a TCAS operational status of ―not operational‖ to Surveillance 
(2.2.7.3.1) and to the CAS Logic (2.2.7.3.2).  The Monitor responses shall be accomplished by positive means such that the response functions show an abnormal condition within one second of failure detection. 

## 2.2.7.1.2 Noninterference With Normal Operation

The Monitor shall not interfere with the normal operation of the TCAS II equipment or the Mode S transponder.  Any RF test signals used by the Monitor shall be restricted by the compatibility requirements of Section 2.2.3.11. 

## 2.2.7.1.3 Self-Test

The Monitor shall include a self-test function, capable of being initiated by the pilot.  As a minimum, self-test shall test the (aural) alarm and activate each display element in a pre-determined temporal pattern to allow visual verification that display outputs issued by the digital processor can be correctly interpreted by the pilot.  The self-test function shall not interfere with the normal operation of the equipment. 

Note: Flight-crew-initiated operation of display indications for test purposes is not 
considered interference with normal equipment operation. 

## 2.2.7.2 Monitoring Of Tcas Components 2.2.7.2.1 Computer Monitoring

The Monitor shall include provisions for computer performance monitoring.  As a minimum these tests shall include random access memory (RAM) pattern tests, central processing unit (CPU) instruction tests, program memory tests, CPU input/output functions tests, and CPU timing tests.  The Monitor shall be capable of detecting a failure in the computer performance monitoring and upon detection shall declare a TCAS II failure. A means of computer performance testing is required to enable the TCAS II computer performance to be monitored both under normal bench test conditions and under environmental extremes.  These computer performance tests may be included in the Monitor or may be a separate test program for use during environmental testing. 

## 2.2.7.2.2 Coordination Monitoring

The Monitor shall be capable of recognizing a persistent lock state as defined in subparagraph 2.2.3.10.3.3 and upon recognition shall declare a TCAS II failure.  The Monitor shall also be capable of detecting a queue overflow in the TCAS high priority input queue (subparagraph 2.2.3.13.2).  Detection of queue overflow in the TCAS high priority input queue for three consecutive seconds shall cause the Monitor to declare a TCAS II failure. 

## 2.2.7.2.3 Tcas Ii/Transponder Interface Monitoring

The Monitor shall be capable of detecting loss of data integrity as described in Section 2.2.3.13.2.1.3 and upon detection shall declare a TCAS II failure. 

## 2.2.7.2.4 Display Monitoring

The Monitor shall monitor the status of the installed traffic display(s) and resolution advisory displays using available status discretes (RA status discretes and/or TA status discretes) provided by each display.  When any of the discretes show a display or display function to be ―Not Operational‖, the Monitor shall determine the appropriate TCAS 
system level operating mode (i.e., TA Only, TA/RA, or TCAS Fail) based on the various status discretes available to it.  The Monitor shall not allow RAs to be issued if all of the RA displays have failed.  In addition, if all of the TCAS displays have failed, the Monitor shall fail the TCAS system.  Also, for those display implementations requiring it, the Monitor shall provide information to the display so that an appropriate status or failure annunciation can be shown on the display. The requirements for the failure and status annunciations are contained in Section 2.2.6.6. 

## Notes:

1. 
It is strongly recommended that each traffic display or traffic display function and each RA display or RA display function always provide status discrete 
information to the Monitor, even when the display or display function is capable of detecting and annunciating its own failures, to ensure that TCAS does not issue RAs when no means are available to display RA guidance. 
2. 
The recommended display and Monitor actions associated with possible display failure conditions are shown in Table 2-23.

## 2.2.7.2.5 Altitude Input Monitoring 2.2.7.2.5.1 Barometric Altitude Monitoring

Note: The Collision Avoidance System (CAS) logic determines credibility of the barometric altitude source.  The determined credibility will be either "credible" or "not credible". 

Each TCAS processing cycle, the CAS logic will provide the Monitor with the status of own aircraft's barometric altitude source credibility.  The Monitor shall declare a TCAS failure when this status has been "not credible" for five consecutive TCAS processing cycles.  Unless this status has been "not credible" for five consecutive TCAS processing cycles, the Monitor shall not declare a failure. 

## 2.2.7.2.5.2 Radio Altitude Monitoring - General

The Monitor shall determine the status, "failed" or "not failed", of the radio altitude source. If the status of the radio altitude source is determined to be "failed", as described in the following, the Monitor shall declare a TCAS failure.  Otherwise, the Monitor shall not declare a failure.  Also as described in the following, the Monitor shall determine the credibility of the radio altitude value and shall provide a radio altitude value and credibility to the CAS logic. 

Note: Accurate radio altitude is required for inhibition of descend advisories at low 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
altitudes.  Consequently, undetected erroneous radio altitudes may cause hazardous conditions.  It is recommended that manufacturers rigorously develop and verify the implementation of the Monitor which deals with radio altitude.  It is also recommended that radio altimeters with integral failure monitors, such as those conforming to the requirements of ARINC CHARACTERISTIC 707 (Ref. E), be used with TCAS. In addition, if other aircraft systems, such as an autoland system, independently monitor the status of the radio altimeter, a failure indication from any of these other systems should, if available, cause the Monitor to declare a TCAS failure. 

## 2.2.7.2.5.2.1 Radio Altimeter Input To The Monitor

An input of height above ground from a radio altitude source shall be provided to the Monitor at least once each TCAS processing cycle for processing and transmission to the CAS logic.  In addition, if the radio altimeter has its own failure monitor, e.g., as required by Ref. E., the outputs from such a failure monitor shall be supplied to the Monitor at least once per TCAS processing cycle. 

## 2.2.7.2.5.2.2 Monitor Inputs To The Cas Logic

The data supplied to the CAS logic by the Monitor shall consist of a tracked or coasted radio altitude value, if either is available, and an indication that the radio altitude value is "credible" or "not credible" (subparagraph 2.2.7.2.5.2.4).  In the event that neither a tracked nor coasted radio altitude value is available, the Monitor shall supply the CAS 
logic with an indication that the radio altitude is not credible.  This data shall be supplied to the CAS logic once per TCAS processing cycle.  In no event shall the maximum radio altitude value supplied to the CAS logic by the Monitor exceed 2,720 ft unless the corresponding indication of not credible is simultaneously supplied. 

Note: The reason for requiring altitude values of greater than 2,720 ft being supplied 
with a not credible indication is to ensure the proper operation of the CAS logic as it is presently designed. 

## 2.2.7.2.5.2.3 Monitor Verification Of Radio Altitude Source Prior To Issuance Of Traffic Or Resolution Advisories

In the event of a power off/on system reset, the Monitor shall verify that a radio altitude source has provided data for five consecutive TCAS processing cycles without a failure indication (see also subparagraph 2.2.7.2.5.2.5) prior to allowing TCAS to issue either Traffic or Resolution Advisories.  It is required that such a verification be performed even when TCAS is in the Standby mode of operation.  If such verification cannot be achieved within the ten TCAS processing cycles immediately following a power off/on system reset, the Monitor shall declare a TCAS failure. 

## 2.2.7.2.5.2.4 Radio Altitude Credibility

Subsequent to radio altitude source verification, the Monitor shall assess the credibility of the sequence of radio altitude values being supplied to it.  The radio altitude credibility shall be tested in accordance with the following.  Only in the event that both Test #1 and Test #2 result in "credible" shall the Monitor supply the CAS logic with "credible". Otherwise, the Monitor shall supply the CAS with "not credible". 

## 2.2.7.2.5.2.4.1 Radio Altitude Credibility Determination Test #1

The Test #1 result shall be not credible if either of the following conditions exist for each of the three most recent successive TCAS processing cycles: 

a. Any condition other than "NORMAL" is indicated in the Sign Status Matrix (SSM) 
of an altimeter in conformance with Ref. E., or 
b. the radio altitude value is greater than the reliable operational range of the radio 
altitude source or 2,720 ft, whichever is smaller. 
Note: In order to determine the reliable operational range of the radio altitude source, the characteristics of the altimeter must be known. 

If the above conditions are not met, the Test #1 result shall be credible. When the Test #1 result is not credible, any existing radio altitude track (subparagraph 2.2.7.2.5.2.4.2) shall also be discontinued. Once the Test #1 result is not credible, it shall remain so until the above conditions no longer exist. 

As long as the Test #1 result is credible, Test #2 shall be conducted.  If the Test #1 result is not credible, there is no need to conduct Test #2. 

Note: In normal operation the a. and b. conditions above will routinely occur as the 
TCAS-equipped aircraft climbs after take off and will no longer exist at some 
point as the TCAS-equipped aircraft descends.  Test #1, therefore, should continually be conducted to allow for timely altitude track reinitialization as the aircraft descends. 

## 2.2.7.2.5.2.4.2 Radio Altitude Credibility Determination Test #2

The Monitor shall incorporate tracking algorithms to further test the credibility of the sequence of altitude inputs from the radio altimeter.  These algorithms shall condition the radio altitude inputs from the radio altimeter to preclude the input of extremely erratic or spurious transient altitudes to the CAS logic. 

Note: As a minimum, the tracking algorithms should consider: (1) the TCAS-equipped 
aircraft's estimated vertical rate and acceleration; and (2) the requirements necessary to reliably coast the radio altitude track when transient input values, such as those caused by terrain fluctuations, to the Monitor are not credible. 
When a radio altitude value is received by the Monitor prior to radio altitude tracker initialization, the Test #2 result shall be not credible. When a radio altitude value is received by the Monitor subsequent to radio altitude tracker initialization, the Test #2 result shall be credible if the tracking algorithms so indicate.  Otherwise, the Test #2 result shall be not credible. 

## 2.2.7.2.5.2.4.2.1 Radio Altitude Track Initiation

The radio altitude tracker shall be initialized after: 

a. radio altimeter source verification, or b. the track has been coasted for three consecutive TCAS processing cycles. 
During the period of tracker initialization, the Monitor shall supply the CAS logic with an indication that the radio altitude is not credible. 

## 2.2.7.2.5.2.4.2.2 Operation Subsequent To Radio Altitude Track Initiation

Following successful track initialization, the Monitor shall supply the CAS logic the most recent tracked or coasted radio altitude value for as long as the track exists. Under the following conditions, the Monitor shall supply the CAS logic with the stated data for each condition: 

a. If the received radio altitude value is determined credible, the Monitor shall supply to 
the CAS logic the tracked altitude value. 
b. If the received radio altitude value is not credible, the radio altitude track shall be 
coasted, and the Monitor shall supply to the CAS logic the coasted altitude value and an indication that it is credible. 
c. If the received radio altitude values have been coasted for three consecutive TCAS 
processing cycles, the Monitor shall attempt to reestablish the track. 

## 2.2.7.2.5.2.5 Radio Altitude Source Failure

The Monitor shall declare a TCAS II failure if any of the following conditions are met: 

a. The radio altitude source has been inoperative for three consecutive TCAS 
processing cycles.  During this period, the Monitor shall indicate to the CAS logic that the radio altitude value is not credible. 
b. The Radio Altimeter Monitor (Note 1), e.g., such as for an altimeter conforming to 
Ref. E., indicates a failure for three consecutive TCAS processing cycles. During this period, the TCAS Monitor shall indicate to the CAS logic that the radio altitude value is not credible. 
Notes: 

1. 
This "Radio Altimeter Monitor" referenced is any monitor integral to the radio altimeter, such as the one required by ARINC CHARACTERISTIC 707 (Ref. E), and is not the TCAS Monitor.   
2. 
Because of the criticality of the Radio Altimeter to proper TCAS operation, it is recommended that other failure detection mechanisms be implemented wherever practicable.  These may include cross comparisons of own aircraft's vertical rates or vertical displacements as determined by barometric altitude and radio altitude changes, the use of own aircraft's Mode S transponder's air-ground status to determine if the radio altitude value reported when the aircraft is on the ground is reasonable, and the use of radio altimeter failure indications from other aircraft systems. 

## 2.2.7.2.5.3 Icao 24-Bit Aircraft Address

The Monitor shall declare a TCAS II failure in the event that own ICAO aircraft address is all 0s or all 1s. 

## 2.2.7.2.5.4 Wind Shear And Ground Proximity Warning System (Gpws)

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The Monitor shall recognize wind shear and GPWS warnings.  Upon recognition of either of these warnings, the Monitor shall cause TCAS to operate in TA-Only mode and shall suppress all TCAS aural annunciations.  The Monitor shall keep TCAS in TA-Only mode until 10 seconds after the wind shear or GPWS warning has ceased.  During this 10 second suppression period, the TA aural annunciation shall not be suppressed.

## 2.3 Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in this subsection are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under conditions representative of those which may be encountered in actual operations. Some of the environmental tests contained in this subsection do not have to be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition.  These tests are identified by the phrase "When Required."  If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional environmental conditions, then these "When Required" tests shall be performed. Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are set forth in Ref. D. Some of the performance requirements in Subsections 2.1 and 2.2 are not required to be tested to all of the conditions contained in Ref. D.  Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions, and that the level of performance specified in Subsections 2.1 and 2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these particular environmental conditions. 

## 2.3.1 Temperature And Altitude Tests

Ref. D contains several temperature and altitude test procedures that are specified according to the category to which the equipment is to be certified.  The following subparagraphs contain the applicable test conditions specified in Section 4.0 of Ref. D. 

## 2.3.1.1 Low Temperature Test

per second and with the Mode C signal characteristics specified in subparagraph 2.4.1.1. The specific reply rate and signal level distribution is specified as required in 
each test procedure. The timing of individual fruit replies shall be controlled to 
prevent random interference with other test signals generated by the test equipment. Altitude codes associated with each fruit reply shall be selected randomly from all possible valid codes.

The processed and recorded data should indicate TCAS performance in terms of the expected output for each test procedure. 
n. Means of accepting and recording TCAS track file information specified in 
subparagraph 2.4.1i.

relative time controllable reply signals at RF carrier frequencies of 1065 ±0.1 MHz, 1087 ±0.1 MHz, 1090 ±0.1 MHz, 1090.3 ±0.1 MHz, 1093 ±0.1 MHz and 1115 ±0.1 MHz. 
p. Means of generating reply signals with amplitude level between -12 and -80 dBm as 
measured at the RF reference point. The absolute amplitude accuracy shall be within ±1.0 dB of the level specified in the test procedure for signals between -12 and -68 
dBm. The absolute amplitude accuracy shall be ±0.5 dB of the level specified in the 
test procedure for signals from -68 to -80 dBm. 
q. Means of determining that the interrogation signals conform to the requirements of 
this document. 
r. Means of measuring the interrogation power levels including multiple interrogation 
levels that may be employed. 
s. Means of simulating linear movement of all targets in slant range. Movement is 
specified independently in the slant range dimension and the altitude dimension. In slant range, the trajectory is expressed in relative coordinates, consisting of initial slant range, minimum slant range and relative speed; however, the relative timing may be offset during a test by a fixed amount. The relative speed remains constant for any given target for the duration of the encounter.  The test equipment shall be able to simulate target relative speed from negative 1200 kt (decreasing range) to positive 1200 kt (increasing range).  The meaning of these variables is indicated in Figure 2-16. 
 

Note: Although the actual motion for the target is linear, the slant range as a 
function of time behaves as a quadratic. The formula for slant range at time, 
t, in terms of initial slant range R0, minimum slant range Rmin and relative 
speed VR, is 
$$R(t)=\sqrt{R_{0}^{\bar{2}}-2V_{R}t(R_{0}^{\bar{2}}-R_{\mathrm{min}}^{\bar{2}})^{1/2}+V_{R}^{2}t^{\bar{2}}}$$
 
Range rate is different from relative speed. Range rate is not constant during 
an encounter with non-zero Rmin. 
t. 
Means of simulating piecewise linear movement of all targets in the altitude dimension. Each target will maintain a constant altitude rate within specified intervals, but may change its rate instantaneously at times specified in each test 
procedure. The nominal altitude trajectory for a target will be generated by starting from the initial altitude and applying the initial altitude rate until the first change in altitude rate occurs, then applying that rate until the next change, and so on. The test equipment shall be able to simulate positive or negative altitude rates of 0 to 10,000 feet per minute. To generate a particular altitude report, the nominal altitude of the target at that time will be determined and then rounded to the nearest 100 feet for Mode C-equipped targets and to the nearest 25 feet for Mode S-equipped targets (unless otherwise stated). The altitude reports shall be generated independently of the range reports for a given target. 

u. Means of generating a single Mode C target with nonlinear slant range motion that 
can simulate multipath replies from a target in linear motion. 
v. Means of generating a single Mode C target with nonlinear slant range motion that 
can simulate an intruder initiating a turn into own aircraft from a flight path that is initially parallel to own aircraft flight path. 
w. Means of adjusting the time of reply to each interrogation to simulate target ranges 
between 500 feet and 30 NM. The reported altitude and the simulated range for each target at the time of interrogation shall differ from the nominal range and altitude of the specified trajectory by an amount no greater than the displacement of the target in range or altitude in 0.1 second. 
x. Means of inhibiting the Mode C or Mode S replies and Mode S squitters from a given 
target during time intervals specified in each test procedure. 
y. Means of initiating or terminating Mode C or Mode S targets at times during a single 
test as specified in each test procedure.  
z. Means of simulating a change in the setting of the pilot manual switch to any position 
at times as specified in each test procedure. 
aa. Means of generating altitude codes for individual replies for altitudes from -1200 to 
126,700 ft MSL. 
bb. Means of adjusting individual reply pulse position, width, and rise and fall time 
within the tolerance range specified in 2.4.1.1. 
cc. Means of generating reply signals that simulate the actual antenna output signals that 
would result from each intruder whose bearing relative to TCAS is specified in the test procedure.

times specified in the test procedure.

compatible Mode S 
transponders.

This test is designed to verify that the interrogations in the high resolution whisper-shout sequence and the minimum basic whisper-shout sequence associated with each directional interrogation beam and omni beam have the proper relative interrogation pulse timing and the proper amplitudes relative to the highest level interrogation. 

## Equipment Required

Detector Video Amplifier, DVA (Aertech Model 1204, or equivalent). Power Supply for DVA. Reference Signal Generator (HP612A, or equivalent). Power Meter and Sensor (HP436A and HP8481A, or equivalent). Oscilloscope (Tektronix 7603 Main frame, 7A13 differential amplifier, 7B50A time base, 7D11 Digital Delay, or equivalent).

## Measurement Procedure Step 1– Relative Power Level Of Interrogation/Suppression Sequence

For this test, the TCAS will be in whisper-shout test mode 1 (paragraph 2.1.6) which shall have the following characteristics: 
Sequence Rate : 10 sequences/second Connect equipment as shown in Figure 2-19. Set oscilloscope as follows: 
Sensitivity 
: 0.5 V/div Sweep Rate : 10 ms/div Delay 
: zero Offset 
: -2 Volts The measurement procedure shall identify the directional antenna beam and omni beam associated with each of the interrogations in the top and bottom antenna for the minimum basic sequence. If separate antenna beam outputs are not provided (i.e., beam switching occurs in the antenna subsystem) the interrogation beam association for the minimum basic sequence can be accomplished by simultaneously observing the beam switching control signal. 

Set S1 to top antenna and observe the total whisper-shout sequence with oscilloscope. Adjust variable attenuator to achieve four volts peak (Vp) amplitude for largest pulses of sequence. Adjust digital delay and increase sweep rate to display the largest five pulses of the sequence (two suppression pulses followed by the three interrogation pulses). Finetune variable attenuator for four volts peak amplitude for interrogation pulses. Note peak voltage (Vp) for suppression pulses. Set S2 to the reference signal generator and verify the proper relative power level between the suppression pulses and the following interrogation pulses. Success: The relative timing between interrogations and between interrogation and suppression pulses and the amplitude of each of the interrogation and suppression waveforms in each of the directional and omnidirectional beams relative to the largest interrogation amplitude shall be as specified in 2.2.4.5.4. Repeat Step 1 using whisper-shout test mode 2. Repeat Step 1 with S1 set to bottom antenna. 

## Step 2 - Relative Timing Between Suppression And Interrogation

Use set-up of Step 1 and observe relative timing between suppression and interrogation for each frame of the whisper-shout sequence. Verify proper timing between suppression and interrogation pulses for both the top and bottom antenna ports. 

## 2.4.2.1.1.3.2 Determination Of Whisper-Shout Sequence (2.2.4.5.4.1.3)

This test verifies that TCAS is able to select the proper interrogation sequence for each interrogation beam based on measurements of potential synchronous garble.

TCAS is initialized and operating at T=0 seconds. Each intruder, when present, shall reply once during each scan and, in the case of a whisper-shout sequence, to different whisper-shout interrogations. 

## Scenario For Intruder 1-4

Intruders 1 through 4 are within the forward beam of TCAS. Initially, all four intruders are separated so as not to be within garble range of each other and do not reply with low confidence code bits. At T=120 seconds, Intruders 1 and 2 are within garble range and contain at least one low confidence code bit in their replies. Success:  During the start-up interval from T=0 to T=60 seconds, the forward beam is constrained to the high resolution whisper-shout sequence regardless of the garble situation in that beam. At T=60 seconds, the forward beam is switched on the following scan to the Minimum Basic whisper-shout sequence. At T=120 seconds, the low confidence bits in the Intruder 1 and 2 reply cause the forward beam to switch on the following scan to the high resolution whisper-shout sequence. 

## Scenario For Intruder 5

Intruder 5 is not present from T=0 to T=120 seconds.  At T=120 seconds, Intruder 5 is within the left beam of TCAS and at 5 NM range. Success:  During the start up interval from T=0 to T=60 seconds, the left beam is constrained to the high resolution whisper-shout sequence regardless of the garble situation in that beam. At T=61 seconds, the lack of a Mode C intruder track within the left beam causes TCAS to transmit a single interrogation in that beam. The presence of Intruder 5 at T=120 seconds causes TCAS to switch to the Minimum Basic whisper-shout sequence in the left beam no later than T=124 seconds. 

## Scenario For Intruders 6 & 7

Intruders 6 and 7 are within the right beam of TCAS. At T=0 seconds, Intruders 6 and 7 are within garble range of each other but do not reply with low confidence code bits. At T=120 seconds, Intruders 6 and 7 are no longer within garble range of each other. Success:  During the startup interval from T=0 to T=60 seconds, the right beam is constrained to the high resolution whisper-shout sequence. At T=60 seconds, the right beam continues to transmit the high resolution whisper-shout sequence because Intruders 
6 and 7 are within garble range of each other. At T=127 seconds, the right beam switches to the Minimum Basic whisper-shout sequence because Intruders 6 and 7 are no longer within garble range of each other. 

## Scenario For Intruder 8 & 9

Intruders 8 and 9 are within the rear beam of TCAS. At T=0 seconds, Intruder 8 is at 1 NM range and Intruder 9 is at 3 NM range. At T=120 seconds, Intruders 8 and 9 are no longer present within the TCAS surveillance range. Success: During the startup interval from T=0 to T=60 seconds, the rear beam is constrained to the high resolution sequence. At T=60 seconds, the rear beam continues to transmit the high resolution whisper-shout sequence because the Mode C density is above a threshold value that indicates potential synchronous garble. At T=120 seconds, the lack of a Mode C intruder causes the rear beam to switch to a single interrogation at T=127 seconds following the drop of the Intruder 8 and 9 tracks. The scenario is terminated at T=180 seconds.

## 2.4.2.1.1.7.2 Suppression Pulse Supplied By Other Avionics

Verify that TCAS is able to receive suppression pulses generated by other avionics equipment on board the TCAS aircraft and employs these pulses to prevent unwanted TCAS transmissions in response to transmissions by the suppressing equipment, specifically the Mode S transponder.  Using Test 2.4.2.1.2.1.1, Ability to Operate Over the Frequency Band 1087 to 1093 MHz, verify that TCAS regains normal sensitivity, within three dB, not later than 15 µs after the end of the applied suppression pulse. 

## 2.4.2.1.1.8 Interrogation Repetition Interval (2.2.4.1) And Jitter (2.2.3.4)

Note: This test uses equipment and set-up described in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.1.3, whisper-shout operation, except for the use of a storage oscilloscope. The TCAS Broadcast Interrogation measurement for directional antenna system is covered in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.10.2. 

## Measurement Procedure

Set S1 to top antenna. Program TCAS for normal Mode C interrogations. Set digital delay and sweep rate to observe rate and jitter of interrogation pulse sequence. Rate and peak-to-peak jitter shall be as specified in subparagraphs 2.2.4.1 and 2.2.3.4.  Repeat measurement using normal TCAS broadcast interrogations. 

## 2.4.2.1.2 Receiver Characteristics (2.2.4.4.1)

Many of the TCAS receiver characteristics are specified in probabilistic terms (expected probability of success) that can only be verified through the use of procedures that are repeated a number of times. The following definitions and conventions apply to all of the procedures in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.2 for which an expected result (success) is given in terms of a required probability of success: 

a. Each test scenario shall be executed a sufficient number of times to establish a test 
result with 90 percent confidence: 
1. Test Passed: The equipment under test passes if it performs with at least the 
probability of success specified under the conditions of the given scenario. 
2. Test Not Passed: The equipment under test fails if it does not perform with the 
probability of success specified under the conditions of the given scenario. 
b. The minimum number of times a test must be repeated (minimum number of trials, T) 
in order to establish, at a confidence level of 90 percent, that the test passed is a function of the number of times a test results in a failure. For the situation in which the number of failures is one or greater, the minimum number of trials (T) shall be determined using: 
$T=\frac{F}{(1-P)C}$

Where $T=$ Minimum number of trials

$P=$ Required probability of success 
 
C = Confidence factor from Table 2-41 
 
F = Number of trials that did not result in success. 
 
Table 2-42 lists the minimum number of trials (T) for the various probability of success values (P) specified in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.2 for each value of F equal to or greater than one. The table also includes the minimum number of trials required given that the number of failures is zero (F=0). In test scenarios where success is defined but no expected probability of success is stated, only a single trial is required. The test is passed if success occurs and failed otherwise. 

Note: Tests of this type correspond to non-statistical requirements in Section 2.2. 

## Generalized Scenario Description

The test scenarios used to verify proper operation of the receiver contain a single simulated Mode C or Mode S target and shall be repeated for each TCAS RF port. The following set of inputs is described for use throughout subparagraph 2.4.2.1.2; additional inputs and conditions are specified as required.

A Mode S intruder is co-altitude with TCAS and transmits three squitters at a time when the TCAS receiver should be in squitter listening mode. The probability that TCAS transmits an acquisition interrogation addressed to the ICAO aircraft address contained in the AP field of the squitter depends on receiver sensitivity at the specified frequencies. Success: TCAS transmits no Mode S interrogation. (All scenarios terminated at T=10 seconds). 

Required Probability of Success 
1-(0.9)3 = 0.27 

## 2.4.2.1.3 Reply Link Interference (2.2.4.5.1.2)

The following procedures verify the existence of an appropriate Mode C and Mode S dynamic minimum threshold (DMTL) function, which is one means of rejecting low level multipath signals.  If another method is used to reject low level multipath signals, the test will need to be appropriately revised. 

## Generalized Scenario Description

The test scenarios used to verify proper operation of the Mode C and Mode S pulse processor contain two simulated Mode C or Mode S targets. In addition the scenarios contain RF test pulses to simulate a narrow pulse signal, a non-specular Mode S multipath signal and a TACAN/DME pulse.

The squitters are accompanied by a simulated non-specular multipath signal which begins shortly after the leading edge of the squitter. Success:  TCAS transmits an acquisition interrogation addressed to the ICAO aircraft address contained in the AP field of Intruder 1 within one second following the last squitter. (Scenario terminated at T=10 seconds). Scenario D:  Both Intruders are co-altitude with TCAS and each transmits squitters when TCAS is in squitter listening mode and replies to discrete interrogations from TCAS. Intruder 2 is just beyond the recovery region of the Intruder 1 DMTL window. Success:  TCAS transmits to each intruder two successive interrogations within two seconds following the third squitter. TCAS transmits a tracking interrogation to each intruder within three seconds following the third squitter.  (Scenario terminated at T=10 seconds). Scenario E:  Intruder 1 is co-altitude with TCAS and accompanied by a large-amplitude narrow pulse immediately preceding the squitter. Success:  TCAS transmits an acquisition interrogation to Intruder 1 within one second following the last squitter. (Scenario terminated at T=5 seconds). Scenario F:  Intruder 1 is co-altitude with TCAS and accompanied by a slow rise time pulse immediately preceding the squitter. Success:  TCAS transmits an acquisition interrogation to Intruder 1 within one second following the last squitter. (Scenario terminated at T=10 seconds).

TCAS is initialized and operating at T=0 seconds. The intruder shall transmit a squitter during the squitter listening period following the completion of each of the first three whisper-shout sequences and then remain silent. 

## Scenario Description

The intruder is within the TCAS active surveillance region at T=0 seconds and transmits three squitters at a time when TCAS is in squitter listening mode. Scenarios A-D: The Mode S preamble pulse characteristics are set to the extreme limits of their tolerance range. Success: TCAS transmits an acquisition interrogation addressed to the ICAO aircraft address contained in the AP field of the intruder within one second following the last squitter. (Scenarios terminated at T=10 seconds) Scenarios E-H: The Mode S preamble pulse widths (Scenario E and F) and positions (Scenario G and H) are set to out-of-tolerance values that will cause rejection of the preamble. Success:  TCAS does not transmit an acquisition interrogation. (Scenarios terminated at T=10 seconds). Scenarios I and J:  A single wide pulse is used to simulate a preamble that contains only one clear leading edge but otherwise satisfies the criteria for preamble acceptance.

TCAS is initialized and operating at T=0 seconds. All five Intruders shall transmit a squitter during the squitter listening period following completion of the first whispershout sequence and a Mode S fruit reply during the squitter listening period following completion of the second and third whisper-shout sequences and then remain silent. The Mode S fruit replies for Intruders 1, 2, 4 and 5 shall have a DF=0 for the first fruit reply and a DF=4 for the second fruit reply. Both fruit replies from Intruder 3 shall have a DF=5. 

## Scenario

All five Intruders are within the active surveillance region of TCAS and each transmits one squitter and two fruit replies at a time when TCAS is in the squitter listening mode. Success:  TCAS transmits an acquisition interrogation addressed to the ICAO aircraft address contained in the AP field of Intruder 1 within one second following the last fruit reply. TCAS does not transmit an acquisition interrogation addressed to any other ICAO aircraft address. (Scenario to be terminated at T=10 seconds). 

## 2.4.2.1.5.3 Mode S Extended Squitter Reception (Optional Feature) (2.2.3.10.7, 2.2.3.10.2.1, 2.2.4.6.2.2, 2.2.4.4.2.2C)

This test will verify that a TCAS, if implemented with the option, is:  

a. able to recognize and accept all valid Mode S extended squitters with DF=17 and to 
use these squitters for Mode S squitter processing and Mode S acquisition; 
b. able to recognize, accept, and decode valid Mode S extended squitters with DF=17 
that contain the aircraft identification message in the ME field.

Bits 41-88 
= ICAO Aircraft Identification, which can be 
any airline code and flight number encoded according to Ref. G, Ref. M. 

TCAS is initialized and operating at T=0 seconds. Intruder 1 shall transmit one DF=11 squitter during the squitter listening period following completion of the first whispershout sequence and two DF=17 squitters spaced 0.5 seconds apart during each of the squitter listening periods following the second and third whisper-shout sequences and then remain silent.  Intruder 2 shall transmit DF=11 squitters during the squitter listening period following completion of each whisper-shout sequence. Intruder 2 shall also transmit DF=17 squitters containing aircraft identity at a nominal rate of once every five seconds beginning at T=0 seconds such that the DF=17 identity squitter occurs during a squitter listening period. 

## Scenario

Intruder 1 is within the active surveillance region of TCAS and transmits one DF=11 squitter followed by four DF=17 squitters when TCAS is in the squitter listening mode. Intruder 2 is within the altitude protection volume of TCAS and transmits DF=11 squitters each second and DF=17 identity squitters once every five seconds when TCAS is in the squitter listening mode. Success: TCAS transmits an acquisition interrogation to Intruder 1 within one second following the second extended squitter.  TCAS transmits an acquisition interrogation to Intruder 2 within one second following the third DF=11 squitter and correctly decodes the DF=17 identity squitter containing the Intruder 2 ICAO Aircraft Identification.

Error Simulation 
The data field content of the short special surveillance reply (DF=0) shall be modified following generation of the parity bit sequence and prior to PPM modulation in the following manner: Data bit number 32 shall contain energy throughout both halves (chips) of its bit position. The amplitude of the signal in the half that would ordinarily contain energy shall be three dB below the amplitude of the signal in the other half of the bit position. 

TCAS initialized and operating at T=0 seconds. The intruder shall transmit a squitter during the squitter listening period following completion of each whisper-shout sequence and shall reply with the modified short special surveillance reply (DF=0) to each TCAS discrete interrogation. 

## Scenario Description

The intruder is within the active surveillance region of TCAS, transmits squitters when TCAS is in squitter listening mode, and replies to discrete interrogations from TCAS. Success:  TCAS transmits an acquisition interrogation addressed to the intruder within one second following the third squitter. 

## 2.4.2.1.6 Mode C Target Surveillance Performance (2.2.4.6.2)

The following test procedures apply to the Mode C surveillance function of the TCAS unit and verify proper surveillance of Mode C-equipped aircraft. The test procedures shall verify that TCAS is capable of the timely acquisition and surveillance of such targets in the specified environments. 

## Generalized Scenario Description

The test scenarios used to verify Mode C surveillance contain simulated Mode C targets. For each target, the barometric altitude, altitude rate, range (relative to TCAS), speed (relative to TCAS) and the reply power of each target is specified. In addition, multipath delay, multipath reply power and whisper-shout level are specified, when applicable. The target scenarios are not probabilistic; that is, reply probabilities less than one are not explicitly permitted. Instead, the effect of an intermittent target is expressed, when appropriate, by a predetermined sequence of replies and missed scans. Also, fruit replies, when included in the simulation, are generated in a deterministic fashion. 

## 2.4.2.1.6.1 Mode C Surveillance Initiation (2.2.4.6.2.1.2, 2.2.4.5, 2.2.4.6)

This test procedure verifies that the Mode C surveillance acquisition range is adequate and that parameters of the acquisition logic are correct. 

## Test Scenarios

Scenarios A, B and C each consist of an Intruder 1 aircraft on a horizontal collision course. The threat aircraft flight is level. The inputs are chosen so that the intruder will enter the threat volume six seconds after scenario initiation.  In scenario A, the target replies on each surveillance update interval and an advisory should be displayed following penetration into the threat volume. In scenario B, the target replies for only two consecutive surveillance update intervals and then intermittently (every other surveillance update interval). Since the track acquisition logic requires three consecutive replies and cannot acquire on intermittent replies, no advisory should be observed. 

Note: A threat at 13 NM traveling a collision course at maximum allowed relative 
speed (1200 kt) will be at the point of closest approach with the TCAS aircraft after an elapsed time of 39 seconds if no collision avoidance measures are taken. If the TCAS unit is designed to give 30 seconds warning, nine seconds should elapse before an advisory is displayed.  It should be noted that TCAS establishes a tentative track after three consecutive correlating replies.  The track becomes firm when a fourth correlating reply is received and is reported to the CAS algorithm, which requires up to 1.5 seconds additional time to issue an advisory on a threatening target. 
In Scenario C, beginning with the fourth reply, the target reports an altitude that is 300 ft different from the altitude reported in the first three replies. Since the fourth reply altitude is beyond the correlation window a track should not be established and no advisory should be observed.

## 2.4.2.1.6.2 Mode C Surveillance Extension (2.2.4.6.2.1.3, 2.2.4.6.2.1.4) 2.4.2.1.6.2.1 Elimination Of Multipath False Tracks

This test procedure shall verify that TCAS eliminates false tracks created by ground-bounce multipath. Multipath from reflective surfaces can create false tracks at two ranges (Figure 2-24). This is due to: 

a. Multipath only on the interrogation link or only on the reply link. b. Multipath on both the interrogation link and on the reply link. 
In this test procedure, the false tracks due to non-sea level multipath from an Intruder A aircraft will be simulated using an additional Intruder B. Unlike true multipath, the replies from Intruder A and B will have different altitude codes. This allows Intruder A to be outside the TCAS threat zone, while its simulated multipath false track, Intruder B, resides within the threat zone, as shown in Figure 2-25 and Figure 2-26. If the TCAS is eliminating false tracks, an advisory should not be generated by Intruder B. The scenario will be run twice to simulate the two cases of multipath mentioned above. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`

## Scenario

The scenario consists of a TCAS-equipped aircraft and two Mode C intruders, Intruders A and B. Intruder B is at an altitude inside the TCAS threat boundary while Intruder A is not. The range and velocity of Intruder B is identical to that of a multipath generated false track from Intruder A.  If TCAS is eliminating false targets an advisory will not be generated by Intruder B. Intruders A and B are made to respond to two different whisper-shout levels to eliminate effects of garbling.

## 2.4.2.1.6.2.2 Range Correlation

The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that the surveillance processor correctly fails to update a track with replies that lie outside the proper range correlation box. The size of the correlation box is a function of several track parameters and may take on numerous values. Rather than testing exhaustively over all possible cases, this test uses two scenarios to verify the performance in the two altitude regimes (above and below 10,000 ft). 

## Test Scenarios

Scenarios A and B are qualitatively similar. In each, a single threat aircraft on a horizontal collision course (Intruder 1) is used, beginning at time T=0. Beginning at T=T1 after the track on Intruder 1 is firmly established, but before the threat volume is entered
 , a range error is introduced so as to cause correlation failure with respect to the established track. This is accomplished by terminating Intruder 1 and introducing Intruder 2 which is identical to 1 except for a range offset equivalent to the intended error value. During the period in which Intruder 2 is present, updates are made only every other surveillance update interval. (This prevents a new track from being established after the original one has been dropped). The period of simulated range error continues until after the threat volume has been entered. Therefore, an advisory will be displayed if the processor has incorrectly correlated through the onset of the range bias. Figure 2-27 and Figure 2-28 illustrate the intended reply sequence for Scenarios A and B respectively. 

Note: T1 is actually chosen so that the last correlating reply occurs more than six seconds before the track would be predicted to penetrate the threat boundary, i.e., surveillance will have deleted the track according to 2.2.4.6.2.1.3. For altitudes above 10,000 feet (Scenario A), the threat boundary is determined by the requirement for 30 seconds warning as in previous tests. For altitudes below 10,000 feet (Scenario B), the corresponding requirement is 25 seconds warning before a 0.3 NM miss.

## 2.4.2.1.6.2.3 Altitude Correlation

This test verifies that the surveillance processor correctly fails to update a track with replies which are outside their proper altitude correlation box of ±200 feet. 

## Test Scenario

At T=0 seconds a threat aircraft (Intruder 1) flies a horizontal approach course with an altitude which differs by 300 feet from the TCAS altitude. Beginning at T=T1, after the track is well established but before the threat volume is entered, an altitude error of 300 feet is introduced so as to cause correlation failure. This is accomplished by terminating Intruder 1 and introducing Intruder 2 which is identical to 1 except for an altitude offset equivalent of the intended error value. If correlation succeeds, the extended track will be within the vertical threat limits and an advisory will be displayed when the horizontal threat boundary is penetrated. During the period in which Intruder 2 is present, updates are made only every other scan, to prevent a new track from being established. The intended reply sequence is illustrated in Figure 2-29.

TCAS is initialized and operating at T=0 seconds. The intruder shall reply once during each whisper-shout sequence. 

## Scenario

For each scenario a single Mode C intruder is within the threat zone of TCAS at T=0 seconds. 

Success (Scenarios A-I): Upon receipt of the reply to the 4th Mode C whisper-shout sequence, an intruder track file is established with tracked altitude equal to the value stated in the Inputs section above. 

## 2.4.2.1.6.3 Missing Mode C Replies (2.2.4.6.2.1.3)

This test procedure will verify that the Mode C surveillance processor correctly coasts a track when replies are missing for several consecutive surveillance update intervals and drops a coasted track when the maximum coast length is exceeded. The requirement for generating advisories on tracks which are predicted to enter the threat volume within six seconds after the last correlating reply is also verified. 

## Test Scenarios

Two scenarios are used, each with a single threat aircraft on a horizontal collision course. In Scenario A, parameters are chosen such that the intruder penetrates the threat volume several seconds before the reply data stream is terminated. An advisory should be displayed beginning at T=9 seconds and should persist for five seconds of track coast but not longer. In Scenario B, the reply data stream ends two seconds before threat volume is entered. An advisory is displayed when the threat boundary is penetrated but persists for no more than four seconds (for a total coast duration of five seconds).

## 2.4.2.1.6.4 Surveillance Target Capacity (Mode C) (2.2.4.6.1)

This test verifies that the Mode C surveillance processor has sufficient storage and processing capacity to provide surveillance on 30 Mode C aircraft when operating in a Mode C fruit environment of 30,000 fruit replies/second.  The 30 Mode C aircraft are distributed such that 22 altitude reporting and two non-altitude reporting aircraft are within a range of five NM and an additional six altitude reporting aircraft are beyond five NM.  This test also verifies that a single track is established on a target that generates more than one reply within a surveillance update interval. Success of the test is determined by inspection of the number of tracks at various times during the test.

## Reply Power Level Distribution

Individual fruit replies shall be generated at the rates and power levels indicated below and interspersed to create an average fruit rate of 30,000/ second. 

| Rate     | Level    |
|----------|----------|
| 15,000/s | -71 dBm  |
| 7,500/s  | -68 dBm  |
| 7,500/s  | -65 dBm  |

The timing of fruit replies exceeding -71 dBm shall be adjusted to prevent overlap or garble of any other signals generated by the test unit. 

TCAS initialized and operating at T=0 seconds. Each intruder shall reply only to its assigned step number(s) except that Intruders 25-30 can reply to any step number. 

## Scenario

The scenario consists of 30 Mode C aircraft at various closing rates and relative altitudes. The first 24 targets have motion relative to TCAS and are generated by repeating Intruders 1 through 2 at 10-second intervals between T=0 seconds and T=110 seconds. Each of the first 24 intruders shall respond to a different step number in the Mode C whisper-shout sequence to prevent garbling replies. Figure 2-30 illustrates the range-time relationship of the first and last of the 12 groups of the first 24 intruders. The first group (Intruders 1-2) and Intruders 25-30 are introduced at T=0 seconds and continue for the duration of the scenario. The last group (Intruders 23-24) is introduced at T=110 seconds and continues for the duration of the scenario. The remaining 10 intermediate groups are introduced at T=10 seconds, 20 seconds and 100 seconds respectively and continue for the duration of the scenario. Between T=120 seconds and 240 seconds, the scenario contains 24 Mode C targets within five NM of TCAS and an additional 6 Mode C targets between 6 and 16 NM of TCAS. In addition a Mode C environment of 0.3 aircraft/NM
2 
within 30 NM of TCAS is simulated by the generation of Mode C fruit at a rate of 30,000 fruit replies/second. Since the presence of fruit is intended only to verify the processing capacity of TCAS, the individual fruit reply times and altitude codes are selected to prevent interference and generation of false tracks. Surveillance track file data (subparagraph 2.4.1i) shall be recorded to provide information on all tracks at T=2 minutes, three minutes and four minutes. Success:  The track file information indicates the correct number of tracks. Scenario terminated at T = five minutes. 

 

## 2.4.2.1.6.5 Surveillance Overload (2.2.4.6.1.1)

The purpose of this test is to verify that, when the track capacity of subparagraph 2.2.4.6.1 is exceeded, the Mode C surveillance processor correctly drops tracks according to the criteria of subparagraph 2.2.4.6.1.1. That is, targets shall be deleted in decreasing range order. 

## Inputs

As described in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.6.4 and supplemented as follows: 

Intruder Aircraft 31 


Range 
= 
6 NM at T=0 seconds 
 
Relative Speed 
= 
-120 kt (-0.033 NM/s) 
 
Whisper-Shout Step Number 
= 
48 and 49 
 
Intruder Aircraft 32-34 

Intruders 32-34 have ranges and relative speeds identical to Intruders 1, 2 and 31 respectively. The applicable whisper-shout step number for reply response and the time of introduction into the scenario are identical to Intruders 13, 14, and 15 respectively. 

All intruders shall be separated by at least 300 feet from each other in altitude and shall be within the surveillance altitude volume of ±10,000 feet relative to own aircraft. 

As described in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.6.4. 

## Scenario:

As described in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.6.4 except that four additional intruders are present. Success:  The track file information indicates that the four intruders furthest in range have been deleted from the track file. 

## 2.4.2.1.7 Mode S Target Surveillance Performance (2.2.4.6.2.2, 2.2.4.4.2.2)

The following tests are designed to verify the proper operation of the TCAS Mode S surveillance processor. 

## Generalized Scenario Description

The test scenarios used to verify proper operation of the Mode S surveillance processor contain simulated Mode S and Mode C targets. Many of the position and rate values associated with the TCAS unit under test and the Mode S message field contents associated with the simulated targets can be represented by a single standard input description. The following set of inputs is applicable for each of the tests in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.7. Additional inputs and conditions relating to each test are specified as required.

## 2.4.2.1.7.1 Mode S Surveillance Initiation (2.2.4.6.2.2.1)

This test will verify that TCAS is designed to: 

a. Make use of the parity coding in squitter transmissions to detect and correct errors in 
the received message. 
b. Employ a squitter processing technique to minimize the number of interrogations 
necessary for target acquisition. 
c. Initiate acquisition of targets that are within an altitude of ±10,000 ft relative to 
TCAS. 
d. Ensure timely acquisition of targets that transition the ±10,000 ft relative altitude 
boundary. 
e. Prevent acquisition interrogations to targets with a DO-181A or later Mode S 
transponder whose squitter CA field indicates on the ground. 
f. Reject squitters that contain an all 0s or all 1s ICAO aircraft address or an address 
identical to that of own aircraft transponder.

For each scenario, TCAS initialized and operating at T=0 seconds.  Beginning at T=0 seconds, Intruders 1 through 19 shall transmit a TCAS Broadcast Interrogation once every 10 seconds, a squitter during the squitter listening period following the completion of each whisper-shout sequence, and shall reply with a short special surveillance format (DF=0) to each discrete TCAS interrogation addressed to it. Intruders 20 through 38 are present between T=100 seconds and T=200 seconds and are required to transmit only squitters and TCAS Broadcast Interrogations as above.  Intruders 39 through 46 are 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
present during the entire time and are required to respond each scan to a whisper-shout step. 

## Scenario Description

The following scenario description is applicable to Scenario A, B and C, except that Intruder 19 is not present during Scenario C.  For convenience in running the test all intruder aircraft except Intruder 19 are specified to be stationary with respect to the TCAS equipment. Intruders 1-19 are present throughout the entire scenario and will result in a certain amount of TCAS interrogation power-rate limiting. For Scenario B Intruder 19 will be within 6 NM at T=71 causing α to drop below 1.  Intruders 20-38 are generated during the interval between T=100 seconds and T=200 seconds. The introduction of Intruders 20-38 should result in an increased count of the number of TCAS aircraft. This in turn should result in a further reduction in the TCAS interrogation power-rate parameters.  Intruders 39 through 46 are positioned to cause TCAS to select the highest level whisper-shout sequence in each beam and therefore to transmit the maximum number of Mode C interrogations each scan. Intruder 19 is moving relative to TCAS and will penetrate the threat boundary at T=162 seconds when all 38 intruders are present. Since Intruder 19 is TCAS equipped, it will cause the TCAS under test to generate air-to-air coordination interrogations between T=163 and T=196 seconds. These interrogations are not subject to interference limiting constraints and are generated at full power. The removal of Intruders 20-38 should result in the recovery of the interrogation limits to their original values. At T=60, 160 and 260 seconds the value of the left-hand side of inequality 3 of subparagraph 2.2.3.6.1 shall be computed by measuring the transmitted power level of each Mode C interrogation in a whisper-shout sequence. The effects of the 8-second freeze are apparent as the inequalities fail when 18 new Intruders are introduced and TCAS has not yet reduced the power enough to account for the unexpected change.  The interference limiting parameters should be nearly stable by the end of each 100 second interval.  The effects of the 5 second update and the 6 second retry on acquisitions to Intruders 20-38 may cause inequality 3 to be exceeded when they line up during the 8-second freeze. Success for Scenario A&B: 

T=60 and 260 sec, $\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left[\frac{PA(k)}{250\text{watts}}\right]\leq3$

T=162 seconds, $\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left[\frac{PA(k)}{250\text{watts}}\right]\leq2.05$

The air-to-air coordination interrogations to Intruder 19 between T=163 and T=196 
seconds shall be transmitted at full power.  Scenario is terminated at T=300 seconds. 

## Success For Scenario C

Because of its altitude, TCAS is not subject to interference limiting inequalities 1, 2, and 3, but is still subject to inequalities 4 and 5. Scenario is terminated at T=300 seconds. 

$\mathrm{T}=92,192,$and $292\,\mathrm{sec},\ \sum_{i=1}^{I}\left[\frac{P(i)}{250\,\mathrm{watts}}\right]\leq$[111]

## 2.4.2.1.7.4.2 Interrogation Control Of Tcas On The Ground (2.2.3.6.3)

This test verifies that the NTA value is automatically set to three times the measured value whenever the TCAS aircraft indicates on the ground and that TCAS quickly recovers its nominal airborne mode surveillance range when transitioning from an onground status to airborne status. 

## Inputs

25 TCAS aircraft are present within 10 to 30 NM of own TCAS.   
Air/ground status = airborne at T=0 seconds and 100 seconds  
 
= on-the-ground at T=20 seconds. 

TCAS initialized and operating at T=0 seconds.  Beginning at T=0 seconds TCAS indicates airborne.  Beginning at T=20 seconds TCAS indicates on the ground. Beginning at T=100 seconds TCAS indicates airborne. 

## Scenario Description

The scenario shall be run with the test unit connected simultaneously to the top and bottom antenna ports of the TCAS equipment.  Between T=0 seconds and T=20 seconds when TCAS is airborne and 25 other TCAS intruders are present, interference limiting is not invoked and TCAS is transmitting full power. At T=19 seconds, TCAS transmit power is as follows: 
Success: 

$$\begin{array}{r l}{\sum_{i=1}^{I}\left[-{\frac{P(i)}{250\ {\mathrm{watts}}}}\right]^{\alpha}\ \ \leq\ 280/26}\\ {\ }\\ {\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left[{\frac{P A(k)}{250\ {\mathrm{watts}}}}\right]\ \ \leq\ 80/26}\\ {\ }\end{array}$$
At T=20 seconds, TCAS is on the ground, the NTA count is set to 75. At T=80 seconds, TCAS transmit power is reduced as follows: Success: 

$$\begin{array}{r l}{I}\\ {\sum_{i=1}^{I}\left[\begin{array}{l}{P(i)}\\ {250{\mathrm{~watts}}}\end{array}\right]^{\alpha}\ \ \leq\ 280/76}\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{r l}{K}\\ {\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left[\begin{array}{l}{P A(k)}\\ {250{\mathrm{~watts}}}\end{array}\right]}&{{}\leq\ 80/76}\end{array}$$
At T=100 seconds, TCAS is again airborne and is transmitting full power by T=103 seconds. Success: 

$$\begin{array}{r l}{\sum_{i=1}^{I}\left[{\frac{P(i)}{250\ {\mathrm{watts}}}}\right]^{\alpha}\ \ }&{{}\leq\ 280/26}\\ {\ }&{{}}\\ {\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left[{\frac{P A(k)}{250\ {\mathrm{watts}}}}\right]\ \ }&{{}\leq\ 80/26}\\ {k=1}\end{array}$$
Scenario terminated at T=120 seconds. 

## 2.4.2.1.7.4.3 Correct Content Of Transmitted Tcas Broadcast Interrogation Messages (2.2.3.9.3.2.4.2 And 2.2.3.10.2.4)

This test verifies that the TCAS unit under test transmits correctly coded TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages for the entire period that the TCAS unit is powered on. Conditions: TCAS initialized and operating. 

Expected Output: 

Msgs: 
UF=16, with UDS1 (bits 33-36) = 3, UDS2 (bits 37-40) = 2, MID (bits 
65-88) = own 24-bit ICAO aircraft address, AP address*=FFFFFF16   
 
*  i.e., address before parity overlay added and after parity overlay 
removed 
The UF=16 messages are transmitted such that, for any other TCAS II aircraft within 30 NM. and at any azimuth, the nominal rate of own TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages arriving at that TCAS II is 1 per 8 to 10 seconds. 

Note: Use of directional antenna for TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages is tested 
in section 2.4.2.1.10.2.  

## 2.4.2.1.7.5 Surveillance Target Capacity And Overload (Mode S) (2.2.4.6.1; 2.2.4.6.1.1)

This test verifies that the Mode S surveillance processor has sufficient storage and processing capacity to process a maximum of 150 squitter signals from Mode S targets within 30 NM of TCAS while providing surveillance on 30 Mode S targets (24 within five NM of TCAS and six beyond five NM) when operating in a traffic density of 0.3 
aircraft/NM2 and a Mode C fruit environment of 30,000 replies/second.  
This test also verifies that the Mode S surveillance processor retains tracks according to the criteria of subparagraph 2.2.4.6.1.1 when the track capacity of subparagraph 2.2.4.6.1 is exceeded. That is, targets shall be deleted in decreasing range order. This test also verifies that a TCAS, operating in a Mode S capacity environment, does not degrade the reply probability of a collocated Mode S transponder more than one percent, and that collocated Mode S transponder transmissions do not interfere with TCAS data processing.

## Fruit Reply Power Level Distribution

Individual fruit replies shall be generated at the rates and power levels indicated below and interspersed to create an average fruit rate of 30,000/second. 

| Rate     | Level    |
|----------|----------|
| 15,000/s | -71 dBm  |
| 7,500/s  | -68 dBm  |
| 7,500/s  | -65 dBm  |

The timing of individual fruit replies shall be such as to prevent overlap or garble of any other signal generated by the test unit. 

TCAS is initialized and operating at T=0 seconds. Each intruder shall transmit a squitter during the squitter listening period following the completion of each whisper-shout sequence with the specified address and shall reply as specified with a short special surveillance format (DF=0) to each discrete TCAS interrogation addressed to it. In addition, the test unit shall cause the collocated TCAS Mode S transponder to be interrogated with a Mode C-Only All-Call interrogation at the level and rate specified above. All squitters, replies and interrogations are input to both TCAS antenna ports simultaneously. 

## Scenario

Intruder aircraft 1 through 24, which are designed to be within the five NM surveillance range of TCAS during the scenario, represent a peak target load equivalent to a density of 
0.3 aircraft/NM2.  All of these intruders are within the TCAS altitude protection volume and will be subject to tracking surveillance. Intruder aircraft 25 through 150 represent the minimum squitter capacity required of TCAS. These additional targets are stationary with respect to TCAS and are distributed uniformly in area between a six and 30 NM range. All of the targets are within the TCAS altitude protection volume and will cause TCAS to generate acquisition interrogations. The squitter and reply probability associated with each of the intruders from 25 through 150 are selected to approximate a reasonable link reliability for the range of the intruder. The TCAS surveillance processor shall provide complete surveillance track file information (subparagraph 2.4.1i) on all targets whether maintained in a squitter,  
acquisition, 1-second tracking, or 5-second tracking state at T=2 minutes, T=3 minutes and T=4 minutes. Success: The track file information indicates the correct number of tracks and the collocated Mode S transponder reply probability between T=2.5 and T=3.5 minutes is equal to or greater than 0.99.  Also, the track file information indicates that the Mode S overload function retains the 30 Mode S intruders closest in range. 

## 2.4.2.1.7.6 Mode S Power Programming (2.2.4.6.2.2.4)

This test verifies that TCAS equipment adjusts the transmit power level of Mode S tracking interrogations to targets within 10 NM of TCAS according to the criteria specified in subparagraph 2.2.4.6.2.2.4. 

## Inputs And Conditions

As described in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.7.4.1, Scenario A, except that Intruder aircraft 1 through 18 are Mode S-equipped and aircraft 20 through 46 are not present. 

## Scenario Description

As described in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.7.4.1 except that Intruder aircraft 1 through 18 are not TCAS-equipped, Intruder aircraft 20 through 46 are not present, interference limiting is not activated and the scenario is terminated at T=200 seconds. Between T=160 and T=190 seconds the transmitted power level from the TCAS to each of Intruders 1 through 19 shall be measured. Success:  The transmitted power level of each of the tracking interrogations to Intruder aircraft 1 through 18 shall be in accordance with the power programming criteria specified in subparagraph 2.2.4.6.2.2.4. The coordination interrogations to Intruder 19 shall be transmitted at full power.  Scenario terminated at T=200 seconds. 

## 2.4.2.1.8 Combined Mode S And Mode C Surveillance 2.4.2.1.8.1 Surveillance Target Capacity (2.2.4.6.1)

This test verifies that TCAS equipment has sufficient storage and processing capacity to process all signals received from targets within 30 NM of TCAS and to provide surveillance on an equal mix of Mode S and Mode C targets within five NM of TCAS 
when operating in a traffic density of 0.3 aircraft per NM2. 

This test also verifies that a TCAS, operating in a Mode S and Mode C capacity environment, does not degrade the reply probability of a collocated Mode S transponder more than one percent, and that collocated Mode S transponder transmissions do not interfere with TCAS data processing.

## Mode S Transponder Interrogation Signal

 
As specified in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.7.5 
Mode C Fruit Replies 
As specified in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.7.5 
TCAS is initialized and operating a T=0 seconds. Each Mode S intruder shall transmit a squitter during the squitter listening period following the completion of each whisper shout sequence with the specified address and shall reply, as specified, with a short special surveillance format (DF=0) to each discrete TCAS interrogation addressed to it. Each Mode C intruder shall reply only to its assigned whisper-shout step number(s). In addition, the test unit shall cause the Mode S transponder to be interrogated with a Mode C interrogation at the level and rate specified. All squitters, replies and interrogations are input to both TCAS antenna ports simultaneously. 

## Scenario

Intruders 1 through 24 simulate an equal mixture of Mode C and Mode S targets within the five NM surveillance range of TCAS. The quantity of targets represents a peak condition for a traffic density of 0.3 aircraft/NM
2. All of these targets are within the altitude protection volume and will be subject to tracking surveillance. The remaining intruders are uniformly distributed in area between five NM and 30 NM 
range and represent the Mode S half of the targets in a density of 0.3 aircraft/NM2. All of these targets are within the TCAS altitude protection volume and will cause TCAS to generate acquisition interrogations. The squitter and reply probability specified for these intruders approximates realistic values. The existence of Mode C targets within a five NM to 30 NM range is simulated by generation of Mode C fruit. The TCAS surveillance processor shall provide complete surveillance track file information (subparagraph 2.4.1i) on all targets whether maintained in a squitter, acquisition, 1-second tracking, or 5-second tracking state at each of the following scenario times: T=2 minutes, 3 minutes and 4 minutes. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Success: The track file information indicates the current number of tracks and, the collocated Mode S transponder reply probability, measured between T=2.5 minutes and T=3.5 minutes, is equal to or greater than 0.99. 

## 2.4.2.1.8.2 Altitude And Range Tracking Of Mode C And Mode S Targets For Threat Detection (2.2.4.6) 2.4.2.1.8.2.1 Range Tracking Accuracy

This test verifies that the range tracker is able to successfully track through transients in airspeed caused by sudden aircraft maneuvers. In the scenario, a non-closing aircraft abruptly undergoes a change in rate that makes it threatening. Proper performance of the tracker will result in a prompt resolution advisory. 

Note: The scenario simulates an actual situation in which the TCAS aircraft and the intruder aircraft are initially flying a co-altitude and parallel course at 600 kt each. Both aircraft then make converging 90 degree turns at a turn rate of 3.6 degrees/second. 

## Test Scenario

In the scenario a single intruder aircraft flies a co-altitude course. The intruder is initially flying at constant range. It then is given a closing rate such that the threat volume is soon penetrated. If the tracker does not lag excessively, an advisory will be generated by the proper time. A late advisory constitutes failure.

## 2.4.2.1.8.2.2 Altitude Tracking Accuracy

This test verifies that the altitude tracker successfully tracks through transients in altitude rate. The scenarios use the abrupt termination and initiation, respectively, of a closing altitude rate in an otherwise constant-altitude track (similar to the range-rate tests of subparagraph 2.4.2.1.6.2.2.). 

## Test Scenarios

Two scenarios are used, each with a single intruder aircraft which is closing in range at a constant rate.  In Scenario A, the intruder is initially below the TCAS aircraft and climbing at a high rate; this rate abruptly goes to zero.  In Scenario B, the intruder is initially above the TCAS aircraft with an altitude rate of 0; this rate abruptly goes to -4000 FPM.

## 2.4.2.1.9 Bearing Estimation 2.4.2.1.9.1 Bearing Accuracy With Standard Ground Plane (2.2.4.6.4.2)

The following procedures verify the target bearing accuracy of the bearing antenna and associated processing equipment on an antenna range. 

## Equipment Required

Antenna pattern range. Ground plane four feet in diameter or larger. Reference quarter wave stub. Test equipment per subparagraph 2.4.1.2. Means to read the smoothed bearing estimation for the test targets.  

## Set-Up/Calibration For Bearing Accuracy Tests

Install a vertically polarized quarter wave stub antenna in the center of the ground plane. Attach the ground plane to the antenna range turntable. Set the power of the 1090 MHz test source so that the received signal strength as measured at the stub antenna connector is at the desired power level specified in the test for an elevation of zero degrees. Replace the stub with the TCAS II antenna and connect it to the TCAS II receiver with cables that simulate the actual aircraft installation. The RF port to the unused bottom antenna shall be terminated in a matched load. Transmit simulated Mode C or Mode S replies from the test source as required by each of the following tests. 

## Accuracy, -10 Degrees To +20 Degrees Elevation

This test will verify the bearing accuracy over all azimuths, and over two elevation zones (-10 to +10 degrees and +10 to +20 degrees) using replies that vary in frequency. 

## Inputs

TCAS and the test equipment are initiated in a mode that provides one reply per whisper-shout sequence and smoothed bearing estimate for all targets. 

## Scenarios

For each combination of the following conditions, record the error between the smoothed bearing estimate and the true bearing at zero degrees + m*15 degrees, m=0, 1, …, 23, azimuth values using 20 whisper-shout sequences at each bearing. The 20 whisper shout sequences chosen shall be such that the bearing filter output has had time to attain a steady state value.

| Elevation Angle                        | = -10, 0, +10, and +20 degrees |

Compute the overall RMS error using the 24 * 20 * 2 = 960 individual errors at each elevation angle. 

Success (-10, 0 and +10 degrees elevation) 
RMS error ≤ 9 degrees 

 
Peak error ≤ 27 degrees 
 
 
Success (+20 degrees elevation) 
RMS error ≤ 15 degrees 
 
Peak error ≤ 45 degrees  
Note: The smoothed bearing estimate is a filtered estimate of reply bearing 
measurements, quantified to 5.625 degrees. The rms error due to the 5.625 degrees quantization is 1.6 degrees and is accounted for in the performance requirements in subparagraph 2.2.4.6.4. 

## 2.4.2.1.9.2 Reply Processing (2.2.4.6.4.3)

The following procedures verify correct processing of the individual pulse bearing data during the formation of reply bearings. The tests are conducted using the test equipment described in subparagraph 2.4.1.2, modified to provide two replies having different bearings. 

Note: These tests require that two replies at different bearings from an ideal antenna 
be simulated and inserted into the RF ports of the equipment. A zero degree 
elevation angle shall be assumed. Systematic bias effects should not be simulated for these tests. 

## Equipment Required

Test equipment per subparagraph 2.4.1.2 modified to provide the inputs described in the following tests. Means to read the smoothed bearing estimates for the test targets.

## 2.4.2.1.10 Tcas Antenna System 2.4.2.1.10.1 Use Of Directional Interrogations For Mode C Surveillance (2.2.4.7.2.1) And Bearing Receive Radiation Pattern (2.2.4.7.2.2)

The following tests are designed to verify that the directional interrogation antenna system meets the specifications stated in subparagraph 2.2.4.7.2.1 for a four-beam directional antenna and that the receive radiation pattern meets the requirements of subparagraph 2.2.4.7.2.2. 

Note: The following tests assume that the top mounted directional antenna system 

contains the antenna elements as well as all necessary RF components to form the 
directional 
interrogation 
patterns, 
the 
control 
pattern 
and 
the 
omnidirectional receive pattern, and that the interface to the remainder of TCAS consists of a directional interrogation RF port (for P1, P3 and P4), a side-lobesuppression RF port (for P2), RF receive ports and a control input for directional beam selection.  The tests also assume antenna reciprocity in that it is able to receive as well as transmit via the directional and control beams. 

## Equipment Required

Antenna pattern range. Ground plane four feet in diameter or larger. Reference quarter wave stub antenna. Antenna pattern recorder and L-Band receiver. L-Band source antenna and RF generator. 

## Measurement Procedure Step 1 - Directional Bandwidth

Install the directional antenna in the center of the four-foot diameter or larger ground plane and mount the ground plane on the antenna range pedestal. Record 360° azimuth patterns at 1030 MHz for each directional interrogation beam at elevation angles of -15, -10, -5, 0, +5, +10, +15 and 20 degrees. Record the following information for use in later steps: 

a. RF source generator power output level. b. Azimuth position of the peak-of-beam of each directional beam at +10 degree 
elevation. 
c. Azimuth position of the cross-over point of each pair of adjacent beams. 
Success:  The three dB azimuth beam width of each directional beam at elevation angles of -15, -10, -5, 0, +5, +10, +15, and +20 degrees shall be less than 100 degrees. 

## Step 2 - Control Pattern Characteristic

Readjust the RF source generator power output level by an amount equivalent to the relative value of P2 that has been established by the manufacturer as appropriate for the directional interrogation antenna system. Record 360 degree azimuth patterns at 1030 MHz at elevation angles of -15, -10, -5, 0, +5, +10, +15 and +20 degrees for the control pattern associated with each directional interrogation beam. Success:  At each of the azimuth cross-over positions determined in Step 1, the amplitude of the control pattern shall be at least three dB (9 dB for the moderate whisper-shout sequence) below the amplitude of its associated directional interrogation beam to insure adequate coverage against maximum-suppression transponders. Beyond the first nulls of the main beam of the directional pattern, the amplitude of the control pattern shall be greater than the amplitude of any side- or back-lobe of its associated directional interrogation beam to ensure that minimum-suppression transponders do not respond to more than two adjacent directional beams. If in the moderate whisper-shout sequence the control pattern is not always larger than any side- or back-lobe of its associated directional beam then there should be tests which demonstrate that the TCAS rejects replies which are received as a result of these unsuppressed side-lobes. 

## Step 3 - Directional Gain And Antenna Loss

Record an elevation pattern from -15 to +20 degrees at 1030 MHz at the RF generator power output level used in Step 1 for each directional interrogation beam at the peakof-beam azimuth position determined in Step 1. Replace the directional antenna on the ground plane with the reference quarter wave stub antenna. Using the same RF generator output level as Step 1, record 360 degree azimuth patterns at 1087 MHz and 1093 MHz at elevation angles of -15, -10, -5, 0, + 5, +10, +15 and +20 degrees. Retain for Step 4. Using the same RF generator output level as Step 1, record an elevation pattern from -15 to +20 degrees at 1030 MHz at each of the peak-ofbeam azimuth positions determined in Step 1. Compute a relative gain for each directional beam as follows: 
Using the elevation pattern of the directional beam and the elevation pattern of the reference stub taken at the same azimuth position, determine the average value of the relative amplitudes of the two patterns at -15, -10, -5, 0, +5, +10, +15 and +20 degrees elevation. 

Compute the fractional beamwidth of each directional beam by dividing its measured three dB beamwidth from Step 1 by 360 degrees. Compute the maximum total radiated power for each directional beam by determining the product of its relative gain, its fractional beamwidth and the peak transmitted power for that beam as measured at the RF reference point. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Success:  The maximum total radiated power associated with each directional interrogation beam shall be within ±2 dB relative to the nominal maximum value specified in subparagraph 2.2.4.7.2.1. 

## Step 4 - Bearing Receive Radiation Pattern

Replace the reference quarter wave stub antenna on the ground plane with the directional interrogation antenna. Using the same RF generator output level as Step 1, record 360 degrees azimuth patterns at 1087 MHz and 1093 MHz at elevation angles of -15, -10, -5, 0, +5, +10, +15 and +20 degrees. Compare with the reference stub azimuth patterns recorded in Step 3. Success:  The gain shall meet the requirements of subparagraph 2.2.4.7.2.2. 

## 2.4.2.1.10.2 Use Of Directional Antenna For Tcas Broadcast Interrogations (2.2.4.7.3 And 2.2.3.10.2.4)

These tests are designed to verify that a directional antenna system used for transmission of TCAS Broadcast Interrogations meets the specifications stated in subparagraphs 2.2.4.7.3 and 2.2.3.10.2.4. 

## 2.4.2.1.10.2.1 Total Radiated Power

Compute the maximum total radiated TCAS Broadcast Interrogation power for each directional beam by determining the product of the relative gain and fractional beam width derived in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.10.1, Step 3, and the peak transmitted TCAS Broadcast Interrogation power from that beam as measured at the RF reference point. Success:  The maximum total radiated TCAS Broadcast Interrogation power associated with each directional interrogation beam shall be 49 ±2 dBm. 

## 2.4.2.1.10.2.2 Interrogation Repetition Interval And Jitter Equipment Required

This test uses the equipment and set-up described in subparagraph 2.4.2.1.1.3 (whisper-shout operation) except that a storage oscilloscope is required for this test. 

## Measurement Procedure

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Set S1 to top antenna. Program TCAS for directional TCAS Broadcast Interrogations. This measurement procedure requires that each directional TCAS Broadcast Interrogation be associated with a directional beam.  If separate antenna beam outputs are not used (i.e., beam switching occurs inside the antenna subsystem), the interrogation-to-beam association shall be accomplished by simultaneously observing the beam switching control signal and the interrogation waveform. Set the oscilloscope digital delay and sweep rate to observe the rate and jitter of the TCAS Broadcast Interrogations. Success: The TCAS Broadcast Interrogation rate, beam sequencing, and jitter shall be as specified in subparagraphs 2.2.4.7.3 and 2.2.3.10.2.4. 

## 2.4.2.2 Cas Test Procedures

This section describes the tests for the Collision Avoidance System (CAS) as specified in the CAS Requirements Specification (CRS) (Volume II). Detailed test input and expected output files are provided on a computer disk which is a part of this document.  The test files are provided in electronic form to allow, to the maximum extent possible, the use of automation in preparing test inputs and comparing test outputs.  Subparagraphs 2.4.2.2.1 and 2.4.2.2.2 describe how to use the test input files and expected output files to test an implementation of the Collision Avoidance System. There are several hundred Test Scenarios in the CRS-based Test Suite.  The Test Scenarios are grouped into Test Groups that test different areas of the CAS logic (Table 2-44).  Three files for each Test Scenario are included on the test disk.  The characteristics and use of these files are summarized in Table 2-45. The input for the tests is provided in the form of scenarios which are defined in the Encounter Input Files.  These scenarios describe the geometry of the encounter, the status of various aircraft equipment, the messages received by the TCAS unit, and the pilot response to TCAS advisories.  To use the tests, the scenario input must be converted by the user into cycle by cycle inputs for the particular CAS implementation being tested.  A 
detailed description of how to interpret the Encounter Input Files is given in subparagraph 2.4.2.2.1.1.  Additional details regarding the calculation of CRS variables from parameters in the Encounter Input Files, as well as a description of how to set up the encounter geometry, are provided in subparagraph 2.4.2.2.1.2.  The Encounter Input File for each test is provided on the test disk.

The expected output of the tests is given in two different forms.  The Short Transition Output File contains selected transitions, conditions, and macros that are triggered during the test.  This file is for use in identifying the key events that take place during the test and the causes of those events.  The End of Cycle Data Output File contains selected end of cycle data in a form that can be compared directly with the output of CRS- or pseudocode-based CAS implementations.  To compare the expected output of the tests with the actual output of a particular CAS implementation, the end of cycle output of the implementation can be reformatted to match the format of the End of Cycle Data Output File and an automated comparison program can be used to compare them.  Detailed descriptions of the two kinds of output files are given in subparagraph 2.4.2.2.2.  Both files are provided on the test disk. 

The CRS-based Test Suite was developed using TSIM, a simulation of the CAS logic based directly on the TCAS II CRS.  The simulation begins at time T=1 sec and is updated at one second intervals.  Each simulation step is called a cycle.  TSIM allows input scenarios to be developed interactively to ensure that targeted requirements are tested, and generates expected outputs which include the key events that determine what occurred during each cycle of the test.  In addition, TSIM captures test coverage data which records which CRS requirements were tested by each test.  This data was used to ensure 100% coverage of the requirements in the CRS and to document requirement-totest and test-to-requirement traceability. 

## 2.4.2.2.1 Using The Input Files 2.4.2.2.1.1 Description Of The Encounter Input File

The Encounter Input File contains the information necessary to set up the scenario for running each test.  The file is divided into four sections which are described in the following paragraphs.  Lines of the files that begin with an asterisk are comments and have no effect on the tests. The first section of the file contains information about own aircraft and begins with the line [Own Aircraft Information].  The items which can be specified in this section are shown in Table 2-46.  The items immediately following the line [Own Aircraft Information] set up the initial conditions for own aircraft which take effect at T=1 sec. Changes to own aircraft information begin with a line giving the cycle time (T=nn, where nn is an integer) for the cycle during which the change takes place.  Once a value for an item is specified, that value is retained until it is changed by another entry. The second section of the file contains information about other aircraft and begins with the line [Encounter n], where n is a number.  The items which can be specified in this section are shown in Table 2-47.  This section is repeated for each other aircraft included in the test scenario.  The items immediately following the line [Encounter n] set up the initial conditions for the other aircraft.  Specification of the start of the encounter or changes to the other aircraft information begin with a line giving the cycle time (T=nn, where nn is an integer) for the cycle during which the change takes place.  The other aircraft enters the scenario during the cycle in which the line Encounter_Start is specified. Once a value for an item is specified, that value is retained until it is changed by another entry.

* Mode_S_ID is the same as the ICAO 24-bit aircraft address. 

Following the sections specifying other aircraft information, a section may be included which begins with the line [Resolution Messages].  The items which can be specified in this section are shown in Table 2-48.  This section contains messages resulting from TCAS-TCAS coordination during an encounter.  The information for each message begins with a line giving the time (T=nn, where nn is a real number) of the message. Resolution messages for the cycle are specified first.  Coordination reply messages are specified after the resolution messages for each cycle. In this section each message is issued only at the time specified and is not repeated unless it is respecified. Finally, a section may be included which begins with the line [Ground Stations].  The items which can be specified in this section are shown in Table 2-49.  This section contains messages exchanged between own aircraft and the Mode S Ground Station during an encounter.  The information for each message begins with a line giving the time (T=nn, where nn is a real number) of the message.  In this section each message is issued only at the time specified and is not repeated unless it is respecified.

## 2.4.2.2.1.2 Calculating Crs Inputs From The Encounter Input

Variables in the input messages specified in the CRS can be determined from the parameters in the Encounter Input Files. Several of the CRS input variables correspond directly to parameters in the Encounter Input File.  Other variables must be calculated from a combination of Encounter Input File parameters.  The following twelve tables (Tables 2-50 through 2-61) summarize the correspondence between the CRS input variables and the parameters in the Encounter Input Files.  Pseudocode equivalents are also given to assist in testing pseudocode-based CAS implementations.  Following Table 2-61 is a description of how to calculate the CRS input variables which must be computed from the Encounter Input File parameters, as well as an example illustrating how to set up the encounter geometry.

The following paragraph describes how to compute and update the CRS input variables Coarse_Altitude, Fine_Altitude, Own_Corrected_Alt, Fine_Altitude_Rate, Radio_Altitude, and ZRINT.  These calculations use the parameters Init_Alt, Init_Alt_Rate, Alt_Accel, Ground_Level, and Quant specified in the Encounter Input File. For own aircraft these are located in the [Own Aircraft Information] section, and for other aircraft they are located in the relevant [Encounter n] section. At T=1 for own aircraft and at the time Encounter_Start is specified for the intruder aircraft, the altitude (Alt) and altitude rate (Alt_Rate) for each aircraft are set to Init_Alt and Init_Alt_Rate, respectively.  At the end of each cycle (T=i) Alt and Alt_Rate are updated for each aircraft for the next cycle (T = i+1) as follows: 

$\mathrm{Alt}_{i+1}=\mathrm{Alt}_{i}+\mathrm{Alt}\_\mathrm{Rate}_{i}\ \bullet1\ \mathrm{sec}+0.5\ \bullet\ \mathrm{Alt}\_\mathrm{Accel}_{i}\ \bullet(1\ \mathrm{sec})^{2}$

$\mathrm{Alt}\_\mathrm{Rate}_{i+1}=\mathrm{Alt}\_\mathrm{Rate}_{i}+\mathrm{Alt}\_\mathrm{Accel}_{i}\ \bullet1\ \mathrm{sec}$.

Calculations for Alt and Alt_Rate always use the exact value of Alt, rather than rounding to the nearest 100 ft. The CRS input variables Coarse_Altitude, Fine_Altitude, Own_- Corrected_Alt, Fine_Altitude_Rate, Radio_Altitude, and ZRINT are calculated at the beginning of each cycle from these values as follows: 
Coarse Altitude Alt i OWNi
_

 
Fine Altitude Alt i OWNi

Own Corrected Alt Alt i OWNi

The following paragraph describes how to set up the encounter geometry, and compute and update the CRS input variables RR (relative range), BEAR (bearing), and BEAR_- MEAS (raw bearing).  These calculations use the parameters Air_Speed, Init_Range, Range_Space, and Angle specified in the Encounter Input File. For own aircraft, Air_Speed is located in the [Own Aircraft Information] section. For other aircraft, all parameters are located in the relevant [Encounter n] section. Figure 2-31 illustrates how to set up the geometry of an encounter.  For all encounters, own aircraft is assumed to be travelling at a constant speed in the positive x-direction. Forward_Range is the x-component of the distance of the other aircraft from own aircraft. Side_Range is the y-component of the distance of the other aircraft from own aircraft, with positive distance being measured to the right of own aircraft.  Angle is the heading angle of the other aircraft measured clockwise from the x-axis.  Initially, at the time Encounter_Start is specified, Forward_Range is set to Init_Range and Side_Range is set to Range_Space.  At the end of each cycle Forward_Range and Side_Range are updated for the next cycle as follows: 


Note that Air_SpeedOWN and Air_SpeedOTHER are constant throughout each test and, if the value of Angle changes, it is updated before the new Forward_Range and Side_Range are computed. The CRS input variable RR is computed at the beginning of each cycle from these values as follows: 
RR
Forward Range Side Range Relative Alt i i i i



_
_

where Relative_Alt is the real altitude difference between own and other aircraft. Relative_Alt is computed as follows using the altitudes computed in the previous paragraph: 
Relative Alt Alt Alt i OWN
OTHER
i i
_


. 

Finally, the CRS input variables BEAR and BEAR_MEAS are calculated at the beginning of each cycle as follows: 

$$\mathrm{BEAR}_{\mathrm{i}}=\arctan\!\left({\frac{\mathrm{Side}_{-}\mathrm{Range}_{\mathrm{i}}}{\mathrm{Forward}_{-}\mathrm{Range}_{\mathrm{i}}}}\right)$$

$$\mathrm{BEAR}_{-}\mathrm{MEAS}_{\mathrm{i}}=\arctan\!\left({\frac{\mathrm{Side}_{-}\mathrm{Range}_{\mathrm{i}}}{\mathrm{Forward}_{-}\mathrm{Range}_{\mathrm{i}}}}\right)$$
and then adjusted for the quadrant in which the other aircraft is located. 

## 2.4.2.2.2 Using The Output Files 2.4.2.2.2.1 Description Of The Short Transition Output File

The Short Transition Output File contains selected transitions, conditions, and macros that were triggered during the test.  These are presented in a form that assists in analysis of the causes of the events that take place.  Not all transitions are included because some of them are very repetitive and/or not key to understanding the logic.  Transitions that are not included are: 

a. All identity transitions 
b. All transitions of the states Composite_RA, Climb_VSL, Descend_VSL, 
Broadcast_Cycle, Intruder_Status_Sync, Traffic_Display_Status, RM_Send_ Status, and RM_Count_This_Cycle 
c. Transition 2 of the state Tau_Rising d. Transitions 1 and 2 of the state Range_Track_Firmness e. Transitions 1, 2, and 3 of the state Range_Bearing_Track_Firmness f. Transition 1 of the state Range_Bearing_Tracker_Consistency_Check g. Transition 2 of the state Maneuver_Detection_Countdown_Timer. 
The information given for each cycle begins with a line T=nn TRANSITIONS, where nn is a number (Figure 2-32).  The next level of indentation below this line consists of lines listing the state transitions that took place during the cycle, followed by the CRS Section number, the transition number, and the number of the column that triggered the transition on the same line with the transition.  The transition information is followed by the key conditions that caused the transition to take place.  In listing the conditions, CRS macros are identified by an exclamation point preceding the macro name and indentation is used to indicate dependency of a condition on the conditions following it.  When a macro is evaluated as true, the number of the column which caused it to be true is given on the same line. 

## 2.4.2.2.2.2 Description Of The End Of Cycle Data Output File

The End of Cycle Data Output File lists the values of selected CRS states, variables, and functions at the end of each cycle of the test.  The items included in this file were selected because they have direct pseudocode equivalents and are sufficient to determine what happened during the cycle.  The data for each cycle begins with a line giving the cycle time T=nn, where nn is a number.  The following 23 to 25 lines contain own aircraft data. Other aircraft data begins with a line Other Aircraft n, where n is a number, followed by lines which contain other aircraft data.  The other aircraft data is repeated for each other aircraft in the test scenario.

Note that additional CRS states, variables, and functions are included in the output file when the other aircraft becomes a threat.  Table 2-62 also shows the variables and values in the CRS that correspond to the parameters and values in the End of Cycle Data Output File. To compare the expected output of the tests with the actual output of a particular CAS implementation, the end of cycle output of the implementation can be reformatted to match the format of the End of Cycle Data Output File and an automated comparison program can be used to compare them.  If the optional CAS input Altitude_Alerter_- Report is not implemented, then the CRS state Altitude_Alerter will also not be implemented.  In this case, when reformatting the end of cycle data of the implementation being tested, the parameter Altitude_Alerter should be set to Not_Available.  Specific examples of computer code used to format CAS output are given in Appendix C. Subsection C.1 includes the Pascal code that writes the End of Cycle Data Output File. Subsection C.2 includes C code that formats the output of a pseudocode-based CAS simulation for comparison with the End of Cycle Data Output File.  Tolerances on the output quantities that are considered to be acceptable differences are given in Table 2-63. The output quantities should compare exactly except in these cases. One acceptable method for comparing the output quantities that take on numerical values is to print out the numerical values to one more significant figure than is indicated in the C code in Subsection C.2 of Appendix C and then make the following test in an automated comparison program:

## 2.4.2.2.3 External Parameter Selection

Note: The tests in subparagraphs 2.4.2.2.3, 2.4.2.2.4, and 2.4.2.2.5 are end-to-end 
system tests that verify both the operation of the TCAS/transponder system with external elements, e.g., Mode S ground sensors and other TCAS aircraft, and also the operation of TCAS with its associated Mode S transponder.  The tests verify proper implementation of formats and protocols in paragraph 2.2.3 and proper coding of some of the software algorithms specified in the CRS in Volume II of this document.  Test results shall be considered successful only if all of the generated outputs match the expected results specified for the test scenario.  This shall include the presence of data output within allowed tolerances (if any), as well as the absence of unspecified data output, except as noted.   

 
The following abbreviations are used: 

| Equip    | Equipage (Mode C, Mode S, TCAS II)          |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Int1     | Intruder Aircraft 1 (also Int2, Int3, etc.) |
| MSS      | Mode S ground sensor                        |
| Msgs     | Messages                                    |
| R        | Horizontal Range                            |

| RA    | Resolution Advisory                    |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| RDOT  | Relative speed (positive if diverging) |
| UUT   | Unit Under Test                        |
| Z     | Altitude                               |
| ZDOT  | Altitude rate (positive if climbing)   |

 
Any TCAS intruder should reply that it has no active RA when interrogated by the UUT, unless otherwise specified.  A successful surveillance reply should be generated for each intruder in response to each interrogation, unless otherwise specified.  Subfield values may be either decimal or binary; in the latter case the 
value is shown as a concatenated string of ones and zeros, whose length is equal 
to the length of the indicated subfield.  For example, the value "001100" 
represents a bit string. 
 
All the messages generated by an intruder must be addressed to the UUT except in the case of squitter messages. 
 
When a test calls for the UUT to be interrogated by a Mode S sensor, critical 
field and subfield values in the sensor"s uplink interrogation are specified in the 
test.  Unless otherwise specified, the values for UF=4, UF=5, UF=20 and UF=21 are as follows: 
a. UF=4, PC=0, RR=0, DI=0, SD: IIS=1, LAS=0 b. UF=5, PC=0, RR=0, DI=0, SD: IIS=1, LAS=0 c. UF=20, PC=0, RR=0, DI=7, SD: IIS=1, RRS=0, LOS=0, TMS=0,  
MA: DP=0, MP=0, M/CH=5, SLC=0 
d. UF=21, PC=0, RR=0, DI=7, SD: IIS=1, RRS=0, LOS=0, TMS=0,  
MA: DP=0, MP=0, M/CH=5, SLC=0 
 
In scenarios where several messages are transferred in the space of a single cycle, alphabetic subscripts are used to show relative order: 
Msg1 at T=3a Msg2 at T=3b 
Msg3 at T=3c 
 
Delays between interrogation and response are ignored unless otherwise noted. 
 
Because of the various tolerances and measurement errors that can occur in performing these tests, a tolerance of 1.5 seconds in the display time of the RAs will be considered acceptable.

Unless otherwise noted, tests in subparagraphs 2.4.2.2.3, 2.4.2.2.4, and 2.4.2.2.5 are to be run while the UUT is connected to an actual Mode S transponder. Each test is to be run twice, once with an FAA TSO-C119A compatible transponder and once with an RTCA/DO-185A,B compatible transponder.  All intruders used in these tests can be assumed to have FAA TSO-C119A compatible transponders. 

## 2.4.2.2.3.1 Ground Control Of Sensitivity Level

This test procedure verifies that TCAS II properly interprets and accepts commands from a ground Mode S sensor to change sensitivity levels. 

## Scenario A

A Mode S ground sensor changes the UUT sensitivity levels by transmitting the appropriate messages; proper setting and reporting of sensitivity level and TCAS equipage are verified by having an intruder interrogate the UUT after every change. 

## Input:

|                              | UUT: Z         | = 21,000 ft at T=0           |
|------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
|                              | ZDOT = 0 fpm   | from T=0 to 23               |
| Int1:                        | Equip          | = TCAS II                    |
|                              | R              | = 5.0 NM                     |
|                              | RDOT = 5 knots | from T=0 to 23               |
|                              | Z              | = 21,000 ft at T=0           |
|                              | ZDOT = 0 fpm   | from T=0 to 23               |
|                              | Msgs           | = UF=0                       |
| MSS: Msgs                    | = UF=20        | at T=1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 |
| with SLC=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 |                |                              |

Expected Output: 
Msgs: DF=0 at T=0a through T=21a every three seconds.  Verify that the SL 
field takes the values 7, 7, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 

Verify that the RI field for T=6a reports a value of two ("Onboard TCAS with no resolution capability") because the ground sensor has selected "TA-Only" mode. At all other times, the RI field should report a value of three ("Onboard TCAS with vertical resolution capability only.") 

## Scenario B

This test starts with the UUT operating in automatic sensitivity level; a message from a ground Mode S sensor is input to request an adjustment of the sensitivity level. The test verifies that the UUT returns to the proper level when the ground request is terminated. Input: 

|    | UUT: Z       | = 12,000 ft at T=0    |
|----|--------------|-----------------------|
|    | ZDOT = 0 fpm | from T=0 to 245       |

Int1: 
Equip 
= TCAS II 
 
 
R 
= 5.0 NM 
at T=0 
 
RDOT = 5 knots from T=0 to 245 
 
Z 
= 12,000 ft at T=0 
 
ZDOT = 0 fpm from T=0 to 245 
 
Msgs 
= UF=0 
at T=0, 2, 243 with AQ=0, RL=0 
MSS: Msgs 
= UF=20 
at T=1 with SLC=4 
Expected Output: Msgs: DF=0 at T=0a, 2a and 243a. Verify that the SL field takes the values 6, 4, 6. 

Note: The SL field will actually take the values 6, 4, 5, 6 but since the interrogation is at T=243, the SL=5 transition will not be seen. 

## Scenario C

This test verifies the proper selection of the sensitivity level when messages are received from two different Mode S sensors. Input: 

| UUT:    | Z            | = 12,000 ft at T=0    |
|---------|--------------|-----------------------|
|         | ZDOT = 0 fpm | from T=0 to 15        |

Int1: 
Equip 
= TCAS II 
 
 
R 
= 5.0 NM 
at T=0 
 
RDOT = 5 knots from T=0 to 15 

|     | Z    | = 12,000 ft at T=0    |
|-----|------|-----------------------|
|      |      | ZDOT = 0 fpm    | from T=0 to 15               |
|------|------|-----------------|------------------------------|
|      | Msgs | = UF=0          | at T=0, 2, 4 with AQ=0, RL=0 |
| MSS: | Msgs | = UF=20         | at T=1 with SLC=4 and IIS =1 |

MSS 2: Msgs 
= UF=20 
at T=3 with SLC=3 and IIS=2 
Expected Output: 
Msgs: DF=0 at T=0a, 2a, and 4a.  Verify that the SL field takes the  
values 6, 4, 3. 

## Scenario D

This test verifies the proper selection of the sensitivity level when messages are received from two different Mode S sensors. Input: 

| UUT:        | Z              | = 12,000 ft at T=0          |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
|             | ZDOT = 0 fpm   | from T=0 to 15              |
| Int1:       | Equip          | = TCAS II                   |
|             | R              | = 5.0 NM                    |
|             | RDOT = 5 knots | from T=0 to 15              |
|             | Z              | = 12,000 ft at T=0          |
|             | ZDOT = 0 fpm   | from T=0 to 15              |
|             | Msgs           | = UF=0                      |
| MSS:        | Msgs           | = UF=20                     |
| MSS 2: Msgs | = UF=20        | at T=1 with SLC=3 and IIS=2 |

Expected Output: 
Msgs: DF=0 at T=0a, 2a, 4a. Verify that the SL field takes the values 6, 3, 3. 

Note: Since TCAS II uses the lowest sensitivity level received from all sites, the level 3 
transmitted by site 2 will supersede the level 4 transmitted by site 1. 

## 2.4.2.2.3.2 Manual Sensitivity Level Selection Scenario A

This test verifies that a manual sensitivity setting of "TA-Only" will inhibit the issuance of resolution advisories. Input: 

| UUT:    | Z    | =    | 7,900 ft    | at T=0         |
|---------|------|------|-------------|----------------|
|         | ZDOT | =    | 0 fpm       | from T=0 to 60 |
| Int1:                                          | Equip    | =    | TCAS II             |                |
|------------------------------------------------|----------|------|---------------------|----------------|
|                                                | R        | =    | 6 NM                | at T=0         |
|                                                | RDOT     | =    | -360 knots          | from T=0 to 60 |
|                                                | Z        | =    | 8,000 ft            | at T=0         |
|                                                | ZDOT     | =    | 0 fpm               | from T=0 to 60 |
|                                                | Msgs     | =    | Squitter msg at T=0 |                |
|                                                |          | =    | UF=0                | from T=0 to 60 |
| Other: Manual setting "TA-Only" from T=0 to 60 |          |      |                     |                |

Expected Output: 
Display: There should be no resolution advisory. 

| Msgs:                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| duration of the test, and that the RI field indicates ―Onboard TCAS |
| with no resolution capability‖ with a value of 2.                   |

Note: Although UUT is in performance level 5, the manual setting of "TA-Only" mode inhibits the display of resolution advisories. 

## 2.4.2.2.4 Coordination

Note: See note on test operation in subparagraph 2.4.2.2.3. 

## 2.4.2.2.4.1 Transmission Of Ra Report To Mode S Sensor And Ra Broadcast Interrogation To Other Ground Receivers

This test verifies that TCAS correctly determines the TCAS/transponder system capability (either FAA TSO-C119A or RTCA/DO-185A,B compatibility) based on communication with the on-board Mode S transponder and then reports RA information in the appropriate format.  This test requires that TCAS demonstrate proper operation with both FAA TSO-C119A and RTCA/DO-185A,B compatible transponders. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
This test verifies that the TCAS/transponder system correctly: 

a. passes RA information from TCAS to the transponder, b. indicates to the ground (DR field in DF=4, DF=5, DF=20, and DF=21 replies) that it 
has information awaiting downlink, 
c. transmits this information in DF=20, DF=21 replies, d. retains RA information for 18 ±1 seconds following the end of the RA, e. (for RTCA/DO-185A,B compatible systems) properly indicates the end of the RA via 
the RA Terminated indicator, and 
f. properly transmits RA Broadcast Interrogations at 8-second intervals for the period 
that the RA is active.  The RA Broadcast Interrogations describe the most recent RA that existed during the preceding 8-second period. 

## Scenario A

The UUT and an unequipped threat are on a horizontal collision course.  The UUT declares a "Descend" advisory and is asked to communicate it to the Mode S ground sensor. 

Input: 

|                                             | UUT: Z                                     | = 12,000 ft    | at T=0         |

Expected Output: 
Display: ―Descend‖ from T=31 to T=65  

Note: If bit 12 in DF=4 (at T=84a) is zero, the MB field in DF=20 (at T=84c) should 
have BDS=48 followed by 48 zeros.  If bit 12 in DF=4 (at T=84a) is one, the MB field in DF=20 (at T=84c) should contain the same information found at T=80c. 
When testing with an FAA TSO-C119A compatible Mode S transponder:

## Scenario B

The UUT and TCAS II-equipped threat are on a horizontal collision course. The threat declares the conflict and selects a "Descend" advisory. Subsequently, the UUT declares the conflict and selects a "Climb." The test verifies that the proper resolution advisory data is successfully transmitted to the ground sensors.

## 2.4.2.2.4.2 Coordination With Tcas Ii 2.4.2.2.4.2.1 Sense Selection And Communication

The following test procedures verify that TCAS II correctly coordinates its resolution of the conflict with a threat that is also TCAS equipped. 

## Scenario A

This test verifies that the UUT correctly transmits a TCAS Resolution Message to the threat. The UUT and a TCAS II-equipped threat are on a horizontal collision course. The UUT is the first to declare the conflict and selects a climb sense RA.  All communications must be present and in the proper sequence. 

## Input

| UUT:  Z    | = 12,200 ft    | at T=0         |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
|            | ZDOT = 0 fpm   | from T=0 to 90 |
| Int1:      | Equip          | = TCAS II      |
|            | R              | = 6.2 NM       |
|            | RDOT = -360 kt | from T=0 to 90 |
|            | Z              | = 12,000 ft    |
|            | ZDOT = 0 FPM   | from T=0 to 90 |

## Scenario B

This test verifies that the UUT correctly selects the complementary vertical sense when a TCAS II equipped threat has previously communicated its sense.  In this case, the UUT selects the complementary crossing sense because the threat has the lower ICAO aircraft address. The UUT and a TCAS II-equipped threat are on a horizontal collision course. The threat is level 200 feet below the UUT and selects a Climb advisory with respect to the UUT. Shortly thereafter, the UUT selects a Descend advisory. All communications must be present and in the proper sequence.

Note: The UUT would normally select a Climb advisory based on the intruder surveillance information. The selection of a Descend advisory by the UUT is due to the coordination process. 

## Scenario C

This test verifies that the UUT selects the correct vertical sense when a TCAS II equipped threat has previously communicated its sense.  In this case, the UUT selects the (incompatible) non-crossing sense because the UUT has the lower ICAO aircraft address and the threat has communicated its sense not more than three seconds prior to the UUT's selection. The UUT and a TCAS II-equipped threat are on a horizontal collision course. The threat is level 200 feet below the UUT and selects a Climb advisory with respect to the UUT. Shortly thereafter, the UUT selects a Climb advisory.  All communications must be present and in the proper sequence. Input:

## Scenario D

This test verifies that the UUT correctly selects the complementary vertical sense when a TCAS II equipped threat has previously communicated its sense.  In this case, the UUT initially selects the complementary crossing sense because, although the UUT has the lower ICAO aircraft address, the threat has communicated its sense more than three seconds prior to the UUT's selection. The UUT and a TCAS II-equipped threat are on a horizontal collision course. The threat is level 200 feet below the UUT and selects a Climb advisory with respect to the UUT. Shortly thereafter, the UUT selects a Descend advisory. Two seconds later the UUT 
reverses to a Climb advisory. All communications must be present and in the proper sequence. Input:

Note: The UUT would normally select a Climb advisory based on the 
intruder surveillance information. The selection of the initial Descend advisory by the UUT is due to the coordination process. 

## Scenario E

This test verifies that the UUT correctly reverses its sense when it has the higher ICAO aircraft address and discovers that a TCAS-equipped threat has selected an incompatible sense. The UUT and a TCAS II-equipped threat are on a horizontal collision course. The UUT 
is the first to declare the conflict and select a Climb sense, sending a ‗Don't Climb' to the threat.  One second later, the threat also selects a Climb sense. The UUT then reverses its sense and communicates a 'Don't Descend', 'Cancel Don't Climb' to the threat. The displayed advisory changes to a Descend.

Note: The UUT should repeat transmission of the intent message at regular intervals 
throughout a 100 millisecond period. The TCAS Resolution Message should be transmitted a minimum of six times, a maximum of 12 times. 

## Scenario H:

This test verifies that the UUT correctly communicates cancellation of a vertical resolution advisory to a TCAS II equipped threat. It also verifies that the UUT correctly processes a cancellation indication from the threat. The UUT has the higher ICAO aircraft address. In this scenario, the UUT removes the intruder from threat status twice.  The first instance is due to the threat sending a "cancel vertical complement" to the UUT.  The second instance is due to the disappearance of threat replies and subsequent dropping of the track by surveillance.

## 2.4.2.2.4.2.2 Validity Check For Tcas-Tcas Communications Link

This test verifies that a TCAS-equipped intruder will not be declared a threat if the communication link with that threat is determined to be faulty. To declare a TCAS equipped intruder a threat, TCAS must have received at least two valid surveillance reports within the last three cycles, and one of the valid reports must have occurred on the current cycle. 

## Scenario A

This scenario is identical to that of subparagraph 2.4.2.2.4.2.1, Scenario A, except that surveillance replies from the intruder are intentionally corrupted or missing so that the UUT receives replies to its surveillance interrogations only every third cycle, i.e., two misses, one reply, two misses, one reply, etc. In order for the intruder track to be properly established, the UUT should receive valid surveillance replies from the intruder for the first 15 seconds of the scenario. After 15 seconds, the pattern of two misses, one reply should be maintained. 

The UUT and a TCAS II-equipped threat are on a horizontal collision course. The UUT would normally detect a conflict and select a climb sense at T=30. However, because of the faulty communications link, no resolution advisory is issued. Input: 

| UUT: Z    | = 12,200 ft    | at T=0         |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
|           | ZDOT = 0 fpm   | from T=0 to 38 |
| Int1:     | Equip          | = TCAS II      |
|           | R              | = 6.2 NM       |
|           | RDOT = -360 kt | from T=0 to 38 |
|           | Z              | = 12,000 ft    |
|           | ZDOT = 0 fpm   | from T=0 to 38 |

## Expected Output:

Some indication that the target is successfully in track, but no resolution advisory displayed. 

## Scenario B

This scenario is identical to Scenario A above except that the intruder sends its vertical intent prior to the time that it penetrates UUT's threat boundary. In this case, despite the faulty communications link, because the threat has already sent its intent, the UUT selects and displays a resolution advisory. In order for the intruder track to be properly established, the UUT should receive valid surveillance replies from the intruder for the first 15 seconds of the scenario. After 15 seconds, the pattern of two misses, one reply should be maintained for surveillance communications only. All coordination communications should be delivered successfully. The UUT and a TCAS II-equipped threat are on a horizontal collision course. The intruder is the first to declare the conflict and select a descend sense. The UUT then selects and displays a climb advisory. The UUT has the higher ICAO aircraft address. Input:

## 2.4.2.2.4.2.3 Tcas Ii In Multi-Aircraft Conflict

This test procedure verifies that TCAS II correctly transmits its intent message when in a multi-aircraft conflict with another TCAS-equipped aircraft. 

## Scenario A

## 2.4.2.2.4.2.4 Coordination Monitor

This test verifies proper operation of the coordination monitor in the TCAS computer. 

## Scenario A

This test procedure verifies that if a TCAS Resolution Message received from a threat contains an illegal value or a parity error, the vertical resolution data in the message is not used by own TCAS II. 

The UUT and a TCAS II-equipped threat are on a horizontal collision course. The UUT is the first to declare the conflict and select a climb sense. Shortly thereafter, the threat communicates its intent once. The threat subsequently sends a different intent, but with bad parity and illegal values. The UUT's RAC field does not change. The UUT has the lower ICAO aircraft address.

## Expected Output:

Display: "Climb" from T=18 continuing to 28 (Corrective). 

When testing with an FAA TSO-C119A Mode S transponder: 

Msgs: UF=16, in MU: UDS=48, MTB=0, CVC=0, VRC=2, CHC=0, HRC=0,

DF=16, in MV: VDS=48, ARA=11000010000000, RAC=1000 at T=22c, e, g, i 
 
Note: Additional testing should be done to verify the parity encoding 
and decoding logic. For encoding, check that in the TCAS Resolution Messages (UF=16) that are sent, each of the 16 possible combinations of bits 43-46 produces the proper encoded value in bits 61-64. (See Vol. II, sec. 1.3.2, Interface 
Vert_Resolution_Message.) For decoding, check that in the TCAS Resolution Messages (UF=16) that are received, for each of the 16 possible values of bits 43-46, only the one proper value of bits 61-64 is recognized as correct (See Vol. II, sec 3.90, Valid_Resolution_Message.) 

## Scenario B

This test verifies that the coordination monitor recognizes a persistent coordination lock state and upon recognition, declares a TCAS failure condition. No specific values are provided for own or intruder positions. The manufacturer must generate a coordination lock state persisting longer than 500 milliseconds and demonstrate that within one second the monitor: 

a. indicates to the flight crew that an abnormal condition exists; b. causes any Mode S transmissions that report own aircraft status to show that own 
aircraft has no on-board resolution capability; 
c. prevents interrogations by own TCAS, and d. deactivates the normal TCAS display functions. 

## Scenario C

This test verifies that the coordination monitor recognizes an overflow in the TCAS high priority input queue and that RAs are inhibited when this condition persists for three consecutive seconds. No specific values are provided for own or intruder positions. The manufacturer must generate a queue overflow condition persisting for three consecutive seconds and demonstrate that within one second (within four seconds of the first queue overflow), the monitor: 
a. indicates to the flight crew that an abnormal condition exists; 

b. causes any Mode S transmissions that report own aircraft status to show that own 
aircraft has no on-board resolution capability; 
c. prevents interrogations by own TCAS, and 
d. deactivates the normal TCAS display functions. 

## 2.4.2.2.4.2.5 Transponder Replies To Incoming Tcas Resolution Messages

This test verifies that: a) whenever the transponder replies with a valid Coordination Reply Message to an incoming TCAS Resolution Message, the incoming message is successfully delivered to the TCAS unit; and b) whenever the transponder's internal queue is full or some other condition is present that would prevent delivery of the message to TCAS, the transponder does not reply with a valid Coordination Reply Message to an incoming TCAS Resolution Message and discards the incoming message. 

## Scenario A

Input a TCAS Resolution Message to the Mode S transponder when all of the following conditions are true: the transponder is reporting that it has an operational TCAS; no transponder queues are full, and no TCAS failure conditions exist. Demonstrate that the transponder transmits a valid Coordination Reply Message and that the incoming message is successfully passed to TCAS. 

## Scenario B

Input a TCAS Resolution Message to the Mode S transponder. Demonstrate that when the transponder queue is full, the transponder does not send a valid Coordination Reply Message (Ref. B, 2.2.20.2.1) and discards the incoming data. 

## Scenario C

Demonstrate that when a TCAS failure condition is present (the transponder is reporting no resolution capability), the transponder does not send a valid Coordination Reply Message (Ref. B, 2.20.2.1) and discards the incoming data. 

## 2.4.2.2.4.2.6 Transponder/Tcas Throughput

This test is intended to verify correct operation of the transponder and TCAS unit in four high density coordination situations: 

a. The transponder and TCAS unit are tested as a pair with a high transponder input rate 
[60 equally-spaced coordination interrogations per second (10 unique messages)]. Both transponder and TCAS unit are expected to keep up with this rate. 
b. The transponder and TCAS unit are tested as a pair at a transponder input rate high 
enough so that the transponder can no longer reply with a valid reply to all interrogations. This scenario is intended to test both the transponder and TCAS unit at the transponder's maximum rate. 
c. The TCAS unit is tested alone at the maximum rate at which coordination 
interrogations could be delivered to TCAS by the transponder/TCAS interface.  This 
scenario is intended to verify that the TCAS unit could keep up with any transponder with which it was paired. 

d. Scenario D is identical to Scenario C except that periodic messages are interspersed 
with the coordination messages received by the TCAS unit. 

## Scenario A

Input 60 RF messages, equally spaced, to the transponder each second for five consecutive seconds. The messages should be as follows: 10 TCAS Resolution Messages, each from a different threat TCAS, repeated six times; i.e., M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9, M10, M1, M2, …, M10, M1, M2, …, M10, …, where M1 is the TCAS 
Resolution Message from threat 1, M2 is the TCAS Resolution Message from threat 2, etc. Demonstrate the following: 

a. All messages successfully reach the TCAS side of the transponder/TCAS interface in 
the order input to the transponder. 
b. Messages are successfully queued in the TCAS unit (placed in the correct order in the 
TCAS high priority input queue).

Note: A manufacturer may choose to not place duplicate messages in the TCAS 
input queue. 

c. All queued messages are successfully processed in the correct order. d. No queue overflow occurs in the transponder or in the TCAS unit. 

## Scenario B

For five consecutive seconds, input RF messages, equally spaced, to the transponder at a rate at which the transponder can no longer reply with a valid reply to all interrogations. The messages should be as follows: 10 TCAS Resolution Messages, each from a different threat TCAS, as in Scenario A. Demonstrate the following: 

a. All messages for which there is a valid reply successfully reach the TCAS side of the 
transponder/TCAS interface in the order input to the transponder. 
b. All messages for which there is not a valid reply are discarded and do not reach the 
TCAS side of the transponder/TCAS interface. 
c. Messages are successfully queued in the TCAS unit (placed in the correct order in the 
TCAS high priority input queue).  
Note: A manufacturer may choose to not place duplicate messages in the TCAS 
input queue. 

d. All queued messages are successfully processed in the correct order. e. No queue overflow occurs in the TCAS unit. 

## Scenario C

Input messages to the TCAS unit at the maximum rate at which they could be delivered to TCAS by the transponder/TCAS interface.  

Note: The actual interface need not be involved; a computer interface that simulates 
the operation of the transponder/TCAS interface is acceptable.  
Send 62 messages at this maximum rate each second for five consecutive seconds. (This approximates a "burst" mode with the possibility of messages backing up in the TCAS high priority input queue and processing catching up at the end of each one-second interval.) The messages should be as follows: 10 TCAS Resolution Messages, each from a different threat TCAS, repeated six times (see Scenario A), followed by one Broadcast Interrogation Message and one Sensitivity Level Command Message. Periodic data should be transmitted immediately following the 62 messages but should not be interspersed with the 62 messages. Demonstrate the following: 

a. TCAS Resolution Messages are successfully queued (placed in the correct order in 
the TCAS high priority input queue).  
Note: A manufacturer may choose to not place duplicate messages in the TCAS 
input queue. 

b. The Broadcast Interrogation Message and the Sensitively Level Command Message 
are placed in order in the TCAS low priority input queue. 
c. All queued messages are successfully processed in the order input to the TCAS unit. d. No queue overflow occurs in the TCAS unit. 

## Scenario D

Input messages to the TCAS unit at the maximum rate at which they could be delivered to TCAS by the transponder/TCAS interface, adhering to the interface protocol specification.  

Note: The actual interface need not be involved; a computer interface that simulates 
the operation of the transponder/TCAS interface is acceptable. 
Send 62 messages at this maximum rate each second for five consecutive seconds. (This approximates a "burst" mode with the possibility of messages backing up at the end of each one-second interval.) The messages should be as follows: 10 TCAS Resolution Messages, each from a different threat TCAS, repeated six times (see Scenario A), followed by one Broadcast Interrogation Message and one Sensitivity Level Command Message. Periodic messages should be interspersed with the TCAS Resolution Messages in the following sequence: 
10 TCAS Resolution Messages (M1, M2, …, M10) 1 periodic word Word 1* of TCAS Resolution Message M1 1 periodic word  
Word 2 of TCAS Resolution Message M1 
1 periodic word Word 3 of TCAS Resolution Message M1 
9 TCAS Resolution Messages (M2, M3, …, M10) Word 1 of TCAS Resolution Message M1 1 periodic word Word 2 of TCAS Resolution Message M1 1 periodic word Word 3 of TCAS Resolution Message M1 9 TCAS Resolution Messages (M2, M3, …, M10) 3 periodic words 1 TCAS Resolution Message (M1) 1 periodic word 9 TCAS Resolution Messages (M2, M3, …, M10) 20 TCAS Resolution Messages (M1, M2, …, M10, M1, …, M10) 1 Broadcast Interrogation Message 1 Sensitivity Level Command Message * This assumes that each TCAS Resolution Message is divided into three words for transmission over the interface. 

 
Demonstrate the following: 

a. TCAS Resolution Messages are successfully queued (placed in the correct order in 
the TCAS high priority input queue). 
Note: A manufacturer may choose to not place duplicate messages in the TCAS 
input queue. 
b. The Broadcast Interrogation Message and the Sensitivity Level Command Message 
are placed in order in the TCAS low priority input queue. 
c. All queued messages are successfully processed in the order input to the TCAS unit. d. No queue overflow occurs in the TCAS unit. 

## 2.4.2.2.4.2.7 Operation Of Tcas/Transponder Queues

This test verifies correct operation of the two input queues that receive messages from own aircraft's Mode S transponder and queue the messages for processing by TCAS. The two queues are the high priority queue, which contains coordination messages (TCAS Resolution Messages from a threat TCAS); and the low priority queue, which contains all other messages (Mode S Sensitivity Level Command Messages, TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages, and periodic own aircraft data messages).  In this test, an alternative TCAS/transponder configuration may be used as long as the actual software and/or hardware used by the queuing and lock mechanisms are/is tested. 

## Scenario A

Set up a background Coordination Lock State (CLS). Demonstrate the following: 

a. Incoming TCAS Resolution Messages do not interrupt the CLS but are successfully 
processed at the end of the current lock state. 
b. Incoming Mode S Messages (Mode S Sensitivity Level Commands or TCAS 
Broadcast Interrogation Messages) do not interrupt the CLS but are successfully processed at the beginning of the next logic cycle or upon receipt of another low priority message that triggers the processing of queued messages. 

## Scenario B

Set up processing of a Mode S Sensitivity Level Command (SLC) Message. Input a TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Message to the transponder followed immediately by a TCAS Resolution Message. Demonstrate the following: 

a. The TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Message is successfully queued but does not 
interrupt the ongoing processing. 
b. The incoming TCAS Resolution Message does interrupt the ongoing SLC processing. 
When processing of the TCAS Resolution Message is done, control returns to the interrupted SLC processing routine. 
c. When processing of the SLC Message is done, the TCAS Broadcast Interrogation 
Message is processed. 

## Scenario C

Place messages in both the high priority and low priority input queues. Demonstrate that all messages in the high priority queue are processed before any messages in the low priority queue are processed. 

## Scenario D

Demonstrate, by submission of a software timing analysis, that no processing within the TCAS unit can delay transfer of TCAS Resolution Messages from the transponder/TCAS interface into the TCAS high priority input queue long enough to cause a message loss. 

The analysis should include, at a minimum, the following: 

a. a prioritized list of all interrupts within the TCAS unit; b. for each interrupt, a statement telling which interrupts (or levels of interrupts) are 
disabled while the interrupt routine is executing and the maximum time such interrupts could be disabled; 
c. the time required for the TCAS unit to input a word from the transponder/TCAS 
interface; 
d. the time required for the TCAS unit to queue a message in the TCAS high priority 
input queue. 

## 2.4.2.2.4.2.8 Coordination Timing

This test verifies that the coordination timing requirements (subparagraph 2.2.3.10.3) are met. 

## Scenario A

Demonstrate that the coordination lock state is invoked in each of the following cases and that in each case the coordination state lock does not persist longer than 0.03 second: 

a. Own aircraft initiates coordination with a TCAS-equipped intruder; b. Own aircraft accesses the threat file during housekeeping operations; and c. Own aircraft accesses the threat file during formation of RA display outputs. 

## Scenario B

Demonstrate that the coordination lock state does not persist longer than 0.01 second when: 
a. Own aircraft responds to coordination initiated by an intruder. 

## Scenario C

Demonstrate that: 

a. The elapsed time from Mode S transponder's receipt of an incoming TCAS 
Resolution Message to the receipt by TCAS from the transponder/TCAS interface is less than or equal to 0.01 second. 
b. The elapsed time from the receipt by TCAS of an incoming TCAS Resolution 
Message to the successful queuing of the message in the high priority input queue is less than or equal to 0.006 second. 

## 2.4.2.2.5 Tcas Capability Reporting (2.2.3.13.2.2.4 And 2.2.3.13.2.2.1)

Note: See note on test operation in subparagraph 2.4.2.2.3.  
This test verifies that the TCAS/transponder system properly communicates its TCAS capability to a ground Mode S sensor and to other TCAS aircraft.  This includes passing TCAS capability information from TCAS to the transponder and transmitting this information in DF=0, DF=16, DF=20, and DF=21 replies.  This test requires that TCAS demonstrate proper operation with both FAA TSO-C119A and RTCA/DO-185A,B compatible transponders. 

## Scenario

Use manual selection on the control panel to select among the modes ―stand-by,‖ ―TA- Only‖, and ―TA/RA.‖   From T=0 to T=19 seconds, TCAS is in stand-by mode.   From T=20 to T=39 seconds, TCAS is in TA-Only mode.  From T=40 to T=59 seconds, TCAS is in TA/RA mode.  From T=60 to T=79 seconds, TCAS is in stand-by mode.

0 if a capability change hasn't taken place, or DR toggles to the alternate 
value 5 (or 4) if a capability change has taken place and retains that value for 18 ±1s.

## 2.4.2.2.6 System Integration Tests

In addition to the Stand Alone Display and Control tests defined in subparagraph 2.4.2.3, a set of system level integration tests will be required for those manufacturers that produce TCAS systems.  The definition and details of these tests are left to the discretion of the manufacturer and the certifying agency.   While the development of the detailed test procedures is the responsibility of the manufacturer, there are certain guidelines that must be followed for the development of these procedures. The system integration tests are not required to be completed on every combination of TCAS processor unit, traffic display, RA display, and control panel that is produced by the manufacturer.  Instead, the system integration tests are required to be completed for each type of interface between system components that is supported by a manufacturer. For example, if a manufacturer provides systems which use the ARINC 429 architecture, the MIL-STD-1553 architecture, and a company proprietary architecture, the manufacture would be required to complete three sets of system integration tests. The system integration tests are bench tests that are conducted under ambient conditions. These tests require that the following system elements be interconnected: 

a. TCAS processor unit which includes all software that will be present in the 
equipment's flight configuration, i.e., CAS, surveillance, and monitor. 
b. TCAS traffic display 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

c. TCAS RA display 
d. TCAS/Mode S control panel e. Speaker and headset for aural annunciations 
f. Mode S transponder 
The tests also require that the required inputs from the own aircraft (data and discretes) and intruder aircraft be available to the TCAS processor unit. The completion of these integrated tests will demonstrate the following functions of the TCAS displays and controls. 

a. All aural annunciations shown in subparagraph 2.2.6.3.1.3 are annunciated through 
both the speaker and the headset.  The aural annunciations for an RA reversal and an increase rate RA are spoken with a sense of urgency. 
b. The information shown on the RA display when an RA is issued is consistent with 
the aural annunciations issued by the TCAS processor unit.  This requires the issuance of all RAs shown in Table 2-16 of subparagraph 2.2.6.3.5. 
c. TCAS automatically switches to the TA-Only mode when a GPWS or wind shear 
warning is active.  A TA is issued while in this mode to verify the aural ―Traffic 
Traffic‖ is not annunciated.  A second TA is issued after the GPWS or wind shear aural annunciation is completed but within the 10 second recovery period to verify the aural ―Traffic Traffic‖ is annunciated. 
d. All TCAS aural annunciations are inhibited when a GPWS or wind shear warning is 
active and when the own aircraft is below the aural inhibit altitude determined by the CAS logic. 
e. An aural annunciation is interrupted when the CAS logic determines a higher priority 
aural annunciation should be announced. 
f. Aural annunciations are generated whenever an RA is initially issued and when the 
strength of an RA is either strengthened or weakened. 
g. The aural annunciation ―Clear of Conflict‖ is provided when an RA is removed from 
the display.  A separate test is required to demonstrate that this aural is not issued when surveillance drops a track while an RA is displayed or when the own aircraft passes below the RA inhibit altitude. 
h. The aural annunciation ―Traffic-Traffic‖ is provided when a TA is initially issued.  A 
demonstration is also required to show that this aural is not issued when the RA reverts back to a TA after passing CPA. 
i. 
The TCAS processor unit operates in Standby, TA-Only, and TA/RA modes when these modes are selected on the TCAS control panel. 
j. 
TCAS automatically fails whenever altitude reporting is disabled or switches to Standby when the transponder-only mode of operation is selected on the control panel. 
k. All levels of intruders (Proximate, TA, and RA) are displayed at the proper range, 
bearing, and relative altitude and with the proper threat level as determined by the CAS logic.  If TCAS is implemented with the capability to display Other Traffic, then ―all levels of intruders‖ shall include Other Traffic for this test. 
l. 
The proper mode annunciations are shown on the traffic and RA displays when TCAS is operating in the TA-Only and the TA/RA mode.  Proper annunciations are displayed for all required failure conditions of the TCAS processor unit, traffic display, and RA display. 
m. The proper display and annunciation of multi-aircraft encounters. n. The RA display calls for maintaining a vertical speed of no more than 4400 fpm 
when a maintain rate RA is issued while the own aircraft is climbing or descending at a rate greater than 5,000 fpm. 

## 2.4.2.3 Display And Controls Stand Alone Tests

A series of stand alone tests are defined to verify the proper implementation of the display and control requirements.  These tests are intended to be performed on each type of display and control panel implementation provided by a manufacturer.  These tests do not require the presence of a TCAS processor unit; instead the manufacturer is responsible for defining a set of test drivers which is consistent with the type of interface (i.e., hardware and software protocols) designed into the item under test.  Likewise, the manufacturer is responsible for defining the types of instrumentation to be used to collect any quantitative data required to demonstrate compliance with the requirements. It is expected that the display drivers and data collection equipment used in these tests will be approved by the appropriate certification authority prior to the initiation of these tests.  Separate drivers may be used for different display implementations and separate drivers may be used to complete the testing defined for controls. This subparagraph contains tests for each requirement contained in paragraph 2.2.6.  It is recognized that all requirements contained in paragraph 2.2.6 will not be applicable to each display or control panel implementation.  The display or control manufacturer, in conjunction with the appropriate certification authority, has the responsibility for determining which tests must be performed for any display or control implementation.  In implementations having different pilot selectable display modes, the tests defined in this subparagraph that are appropriate for each available mode shall be completed. 

Note: In the stand-alone tests, the test descriptions and the success criteria include a time period for which a symbol or other information should be displayed and for the time between steps in the procedure.  All these times were set to 30 seconds to ensure that sufficient time is available to complete the required observations and to provide the test conductor sufficient time to complete any required configuration changes.  If the tasks specified in the test procedures can be performed in less than 30 seconds without affecting the collection of data specified for the test, the 30 seconds time periods may be reduced. 

## 2.4.2.3.1 Traffic Displays

The following tests verify the required functions of a traffic display are properly included in a manufacturer's implementation. 

## 2.4.2.3.1.1 General Characteristics 2.4.2.3.1.1.1 Own Aircraft Symbol  (2.2.6.1.2.1; 2.2.6.1.2.6.2; 2.2.6.1.2.7.1.2; 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.6.2; 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.7.3; 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.8.4; 2.2.6.1.2.7.2.9.3; 2.2.6.1.2.7.3.2; 2.2.6.1.2.7.4.2.2)

This test verifies that the traffic display information includes a reference symbol to represent the location of the own aircraft. 

This test requires that the traffic display be powered up and configured such that TCAS information can be displayed.  If the display provides multiple, pilot-selectable modes, this test shall be completed for each available display mode.  During the test, at least one intruder classified as Proximate Traffic or Other Traffic shall be displayed. 

## Success

a. The traffic display shall show a symbol representing the own aircraft in either cyan or 
white. 
b. The color of the own aircraft symbol shall be different than the color of the displayed 
Proximate or Other Traffic. 
c. If the selected display mode displays only TCAS traffic information, the own aircraft 
symbol is centered horizontally on the display and approximately 1/3 of the height from the bottom of the display. 

## D. Shared Weather Radar Displays

1. In the WX/TCAS mode, the own aircraft symbol is centered horizontally on the 
display and approximately 1/3 of the height from the bottom of the display. 
2. In the WX-and-Traffic mode, a unique own aircraft symbol is not displayed and 
the own aircraft reference of the weather radar remains displayed. 
3. In the Traffic-Only mode, the own aircraft symbol is centered horizontally on the 
display and approximately 1/3 of the height from the bottom of the display.

## 2.4.2.3.1.1.6 Intruder Vertical Speed Arrow (2.2.6.1.2.1.6)

This test verifies that the traffic display properly displays the symbol denoting the intruder has a vertical speed in excess of 500 fpm. 

This test requires that the traffic display be powered up and configured such that TCAS information can be displayed.  In addition, the display must be receiving data for two intruders with an indication that their vertical speeds are outside the range of  500 fpm (one climbing and one descending) and for two other intruders with indications that their vertical speeds are within the range of 500 fpm (one climbing and one descending). Each of these intruders shall have a range, relative to the own aircraft, that is within the available range of a fixed range display or the selected range of a variable range display. The information sent to the display for each intruder shall include valid bearing and relative altitude data for the intruder.  An additional intruder that is non-altitude reporting, but with a vertical speed of +1,000 fpm shall be included in the scenario.  If the display provides multiple, pilot-selectable modes, this test shall be completed for each available display mode. 

## Success

a. The display shows five intruders.  One intruder has a vertical arrow pointed down () 
to the immediate right of the intruder symbol and one intruder has a vertical arrow pointed up () to the immediate right of the intruder symbol.  Two intruders do not have a vertical arrow displayed.  The non-altitude reporting intruder is displayed with or without a vertical trend arrow. 
b. The colors of the vertical arrows are the same as the intruder symbol. 

## 2.4.2.3.1.1.7 No-Bearing Advisories (2.2.6.1.2.1.8; 2.2.6.1.2.1.12)

This test verifies that the traffic display properly displays information on the intruder when a TA or RA is issued against an aircraft with no bearing information displayed.  It also verifies that intruders not causing a TA or RA to be issued and for which bearing data are not available are not displayed. 

This test requires that the traffic display be powered up and configured such that TCAS information can be displayed.  In addition, the display must be initially receiving data for four intruders that have a threat status of either a TA or RA and for which no bearing information is available.  The second part of the test eliminates three of the four intruders and adds a no-bearing intruder that is proximate traffic.  Finally, the traffic display is configured to display the intruder's actual altitude instead of relative altitude.  For this portion of the scenario, the display is assumed to have the local barometric correction. 

For the first four intruders, at least one of the intruders shall be non-altitude reporting and causing a TA.  The scenario shall be implemented so that the non-altitude reporting intruder is displayed during the initial phase of the scenario.  All other intruders shall be altitude reporting and have a vertical speed greater than 500 fpm.  At least one intruder shall be classified as causing an RA.  
There are no additional requirements for the Proximate Traffic intruder. 

## Success

a. The display shows at least two of the four initial intruders using an alpha-numeric 
string for each intruder.  In this string, the threat information is shown in the following order:  threat level using the indication ―TA‖ or ―RA‖; range in NM; relative altitude; and the vertical speed arrow.   For the non-altitude reporting TA traffic, the alpha-numeric string contains only the letters ―TA‖ and the intruder's range.  There is no maneuver information shown on the traffic display. 
b. The alpha-numeric string is shown in amber or yellow for the intruders causing a TA 
and in red for those intruders causing an RA. 
c. If less than four intruders are shown, the ones that are not displayed have a lower 
priority (by order of delivery) than the intruders that are displayed. 
d. When three of the four initial intruders are removed from the scenario and the 
Proximate Traffic is added, only one no-bearing intruder is shown and it is either a TA or an RA.  The no-bearing proximate traffic is not displayed. 
e. When the display is configured to display actual altitude instead of relative altitude, 
the alpha-numeric string for the no-bearing intruder shows the actual altitude, using three digits, instead of relative altitude. 

## 2.4.2.3.1.1.8 Display Of Traffic (2.2.6.1.2.1.9)

This test verifies that the traffic display includes information on the proper number and types of intruders whenever a TA or an RA is issued. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

This test requires that the traffic display be powered up and configured such that TCAS information can be displayed.  The test requires that the display receive information on 10 intruders that are prioritized in the same manner used by the CAS logic and which have a range of five NM or less.  The test set-up shall ensure that the relative altitude of all 10 intruders is within the available or selected altitude band of the display.  One of the intruders shall be classified as a TA or an RA; eight shall be classified as Proximate Traffic; and one shall be classified as Other Traffic. 

## Success

The display shows at least eight of the ten intruders. These eight intruders shall include the intruder classified as a TA or RA and seven Proximate intruders.  The Proximate traffic that is not displayed has the lowest priority of the eight intruders classified as Proximate traffic. 

## 2.4.2.3.1.1.9 Altitude Band For The Display (2.2.6.1.2.1.10; 2.2.6.5.2)

This test verifies that the traffic display is capable of displaying intruders within the specified relative altitude of the own aircraft. 

This test is performed in three parts and all require that the traffic display be powered up and configured such that TCAS information can be displayed. The first part of the test verifies that traffic within 2,700 feet of the own aircraft are displayed and that any intruder causing a TA or an RA outside this altitude band is displayed.  On traffic displays which have a capability of expanded altitude display, the display shall be configured to only show traffic within 2,700 feet.  Five intruders are used in this part of the test; three have relative altitudes within a range between 2,700 feet and two have relative altitudes outside the range of 2,700 feet.  One of the intruders with an initial relative altitude outside the range of 2,700 feet has a vertical speed towards the own aircraft such that its relative altitude becomes less than 2,700 feet at t=10 seconds.  At t=20 seconds, the remaining aircraft with a relative altitude greater than 2,700 feet causes a TA or RA to be issued. The second and third parts of the test verify the proper implementation of the expanded altitude band function. Six intruders are used in the second part of the test; three have relative altitudes between +9,900 and -2,700 feet; one has a relative altitude of -3,000 feet; and two have relative altitudes greater than +9,900 feet.  The display is configured in the ―Above‖ mode.  One of the intruders with an initial relative altitude greater than 
+9,900 feet has a vertical speed towards the own aircraft such that its relative altitude becomes less than 9,900 feet at t=10 seconds. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Six intruders are used in the third part of the test; three have relative altitudes between -9,900 and +2,700 feet; one has a relative altitude of +3,000 feet; and two have relative altitudes in excess of +9,900 feet.  The display is configured in the ―Below‖ mode.  One of the intruders with an initial relative altitude in excess of -9,900 feet has a vertical speed towards the own aircraft such that its relative altitude becomes less than 9,900 feet at t=10 seconds. 

## Success Part 1:

a. At t=0, three intruders are displayed and all have relative altitudes within a range 
between 2,700 feet.   
b. At t=10 seconds, a fourth intruder is displayed and it also has a relative altitude 
within a range between 2,700 feet.  
c. At t=20 seconds, the fifth intruder is shown as a TA or RA with a relative altitude 
outside the range of 2,700 feet. 

## Part 2:

a. At t=0, three intruders are displayed and all have relative altitudes between -2,700 
and +9,900 feet.   
b. At t=10 seconds, a fourth intruder is displayed and it also has a relative altitude 
between -2,700 and +9,900 feet.   
c. The sixth intruder is never displayed. d. The selection of the ―Above‖ mode is annunciated on the display. 

## Part 3:

a. At t=0, three intruders are displayed and all have relative altitudes between +2,700 
and -9,900 feet.   
b. At t=10 seconds, a fourth intruder is displayed and it also has a relative altitude 
between +2,700 and -9,900 feet.   
c. The sixth intruder is never displayed. d. The selection of the ―Below‖ mode is annunciated on the display. 

## 2.4.2.3.1.1.10 Display Of Tcas Operating Mode (2.2.6.1.2.1.11; 2.2.6.6.2; 2.2.6.1.2.1.14)

This test verifies that the traffic display properly annunciates the current operating mode of TCAS. 

This test requires that the traffic display be powered up and configured such that TCAS information can be displayed.  Sequential signals are provided to indicate that TCAS is in Standby, TA-Only, and TA/RA mode.  Sequential signals shall also be provided to indicate that TCAS has failed, that the traffic display is unable to display traffic, and that a pilot- initiated Self Test is in progress. 

## Success

a. When the display receives an indication that TCAS is in Standby, this state is clearly 
annunciated on the traffic display.  This annunciation is shown in a color other than yellow, amber, or red. 
b. When the display receives an indication that TCAS is in the TA-Only mode, this state 
is clearly annunciated on the traffic display.  This annunciation is shown in a color other than yellow, amber, or red when no TA is present. 
c. When the display receives an indication that TCAS is in the TA/RA mode, this state 
is clearly annunciated on the traffic display.  This annunciation is shown in a color other than yellow, amber, or red.  
Note: It is acceptable for the traffic display to not provide an annunciation indicating the system is operating in the TA/RA mode.  The lack of an annunciation on some displays of the TA/RA mode, along with annunciations showing other operating modes provides the pilot with a unique indication of the system"s operating status. 

d. When the display receives an indication that TCAS has failed, this state is clearly 
annunciated on the traffic display.  This annunciation is shown in either yellow or amber. 
e. When the display receives an indication that the traffic display has failed, this state is 
clearly annunciated on the traffic display.  This annunciation is shown in either yellow or amber. 
f. When the display receives an indication that a pilot initiated Self Test is in progress, 
this state is clearly annunciated on the traffic display.  This annunciation is shown in a color other than yellow, amber, or red. 
g. All TCAS-related annunciations have a single meaning which is consistent in all 
available display modes. 
h. On shared displays, the TCAS annunciations are consistent with all other 
annunciations shown on the display.   
Note: The completion of this step may require additional inputs to the display to generate the other annunciations. 

## 2.4.2.3.1.2 Fixed Range Displays

There are no unique tests for fixed range displays. 

Note: The unique requirements for the fixed range display are tested using the relevant 
test procedures shown in subparagraph 2.4.2.3.1.1. 

## 2.4.2.3.1.3 Variable Range Displays 2.4.2.3.1.3.1 Display Range (2.2.6.1.2.3.1)

This test verifies that a variable range traffic display provides a pilot selectable range that is appropriate for use in the immediate vicinity of an airport. 

This test requires that the traffic display be powered up and configured such that TCAS information can be displayed.  The display is configured so that the lowest selectable display range is shown.   

Note: If the traffic display provides a display range less than five miles, the five mile 
range (or closest available range) shall be selected for this test.  A simulated intruder that is classified as Proximate or Other traffic begins the scenario at the 
12 o"clock position and at a range of eight miles.  The intruder moves toward the own aircraft and ends the scenario at the six o"clock position at a range of four 
miles. 

## Success

a. At the beginning of the scenario, the intruder is not displayed.  The traffic display has 
an annunciation of the range selected. 
b. The intruder is initially shown on the display at a maximum range of six NM and 
remains displayed until it is at least 2.5 NM to the rear of the own aircraft.   
Note: On shared displays, the intruder is not required to be displayed after it passes the own aircraft reference symbol. 

## 2.4.2.3.1.3.2 Range Selection (2.2.6.1.2.3.2)

This test verifies that all available display ranges can be selected and that an intruder is shown at the proper location, relative to the own aircraft, in all display ranges. 

This test requires that the traffic display be powered up and configured such that TCAS information can be displayed.  The display is initially configured in the lowest available display range.  All higher ranges are subsequently selected.  An intruder is required to be shown at a range of nine NM at the 12 o'clock position.  The test also requires a means of selecting all available display ranges.  This selection may be done using controls located on the traffic display, with a connected control panel, or with simulated inputs. 

## Success

a. At the beginning of the test, the intruder is not displayed and the selected range is 
annunciated on the display. 
b. For selected ranges less than nine NM, no intruder is displayed.  The selected range is 
annunciated on the display. 
c. For selected ranges greater than nine NM, the intruder is displayed at the proper 
range and bearing.  The selected range is annunciated on the display. 

## 2.4.2.3.1.4 Part Time Displays 2.4.2.3.1.4.1 Activation And Information Displayed (2.2.6.1.2.4.1; 2.2.6.1.2.4.2)

This test verifies that a part-time display activates at the appropriate time, displays the proper information when activated, and continues to display traffic information for the appropriate amount of time. 

This test requires that the traffic display be powered up and configured such that TCAS information is displayed on a part time basis.  It requires the presence of an intruder that is classified as Proximate Traffic and has a range of four NM; an intruder that is classified as a TA; and an intruder that is classified as an RA, but for which no TA was issued.  It also requires the capability to select various display modes on a shared display.  
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`
This selection may be done via controls located on the traffic display, with a connected control panel, or using simulated inputs. The Proximate Traffic information is sent to the display throughout the scenario.  Thirty seconds (t=30) after the start of the scenario, information for the TA is sent to the display.  
This information is sent for 30 seconds before being removed at t=60 seconds.  If a written text message is shown on the display instead of the TA symbology, the display shall be reconfigured to show the traffic symbology after the TA is issued.  After a 30 second delay (at t=90), information on the intruder causing an RA is sent to the display. This information is sent for 30 seconds before being removed at t=120 seconds.  If a written text message is shown on the display instead of the RA symbology, the display shall be reconfigured to show the traffic symbology after the RA is issued.  After a delay of 30 seconds (at t=150), the information on the intruder causing the TA and the intruder causing the RA (with no preceding TA) is sent to the display.  This information is sent for 30 seconds before being removed at t=180 seconds.  If a written text message is shown on the display instead of the RA symbology, the display shall be reconfigured to show the traffic symbology after the RA is issued.  If the display supports another mode which supports the full time display of traffic, it is selected while the RA is displayed.     

## Success

a. At the start of the scenario, the display shows no traffic information.  If the display

## 2.4.2.3.1.7.4 Ta/Ra/Vsi

These tests verify the proper implementation of the vertical speed indicator and the TCAS traffic display on a single instrument. 

## 2.4.2.3.1.7.4.1 Vsi Requirements (2.2.6.1.2.7.4.1.2)

This test verifies that the VSI needle supports the requirements for use as a vertical speed indicator.   

Note: This test is not intended to be a complete qualification of the VSI function of this 
type of display.  Additional testing may be required to demonstrate that the VSI meets all the applicable standards for such an instrument. 
This test requires that the TA/RA/VSI be powered up and that the display of traffic be enabled.  At least one intruder must be displayed in a location which falls under the stem of the VSI needle.  The test requires that instrumentation be provided which permits various vertical speeds to be displayed on the TA/RA/VSI.  This instrumentation shall also permit the vertical speed to be varied using accelerations that can be expected during normal aircraft operations. 

## Success

Note: The assessment of the vertical speed function is a subjective assessment and 
should be performed by Flight Test personnel from the Aircraft Certification Office. 
a. Using peripheral vision only, the actual vertical speed depicted and the vertical speed 
trend is accurately interpreted. 
b. The stem of the VSI needle overlaps the displayed traffic, but the information on the 
displayed traffic (range, bearing, threat type, and relative altitude information) remains readable. 

## 2.4.2.3.1.7.4.2 Interference With Vertical Speed Scale (2.2.6.1.2.7.4.2.3)

This test verifies that none of the displayed traffic information overwrites any portion of the vertical speed scale. 

This test requires that the TA/RA/VSI be powered up and that the display of traffic be enabled.  Six intruders must be evenly spaced around the display at the maximum range of the display at each location.  Each intruder must be altitude reporting and have a vertical trend arrow. 

## Success

None of the traffic information overwrites or infringes on any portion of the vertical speed scale.  This includes the traffic symbol, altitude data, and vertical trend arrow. 

## 2.4.2.3.2 Ra Displays

These tests verify the proper implementation of TCAS RA display characteristics. 

## 2.4.2.3.2.1 Round Dial Vsi (2.2.6.2.2; 2.2.6.2.2.1.1; 2.2.6.2.2.1.2; 2.2.6.2.2.1.3; 2.2.6.2.2.1.4)

The tests in this subparagraph verify the proper depiction of corrective and preventive RAs when the RAs are shown on a round dial VSI. 

These tests require that the round dial VSI be powered up.  The test will verify the proper depiction of the RAs shown in Table 2-64.  

## Success

The success criteria for these tests are shown in Table 2-64. During the display of all RAs, both the red and green arcs depicted on the display shall be readily discernible and distinguishable from each other and from the portions of the VSI with no illuminated arcs.   

## Notes:

1. 
The assessment of the distinction between the various illuminated arcs is a subjective assessment and should be performed by Flight Test personnel from the Aircraft Certification Office. 
2. 
The length of the green arc in terms of vertical speed shown in Table 2-64"s success criteria is approximate and should not be considered absolute.  The 
length of the green arc should be the nominal length, as defined in subparagraph 
2.2.6.2.2.1.2 for all RAs except the multi-aircraft encounter (Maintain Existing Vertical Speed).

## 2.4.2.3.2.1.1 Vsi Range (2.2.6.2.2)

This test verifies the RA display has sufficient range on the vertical speed scale to display all RAs that can be issued by the CAS logic. 

This test requires that the RA display be powered up and configured such that RA can be displayed. 

## Success

The scale of the vertical speed indicator can display vertical speeds between 6000 fpm. 

Note: If the VSI implementation does not provide a scale between 6,000 fpm, alternative test procedures must be defined by the display manufacturer.  These alternative tests must demonstrate that each of the RAs shown in Table 2-64 are displayed in a manner which permits a pilot to make the desired response to the displayed RA. 

## 2.4.2.3.2.2 Vertical Speed Tape (2.2.6.2.3; 2.2.6.2.3.1.1; 2.2.6.2.3.1.2; 2.2.6.2.3.1.3; 2.2.6.2.3.1.4)

The tests in this subparagraph verify the proper depiction of corrective and preventive RAs when the RAs are shown on a vertical speed tape within the PFD. 

These tests require that the PFD be powered up.  The test will verify the proper depiction of the RAs shown in Table 2-65.  

## Success

The success criteria for these tests are shown in Table 2-65.  During the display of all RAs, both the red and green zones depicted on the display shall be readily discernible and distinguishable from each other and from the portions of the vertical speed tape with no illuminated arcs.   

## Notes:

1. 
The assessment of the distinction between the various illuminated zones is a subjective assessment and should be performed by Flight Test personnel from the Aircraft Certification Office. 
2. 
If the vertical speed tape implementation does not provide a scale between 
6,000 fpm, alternative test procedures must be defined by the display 
manufacturer.  These alternative tests must demonstrate that each of the RAs shown in Table 2-65 are displayed in a manner which permits a pilot to make the desired response to the displayed RA. 
3. 
The length of the green zone in terms of vertical speed shown in Table 2-65"s success criteria is approximate and should not be considered absolute.  The length of the green zone should be the nominal length as defined in 2.2.6.2.3.1.2 for all RAs except the multi-aircraft encounter (Maintain Existing Vertical Speed)

The green zone is either wider than the red zone, or is offset from the red zone.  It is also acceptable to display a nominal length green zone beginning at 0 fpm and extending downwards to approximately -250 fpm.

| Vertical Speed Tape Range (2.2.6.2.3)                                   |

This test verifies the vertical speed tape has sufficient range on the vertical speed scale to display all RAs that can be issued by the CAS logic. 

This test requires that the PFD be powered up and configured such that RA can be displayed. 

## Success

The scale of the vertical speed indicator can display vertical speeds between 6000 fpm. 

Note: If the vertical speed tape implementation does not provide a scale between 
6,000 fpm, alternative test procedures must be defined by the display manufacturer.  These alternative tests must demonstrate that each of the RAs shown in Table 2-65 are displayed in a manner which permits a pilot to make the desired response to the displayed RA. 

## 2.4.2.3.2.3 Pitch Cues On The Pfd (2.2.6.2.4.1; 2.2.6.2.4.2; 2.2.6.2.4.3)

The tests in this subparagraph verify the proper depiction of corrective and preventive RAs when the RA guidance is shown using pitch cues displayed on the PFD. 

These tests require that the PFD be powered up.  The test will verify the proper depiction of the RAs shown in Table 2-66.  

## Success

The success criteria for these tests are shown in Table 2-66.  During the display of all RAs, the TCAS trapezoid, or other geometric shape, depicting the pitch angle to maintain or attain shall be readily discernible and distinguishable from all other information shown on the PFD.   
Note: This assessment is a subjective one and should be performed by Flight Test personnel from the Aircraft Certification Office.

## 2.4.2.3.2.4 Flight Director Guidance (2.2.6.2.5.1)

The tests in this subparagraph verify the proper depiction of corrective and preventive RAs when the RA guidance is shown using the flight director. 

These tests require that the ADI or PFD be powered up.  The test will verify the proper depiction of the RAs shown in Table 2-67.  

## Success

The success criteria for these tests are shown in Table 2-67.  The success criteria refer to both a single cue flight director and the vertical bar of a split cue flight director.  The lateral guidance shown by the flight director is not constrained by these tests.

The tests in this subparagraph verify the proper depiction of corrective and preventive RAs when the RA guidance is shown on a HUD. 

These tests require that the HUD be powered up and that navigation data be displayed. The test will verify the proper depiction of the RAs shown in Table 2-68.   The tests shall be completed for each available display mode. 

## Success

The success criteria for these tests are shown in Table 2-68.  RA guidance information shall be displayed in all available display modes.  During the display of all corrective RAs, a flight path target consisting of a box with lines twice the width of the trapezoid comprising the ―no fly‖ zone shall be displayed.  The trapezoid representing the flight path to be attained or maintained and the flight path target shall be readily discernible and distinguishable from all other information shown on the HUD.   

Note 1: This assessment is a subjective one and should be performed by Flight Test 
personnel from the Aircraft Certification Office. 
The underlying navigation data and HUD guidance cue remain displayed at all times. Other information may be removed to declutter the display as long as this does not interfere with the pilot's ability to comply with the RA or operate the aircraft in compliance with the appropriate regulations and requirements.    

Note 2: This assessment of which information can be removed during an RA is a 
subjective one and should be performed by Flight Test personnel from the Aircraft Certification Office.

## 2.4.2.3.3 Controls

The tests defined in the following sections verify that the TCAS and transponder controls perform the functions required in subparagraph 2.2.6.5.  These tests are to be performed using the actual controls or control panels.  The controls are not required to be connected to the TCAS processor unit or to the display which they are intended to control.  If the controls are not actually connected to the TCAS processor unit and associated displays, appropriate instrumentation must be provided to demonstrate the required inputs and outputs are available at the controls or control panel. 

## 2.4.2.3.3.1 Tcas/Mode S Controls (2.2.6.5.1)

These tests verify that the TCAS and Mode S control panel(s) provide the means to select the required operating modes of TCAS and the Mode S transponder. 

The TCAS/Mode S control panel is powered up and connected to either: (1) the TCAS processor unit and the Mode S transponder; or (2) appropriate test instrumentation to demonstrate the control panel provides the correct outputs.  If a design implementation uses separate control panels for TCAS and the Mode S transponder, both must be present for the completion of these tests. 

The test requires that each of the four required TCAS/transponder operating modes be selected and that the proper output of the control panel be verified.  The test also requires that all required control functions of the control panel be exercised. 

## Success

a. When the operation of the Mode S transponder only is selected, the control panel 
provides a unique signal which indicates the transponder is operative, but that TCAS must be placed in Standby. 
b. When the TA/RA mode is selected, the control panel provides a unique signal which 
indicates the transponder is operative and that TCAS is capable of issuing RAs. 
c. When the TA-Only mode is selected, the control panel provides a unique signal 
which indicates the transponder is operative and the pilot has selected a TCAS operating mode which inhibits RAs. 
d. When the TCAS Self Test is selected, the control panel provides a unique signal 
which initiates the TCAS Self Test. 
e. The control panel provides the capability to select all 4096 Mode A transponder 
codes.  When a code is selected, the correct information is provided as an output from the control panel to the transponder. 
f. When altitude reporting is disabled, a unique code is provided to indicate that 
Mode C should not be included in the transponder replies and that TCAS should be failed. 
g. The position of all controls is readily discernible by inspection.    
Note: This assessment is a subjective one and should be performed by Flight Test personnel from the Aircraft Certification Office. 

## 2.4.2.3.3.2 Traffic Display Controls (2.2.6.5.2)

These tests verify the proper implementations of the optional traffic display controls. 

The test set-up is dependent on the actual implementation of the traffic display controls. If the controls are integrated into the traffic display, the actual traffic display must be used in these tests.  If the controls are included as part of the TCAS/Mode S control panel, or as part of another type of control panel, only that control panel is required.   

## Success

a. Altitude Range Selector.  A switch is provided to permit the pilot to display traffic 
that is outside a relative altitude of 2,700 feet.  The switch provides three selections indicated by the words ―Above‖, ―Normal‖, or ―Below‖ or a suitable abbreviation of these words.  When each of the positions is selected, a unique signal is provided by the control to the traffic display which indicates the relative altitudes to be displayed. 
b. Range Selection.  If the traffic display is a variable range display, a switch is 
provided to select the available display ranges. When each of the positions is selected, a unique signal is provided by the control to the traffic display which indicates the selected display range. 
c. Actual Altitude.   If the traffic display provides for the display of actual altitude, a 
switch is provided to select between the display of actual and relative altitude.  When each of the positions is selected, a unique signal is provided by the control to the traffic display which indicates the format of altitude to be displayed. 
d. Traffic Override.  On a part time display, a switch is provided to override the display 
of TCAS information and return the display to its other function.  When traffic override is selected, a unique signal is provided by the control to the traffic display which indicates that the display of traffic is no longer desired. 
e. Display Mode.  On displays with both a part time and a full time display capability, a 
switch is provided to enable the pilot to configure the display to either operating mode.  When either switch position is selected, a unique signal is provided by the control to the traffic display which indicates the desired display configuration. 
f. The position of all switches is readily discernible by inspection.    
Note: This assessment is a subjective one and should be performed by Flight Test personnel from the Aircraft Certification Office. 

## 2.4.2.3.3.3 Shared Weather Radar/Traffic Display Controls (2.2.6.5.3; 2.2.6.5.3.1; 2.2.6.5.3.2; 2.2.6.5.3.3)

These tests verify the proper implementations of the controls when the TCAS traffic display is shared with the weather radar display. 

The test set-up is dependent on the actual implementation of the traffic display and weather radar controls.  If the controls are integrated into the traffic display, the actual traffic display must be used in these tests.  If the controls are included as part of the TCAS/Mode S control panel, or as part of another type of control panel, only that control panel is required.   

## Success

a. A switch is provided to select either the WX/TCAS mode or the WX-and-Traffic 
Mode.  
b. If the display supports a WX-Only and a TCAS-Only mode, a switch is provided to 
select these modes. 
c. The position of all switches is readily discernible by inspection.    
Note: This assessment is a subjective one and should be performed by Flight Test personnel from the Aircraft Certification Office. 

## 2.4.2.3.4 Status And Failure Annunciations (2.2.6.6)

These tests verify that the required status and failure annunciations are properly displayed on the TCAS displays. 

## 2.4.2.3.4.1 Traffic Display Annunciations (2.2.6.6.1)

The required annunciations on the traffic display are contained in subparagraph 2.4.2.3.1.1.10. 

## 2.4.2.3.4.2 Ra Display Annunciations (2.2.6.6.2)

These tests verify that the RA display properly annunciates the required TCAS operating modes and failure conditions. 

This test requires that the RA display be powered up and configured such that TCAS information can be displayed.  Signals are provided to indicate that TCAS is in Standby, TA-Only, and TA/RA mode.  Signals shall also be provided to indicate that TCAS has failed, that the RA display is unable to display RAs, and that a pilot-initiated Self Test is in progress. 

## Success

a. When the display receives an indication that TCAS is in Standby, this state is clearly 
annunciated on the RA display.  This annunciation is shown in a color other than yellow, amber, or red. 
b. When the display receives an indication that TCAS is in the TA-Only mode, this state 
is clearly annunciated on the RA display.  This annunciation is shown in a color other than yellow, amber, or red when there is no TA present. 
c. When the display receives an indication that TCAS is in the TA/RA mode, this state 
is clearly annunciated on the RA display.  This annunciation is shown in a color other than yellow, amber, or red. 
d. When the display receives an indication that TCAS has failed, this state is clearly 
annunciated on the RA display.  This annunciation is shown in either yellow or amber. 
e. When the display receives an indication that the RA display has failed, this state is 
clearly annunciated on the display.  This annunciation is shown in either yellow or amber. 
f. When the display receives an indication that a pilot initiated Self Test is in progress, 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

this state is clearly annunciated on the RA display.  This annunciation is shown in a color other than yellow, amber, or red. 
g. All TCAS-related annunciations have a single meaning which is consistent in all 
available display modes. 
h. On shared displays, the TCAS annunciations are consistent with all other 
annunciations shown on the display.   
Note: The completion of this step may require additional inputs to the display to generate the other annunciations. 

## 2.4.2.4 Automatic Performance Monitoring And Self Test (2.2.7) 2.4.2.4.1 Automatic Performance Monitoring (2.2.7.1)

The manufacturer shall provide a test plan to verify that the failure response specified in subparagraph 2.2.7.1.1 is actuated within the time specified in subparagraph 2.2.7.1.1 under each of the fault conditions that would be detected if the Monitor is operating as specified in subparagraphs 2.2.7.1, 2.2.7.2, and 2.2.7.3. The plan shall include a procedure to verify that the message interface to the Mode S transponder indicates a nonoperative TCAS whenever the failure response is actuated. These tests may, at the manufacturer's option, be performed in an open box mode. The manufacturer shall provide means of his own design (e.g., the manual disconnecting of cables or cutting of wires, a temporary test harness, a permanent test connector or any combination of these) for inducing each of the malfunctions whose presence the Monitor is required to detect. In any instance where the relation between the malfunction and the means for inducing the malfunction is not physically obvious, the manufacturer shall provide an engineering analysis that establishes this relation. Engineering analysis may be substituted for any test in which the manufacturer's design makes the artificial stimulation of a malfunction impractical. 

## 2.4.2.4.2 Self-Test (2.2.7.1.3)

The manufacturer shall provide a test plan to verify that the self-test function operates as specified in subparagraph 2.2.7.1.3. The general considerations stated in subparagraph 2.4.2.4.1 apply.  Procedures for self-test verification may, whenever appropriate, use the results of tests performed under subparagraph 2.4.2.4.1. 

## 2.4.2.4.3 Own Transponder Icao 24-Bit Aircraft Address (2.2.7.2.5.3)

This test verifies that the Monitor recognizes an own ICAO 24-bit aircraft address of either all 0s or all 1s and upon recognition, declares a TCAS failure. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The manufacturer must simulate own TCAS aircraft ICAO aircraft address conditions of all 0s and all 1s and demonstrate for each condition that within one second the Monitor: 

a. indicates to the flight crew that an abnormal condition exists; b. causes any Mode S transmissions that report own aircraft status to show that own 
aircraft has no on-board resolution capability; 
c. prevents interrogations by own TCAS; and 
d. deactivates the normal TCAS display functions. 

## 2.4.2.5 Performance Compatibility With Own-Aircraft'S Mode S Transponder

The following tests verify that under normal operating conditions the Mode S transponder and the TCAS functions do not interfere with one another. 

## 2.4.2.5.1 Tcas To Mode S Transponder Interference (2.1.10.1)

This test verifies that the TCAS functions do not couple spurious signals into the Mode S transponder and thereby degrade its minimum threshold (sensitivity) level. Test Scenario:  A sensitivity measurement is to be performed on the Mode S receiver immediately following completion of the TCAS transmitter active state (as defined in subparagraph 2.1.10.1) during which a TCAS interrogation occurred at its maximum output power level value. If separate antenna ports are provided for the Mode S transponder and the TCAS, the external coupling paths between the transponder receiver input and the TCAS transmitter output shall be simulated to represent the estimated maximum coupling with the equipment installed in an aircraft. A separate transponder sensitivity measurement shall be conducted for the top and bottom antenna ports in accordance with Ref. B, subparagraphs 2.2.2.3 and 2.4.2.1. 

## 2.4.2.5.2 Mode S Transponder To Tcas Interference (2.2.3.11)

This test verifies that the Mode S functions do not couple spurious signals into the TCAS receiver and thereby degrade its minimum threshold (sensitivity) level. Test Scenario: A sensitivity measurement is to be performed on the TCAS receiver immediately following completion of the Mode S transmitter active state as defined in subparagraph 2.2.3.11. If separate antenna ports are provided for the Mode S transponder and TCAS, the external coupling paths between the TCAS receiver input and the Mode S transponder transmitter output shall simulate the estimated maximum coupling with the equipment installed in an aircraft. 

## 2.4.3 Computer Performance Verification

Note: The details of these tests should be coordinated with the appropriate 
airworthiness authorities.

All electrically operated aircraft systems and equipments shall be operational before conducting electronic interference tests. 

## 3.1.3 Environment

During the following tests, the equipment shall not be subjected to environmental conditions that exceed those specified by the manufacturer. 

## 3.1.4 Adjustment Of Equipment

The circuits of the equipment under test shall be properly aligned and otherwise adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practices. 

## 3.2 Equipment Installation 3.2.1 Equipment Accessibility

The equipment controls and display(s) installed for in-flight operation shall be readily accessible from the normal seated position. The appropriate operator/crew member(s) shall have an unobstructed view of the display(s) when in normal sitting position. 

## 3.2.2 Display Visibility

The display brilliance shall be such that the display can be interpreted under all probable cockpit conditions of ambient light. Filters and brightness adjustments are acceptable means of obtaining visibility in daylight. 

## 3.2.3 Interference

The equipment shall not be the source of objectionable conducted or radiated interference nor be adversely affected by conducted or radiated interference from other certificated equipment or systems installed in the aircraft. 

## 3.2.4 Physical Installation

Operation of the equipment shall not be adversely affected by aircraft maneuvering or changes in attitude encountered in normal flight operations. 

## 3.2.5 Aircraft Power Source

The voltage and voltage tolerance characteristics of the equipment shall be compatible with the aircraft power source. 

## 3.2.6 Transmission Lines

Transmission lines to the antennas shall have impedance, power handling and loss characteristics in accordance with the specifications of the equipment manufacturer. The VSWR for both bottom and top antennas as seen through the transmission lines shall be within the limits specified by the manufacturer. The delay difference between the transmission lines to the top and bottom mounted antennas shall not exceed the amount specified by the equipment manufacturer. 

## 3.2.7 Antenna Location

The horizontal distance between the top and the bottom antennas shall be not greater than 7.6 m (25 ft). Both antennas shall be mounted as near as possible to the center line of the fuselage. Antennas shall be located to minimize obstruction to their fields in the horizontal plane. 

Note: The antenna spacing is specified in order to control apparent range jitter from 
reply to reply due to antenna switching. 

## 3.2.7.1 Minimum Distance From Other Antennas

The spacing between the TCAS antenna and the Mode S transponder antenna shall be such as to provide a minimum of 20 dB of isolation between the two antennas when the peak of the azimuth beam of the TCAS antenna is steered in the direction of the Mode S transponder antenna. 

Note: If both antennas are conventional omnidirectional matched quarter-wave stubs, 
this level of isolation is obtained by providing a spacing of at least 51 cm (20 in) between the centers of the two antennas.  If either antenna is other than a conventional stub, the minimum spacing must be determined by measurement. 

## 3.2.8 Altimetry System

Note: The altimetry system performance requirement is specified for the total system.  

This includes all errors associated with the static system, the pressure transducer 
and with any quantizer used to convert the transducer output to a form suitable for TCAS or the Mode S altitude report or both. 
Figure 3-1 is a block diagram of an altimetry system and shows the outputs to the transponder and to TCAS.  All of the associated error components, listed below the system elements, must be included in the assessment of total altimetry system error.   The assessment must include consideration of both the altitude data being supplied to the TCAS unit and that provided in the transponder's altitude report. 

## 3.2.8.1 Barometric Altimetry Performance Required For Tcas Operation

Table 3-1 shows the altimetry performance requirements necessary for TCAS operation. The table specifies the error bound of the altimetry system providing altimetry data to the TCAS unit and also the error bound of the altitude report.  The error magnitude shall not exceed the error bound more than 0.3 percent of the time on a probability basis. Intermediate values are found through linear interpolation of the nearest given values. Values at altitudes beyond those given are found through linear extrapolation of the two nearest end values. 

| ALTITUDE    |   ERROR BOUND in feet  |
|-------------|------------------------|
| MSL         |                   135  |
| 5 K         |                   144  |
| 10 K        |                   156  |
| 15 K        |                   174  |
| 20 K        |                   195  |
| 25 K        |                   213  |
| 30 K        |                   234  |
| 35 K        |                   258  |
| 40 K        |                   285  |

The altimetry data used for TCAS shall be obtained from the source that provides that information for own Mode S altitude reports and shall be used at the finest quantization available within the aircraft installation.  When the altimetry data is provided to TCAS, it shall be indicated as being either finely quantized or coarsely quantized.  Altitude information that is quantized to 10 ft or less shall be considered finely quantized.  All other altitude information shall be considered coarsely quantized. 

## Notes:

1. 
Where these requirements are not met, TCAS operation may be unacceptable. 
2. 
These requirements are for altimetry performance in all flight configurations in which resolution advisories are generated including clean, maneuvering, holding and for approach and departure when above 500 feet AGL.  They do not include any consideration of flight technical error, pilot blunders or barometric setting errors.  All altimetry data used for TCAS purposes is referenced to the standard atmospheric pressure reference datum of 1013.25 millibars (29.92 inches of mercury). 
3. 
When TCAS receives finely quantized altitude data for own aircraft, it tracks this 
information with an alpha-beta tracker.  When TCAS receives coarsely quantized 
altitude data, it requantizes the data to the nearest 100 ft by rounding prior to supplying it to the nonlinear vertical tracker function (See Volume II, Collision Avoidance System Requirements Specification (CRS)). 
4. 
The altimetry system performance reflected in Table 3-1 is practically realizable with current altimetry equipment.  In addition, when two TCAS-equipped aircraft are in conflict and both aircraft a) meet the performance requirements of Table 3-1 and b) respond to their displayed resolution advisories as modeled in Vol. II, the assurance that the conflict will be successfully resolved is very high. 

## 3.2.8.2 Altimetry System Error Assessment

Note 1: The accuracy of the installed altimetry system should be determined by tests, 
evaluation of previously collected data or both, to assure that the altimetry error budget specified in subparagraph 3.2.8.1 is not exceeded. 
As a minimum, altimetry performance shall be proven to meet the requirements at one altitude within each of the following altitude bands, provided an altitude in the band falls within the approved operational ceiling of the aircraft: 

a. 500 to 2500 feet above MSL. 
b. 2500 to 10,000 feet above MSL. c. 10,000 to 18,000 feet above MSL. d. 18,000 to 30,000 feet above MSL. e. 30,000 feet and greater above MSL. 
Note 2: A recommended procedure for assessing altimetry system performance is 
described below.  This procedure differentiates between fixed and variable 
errors.  Variable errors are combined using the root-sum-square (RSS) methodology.  Fixed errors are combined arithmetically.  Next, assume that the total altimetry system error is a Gaussian random variable characterized by the accumulated variable and fixed errors. 
 
The RSS methodology provides the standard deviation of the total variable error through calculation of the square root of the sum of squares of the variable error component standard deviations.  This assumes that the variable error components are statistically uncorrelated.  In the RSS methodology, variable error components are treated differently according to their distributions.  For example, the standard deviation for each variable error component that is uniformly distributed (has a rectangular distribution) is found by dividing the total error range by the square root of 12.  The total fixed error is the arithmetic sum of the individual fixed error components. 
 
To assess altimetry system performance in terms of Table 3-1, the altimetry system error is taken as Gaussian with a standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the total variable error as determined by the RSS methodology and a mean equal to the total fixed error.  Standard calculations and/or mathematical tables then can be used to calculate the probability that the 
magnitude of the altimetry system error will exceed the error bound of Table 3-1. This probability must be less than 0.3 percent. 

## 3.2.8.3 Definitions

Note: The following paragraphs describe the error components listed under each of the 
altimetry system elements identified in Figure 3-1. 
a. Static Source: Static source errors arise from variations in the location and 
physical condition of flush ports or static probes and any errors associated with the transmission of air pressure to the transducer.  The net result is a differential between the ambient pressure outside the aircraft and that presented to the transducer.  Errors that should be considered for analysis are: 
1. Calibrated static pressure error:  This refers to the published static 
source error correction.  (If this correction is automatically applied, then 
this error need not be included in the computation of total system accuracy). This error is treated as a fixed error that shifts the mean of the altimetry system error distribution. 
2. Deviation from calibrated error:  This refers to the deviation of static 
source error from the published calibration data.  This variable error component includes the errors associated with the initial calibration measurements of static source error, production tolerances, in-service degradation of the static source and expected variations in the flight regime and gross weight of the aircraft.  If automatic correction of static pressure error is applied, then the residual errors must be included in this variable error component. 
b. Transducer:  Transducer errors result in a difference between the air 
pressure introduced to the transducer and the conditioned output provided to the quantizer.  This is a conversion error and is further defined below: 
1. Conversion error:  This refers to the resultant of those variable error 
components identified with the conversion of the input static system pressure to an appropriate output.  Conversion error is a variable error component that includes but may not be limited to:  scale errors, temperature scale errors, balance errors, threshold errors, friction errors and hysteresis errors.  In addition, the overall accuracy of the transducer is affected by the limitations in accuracy and readability of the reference barometric standard.  Determination of total conversion error must include considerations of all such errors. 
c. Quantizer:  The quantizer, as distinguished from the transducer, contributes 
additional error: 
1. Encoding error:  This variable error component is associated with the 
correspondence between the ideal quantizer transition points and the actual quantizer transition points for a specified transducer output.  The largest errors are generally associated with mechanically driven or 
servo driven quantizers yet such errors do occur in an electrical analog-to-digital conversion. 
2. Quantization error:  This variable error component results from 
digitizing analog data.  The peak quantization error is half the quantization range or interval.  The data input to TCAS may not be more coarsely 
quantized 
than 
that 
used 
in 
the 
Mode C 
report. The peak Mode C quantization error is half the 100 foot quantization range or 50 feet.  For purposes of the RSS treatment of errors, the standard deviation of quantization error, assuming a uniform distribution of aircraft altitude over the quantization range, is then 50 feet divided by the square root of three. 

## 3.2.9 Number Of Intruders Displayed (2.2.6.1.2.1.9)

The number of intruders displayed by the traffic display is fixed and cannot be modified from the cockpit.  Verify that the aircraft wiring either defines no limit to the number of displayed intruders or that the proper pins are grounded to limit the number of aircraft shown on the traffic display.  Use a test set or fixed transponders to simulate more intruders than the traffic display is configured to display and verify that only the maximum number of intruders defined for the installation are shown on the traffic display.  While the intruders are being simulated, exercise all TCAS and transponder control functions and verify that the number of displayed intruders does not change. 

## 3.2.10 Display Of Traffic On Eicas/Systems Displays (2.2.6.1.2.7.3.3)

If the traffic display is implemented on the same display used by the EICAS or SYSTEMS display, verify that:  (a) the traffic information is not shown on the primary engine display under any condition or operating configuration and (b) the traffic display function is inhibited if one or more EICAS displays is inoperative. 

## 3.2.11 Use Of Flight Director Cues For Ra Guidance (2.2.6.2.5.1)

If an installation uses flight director cues for displaying RA guidance, verify that a pilot selectable RA mode and suitable mode annunciation is provided to both pilots. 

## 3.2.12 Red Visual Alert (2.2.6.4.2)

Verify that a red visual alert is provided in the primary field of view of each pilot whenever an RA is issued. 

## 3.3 Minimum Installed Equipment Performance Requirements

When a transmission line is included as part of the installation, all minimum installed system performance requirements must be met. The installed equipment shall meet the requirements of Subsection 2.2. In order to meet these requirements, test results supplied by the equipment manufacturer may be accepted in lieu of tests performed by the equipment installer. However, performance characteristics such as interaction with other installed equipment and power sources, which cannot be tested by the equipment manufacturer, shall be tested by the installer. 

## 3.4 Test Procedures For Installed Equipment Performance

The test procedures set forth below are considered satisfactory for use in determining required equipment performance when installed in aircraft. Tests are stated in a manner that will make maximum use of test data available before installation on the aircraft. 

Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the installer. 

## 3.4.1 Conformity Inspection

Visually inspect the installed equipment to determine the use of acceptable workmanship and engineering practices. Verify that all mechanical and electrical connections have been made properly and that the equipment has been installed and located in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements. 

## 3.4.2 General Test Procedures 3.4.2.1 Equipment Function

Vary all controls used for in-flight operations through their full range to determine that the equipment is operating according to the manufacturer's instructions and that each control performs its intended function. 

## 3.4.2.2 Interference Effects (Ground Test)

With the transmitter and receiver operating, individually operate each of the other electrically operated aircraft equipments to determine that no significant conducted or radiated interference exists. Evaluate all reasonable combinations of control settings and operating modes. Operate communication and navigation equipment on at least one low-band, one high-band and one mid-band frequency. Make note of systems or modes of operation that should also be evaluated during flight. If appropriate, repeat tests using emergency power. 

Note: Electromagnetic interference tests are often conducted on all electronics systems 
in one test series, using procedures established by the aircraft manufacturer. If such tests include the TCAS equipment, no further tests are required.  
 

## 3.4.2.2.1 Suppression Bus

This test ensures that TCAS and the Mode S transponder are properly installed on the mutual suppression bus such that when transmitting, each does not cause the other to receive and process erroneous signals. Specifically: 

a. During the interval of a TCAS transmission as defined in 2.1.10.1, demonstrate that 
the TCAS transmission does not cause the Mode S transponder to generate spurious signals. 
b. During the interval of a Mode S transponder transmission as defined in 2.2.3.11 
demonstrate that the Mode S transponder transmission does not cause TCAS to generate spurious signals. 

## 3.4.2.3 Accessibility

Determine that all equipment controls and displayed data are readily accessible and easily interpreted. 

## 3.4.3 Antenna Gain Performance

These paragraphs apply to all TCAS antennas and specify antenna gain tests or antenna location criteria to ensure that the installed antenna gain is not degraded beyond an acceptable value. If a transponder suppression pattern is part of the antenna system, its gain performance must also be considered. Tests peculiar to antennas used for bearing estimation are described in paragraph 3.4.5. The purpose of the antenna gain tests is to verify that the installed antenna patterns meet the success criteria for antenna gain specified in subparagraph 3.4.3.1. This may be done using one or a combination of three distinct procedures: (a) full-scale antenna range measurements, (b) scaled model measurements or (c) theoretical calculations. Another method of validating antenna gain is to employ distance-area conditions to ensure that the location of the antenna on the aircraft does not unduly degrade its required gain performance. This procedure, which is described in subparagraph 3.4.3.5, can be used in place of or in combination with any of the other three antenna gain determination procedures. 

## 3.4.3.1 Success Criteria

At an elevation angle of zero degrees relative to the fuselage reference plane, the gain of the forward 45 degree azimuth sector of both the top and bottom antennas shall be no more than one dB below the gain of the antenna when installed on a standard ground plane as specified in subparagraph 2.2.4.7.2. The radiation pattern gain, at zero degrees elevation, shall be within three dB of the gain of the ground-plane-installed antenna over 90 percent of the remainder of its azimuthal coverage. 

Note: Where possible, it is recommended that the antenna be mounted on the forward 
fuselage, thereby minimizing blockage due to the vertical stabilizer and engine nacelles. 

## 3.4.3.2 Full-Scale Anechoic Antenna Range Measurements Of Gain

The gain characteristics of the antenna as mounted on the actual airframe may be measured directly in a calibrated anechoic antenna test range using standard controlled procedures for such measurements. Gain characteristics determined in this way require no further validation. 

Note: Anechoic range measurements are generally impractical for determining full antenna gain patterns for large aircraft. However, such techniques may be practical for qualifying certain subregions of the coverage pattern or for validating model measurements or theoretical calculations.

## 3.4.3.3 Scaled Model Measurements Of Gain 3.4.3.3.1 Aircraft Model

Aircraft models for antenna measurements are normally 1/10 to 1/40 scale. The scaling factor is dependent upon the availability of equipment, antenna scaling considerations, etc., with larger models resulting in greater accuracy. It is necessary to construct only the major structural features of the aircraft. Detailed features such as windows, turbines, etc. are not required. The outside skin should be of conductive material. Often, the fuselage and engine nacelles can be modeled from metal tubing and/or shaped metal screening; wings and stabilizers can be constructed of flat metal plates. Moving control surfaces are not required unless it is expected that they will have significant effects upon the antenna pattern. 

Notes:  

1. 
As a general rule, obstructions that subtend angles at the antenna of less than a few degrees in elevation or azimuth do not have to be modeled. However, smaller obstructions, such as other antennas, that are within a few wavelengths of the antenna under test, may have to be modeled because they can act as resonant scatterers and could have a significant effect upon the radiation pattern. 
2. 
If the swept area of propeller blades exceeds the limits given in (1) above, the blades can be worst-case modeled as a flat metal disk of radius equal to the blade length. If the radiation pattern using disks for propellers satisfies the success criteria given above, it can be assumed that the pattern modulation caused by the rotating blades will not significantly degrade the TCAS system performance. 

## 3.4.3.3.2 Model Tests

a. Mount the scaled model antenna in the center of a ground plane whose radius is equal 
in wavelengths to the ground plane used for testing the full-scale antenna (subparagraph 2.2.4.7.2). 
b. Using a calibrated anechoic antenna test range, confirm that the gain of the scaled 
antenna (including possible multiple radiating elements, splitting or combining networks, impedance and mutual coupling effects) is within two dB of the full-scale antenna gain, for all azimuth and elevation angles for which the gain of the full-scale antenna is within six dB of the peak gain. 
c. Mount the scaled model antenna on the aircraft model at the intended installation 
location. 
d. Measure the antenna gain for all azimuth angles (for top or bottom antennas). e. Confirm that the scaled antenna meets the success criteria of subparagraph 3.4.3.1. 
Note: This measurement may be performed using either analog or digital instrumentation. Azimuth data should be acquired every two degrees or less. 

## 3.4.3.4 Theoretical Calculations Of Antenna Gain

The gain characteristics of the antenna as mounted on the actual airframe may be determined indirectly by a combination of radiation pattern calculations and measurements designed to validate those calculations. When using such techniques to determine the gain of a multi-element antenna it is necessary to show that the calculations include the inherent characteristics of the antenna elements and their drivers, splitting or combining networks, and any effects due to mutual coupling between those elements. 

## 3.4.3.4.1 Validation Of Theoretical Calculations

If radiation pattern calculations are used to prove the success criteria of subparagraph 3.4.3.1, the manufacturer of the antenna must provide corroborating data demonstrating the success of the calculation technique in predicting the antenna gain on an airframe roughly similar in size and complexity to the airframe under qualification. Such data must be obtained by comparison with selected gain measurements made (a) on a full-size airframe using a calibrated ramp test antenna range or (b) on a scaled model airframe as indicated in subparagraph 3.4.3.3. 

## 3.4.3.5 Antenna Location Using Distance-Area Calculations

The extent to which the antenna installation successfully minimizes obstructions in the horizontal plane and minimizes effects of reflecting objects may be judged by the distances to such objects and their sizes. If these distances and sizes satisfy the condition given here, then the antenna installation may be considered to be validated with regard to antenna gain. The condition is: For a target aircraft at zero degree elevation angle and at an azimuth bearing between -90 degrees and +90 degrees, 

$$\frac{A_{1}^{2}}{\lambda^{2}D_{1}^{2}}+\sum\frac{A_{2}^{2}G_{2}^{\prime}}{\lambda^{2}D_{2}^{2}G_{2}}+\sum\frac{A_{3}G_{3}^{\prime}}{4\pi D_{3}^{2}G_{3}}<0.02$$
where =0.9 ft. is the free-space wavelength at 1090 MHz. The first term is applicable only if there is a metallic obstruction between the target and the TCAS antenna. The distance in feet to the obstruction is denoted D1, and the area in ft2 of the obstruction projected in the direction of the TCAS antenna is denoted A1. The second term is a summation over flat metallic reflectors, if any, that are oriented so as to cause a specular reflection between the TCAS antenna and the target. The distance in feet to the reflector is denoted D2, the area in ft2 of the reflector projected in the direction of the TCAS 
antenna is denoted A2, the antenna gain in the direction of the reflector is denoted G2 and is dimensionless (i.e., gain in dB = 10 log G2), and the antenna gain in the direction of the target is denoted G2 and is dimensionless. The third term is a summation over all other metallic objects that may cause reflections between the TCAS antenna and the target.  The parameters D3, A3, G3, and G3 have the same meanings as in the second term. 

In the case of other aircraft antennas in view of the TCAS antenna, a minimum value A=0.22 ft2 is to be used if the actual area is smaller than 0.22 ft2.

## 3.4.4 Certification Flight Test Procedures

The bench tests in Subsection 2.4 of this document are designed to verify TCAS II performance under carefully controlled conditions.  Flight tests (3.4.4.1, 3.4.4.2, and 
3.4.4.3) shall be performed to completely validate TCAS II surveillance and coordination designs.  The tests shall be accomplished with all certifiable antenna configurations unless the applicant can demonstrate that a worst-case configuration has been evaluated. Since the functions to be evaluated by these tests are sufficiently independent of installation factors such as aircraft type and specific antenna location, these flight tests can be carried out using a smaller non-carrier aircraft.  

## 3.4.4.1 Mode C Surveillance Flight Tests

a. A flight test under environmentally stressful conditions shall be performed to provide 
the data for a complete TCAS II Mode C surveillance design validation.  This environment includes the combined effects of multipath interference, synchronous garbling, and fruit interference as a result of high aircraft density, and ground interrogator interference from multiple ground interrogators. 
b. Flight testing shall be accomplished in an area of high Mode C density such as the 
Los Angeles basin area, particularly in the vicinity of the Long Beach and Santa Ana airports, since previous tests of TCAS II have shown that this area provides the stressful environment necessary for proper evaluation of TCAS II Mode C surveillance.  Flight paths shall include a representative mixture of the following conditions: 
1. Over-land flights at altitudes between 3000 and 6000 feet; 2. Over-water flights at altitudes between 3000 and 6000 feet for a duration that is 
at least 20% of the total required flight duration defined in d. below; and 
3. Approach and departure flights to Long Beach and Santa Ana airports. 
c. The flight test shall be conducted on weekends between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. 
when the ground visibility is greater than 5 NM with a ceiling of at least 10,000 feet to ensure the highest peak traffic densities.  Another location and/or time may be proposed by the applicant and will be considered as a suitable alternative to the Los Angeles area if the applicant can demonstrate that the TCAS II surveillance test was conducted in an average density of at least 0.1 transponder-equipped aircraft per sq. NM and a peak density of at least 0.2 transponder-equipped aircraft per sq. NM. Density is defined as the number of other transponder-equipped aircraft within 5 NM of the TCAS II test aircraft divided by the area of a circle of 5 NM radius.  Eight real aircraft target tracks occurring simultaneously within 5 NM of the TCAS II test aircraft is equivalent to a density of 0.1 transponder-equipped aircraft per sq. NM. The alternative location must also contain a minimum of three civil or military secondary surveillance radars located within 30 NM of the TCAS II aircraft in order to provide an interference environment similar to the Los Angeles area.   
d. Flight testing shall be of sufficient duration to record at least 10,000 seconds of target 
track reports on targets-of-interest.  The data shall be accumulated during a continuous time period not exceeding 3 hours.  A target-of-interest is defined as any target-of-opportunity that is: 
1. Within a 5 NM range of TCAS in the forward quadrant, 
2. Within a 3.5 NM range of TCAS in the right and left quadrants, 3. Within a 2 NM range of TCAS in the aft quadrant, 
4. Within ±5 deg. elevation of TCAS, and 5. Altitude reporting and airborne. 
e. The number of actual flight hours necessary to collect 10,000 track-seconds of data 
depends on the aircraft density.  For example, a one hour recording in the Los Angeles basin which has a demonstrated minimum average density of 0.1 aircraft per sq. NM would result in approximately 10,000 track-seconds of data on targets-ofinterest.  It is expected that the applicant will have prior knowledge of the density conditions and will select the flight time necessary to record the appropriate amount of data. 
f. The recorded data shall include as a minimum all raw reply reports prior to any 
duplicate reply elimination, reply merging, reply correlation, etc., processed surveillance track reports that have been declared established, traffic and resolution advisories, internal processor clock, and time-of-day.  Recorded flight data shall be provided to the appropriate certification authority to permit an independent assessment of surveillance performance in accordance with paragraph g. below. Details concerning the format and data types of the data to be provided shall be coordinated with the appropriate certification authority in a timely manner.  Sixty days or more in advance of the availability of the recorded flight data is recommended.  
g. The applicant shall perform at least the following specific post-flight data analyses: 
1. Identify all recorded surveillance target track reports that are established and that 
satisfy the criteria for a target-of-interest. 
2. Identify those established target-of-interest track reports that are associated with 
real aircraft. 
3. Determine the total number of aircraft-seconds associated with real aircraft and 
the total number of true track-seconds (i.e., those update intervals in which an established surveillance track report was either coasted or updated with a valid reply) associated with real aircraft. 
4. Determine the TCAS II surveillance track probability as the ratio of the total 
number of true track-seconds associated with real aircraft to the total number of aircraft-seconds associated with real aircraft. 
5. Identify those established target-of-interest track reports that are not associated 
with real aircraft. 
6. Determine the total number of track-seconds that are not associated with real 
aircraft.  These are classified as false track-seconds. 
7. Determine the TCAS false track probability as the ratio of the total number of 
false track-seconds to the total number of aircraft-seconds associated with real aircraft. 
h. The data shall also be examined to determine whether any single event such as 
crossing targets, multipath-induced image targets, the inability to maintain track at closest-point-of-approach, or a synchronously garbled target dominates the false track rate or the rate at which real targets are dropped.  If the false tracks or dropped tracks are due mostly to one type of interference mechanism or geometric condition, it could indicate a design deficiency in the area even though the overall surveillance track probability and false track ratio are acceptable.  If this condition exists, the applicant shall present this information and provide an evaluation summary that indicates an acceptable design.  
i. 
The applicant shall present sufficient data in the form of reply plots, surveillance track plots, printouts, tabulations, etc., to substantiate that the Mode C surveillance performance on targets-of-interest, measured as a result of the surveillance flight test, meets or exceeds the following acceptance criteria: 
1. TCAS surveillance probability for targets-of-interest > 95% 2. TCAS false track rate for targets-of-interest < 1.2%. 
The applicant shall also present an evaluation summary on any single dominant failure event as discussed in h. above. 

## 3.4.4.2 Mode S Surveillance Flight Tests

a. A flight test under environmentally stressful conditions shall be performed to provide 
the data for a complete TCAS II Mode S surveillance design validation.  This environment includes the combined effects of fruit interference as a result of high aircraft density and ground interrogator interference from multiple ground interrogators. 
b. Flight testing shall be accomplished in an area of high Mode S density such as 
Chicago or New York. Previous tests of TCAS have shown that these areas provide the most stressful environment necessary for evaluation of TCAS Mode S surveillance. Chicago has exhibited a combined air and ground average density of 0.1 and New York 0.12. Chicago has exhibited a maximum NTA of 103 and New York 151. Either Chicago or New York are considered adequate to test the Mode S surveillance, however, New York will provide the most severe combined average density and NTA environment. The most effective flight paths have proven to be orbital flights of 5 NM radius near the major airport terminal, JFK in New York and O'Hare in Chicago.  
 

c. The flight test shall be conducted at an altitude less than 10,000 feet during peak 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
traffic periods when the ground visibility is greater than 10 NM with a ceiling of at least 11,000 feet to ensure the highest peak traffic densities. Other locations may be proposed by the applicant and will be considered as a suitable alternative to the above areas if the applicant can demonstrate that the TCAS surveillance test was conducted in an environment whose combined average density of transponder-equipped aircraft 
equals or exceeds those of New York or Chicago and indicates a continuous minimum NTA count of 75. Density is defined as the number of other transponderequipped aircraft within 10 NM of the TCAS test aircraft divided by the area of a circle of 10 NM radius. Thirty-one real aircraft targets occurring simultaneously within 10 NM of the TCAS test aircraft is equivalent to a density of 0.1 transponderequipped aircraft per sq NM. Alternate locations must also contain a minimum of three civil ATC or military secondary surveillance radars located within 30 NM of the TCAS aircraft in order to provide an interference environment similar to the above areas.  
Note: Although New York and Chicago are the highest known densities, future development or test flights may define areas of greater density. If this occurs, for purposes of maximum system stress, the Mode S Surveillance Flight should be flown in these newly defined areas.  

d. Density estimates shall be obtained during a flight test of a minimum duration of 45 
minutes. Track analysis data shall be obtained during the 45 minute flight and will contain an accumulation of 5,000 to 8,000 seconds of target track reports on targetsof-interest. More than 8,000 track seconds need not be analyzed. However, an aircraft density estimate for at least 45 minutes shall be provided. A target-of-interest is defined as any target-of-opportunity that is:   
1. Within 10 NM of TCAS 2. Within ±10 degrees elevation of TCAS, and 3. Altitude reporting and airborne 
It is expected that the applicant will have prior knowledge of the density conditions in the flight area and will select the flight time that will provide the maximum density.  

e. The recorded data shall include as a minimum all raw reply reports prior to reply 
correlation, processed surveillance track reports that have been declared established, traffic and resolution advisories, internal processor clock, and time-of-day.  Recorded 
flight data shall be provided to the FAA to permit an independent assessment of 
surveillance performance in accordance with paragraph "f" below.  Details concerning the format and data types of the data to be provided shall be coordinated with the FAA in a timely manner.  Sixty days or more in advance of the availability of the recorded flight data is recommended.  
f. The applicant shall perform at least the following specific post-flight data analyses: 
1. Identify all recorded surveillance target track reports that are established and that 
satisfy the criteria for a target-of-interest. 
2. Identify those established target-of-interest track reports that are associated with 
real aircraft. 
3. Determine the total number of aircraft-seconds associated with real aircraft and 
the total number of true track-seconds (i.e., those update intervals in which an established surveillance track report was either coasted or updated with a valid reply) associated with real aircraft. 
4. Determine the TCAS II surveillance track probability as the ratio of the total 
number of true track-seconds associated with real aircraft to the total number of aircraft-seconds associated with real aircraft. 
5. Identify those established target-of-interest track reports that are not associated 
with real aircraft. 
6. Determine the total number of track-seconds that are not associated with real 
aircraft.  These are classified as false track-seconds. 
7. Determine the TCAS false track probability as the ratio of the total number of 
false track-seconds to the total number of aircraft-seconds associated with real aircraft. 
g. The applicant shall present sufficient data in the form of reply plots, surveillance 
track plots, printouts, tabulations, etc., to substantiate that the Mode S surveillance performance on targets-of-interest, measured as a result of the surveillance flight test, meets or exceeds the following acceptance criteria: 
1. TCAS surveillance probability for targets-of-interest > 95% 2. TCAS false track rate for targets-of-interest = 0%. 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 3.4.4.3 Coordination Flight Tests

a. Planned TCAS II-to-TCAS II coordination encounters shall be performed in order to 
evaluate the reliability of the overall air-to-air coordination data link for installed TCAS II and Mode S transponder equipments.   
b. The encounters shall be flown at 3,000 feet over calm water in order to increase the 
likelihood of multipath and in configurations that maximize the times during which an RA is present and coordination is taking place.  Examples of such encounters are tail chases and side-by-side flights.  If the lateral separation necessary for multipath is larger than the separation that maintains the RA, the aircraft can periodically turn in towards each other during side-by-side flights in order to continually initiate RAs.   
c. The encounters shall be flown so as to involve a reasonable mix of the four quadrants 
of the TCAS II and transponder antennas.   
d. Each TCAS II aircraft shall have sufficient recording capability to record the replies 
received in response to coordination interrogations.  The recorded data shall include at least 2,000 TCAS coordination scans.  
e. The criteria for acceptable performance is as follows: 
1. The probability of a single scan coordination link dropout shall be no greater than 
0.1%. 
2. There shall be no coordination link dropouts that exceed one scan in duration. 

## 3.4.5 Bearing Estimation Tests

The purpose of these tests is to determine those azimuthal regions, if any, where the installed bearing estimation antenna and all associated bearing estimation subsystems fail to meet the success criteria for bearing estimation specified in subparagraph 3.4.5.1. This may be done using one or a combination of four distinct procedures: (a) antenna range measurements, (b) airborne measurements, (c) scaled-modeled measurements or (d) theoretical calculations. Procedures (b), (c) and (d) require additional data to corroborate the validity and calibration accuracy of the procedure. 

## 3.4.5.1 Success Criteria For Bearing Estimation Measurements

The test shall identify those azimuthal regions in which the bearing estimation system in the absence of external sources of interference or multipath, fails to provide target bearing estimation accuracy sufficient to support a pilot traffic advisory service. Specifically, the test shall identify all clock-position sectors within which the peak bearing estimation error for a Mode S reply persistently exceeds 30 degrees at zero degrees elevation relative to the fuselage reference plane. The clock position shall be identified if the error exceeds the stated bound at any azimuth angle within its sector. A transponder is used as the calibration source in the range or airborne measurements to enable the TCAS equipment to operate in its normal manner when making reply bearing estimates. A Mode S transponder target is used rather than an ATCRBS transponder to avoid ATCRBS synchronous garble effects, to provide positive target identification and to minimize the effects of thermal noise on the measurement. 

## 3.4.5.2 Antenna Range Measurements Of Bearing Accuracy

Bearing estimation accuracy for the antenna and bearing estimation system as mounted on the actual airframe may be measured using a calibrated antenna range that allows precise echo-controlled, far-field, angle-of-arrival measurements over a small range of positive and negative elevation angles and over 360 degrees in azimuth. 

a. The location, the direction and the directivity of the test target antenna must be 
chosen to ensure that ground reflections or multipath reflections from structures or other aircraft near enough in range to provide overlapping signals are attenuated by at least 20 dB relative to the direct test signal.  Figure 3-2 illustrates some test geometry considerations. The site should also be monitored carefully during the test to ensure that specular reflections from moving aircraft or ground vehicles do not contaminate the test results. 
b. The distance of the test target from the aircraft shall be such that the maximum 
dimensions of the aircraft subtend an angle of less than 10 degrees at the test target. The pitch attitude of the aircraft shall be such that the fuselage reference plane is within five degrees of horizontal. 
c. Point the aircraft toward the target transponder using an appropriate precise means of 
mechanical or visual bearing calibration. Interrogate the target transponder using the normal TCAS surveillance process. Record the target transponder relative bearing as indicated on the plan position display of traffic advisory information, or other special test display. 
Note: Any bearing bias error measured using procedures of Subsection 2.4 should be subtracted from the indicated relative bearing. 

d. Rotate the aircraft one clock position (30 degrees) and repeat the measurement. 
Repeat the measurement for each clock position. 
 

## 3.4.5.3 Airborne Measurements Of Bearing Accuracy

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Bearing estimation accuracy may optionally be measured by means of a flight test. The following suggested procedure could be followed in a region of low traffic density, but any other test that provides equivalent data would be acceptable. A target aircraft equipped with a Mode S transponder may be used for calibration of bearing estimation accuracy. Such measurements are most conveniently made when the target aircraft and the TCAS aircraft under calibration have equal speed capability and fly at relatively high altitude for maximum immunity to multipath. The flight paths of the two aircraft are chosen to provide extended periods of constant target bearing. This is most conveniently accomplished at bearing angles of 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees. However, calibration at each clock position requires a means of optical calibration (visual sighting) of the true bearing angle from the cockpits of both aircraft. 

Calibration of angles other than the four cardinal bearings is best accomplished by means of slow overtaking encounters. (The bearing angle must change sufficiently slowly so that tracker lag does not introduce significant additional errors). Manual readout of the bearing estimate may be accomplished directly from a plan position display of traffic advisory information. Alternatively, the bearing estimates may be automatically recorded or may be read from a special test display. An alternative method for flight test calibration employs a Mode S transponder mounted on a building or tower. Bearing measurements may be calibrated by visual sighting or by means of conventional navigational techniques as the TCAS aircraft flies by the transponder. 

## 3.4.5.4 Scaled Model Measurements Of Bearing Accuracy 3.4.5.4.1 Aircraft Model

The aircraft modeling criteria given in subparagraph 3.4.3.3.1 are adequate to test for the effects of the aircraft structure upon the bearing estimation accuracy. 

## 3.4.5.4.2 Antenna Model

The scaled model antenna should include the inherent characteristics of the antenna elements and their drivers, splitting or combining networks and any effects due to mutual coupling between the elements. Model measurements should be made at sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios to eliminate the effects of noise on the accuracy of the bearing estimates. 

## 3.4.5.4.3 Model Tests

These tests are similar to the tests of subparagraph 3.4.3.3.2 but with additional bearing measurement requirements. 

a. Mount the scaled model antenna in the center of a ground plane whose radius is equal 
in wavelengths to the ground plane used for testing the full-scale antenna. 
b. Using a calibrated anechoic antenna test range, confirm that, on the ground plane, the 
bearing estimates are within 10 degrees of the full-scale antenna estimates for azimuth angles from zero to 360 degrees and elevation angles from -15 to +20 degrees. 
c. Mount the scaled model antenna on the aircraft model at the intended installation 
location. 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

d. Measure the antenna bearing estimates for elevation angles from -15 to +20 degrees 
and for all azimuth angles. 
Note: This measurement can be performed using either analog or digital instrumentation. Azimuth data should be acquired every two degrees or less. 

Elevation angle data should be acquired in increments of five degrees or less. 

## 3.4.5.5 Theoretical Calculations Of Bearing Accuracy

The bearing estimation accuracy of the antenna as mounted on the actual airframe may be determined indirectly by a combination of radiation pattern calculations and measurements designed to validate those calculations. When using such techniques to determine the bearing accuracy of a multi-element antenna, it is necessary to show that the calculations include the inherent characteristics of the antenna elements and their drivers, splitting or combining networks and any effects due to mutual coupling between those elements. 

## 3.4.5.5.1 Validation Of Theoretical Calculations Of Bearing Accuracy

If radiation pattern calculations are used to determine installed bearing estimation accuracy, the manufacturer of the antenna must provide corroborating data demonstrating the success of the calculation technique in predicting the bearing estimates on an airframe roughly similar in size and complexity to the airframe under qualification. Such data must be obtained by comparison with selected bearing measurements made (a) on a full-size airframe on an antenna range or (b) on a scaled model airframe as indicated in subparagraph 3.4.5.4.

## Appendix A: Surveillance Procedures A.1 Interference Limiting Procedure

The following describes one possible implementation of an interference limiting procedure.  It varies the system parameters appearing in inequalities (1), (2), and (3) of 
2.2.3.6.1 to maximize and maintain approximate equality between the estimated surveillance ranges for Mode S and ATCRBS targets. In evaluating these inequalities 8-second averages of the Mode S parameters are used, and current or anticipated values of the ATCRBS parameters are used. The procedure is illustrated in the flowchart of Figure A-1.  Depending on the specific whisper-shout sequence in use, the first step in the control process is to reduce either the number of whisper-shout steps or the whisper-shout power level of the sequence tentatively scheduled for use during the present scan if either: 

a. Inequality (3) is violated, or 
b. Inequality (1) or (2) is violated and the Mode S surveillance range of the last scan 
does not exceed the ATCRBS surveillance range that would result from use of the scheduled whisper-shout sequence. 
If the high resolution whisper-shout sequence is in use, whisper-shout steps for an airborne TCAS are eliminated from that sequence in the order dictated by the limiting priority in paragraph 2.2.4.5.4.1.2 and the number of steps eliminated is just large enough to insure that neither of the above conditions is satisfied.  If the minimum basic whispershout sequence or the single interrogation is in use, the power of each of the whispershout steps or the single interrogation in a directional beam for an airborne TCAS is reduced in 1-dB steps with the order of beams dictated by the limiting priority in paragraph 2.2.4.5.4.1.1 and 2.2.4.5.4.1.4 and the amount of power reduction is just large enough to insure that neither of the above conditions is satisfied.  The value of the number of whisper-shout steps for a high resolution sequence or the power level of the largest step for the minimum basic whisper-shout sequence or the single interrogation tentatively scheduled for use is initialized at the number used on the last scan. For a TCAS on the ground, the reduction or elimination of whisper-shout steps is modified from the process used for airborne TCAS such that steps are first eliminated or reduced in the forward beam until it matches the sequence in the side beams and then the steps in the forward and side beams are eliminated or reduced until they match the sequence in the rear beam. Further reduction is accomplished by sequentially eliminating or reducing steps in all beams. The relative magnitudes of the Mode S and ATCRBS surveillance ranges are determined from the estimated effective radiated power (ERP) seen by targets with Mode S and ATCRBS transponders located directly ahead of the TCAS aircraft.  The ERP in a given direction is determined by the product of the power input to the antenna, and the antenna pattern gain in that direction.  If the transponder sensitivities were identical, the Mode S range would be more or less than the ATCRBS range according to whether the Mode S transmitted power was more or less than the ATCRBS transmitted power.  Since ATCRBS transponders may have somewhat lower sensitivities than Mode S transponders, the ATCRBS range is assumed to be greater than the Mode S range if, and only if, the ATCRBS power exceeds the Mode S power by 3 dB. 

 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The second step in the controlling process is to reduce the Mode S interrogation power for acquisition by 1 dB, and to increase the MTL for Mode S squitter listening by 1 dB from the values last used, if: 

c. Inequality (1) or (2) is violated and the Mode S surveillance range of the last scan 
exceeds the ATCRBS surveillance range that would result from use of the scheduled whisper-shout sequence. 
Once such a change has been made the only change allowed during the ensuing 8 seconds is a reduction in the number of whisper-shout steps if such is needed to satisfy Inequality (3).  This 8-second freeze allows the effect of the Mode S changes to become apparent since the 8-second averages used in Inequalities (1) and (2) then will be determined by the behavior of the system since the change. The third step is to add a whisper-shout step to those tentatively scheduled if using the high resolution sequence or add 1 dB to each tentatively scheduled level in a beam if using the minimum basic whisper-shout sequence or the single interrogation, when it is not prevented by an 8-second freeze, and the following conditions are satisfied: 

d. Inequalities (1), (2), and (3) are satisfied and will continue to be satisfied after step e. 
is added, and 
e. The Mode S surveillance range of the last scan exceeds the ATCRBS surveillance 
range that would result from use of the scheduled sequence and, 
As many steps are added as possible without violating d., or e. above. Finally, if condition d. above is satisfied, but condition e. is not, an estimate is made of the effects of increasing the Mode S interrogation power for acquisition by 1 dB and reducing the MTL for Mode S squitters/fruit by 1 dB.  If the estimate indicates that Inequalities (1) and (2) will not continue to be satisfied the 1 dB change is not made.  If the estimate indicates that they will continue to be satisfied, the 1 dB change is made and no further changes in either the ATCRBS or Mode S parameters are made for the ensuing 8 seconds, except as described in connection with condition c. 

## A.2 Rejection Of Reply Link Interference

One possible means of rejecting low level multipath signals is to use the dynamic minimum trigger level (DMTL) function described below.  Variable receiver thresholds have usually been avoided in ATCRBS reply processors because they tend to discriminate against weak replies.  However, when used in conjunction with the minimum required whisper-shout technique (2.2.4.5.4.1.1), this disadvantage of dynamic thresholding is largely overcome.   

## Atcrbs Reply Reception

When listening or ATCRBS replies and upon receipt of the first pulse of an ATCRBS reply of amplitude A, when A exceeds MTL+13 dB, the receiver threshold is increased to A-9 dB ±1 dB for a period of not less than 21 microseconds following the leading edge of the first reply pulse and is recovered in not more than 26 microseconds.  The receiver threshold should at no time exceed A-8 dB except for possible overshoot during the first microsecond following the desensitizing pulse.   
If A is less than MTL+11 dB, there is no need to raise the threshold.   

## Mode S Squitters And Reply Reception

When listening for Mode S squitters or replies and upon receipt of the first pulse of a Mode S transponder squitter or interrogation reply of amplitude A, where A exceeds MTL+10 dB, the receiver threshold is increased to A-6 dB ±1 dB for a period of not less than 5 microseconds following the leading edge of the first reply pulse and is recovered in not more than 8 microseconds, unless a valid or qualifying preamble is received (2.2.4.4.2.2), in which case the threshold is held at A-6 dB ±1 dB for a period of not less than 115 microseconds and is recovered in not more than 120 microseconds.  The receiver threshold should at no time exceed A-5 dB except for possible overshoot during the first microsecond following the desensitizing pulse.  If A is less than MTL+8 dB, there is no need to raise the threshold. The length of a Mode S reply cannot be determined with certainty by the DMTL system. Therefore, the Mode S DMTL extends for the duration of the long Mode S reply.   

## A.3 Mode S Error Correction

The following is an algorithm for error detection and correction of Mode S squitter replies (DF=11 and DF=17) and Mode S replies to addressed interrogations, (DF=0 and DF=16).  This algorithm may be implemented in hardware or software.  The configuration of the implementation may be inferred from the details of the corresponding figures. Message Decoding - The function of message decoding is to first check the bit decision sequence for errors by means of a parity check, and if errors are detected, to use the confidence bit sequence to attempt to locate a burst error pattern spanning up to 24 bit decisions that would correct the message. The inputs to the message decoder are: 

a. Bit decision sequence (Di) b. Confidence bit sequence (Ci). 
c. Reply length indicator bit (L). 
d. Expected address (Ai, where i=1…24). 
The derivation of the Bit Decision and the Confidence Bit Sequences is described in 2.2.4.4.2.2c. 

 
The decoder outputs are: 
 

a. Error correction enable bit, m (1 bit). b. The decoded message, if m=1, (32 or 88 bits). 
Message decoding is treated in three stages; error detection, error pattern location, and error correction. 

Error Detector - The primary function of the error detection is to compute a 24-bit error syndrome.  This computation is accomplished in two steps.  First, the decoded address is calculated from the sequence of bit decisions.  Then the syndrome is obtained by a comparison of the decoded address with the expected address.  If the two addresses agree, then the error syndrome is zero (i.e., all component bits are zero), and the decoded message will ultimately be obtained directly from the bit decision sequence. Initial Conditions for Error Detector - The error detector and initial conditions are shown in Figure A-2.  The DB register need not be initialized and is used to store the bit decision sequence as it is produced by the bit processor.  The CB register is used to store the confidence bit sequence as it is produced by the bit processor and is initialized by setting the 56 stages closest to the input to ONE.  The A register, used to determine the decoded address Ai, i=1…24, is initialized by resetting all 24 stages to ZERO. 

Confidence Test - As the confidence bits are being loaded into the CB register, a confidence test maintains a count of the number of high-confidence bits contained in the 24 elements closest to the input side of the register.  (Note: The count is initialized to 24.) If the counter falls below 12 while the CB register is being loaded, the correction disable bit is set to ONE.  Correction of an erroneous message is not allowed if the correction disable bit has been set. Final Conditions of Error Detector - The bit processor produces sequentially the bit decision sequence in the order D1, D2, …, DI and the confidence bit sequence in the order C1, C2, …, CI, with Ci and Di made available to the message decoder together after the ith bit interval has been processed.  The lengths of these sequences (I) is determined by the message length indicator bit L (I=56 for L=0, I=112 for L=1.)  The bit decision sequence is shifted into the DB register and the A register as each bit decision is produced.  The confidence bit sequence is shifted into the CB register and checked by the confidence test as each bit decision is produced.  The state of the error detector immediately after the last bit decision and confidence bit is entered into the message decoder is as shown in Figure A-3.  At this instant, the decoded address A1…A24 has been compared bit-by-bit with the expected address 
1
A …
24
A
to produce, by parallel Modulo 2 addition, the 24-bit error syndrome denoted S1…S24. 

Error Detection Criterion - If the correction disable bit has been set after the error syndrome has been calculated, and the error syndrome is not all zeroes, error correction is not attempted.  If the correction disable bit is set and the error syndrome is all zeroes, the message is accepted.  If the correction disable bit is not set, error correction will be attempted.  The case in which the error syndrome is all zeroes is taken as an entirely correct bit decision sequence, but is treated as a correctable error pattern in which no bit decisions are actually corrected. Error Location - The second stage of message decoding attempts to locate a correctable error burst pattern in the bit decision sequence generated by the message bit processor. This function requires the error syndrome and the confidence bit sequence. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
When the correction disable bit is false, and when all of the erroneous bit decisions are confined within a segment of the bit decision sequence spanning no more than 24 bits, and when none of the errors are associated with a high-confidence bit, the error pattern is a correctable error pattern.  In every instance of a correctable error pattern, the error correction circuit will generate a decoded message. The error pattern locating function attempts to locate erroneous bit decisions by performing logical operations on the error syndrome and confidence bit sequence.  If a correctable error pattern is located, a bit signifying such an occurrence is set. When set, this bit shall allow the corrections indicated by the error pattern to be made in the decision sequence by the error pattern correction function.  If this bit, denoted by m and called the correction enable bit, has not been set after a specified number of operations have been performed, the erroneous bit decisions cannot be located by the error location function. Whenever the calculated address agrees with the expected address, the syndrome is zero and, with very high probability, every bit in the decision sequence is correct.  As a result of the syndrome being zero, the error location function will immediately find a correctable error pattern consisting of 24 zeroes.  The correction enable bit will be set even though the error pattern has no effect on the bit decision sequence. The final value of the correction enable bit is used to indicate the presence or absence of a decoded message. Initialization of Error Pattern Location Function - The error location function is initialized immediately after the error syndrome is generated by the error detector.  The error location function requires three loading steps and is shown in Figure A-4. 

a. The E register is loaded by a transfer of the error syndrome S1…S24. b. The M register is loaded by a transfer of the bit decision sequence D1…DI. c. The L register is loaded by a transfer of the confidence bit sequence C1…CI, unless 
the correction disable bit is set, whereupon the loading of the L register is inhibited. The loading of the M and L registers is done in such a way as to permit digits to be shifted out of these registers in the reverse of the order in which they were received from the message bit processor. 
Correctable Error Pattern Location - Once initialized, the error location function (E, L, and M registers) is shifted simultaneously, as rapidly as practical to free the function for the next reply.  (The error location function should complete the operation while the error detector is being loaded with data from the next reply.)  The number of shifts performed is determined by the reply length indicator bit L (L=0 implies 56 shifts, L=1 implies 112 shifts.)  The input to the L register continues to enter ONE in this register while the registers are being shifted.  If, after the specified number of shifts, no correctable error pattern has been located, the registers are deactivated. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The 24-bit E register generates a sequence of possible burst error patterns as it is being shifted, each of which would result in the observed error syndrome.  After initialization, the E register contains a burst error pattern (which is the error syndrome itself) corresponding to the last 24 bits of the bit decision sequence. 

After j shifts, the E register contains a burst error pattern, which, if located in bits DI-j-23 through DI-j, would result in the observed error syndrome.  That is, every ONE in the E 
register corresponds to a bit decision that is presumed to be in error, while every ZERO in the E register corresponds to a bit decision that is presumed to be correct.  The E and L 
registers are shifted together so that the possible burst error patterns may be compared with the proper 24-bit segment of the confidence bit sequence. If a burst error pattern is found in which all error locations (ONEs in the E register) align with low confidence bit positions (ZEROs in the L register), a correctable error pattern has been located and the correction enable bit m will be set to ONE (Figure A-5). The correction enable bit results in activation of the error pattern correction function.  Note that the bit values in the L register that correspond to ZEROs in the E register have no effect on error pattern location. Error Correction - Immediately after the correction enable bit has been set to ONE (before the next shift of the E, L and M registers), the error correction function is enabled to combine bit-by-bit the contents of the E register with the contents of the M register as shown in Figure A-6.  The next 24 shifts of the E and M registers then result in the error pattern being shifted out of the E register (and replaced by ZEROs), causing those bit decisions that are combined (sum Modulo 2) with ONEs in the error pattern to be changed.  The error location function has no effect after the error pattern is shifted out of the E register, and so it is not necessary to disable this function.  After the prescribed total number of shifts have been carried out, the final stage of the error correction function is as shown in Figure A-7. 

## A.4 Determination Of Synchronous Garble Potential

The detection and determination of synchronous garble potential is monitored at the surveillance reply (Low Confidence Bit Measurement), track (Intruder Range Track Comparison), and beam (Mode C Aircraft Density Measurement) levels.  The following algorithms describe an acceptable means for monitoring synchronous garble potential at the reply and track levels. 

## Low Confidence Bit Measurement

The Low Confidence Bit Measurement is added to the ATCRBS surveillance function prior to the formation of the reply buffer where redundant replies are merged.  In the Low Confidence Bit Measurement, ATCRBS replies from the current and the previous scan are tested for the presence of low confidence bits. A flowchart of the measurement algorithm is shown in Figure A-8, and assumes that replies are already arranged in increasing range order prior to the formation of the reply buffer.  A list is created containing data for those replies that indicate low confidence bit settings in the altitude code.  Each element in this list contains the following associated reply information: 

a. reply range b. antenna (top or bottom) 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
 

c. beam (front, back, right, left, or omni) 
This list is retained for use during the current scan and the next scan. 

For each directional beam, a sequential comparison is made between each element in the previous scan list and the element from the current scan list.  Starting with the first element in the previous scan list, rp, the following item is checked: 

a. rp range is less than 14 NM in the forward beam, 8.8 NM in the side beams or 5.0 
NM in the aft beam 
If (a) is true, then the comparison starts for each element in the current scan list, rc, with the following checks: 

a. rc is in same beam as rp 
b. rc is within range of rp ±0.5 NM 
If both of the above are true then the flag, C1, is set indicating that the Low Confidence Bit Measurement has found a possible synchronous garble situation in this beam.  If not true, the comparison continues with each remaining element in the current scan list until one of the following is true: 

a. rc range is greater than rp + 0.5 NM. b. rc range is greater than 14 NM in the forward beam, 8.8 NM in the side beams or 5.0 
NM in the aft beam  
c. there are no more elements in the list 
If any of the above are true, then the process moves to the next reply in the previous scan list, and the comparison is repeated until one of the following is true: 

a. rp range is greater than 14 NM in the forward beam, 8.8 NM in the side beams or 5.0 
NM in the aft beam  
b. there are no more elements in the list 

## Intruder Range Track Comparison

The Intruder Range Track Comparison is appended to the ATCRBS surveillance function.  The Intruder Range Track Comparison is implemented in a similar fashion as the Low Confidence Bit measurement, except tracks within the same list are compared. Figure A-9 provides the process flow diagram and assumes that the tracks are arranged in increasing range order. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The range of the first track in the list (trk1) is initially verified to be less than the current maximum reliable surveillance range in order to continue.  If this is true, a comparison of the range of each of the following tracks (trk2) is performed by checking: 

a. trk1 is in same beam as trk2 
b. trk2 is within range of trk1 ±1.7 NM. 
If all of the above are true then the flag, Tr, is set indicating that the Intruder Range Track Comparison has found a possible synchronous garble situation in this beam.  If not true, this comparison continues with each track in the list until one of the following is true: 

a. trk2 range is greater than trk1 + 1.7 NM. b. trk2 range is greater than maximum reliable surveillance range 
c. there are no more tracks in the list 
If any of the above are true, then the process moves to the next track in the list, and the comparison is repeated until one of the following is true: 

a. trk1 range is greater than maximum reliable surveillance range 
b. there are no more tracks in the list 

## A.5 Mode C Track Initiation

The following rules for assessing correlation of reply code bits and determining the initial altitude track code estimate for a target have been used successfully in experimental TCAS equipment (see Ref. F.): Three replies correlate only if: 

a. All eight of their D, A and B code pulses agree, or b. Seven of their D, A, and B code pulses agree and at least one of their C code pulses 
agree 
A test for code agreement among the three replies is made individually for each of the reply code pulse positions.  The initial test is based on the presence of code pulses alone. Agreement occurs for a given reply code pulse position if all three replies are detected with a ONE in that position or all three replies are detected with a ZERO in that position. The confidence associated with those pulse detections does not affect agreement.  If agreement exists, the code estimate for that pulse position is set to the detected value. When agreement among the three replies does not occur for a given reply code pulse position, the initial track pulse code estimate for that position is based on the values of the individual pulse codes and the confidence flags associated with those pulse codes in the three replies. The confidence flag for a reply pulse position is set LOW whenever there exists another received reply (either real or phantom) that could have had a pulse within ±0.121 microsecond of the same position.  Otherwise, the confidence flag is set HIGH. 

When agreement among the three replies fails for a given pulse position, the rules for estimating the initial track code for that position are based on the principle that LOW- confidence ONEs are suspect.  The rules are as follows: 

a. If in the most recent (third) reply the detected code for a given pulse position is 
HIGH confidence or a ZERO, the initial code estimate for that pulse position is set to the detected value.  Otherwise, 
b. if in the second reply the detected code for that pulse position is HIGH confidence or 
a ZERO, then the initial code estimate for that pulse position is set to the detected value in the second reply.  Otherwise, 
c. the initial code estimate for that pulse position is the same as the code detected in that 
pulse position in the first reply. 
These rules can also be expressed as a truth table showing the agreement decision and the initial track code pulse estimate for a given pulse position.  This is given in Table A-1 for all combinations of the three detected code bits and the three associated confidence bits. 

Determination of code pulse agreement and code pulse estimate for all possible combinations of code pulses and associated confidence bits.  Reply 1 is the oldest and reply 3 is the most recent.

## A.6 Mode C Track Maintenance

The following algorithms for surveillance of ATCRBS targets have been used successfully in experimental TCAS equipment (see Ref. F.). The tracks are processed individually in increasing range order with input range precision of at least 1/128 NM and retained computational accuracy of at least 1/1024 NM.  Range is estimated and predicted by a recursive (alpha-beta) tracker with *alpha* of 0.67 and *beta* of 0.25. After each surveillance update a new range measurement is available for each target. Since the measurement includes errors, it must be smoothed based on previous measurements to obtain improved estimates of the current target position and velocity.  
The range and range rate estimation equations are as follows: 

$r_{ext}\left(t\right)=r_{pred}\left(t\right)+alpha\left[r_{meas}\left(t\right)-r_{pred}\left(t\right)\right]$

$\dot{r}_{ext}\left(t\right)=\dot{r}_{ext}\left(t-T_{p}\right)+\left(\frac{beta}{T_{p}}\right)\left[r_{meas}\left(t\right)-r_{pred}\left(t\right)\right]$
where Tp is the time difference between the current and previous measurements. 

The gains, *alpha* and *beta*, determine the relative degree of reliance on current and previous measurements; gains of unity would place complete reliance on the current measurement and result in no smoothing. The estimates obtained from the above equations are subsequently used to predict the range at the time of the next measurement as follows: 

$$r_{p r e a l}(t+T_{n})=r_{e x t}(t)+\left[{\dot{r}}_{e s t}(t)\cdot T_{n}\right]$$
where Tn is the time difference between the next measurement and the current measurement. The range correlation window is centered at the predicted range and has a half-window width as follows: 


 
  
 
 
760 ft if 
  
 if track is not established: 0 
 
 
coasted last  
  
  
 
 
interval 
  
 if track is established:  


+ 
 2000 ft, if r .GE. 0.00 NM and .LT. 0.17 NM 
 
 
570 ft if 
  
 1000 ft, if r .GE. 0.17 NM and .LT. 0.33 NM 
 
 
updated last 
  
 600 ft, if r .GE. 0.33 NM and .LT. 1.00 NM 
 
 
interval 
  
 240 ft, if r .GE. 1.00 NM and .LT. 1.50 NM 

 
 0 ft, if r .GE. 1.50 NM 

If the track is above 10,000 ft, the term contained within the second pair of brackets is multiplied times four. For the purposes of altitude correlation, altitude is estimated and predicted by an alphabeta tracker with alpha of 0.28 and beta of 0.06.  The tracker has retained computational accuracy of 100 ft divided by 16.  The altitude prediction is rounded to the nearest 100 foot increment and converted to Gray code.  The Gray codes of the predicted altitude ±100 feet are also computed.  (Note that the longer-term altitude predictions performed by the CAS logic require a more accurate altitude tracking procedure). The reply(s) that lie in the range correlation window are tested for altitude correlation in increasing range order.  The track is updated with the first reply that has exact agreement (in all bits) with any of the three Gray codes computed above.  If no reply matches, two additional Gray codes are computed and the process tried again.  The two codes are the predicted altitude ±200 feet. The updating reply (if any) is eliminated from further consideration in updating other tracks, or in the track initiation process.  If there is no updating reply, the range and altitude estimates are set equal to the corresponding predicted values.  If this is the sixth consecutive surveillance update interval having no updating reply, the track is dropped. If there is an updating reply, and if the track is not identified as an image (2.2.4.6.2.1.4), the track is flagged as established, that is, it is now available for use by the CAS logic. Once established, a track remains established until it is dropped, even if it subsequently satisfies the conditions for an image track (2.2.4.6.2.1.3). When all tracks have been processed, they are combined with the tracks that are newly initiated during the current scan, and then all the tracks are examined pairwise to determine if a given pair of tracks is likely to represent the same intruder.  If: 

a. the ranges differ by at most 0.082 NM b. the range rates differ by at most 8.9 kt c. either 
1. the altitudes differ by at most 100 ft, or 2. the altitude rates differ by at most 10 ft/s and both tracks were initiated during the 
same scan, 
only one of the tracks is retained, preference being given to the track showing the larger number of replies since initiation. 

## A.7 Multipath False Targets

The following algorithms have been successfully used to identify image tracks. If a track is identified as an image, it may be retained, but it cannot be flagged as established for use by the CAS logic.  Those tracks that could have been formed by replies specularly reflected from the ground are referred to as image tracks.  A track is identified as an image if there exists a track at shorter range (referred to as the real track) such that: 

a. The difference between the real altitude and the image altitude is less than or equal to 
200 ft for altitude-reporting targets, or both the image track and the real track are non-altitude-reporting, and 
b. the difference between the measured image range rate and the calculated image range 
rate 
I
R
 is less than or equal to 40 kt., where the calculated image range rate is either 
(for the single-reflection): 
$$\dot{R}_{I}=\sfrac{1}{2}\Bigg{[}\dot{R}+\frac{\left(\left(2R_{I}-R\right)^{2}-R^{2}+\left(Z_{O}-Z\right)^{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}(\dot{Z}_{O}+\dot{Z})+R\dot{R}-(Z_{O}-Z)(\dot{Z}_{O}-\dot{Z})}{2R_{I}-R}\Bigg{]}$$
or (for the double-reflection case): 

$$\dot{R}_{I}=\sqrt[1]{R_{I}}\left[\left({R_{I}}^{2}-R^{2}+(Z_{O}-Z)^{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}(\dot{Z}_{O}+\dot{Z})+R\dot{R}-(Z_{O}-Z)(\dot{Z}_{O}-\dot{Z})\right]$$
where: 
RI is the image range, 
R is the real range, Z is the real altitude for altitude-reporting targets or Z is set to own altitude for non-altitude-reporting targets, and 
ZO is own altitude. 

## A.8 Mode S Squitter Processing

The following is one acceptable means of processing squitters and altitude replies to reduce unnecessary interrogations and minimize interference limiting. When a squitter with no parity error is first received, a running sum initialized at zero is associated with it.  During each succeeding surveillance update interval the sum is decremented by 1 if no squitters or altitude replies with that address are received, and the sum is incremented by 16 for each reception within the surveillance update interval of either a squitter or an altitude reply.  The process continues until the sum equals or exceeds 20.  When the sum becomes less than or equal to -20, the address is removed from the system.  When it equals or exceeds +20, the target is declared to be valid. When a target has been declared to be valid, it is: 

 
Interrogated for surveillance if its altitude is 10,000 ft relative to own, or 
 
Monitored for altitude using DF=0 or DF=4 replies or, in the absence of such replies, by interrogating once every 10 seconds if its altitude is >10,000 ft relative to own. 
When any of these conditions is satisfied, the running sum continues to be incremented and decremented even though its value may exceed 20. Mode S squitter processing following an unsuccessful acquisition attempt is identical to the above but with the increment 16 replaced by 8.  If a second failure to acquire occurs, the process is repeated with an increment of 4.  After any subsequent failures, an increment of 2 is used. 

## A.9 Non-Altitude Reporting Aircraft

The following procedure for tracking altitude-unknown targets has been used successfully in experimental TCAS equipment (Ref. F.): The altitudes of all replies having empty brackets are changed to a pseudo-altitude, such as 127,000 feet.  These replies are used during track updating and initiation.  When three of them from consecutive scans satisfy the criteria for a new track, a track is formed. 

When a non-altitude-reporting target replies to more than one whisper-shout interrogation on a given scan, those replies are combined into a target report and discarded if they lie within 150 ft in range, 20 degrees in bearing, and their whisper-shout interrogations overlap in power. 

Target reports and replies associated with non-altitude-reporting targets are used to update existing non-altitude-reporting target tracks.  The range correlation window, centered on predicted track position, has a width (in units of 1/128 NM) of: 

$$W=(7-a g e)+5+\frac{u p/\,d o w n\_c o a s t\_c o u n t}{2}+\frac{b i a s}{2}$$
but less than 15. A newly initiated track has an age of 3.  When the term (7 - age) is negative, it is dropped from the formula.  The variable *bias* is a measure of how well the track is following recent range measurements.  The windows of adjacent tracks are not allowed to overlap. Regions of overlap are divided in half, and each half is allocated to the appropriate track. The replies and/or reports that lie in a track's range window are examined to select the "best" one to use to update the track.  If no reply or report is within 30 degrees of the predicted bearing then none is selected, and the track is coasted.  If more than one reply or report, or both, lie in the window, and they have the same bearing within 15 degrees, the one having a range closest to the track range prediction is selected.  If they do not have the same bearing within 15 degrees, the one having a range closest to the track range is selected. The replies and/or reports that lie in the window are then discarded.  That is, they are not eligible for further use by track update or by track initiation. The variable *up/down_coast_count* is incremented by one for each coasted scan, and decremented by one for each updated scan. The track updating equations are as follows. Let:  

$r(t)=$ range measurement at time $t$

$R_{meas}\left(t\right)=r(t)\cdot r(t)$ such that $r(t)=\sqrt{R_{meas}\left(t\right)}$
Then, for straight line motion: 

$${\dot{r}}(t)={\dot{R}}(t)/(2\cdot r(t))$$
Rmeas(t) "measurements" are tracked with an alpha, beta, gamma filter. 

$R_{est}(t)=R_{pred}(t)+alpha\left[R_{meas}(t)-R_{pred}(t)\right]$

$\dot{R}_{est}(t)=\dot{R}_{pred}(t)+\left(\frac{beta}{T_{p}}\right)\left[R_{meas}(t)-R_{pred}(t)\right]$ $$\ddot{R}_{e s t}\left(t\right)=\ddot{R}_{p r e d}\left(t\right)+\left(\frac{g a m m a}{{T_{p}}^{2}}\right)\left[R_{m e a s}\left(t\right)-R_{p r e d}\left(t\right)\right]$$
where Tp is the time difference between the current and previous measurements. 

The gains, alpha, *beta* and *gamma* determine the relative degree of reliance on current and previous measurements:  gains of unity would place complete reliance on the current measurements and result in no smoothing. The gains are implicitly dependent on the age of the track, its history of updates and coasts, and how well the track followed the recent range measurements (as expressed in the *bias*): 

$alpha$=$alpha$* 0.90 + 0.440* 0.10

$beta$=$beta$* 0.79 + 0.114* 0.21

$gamma$=$gamma$* 0.70 + 0.012* 0.30
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
After the above calculations, an additional one is made if the track was coasted on the last scan: 

250 . 0 750 . 0 *  alpha alpha   016 . 0 984 . 0 *  beta beta   002 . 0 998 . 0 *  gamma gamma  
Calculate the *bias* as: 

$$b i a s=\frac{b i a s+\left[R_{m e a s}(t)-R_{p r e d}(t)\right]}{2}$$
If the *bias* is greater than 50 feet, and *alpha* is less than 0.58 then: 

$$a l p h a=0.580$$

$b e t a=0.220$

$g a m m a=0.035$
New tracks are initiated using replies and reports that did not lie in the range correlation windows of existing tracks.  Three replies from consecutive scans are necessary to initiate a new track, and they must lie in an approximately straight line, and have bearing within 20 degrees of each other.  The straight line criteria is that the third of three in a row must lie within 100 feet of a line through the first two. 

A new track has the following initial values: 
 

age 
 = 3 
up/down coast count   = 0 
coasts  
 = 0 
bias 
 = 0 
alpha 
 = 1.0067 
beta 
 = 1.2355 
gamma 
 = 0.7091 
 

The estimates obtained from the above equations are subsequently used to predict the range at the time of the next measurement as follows: 

$R_{pred}(t+T_{n})=R_{est}(t)+\dot{R}_{est}(t)\cdot T_{n}+\dot{R}_{est}(t)\cdot\frac{T_{n}^{2}}{2}$

$\dot{R}_{pred}(t+T_{n})=\dot{R}_{est}(t)+\dot{R}_{est}(t)\cdot T_{n}$

$\dot{R}_{pred}(t+T_{n})=\dot{R}_{est}(t)$
where Tn is the time difference between the estimate and prediction. 

$$r_{p r e d}(t+T_{n})=\sqrt{R_{p r e d}(t+T_{n})}$$
The initial track values are: 

$R_{ext}\left(t_{2}\right)=R_{meas}\left(t_{2}\right)$

$\dot{R}_{ext}\left(t_{2}\right)=\frac{3\cdot R_{meas}\left(t_{2}\right)-4\cdot R_{meas}\left(t_{1}\right)+R_{meas}\left(t_{0}\right)}{2}$

$\dot{R}_{ext}\left(t_{2}\right)=R_{meas}\left(t_{2}\right)-2\cdot R_{meas}\left(t_{1}\right)+R_{meas}\left(t_{0}\right)$

## A.10 Bearing Estimation

The following Cartesian alpha-beta estimation algorithm has been used successfully to develop smoothed target bearing estimates. Initiation. The bearing measurement (if available) and range measurement of each reply are used to form x and y position estimates:  
)
cos(bearing r x 
 
)
sin(bearing r y 
 
These measurements are used to form a least-squares estimate of the x and y positions and velocities.  At least one reply from a bearing measurement antenna is required for initiation. 

Prediction. A predicted x,y position for the next scan is formed by adding the product of the last-scan velocity estimate and the time since the last scan to the last-scan position estimate.  The predicted x and y are converted to bearing using the tangent function in the appropriate quadrant. 

Update. If a bearing measurement having at least one ungarbled code pulse is available, it is combined with the range measurement to form the x and y estimates.  The update is made using a standard alpha-beta tracker in both x and y.  The gains are the same in the x and y coordinates.  The least-squares gains vary during the first 15 scans following initiation of the range-altitude track and then are held constant, as shown below.  The gain values depend only on the age of the track, not the history of availability of reasonable estimates.

## 

If a valid bearing measurement is not available, the x and y estimates are set equal to the corresponding predicted values. The position update equation in x is: 

$$x_{e x t}(t)=x_{p r e d}(t)+a l p h a\left[x_{m e a x}(t)-x_{p r e d}(t)\right]$$
The velocity update equation in x is: 

$$\dot{X}_{ext}\left(t\right)=\dot{x}_{ext}\left(t-T\right)+\left(\frac{beta}{T}\right)\left[x_{meas}\left(t\right)-x_{pred}\left(t\right)\right]$$
where T is the time difference between the current and previous measurements. The y equations are analogous. 

## A.11 Mode S Tracker Using A Five-Second Update Rate

The following describes one possible implementation for providing reliable tracked range and range rate estimates each scan during periods of reduced update rate tracking. 

Track initiation and acquisition follows the suggested method based on the 1 second update interval.  Upon receipt of a reply to an acquisition interrogation, the target is placed into the track state.  The track is extended by interrogating at a 1 second update interval until an established range rate estimate can be made.  To allow the range tracking algorithm time to provide valid rate estimates, the range rate is considered established 4 scans after acquisition as long as a minimum of 2 successful updates occurred in those 4 scans.  Once established, it remains until the track is dropped.  The target threat level, for use in determining the update interval, is not evaluated until the range rate is established. Each active interrogation scan, all Mode S track parameters are updated by recursive alpha-beta filters for smoothing and predicting range and range rate based on the measured data and the time difference between the current and last interrogation.  The form for providing smoothed range and range rate estimates and predicting future states is given by: 

$$F_{ext}\left(t\right)=r_{pred}\left(t\right)+0.67\cdot\left[r_{meas}\left(t\right)-r_{pred}\left(t\right)\right]$$

$$\dot{r}_{ext}\left(t\right)=\dot{r}_{ext}\left(t-T_{p}\right)+\frac{0.25}{T_{p}}\left[r_{meas}\left(t\right)-r_{pred}\left(t\right)\right]$$

$$\dot{r}_{pred}\left(t+T_{n}\right)=r_{est}\left(t\right)+\left[\dot{r}_{est}\left(t\right)\cdot T_{n}\right]$$
where, t is the time of the estimate, T p is the time since the previous measurement, Tn is the expected time until the next measurement, rest t
 is the smoothed range estimate, 

r pred t
     is the predicted range value, rmeas t
                                         is the measured range, and 
                                                                        
                                                                      
                                                                      r
                                                                         t
                                                                      est
                                                                            is the 

estimated range rate. For each of the nominal 5 second scan periods between active scans, the smoothed and estimated range and range rate are calculated using the above equations.  The resultant rate estimates are then used to provide predicted position estimates during those scans where no active interrogation takes place. 

## A.12 Transition From On-The-Ground To Airborne Interference Limiting

The following describes one possible implementation of a procedure that enables TCAS to quickly recover its normal airborne surveillance range capability following a transition from an on-the-ground status to an airborne status. Whenever TCAS is operating on the ground and is using three times the value of NTA in the interference limiting function to determine the Mode C and Mode S interrogation power levels that it transmits each surveillance update interval, TCAS also simultaneously computes the Mode C and Mode S power levels that it could transmit using the direct value of NTA and an alpha value of one. Within the next surveillance update interval following indication of a transition from an on-the-ground status to an airborne status, TCAS replaces the previous Mode C and Mode S transmitted power levels computed using three times NTA and an alpha value based on NTA and on the measured TCAS distribution within 6 NM with the most recent power levels computed using NTA and an alpha of one. On successive surveillance update intervals, TCAS performs interference limiting according to 2.2.3.6.1 and 2.2.3.6.2 as long as it remains airborne.   
 

## B.1 Introduction

RF communication paths used by TCAS are shown in Figure B-1.   A brief overview of each path is given in sections 2 and 3 below.  This information is presented as background material in order to provide clarification for the coordination and communication requirements contained within this document.  

## B.2 Air-To-Air Communication

Air-to-air communication takes place using Mode S uplink formats UF=0, 16 and Mode S downlink formats DF=0, 16.  The short (56-bit) special surveillance interrogations and replies (UF, DF=0) are used for air-to-air surveillance.  The long (112- bit) special surveillance interrogations and replies (UF, DF=16) are used for air-to-air coordination and communication.  DF=11 replies are unique in that they are involved in both air-to-air and ground-to-air surveillance. (See sections 1.4 and 2.4 below.)   

## B.2.1 Coordination

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
TCAS coordination is accomplished via air-air transmissions using UF, DF=16 interrogations and replies.  A TCAS-equipped aircraft will initiate a coordination interrogation/reply sequence with another TCAS-equipped aircraft once per second as long as the initiating aircraft perceives the other aircraft to be a threat.  Interrogations are sent by the TCAS processor in one aircraft and received by the Mode S transponder in the other aircraft.  The receiving transponder then passes the coordination information on to its associated TCAS processor.  UF=16 interrogations used for coordination contain a TCAS Resolution Message in the 56-bit message field; within this field is a vertical resolution advisory complement (VRC) which is used to restrict the choice of vertical sense by the receiving aircraft.  Coordination information in replies (e.g., ARA, RAC) is not used; a coordination reply is simply a technical acknowledgment which informs the initiating TCAS that its interrogation was received by the other aircraft's Mode S transponder. 

## B.2.2 Tcas Broadcast Interrogation Messages

UF=16 interrogations are also used to transmit TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Messages. In this case, the 56-bit message field contains the address of the initiating TCAS.  TCAS Broadcast interrogations allow a TCAS-equipped aircraft to announce its presence to other TCAS in the vicinity.  TCAS Broadcast interrogations are sent every 8 to 10 seconds by a TCAS processor and received by the Mode S transponder of every TCAS- equipped aircraft within receiving range.  The receiving transponder then passes the information on to its associated TCAS processor, where the information is used for interference limiting purposes.  The receiving aircraft's transponder does not reply to a TCAS Broadcast interrogation. 

 

Note: This diagram shows a separated TCAS processor and Mode S transponder.  
Current U.S. TCAS II air carrier implementations use a separated TCAS processor and Mode S transponder connected by two 100 kHz ARINC 429 buses. A manufacturer could choose some other option, e.g., housing the two functions in the same physical unit and communicating via shared memory or using a connection other than ARINC 429. 

## B.2.3 Ra Broadcast Interrogation Messages

UF=16 interrogations are also used to transmit RA Broadcast Interrogation Messages. These interrogations are transmitted every 8 seconds by a TCAS processor for the period that an RA is active.  This allows RA activity to be monitored in areas where Mode S ground station surveillance coverage does not exist by using special RA broadcast signal receivers on the ground.  RA Broadcast Interrogations are defined as uplink transmissions but are normally destined for ground equipment.  In the RA Broadcast Interrogation, the 56-bit message field describes the most recent RA that existed during the preceding 8 second period. The message field also includes the most recent Mode A and Mode C codes transmitted by the associated Mode S transponder. 

## B.2.4 Surveillance

Mode S "squitters" (DF=11 replies) are emitted spontaneously nominally once per second by a Mode S transponder.  A squitter contains the aircraft's 24-bit ICAO aircraft address "in the clear‖ (i.e., parity does not overlay the address) and allows a receiving TCAS aircraft to acquire the ICAO aircraft address for surveillance initiation. Following receipt of squitters, a TCAS aircraft will use surveillance interrogations (UF=0) for acquisition and then tracking of a Mode S-equipped aircraft.   A responding aircraft's Mode S transponder will reply with DF=0 replies, containing vertical status (VS), sensitivity level (SL), capability (RI), and altitude information.  TCAS periodically reports its sensitivity level and operational capability to the transponder for use in DF=0 replies. DF=17 replies are identical to DF=11 replies but with an added 56-bit message field that can be used to convey various types of information (e.g., the aircraft's GPS position). The DF=17 format is squittered spontaneously by some Mode S transponders.  Note that for these transponders, the DF=17 squitter is currently in addition to, not in place of, the DF=11 squitter. For TCAS surveillance of ATCRBS-equipped aircraft, TCAS transmits Mode C ATCRBS-only all call interrogations [P1 and P3 spaced 21 microseconds apart to elicit a Mode C (altitude) reply, plus a short (0.8 microsecond) P4 pulse to prevent Mode S transponders from replying.]  The "whisper-shout" technique (transmitting repeated Mode C interrogations at different power levels) is used to minimize synchronous garble. 

## B.3 Air-To-Ground, Ground-To-Air Communication

Communication between TCAS and a Mode S ground sensor takes place using groundtransmitted UF=4, 5, 20, 21 interrogations and the aircraft's transponder-transmitted DF=4, 5, 20, 21 replies.  The main use for all of these interrogations and replies is surveillance, and for this the short formats are sufficient (UF, DF=4, 5).  When message bits are to be transmitted either in the uplink or downlink, the long formats are used (UF, DF=20, 21).  UF=11 interrogations and DF=11 replies are also used in ground-based surveillance (section 2.4). 

## B.3.1 Sensitivity Level Command Messages (Ground-To-Air)

A Mode S ground sensor can use the 56-bit message field of a UF=20 or 21 interrogation to transmit a Sensitivity Level Command Message to a TCAS-equipped aircraft.  The 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
receiving aircraft's transponder replies with a corresponding DF=20 or 21 reply and passes the message on to its associated TCAS processor. 

## B.3.2 Ra Report (Air-To-Ground)

Whenever TCAS indicates to the transponder that it has an Active RA (ARA), the transponder sets a bit in its DF=4, 5, 20, 21 replies to indicate the availability of this information.  A Mode S ground sensor can then request this information when sending a UF=4, 5, 20, 21 interrogation to the aircraft.  When so requested, the transponder will send the RA information in the 56-bit message field of the corresponding DF=20 or 21 reply.  Note that the format for the RA Report is different for DO-185A,B compatible TCAS/transponder systems (i.e., Change 7 systems) and FAA TSO-C119A TCAS/transponder systems (i.e., pre-Change 7 systems).  Possible uses for the downlinked information are display to air traffic controllers and data collection. 

## B.3.3 Data Link Capability Report (Air-To-Ground)

When requested by a Mode S ground sensor via a UF=4, 5, 20, 21 interrogation, the transponder will report its capability, including TCAS capability, in the 56-bit message field of the corresponding DF=20 or 21 reply.  Note that the format for the Data Link Capability Report is different for DO-185A,B compatible TCAS/transponder systems (i.e., Change 7 systems) and FAA TSO-C119A TCAS/transponder systems (i.e., pre- Change 7 systems).  Mode S ground sensors use the Data Link Capability Report to determine what ground-air-ground interactions an aircraft can support.  

## B.3.4 Surveillance

Mode S ground sensors typically obtain knowledge of a Mode S-equipped aircraft in their coverage area when the aircraft responds with a DF=11 reply to the sensor's Mode S-only all call (UF=11) interrogation.  The aircraft thereafter is interrogated on a regular basis with discrete UF=4, 5 (or UF=20, 21) interrogations.

# Minimum Operational Performance Standards For Traffic Alert And Collision Avoidance System Ii (Tcas Ii) Collision Avoidance System (Cas) Requirements Specification

## Version 7.1 Volume Ii

This page intentionally left blank.

## Environment

1.   ENVIRONMENT This chapter describes assumptions regarding the behavior of the non-Collision Avoidance System (CAS) components of the TCAS II system.  The CAS requirements are based on these assumptions.  Effects of their violation should be carefully considered.  This is the first chapter to use state chart notation, which is described in Appendix D.  Symbols used in this document are defined in Appendix E.  When comparing or assigning numerical values, the units of measurement must be considered.  For example, 10 ft is less than 1 nmi.

## 1.1   Components Input Interfaces

1.2   Input Interfaces 
 
This section describes CAS input interfaces. 
 
Note:  The Trigger Event, RECEIVE, is asynchronous with TCAS.  The synchrony hypothesis 
explained in Appendix D, Section D.10.1, assumes that TCAS is infinitely faster than the 
environment, and hence TCAS response to an external message or data is always generated in 
the same step that the message or data is introduced.

Description:  Upon receiving a valid  TCAS resolution message from another 
aircraft, choose an Other_Aircrafts-157 entry i, such that either: 
 
 
(1)  Other_Aircrafts-157 [i] is already modeling information about the 
interrogating aircraft, or 
 
 
(2)  Other_Aircrafts-157 [i] is available to model the interrogating aircraft, and no 
Other_Aircrafts-157 [j] is already modeling information about the interrogating 
aircraft.  The Received_Intruder_Intent_Event triggers a coordination update message.  The Selected_To_Model_Intruder_Event[i] triggers the transition from 
Not_Tracked to Threat_Not_Tracked to model an untracked aircraft that 
considers own a threat.  The event is ignored if in Tracked.  This variable is assigned from the resolution message, which has the highest priority of reception. The variable is updated immediately to be used in determining the resolution advisory, i.e., wherever Other_VRC is checked in a transition table, the value assigned is that loaded from the most recently received resolution data.

## Collision Avoidance System

The TCAS Controller statechart reflects two high-level states of the TCAS system, Power_On and Power_Off.  No functionality is provided in the Power_Off state.  The Power_On state is composed of two substates, Fully_Operational and Standby. Tracking of own aircraft is performed when TCAS is in Standby; however, TCAS does not interrogate other aircraft, therefore it does not perform conflict detection or resolution.  The details of the TCAS Standby substate and the conditions for transitions to and from the Standby substate are determined by the manufacturer.  The Fully_Operational substate is composed of four distinct subcomponents: Own_Aircraft:  This component contains internal information about the state of own aircraft. Section 2.1 contains a detailed description. Other_Aircraft:  This component contains internal information about the states of multiple other aircraft as perceived by TCAS. Information such as intruder status and advisories is contained here.  Section 2.2 contains a detailed description. Vertical_Tracker:  This component contains internal information derived by a nonlinear algorithm about the altitude and altitude rate of own aircraft and each altitude-reporting intruder. Section 2.3 contains a detailed description. Mode_S_Ground_Station:  This component contains internal information from multiple communicating ground stations as perceived by TCAS.  Section 2.4 contains a detailed description.

Notes: 
         1. 
              Description:  Own_Alt_Radio is an input from the radio altimeter which gives the 
              feet above ground level (AGL) of own aircraft.  Hardware differ in available 
              range.  A smaller range will cause radio altitude status to become invalid at a 
              lower altitude above ground than intended by the CAS logic, thus affecting logic 
              switch points based on altitude above ground.  Hardware can be analog or 
              digital. Analog input to the TCAS box is in a voltage range that must be converted 
              to feet.  Digital input is in binary via the ARINC 429 data word.

## 2.1.4   Alt_Layer

Note: 
          
              Description:  The Alt_Layer state gives the present pressure altitude layer.  This 
              state is used to select altitude-dependent thresholds for traffic advisories and 
              resolution advisories.  Six altitude layers are used to account for the inherent 
              decrease in barometric altimeter measurement accuracy with increasing altitude.

## 2.1.11   Advisory_Status

Note: 
 
Description:  The Advisory_Status state and its substates constitute the collection of information that determine both the display and aural annunciation of an advisory to the flight crew.  This information is used to present a single resolution advisory even when there are multiple threats, to indicate whether the advisory is positive or negative, and to inform the pilot when a change of flight path is required.

## 2.1.11.1   Composite_Ra

Notes: 
 
Description:  The Composite_RA state is the component of the Advisory_Status state which combines the resolution advisories selected against all other aircraft that are currently considered to be threats.  The purpose of Composite_RA is to present a single RA for display and to indicate the sense of this RA.  Substates of Composite_RA determine whether or not there is an RA, the positive (i.e., Climb, Descend) or negative sense of the RA, and the strength of the Vertical Speed Limit (VSL) for a negative sense advisory.

Description:  For single threat situations, transition to a negative composite advisory occurs when either a negative climb or a negative descend RA is selected against the threat.  When there are multiple threats, transition to a negative composite advisory occurs when the RAs selected for each threat are either (1) all descend sense RAs but descend is inhibited, or (2) not all of the same sense (i.e., all climb or all descend).

## 2.1.11.1.1   Ra

Note: 
          
              Description:  The RA (Resolution Advisory) state is the component of the 
              Composite_RA state which indicates whether a resolution advisory is "positive" or 
              "negative".  A positive RA tells the crew to climb or descend, whereas a negative 
              RA imposes a restriction on vertical speed. 

## 2.1.11.1.1.1   Negative

Note: 
 
Description:  The Negative state is the component of the RA state selected whenever a resolution advisory which imposes a vertical speed limit (VSL) provides adequate vertical separation for a threat.  A negative RA is weaker than a positive RA which requires a change in flight path (i.e., climb or descend) to achieve adequate vertical separation. 

## 2.1.11.1.1.1.1   Climb_Vsl

Note: 
 
Description:  The Climb_VSL state is the component of the Negative state which gives the strength of the Vertical Speed Limit (VSL) for a negative climb sense (i.e., do not descend) composite RA.  Strength, indicated by the name of the substate, limits the descend vertical speed to 0, 500, 1000, or 2000 ft/min.

Description:  Transition to corrective climb occurs whenever the composite resolution advisory is either climb (always corrective) or is negative sense but the aircraft is not meeting the climb goal. .  The transition to corrective climb also occurs when a climb RA is weakened to a zero climb rate goal but the aircraft climb rate exceeds zero by more than the hysteresis value for level flight.

Description:  Transition out of corrective climb occurs for a weakened climb RA condition when either the own aircraft altitude rate exceeds a non-zero climb goal or the aircraft is considered level (i.e., within hysteresis) for a zero climb and descend goal.  This transition also occurs whenever the aircraft is not meeting the current descend goal.

## 2.1.11.3   Corrective_Descend

Note: 
 
Description:  The Corrective_Descend state is the component of the Advisory_Status state which indicates that a descend maneuver is required to correct the current flight path to avoid a threat.  The default state corresponds to a preventive RA which means the current vertical rate is to be maintained or a planned maneuver is subject to a vertical rate restriction.

## 2.1.11.4   Combined_Control

Note: 
 
Description:  The Combined_Control state is the component of the Advisory_Status state which indicates whether a displayed advisory is preventive or corrective, or whether the advisory is to be discontinued because the threat has stopped reporting altitude or its track was dropped, or the threat is now clear of conflict.  Separate climb and descend sense corrective indicators are needed because the composite RA for a multi-aircraft situation may be a combination of RAs of different vertical senses, only one of which may be corrective.

## 2.1.15   Altitude_Alerter

 Note: 
 
Description:  The Altitude_Alerter state determines whether or not altitude alerter information is considered available for use in the TCAS logic.  TCAS only uses the altitude alerter information in deciding where to optimally place the green "fly to" arc for weakening resolution advisories.  The algorithms have been designed to function even when the altitude alerter input is not available.  This state is required only if the Altitude_Alerter_Report Input Interface is implemented.

## 2.1.16   Own_Tracker

Note: 
 
Description:  The Own_Tracker state determines which of two filters is used to estimate own aircraft"s altitude.  Selection of either the fine data tracker or the coarse (100 ft) data tracker depends on the quantization level (i.e., granularity) of the barometric altimeter-reported pressure altitude (feet above mean sea level). Altitude data used for TCAS may not be more coarse than the 100 ft maximum quantization level that is used for altitude reporting.

## 2.1.18   Own_Tracker_Softness

Note: 
 
Description:  The Own_Tracker_Softness state value gives the softness factor used by the tracker which estimates own aircraft"s altitude and altitude rate.  The softness factor is used in determining if the tracker-predicted altitude agrees well enough with the barometric altimeter-reported altitude.  The maximum softness factor applies when the coarse quantization tracker is selected or when there is a persistent altitude coast.  The softness factor is decreased each cycle to a minimum value of 3 when the fine quantization tracker is processing altitude data (i.e., not coasting) or when a switch from the coarse to the fine quantization tracker is imminent.

## 2.2.4   Track_Status

Note: 
 
Description:  The Track_Status state categorizes the current track established on an intruder as either "not tracked", "tracked", or "threat not tracked".  The state not tracked is used when a track has not yet been established or surveillance has not provided tracking data.  Tracked status indicates that the intruder is being considered for classification as either a threat, potential threat, proximate traffic, or other traffic.  A "threat not tracked" situation arises when a resolution intent has been received from a TCAS-equipped intruder, but the intruder is either not currently tracked or surveillance has not provided updated tracking data.  For "threat not tracked" intruders, the resolution intent is saved but no action is taken until a track is established by surveillance.

Description:  Transition from tracked to not tracked status occurs when a resolution intent has not been received and surveillance has not provided updated track data to CAS.  The transition also occurs if TCAS is in Standby mode or is not operational because there is no need to track intruders since TCAS is then incapable of issuing advisories.

## 2.2.4.1   Tracked

Note: 
 
Description:  Only intruders that are in the Tracked state are evaluated by the CAS detection/resolution logic.  Intruders are considered tracked only if TCAS is fully operational and not in Standby mode, because otherwise TCAS could not issue advisories so there would be no need to track intruders.  Substates of Tracked provide TCAS"s fundamental view of an intruder"s flight situation, threat status and predicted horizontal miss distance. 

## 2.2.4.1.1   Alt_Reporting

Note: 
 
Description:  Intruder aircraft can be classified as altitude reporting or nonaltitude reporting.  In general, an intruder aircraft will remain in one of the Alt_Reporting states for the duration of its surveillance track; however, an intruder can transition between states if it activates or deactivates its altitude reporting capability while it is under track.  When an altitude-reporting intruder becomes non-altitude reporting, the CAS logic loses the ability to assess whether or not the intruder is a threat.  In practice, transitions of this state only occur for Mode S equipped intruders.

## 2.2.4.1.2   Intruder_Status

Note: 
 
Description:  The Intruder_Status state contains the basic elements of the collision avoidance function by qualifying intruder aircraft as threats that warrant a Resolution Advisory or as non-threats that may warrant a Traffic Advisory.  The CAS logic categorizes each tracked intruder aircraft as either "other traffic", "proximate traffic", "potential threat", or "threat" which are the substates of Intruder_Status.

Note: 
 
Description:  The TCAS detection logic uses range and altitude tests to qualify an intruder as a threat that warrants an RA.  The criteria for the threat are that it either already be close in range or altitude to own aircraft, or that it be converging in range or altitude with a predicted time to minimum range or coaltitude being less than a designated time threshold.  Two basic requirements for threat declaration are that the intruder must be airborne and that issuance of RAs must not be inhibited.  Transition to the Threat state from any other Intruder Status state occurs when conditions described by the Threat_Condition macro are satisfied. 
 

## 2.2.4.1.2.1.1   Range_Test

Note: 
 
Description:  The CAS logic uses a range test to qualify an intruder as a threat that warrants an RA.  Once an RA has been issued, the RA is continued until the range test fails on two consecutive execution steps.  This is done to ensure that the threat is actually diverging and to avoid fluctuations in the displayed advisory. The Range_Test state is used to continue an RA through one failure of the range test.

Description:  For these transitions, conditions that indicate the end of a crossing situation are checked.  The 100ft_Crossing macro is called to verify that the situation is no longer crossing.  If either the intruder"s sense is climb and own aircraft is more than 100 ft above other aircraft, or intruder"s sense is descend and own aircraft is more than 100 ft below other aircraft, the transition to Non- Crossing takes place.  Transition to Non_Crossing always occurs when the true time to closest approach is less than 4 seconds.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  Transition is from the Own_Cross state, in which own aircraft is considered "responsible" for the crossing, into Int_Cross where the intruder is projected to cross through own aircraft"s altitude.  The conditions that must be satisfied are that a climb sense has been chosen and other aircraft projected altitude is less than own current aircraft altitude, or that a descend sense has been chosen and other aircraft projected altitude is greater than own aircraft current altitude.

Note: 
          
              Description:  Sense is the substate of the Threat state that indicates an intruder"s 
              contribution to own"s advisory.  Substates of Sense indicate the preferred 
              directional sense, "climb" or "descend", for resolution advisories for each threat.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  In order to separate the sense selection of a new threat from that of a continuing threat, there exists a substate of Sense named Sense_Not_Selected (the default state of Sense) which applies to new threats only. Sense_Not_Selected transitions to conditional state which, depending on the conditions satisfied, transitions to either the Climb or the Descend state.  This transition happens only once for any particular threat.

## 2.2.4.1.2.1.5.1   Climb, Descend

Note: 
 
Description:  Climb and Descend are parallel substates of the Sense state.  Only one of these is active at any time for a particular threat.  The active state indicates the directional sense of the resolution advisory for the threat.  Substates of Climb and Descend give the strength of the selected advisory and the status of the reversal geometry at the present and previous computation cycle. 

## 2.2.4.1.2.1.5.1.1   Consider_Reversal

Note: 
 
Description:  Consider_Reversal is a substate of the Climb and Descend states. The substates of Consider_Reversal determine whether the current range and encounter geometry conditions warrant the CAS logic to consider revising an inprogress resolution advisory.

## 2.2.4.1.2.1.5.1.2   Strength

Note: 
 
Description:  Strength is a substate of the Climb and Descend states which are themselves substates of the Sense and Threat states.  The substates of Strength determine whether the selected resolution advisory is "positive", which requires a vertical rate be attained in the direction of the advisory"s Sense, or "negative", which imposes a limitation on the vertical speed.  Lower level substates of Strength represent the magnitude of the resolution advisory required to resolve the conflict with this threat.  The weakest advisory that will suffice is selected in order to minimize the disruption to the original flight path while providing adequate vertical separation.

## 2.2.4.1.2.1.6   Status

Note: 
 
Description:  In order to process multiple threats in an orderly way, threats are classified by Status.  Intruders requiring a resolution advisory for the first time are classified as "new" and previously established continuing threats are designated "continuing".  Continuing threat status is an important factor in the CAS logic, playing a role in tests where continuity of display and pilot response time to an advisory are key considerations.  New threats are processed first so that their resolution advisory senses may be adjusted later by the multiaircraft logic.  This order of processing causes the least disruption in the resolution advisory that is already being displayed to the pilot.

As a means of reducing altitude crossings in TCAS-TCAS conflicts, the TCAS logic incorporates a test that has the level aircraft defer threat declaration against a nonlevel intruder which is projected to cross in altitude, if that intruder has not yet transmitted its intent to the level aircraft TCAS.  This tends to force the nonlevel TCAS aircraft to choose first and its choice usually will be a non-crossing resolution advisory.  In the event that the nonlevel TCAS aircraft does not send its intent within the three second period, the level TCAS will select its own best sense, still possibly avoiding an altitude crossing.

Description:  The Display_Arrow state models the information of an intruder"s vertical direction of motion that will be depicted on the traffic display.  This information updates the arrow on the display which enables the flight crew to have an indication of the intruder"s current relative position as well as its predicted position and vertical direction.  If the intruder is an established climb or descend maneuver, either "up" or "down" states are entered.  The state "no arrow" is entered when the intruder is either deemed to be level, or has a suspected but unconfirmed rate, or the track is too young to determine a rate.

## 2.2.4.1.7   Tau_Rising

Note: 
 
Description:  The purpose of the Tau_Rising state is to eliminate certain alarms which occur very near to the time of closest approach, namely alarms against those intruders whose time of closest approach (range tau) has begun to rise when they are more than 1.7 nmi away but that later violate the altitude threshold.  The concept relies on the fact that the range tau goes through a minimum and then rises just before the aircraft reach closest approach.  As long as the range tau continues to rise, the intruder will not be declared a threat; however, if the range tau subsequently decreases, the intruder could again immediately qualify for a resolution advisory.

## 2.2.4.1.9   Horizontal_Miss_Distance_Ra_Filter

Note: 
 
Description:  The purpose of the Horizontal_Miss_Distance_RA_Filter is to suppress Resolution Advisories when the horizontal miss distance (horizontal separation at closest point of approach) exceeds a predetermined threshold. 
 
 
It is made up of three distinct trackers used simultaneously to detect maneuvers and calculate an estimate of the horizontal miss distance: 
1.  The cartesian tracker, based on range measurements, is used to detect 
maneuvers only. 
2.  The parabolic tracker, also based on range measurements, is used to detect 
maneuvers (such as turns) and calculate an estimate of the horizontal miss distance. 
3.  The range-bearing tracker, based on range and bearing measurements, is 
used to detect maneuvers (specifically, speed changes) and provide another estimate of the horizontal miss distance. 
 
 
To be initialized, all trackers must receive several valid measurements in a row (range and bearing track firmness).  Additional tests on the trackers are also performed (range-bearing tracker consistency check).  If no maneuver has been detected and the smallest calculated horizontal miss distance is computed to be greater than a fixed, predetermined threshold, preexisting or pending Resolution Advisories are suppressed.

## 2.2.5   Rm_Send_Status

Note: 
 
Description:  For each threat that is TCAS-equipped, own TCAS must attempt a coordination sequence each cycle.  RM_Send_Status  reflects whether own aircraft is attempting to send a TCAS resolution message (coordination interrogation) to the other aircraft.  If RM_Send_Status is in state Not_- Attempting_RM, then no TCAS resolution messages are being transmitted to the intruder.  If an RA needs to be sent, then Waiting_To_Coordinate is activated. The output interface sends a TCAS resolution message to the corresponding TCAS-equipped aircraft and RM_Send_Status for that intruder enters Waiting_- For_Reply.  If RM_Send_Status is in state Waiting_For_Reply, then own aircraft is attempting to coordinate with the intruder.  Between six and twelve attempts are made.  If a reply is received, or no reply is received after the specified number of tries, a transition is made to Not_Attempting_RM.

## 2.2.6   Rm_Count_This_Cycle

 
Note: 
                       Description:  Own aircraft attempts to send a TCAS resolution message 
                       (coordination interrogation) to each TCAS-equipped threat.  If there is no reply to 
                       the initial interrogation, the interrogation is repeated and the 
                       RM_Count_This_Cycle is incremented.  If necessary, a minimum of six and a 
                       maximum of twelve interrogations are sent over a 100 ± 5 millisecond period.  A 
                       minimum of six interrogations are needed to assure that the coordination link is 
                       established in spite of atmospheric conditions that may contribute to link failure.  
                       A maximum of twelve interrogations increases the probability of successful 
                       coordination.

## 2.3.3   100Ft_Tracker

Note: 
 
Description:  The 100 ft tracker handles altitude reports that are quantized to 100 ft to determine tracked altitude and tracked altitude rate for own aircraft and each altitude-reporting intruder. The 100 ft tracker is composed of a nonlinear tracking algorithm, and for high vertical rates (exceeding 6,000 ft/min), an alphabeta tracking function with logic to transition between the nonlinear portion and the alpha-beta portion. 

Transition(s):  
                      Tracking 
                                   

Description:  The Validity_Check_Prior_To_Switch_To_25ft_Tracker state is a counter used to require that three successive valid 25 ft quantization reports are received before switching to the 25 ft tracker.  This delay assures that the change to the 25 ft quantization level is not just a momentary shift.

## 2.3.3.3   100Ft_Bin_Transition_Status

Note: 
 
Description:  For each tracked aircraft, the 100 ft vertical tracker determines a bin transition status which characterizes the track as one of five possible values (the substates of 100ft_Bin_Transition_Status).  Bin transition status is an important factor in determining the level of confidence in the tracked altitude and altitude rate.  At initialization, status is either "New" or, when there is a known significant altitude rate, "Trend."  "Trend" status is assigned when there is a regularly-spaced and same direction sequence of bin transitions.  "Trend" transitions to "Level" status when an expected bin transition is very late.  "Level" status, which indicates zero vertical rate, is selected when no bin transition has occurred for a long time.  A sequence of single bin transitions which alternate in direction produces an "Oscil" status indicating level flight with oscillations (i.e., jitter) in reported altitude.  The "Guess" status is assigned when an altitude report produces an unexpected change in the direction and number of bins crossed.

## 2.3.3.4   100Ft_Firmness

Note: 
 
Description:  The 100 ft vertical tracker selects a value for the 100ft_Firmness state which characterizes tracker self-assessment of the quality of its estimates. Firmness values range from 0 (minimum confidence) up to 3 (maximum confidence).  Tracker firmness affects the TCAS threat detection, sense selection and advisory selection processes since decisions may be delayed when a high confidence estimate of vertical rate is not available.

## 2.3.4.2   Initialization

Note: 
 
Description:  Initialization of the 25 ft tracker is considered complete for an aircraft if the tracker is processing altitude reports (i.e., not coasting) and the minimum required initialization time has elapsed since the start of tracking.  This initialization period is needed for the alpha-beta tracker to establish an initial estimate of altitude and altitude rate.  However, if the 100 ft tracker is already tracking the aircraft when the 25 ft tracker starts, altitude and altitude rate estimates are handed off to the 25 ft tracker and the initialization period is not needed. 
Notes: 
1. 
Description:  Conditional initialization of the 25 ft tracker when the 100 ft tracker is currently not tracking altitude.

## 2.3.4.3   25Ft_Bin_Transition_Status

Note: 
 
Description:  For each tracked aircraft, the 25 ft vertical tracker determines a bin transition status which characterizes the nature of recent bin transitions as one of three possible values (the substates of 25ft_Bin_Transition_Status).  Bin transition status is an important factor in determining the level of confidence in the tracked altitude and altitude rate.  "New" status is assigned at initialization when there is no hand-off from the 100 ft vertical tracker.  After initialization is complete, "Level" is assigned when the tracked altitude rate is zero, and otherwise the status is "Trend."

Note: 
          
              Description:  The 25 ft vertical tracker selects a value for the 25ft_Firmness state 
              which characterizes tracker self-assessment of the quality of its estimates.  
              Firmness values range from 0 (minimum confidence) up to 3 (maximum 
              confidence).  Tracker firmness affects the TCAS threat detection, sense selction 
              and advisory selection processes since decisions may be delayed when a high 
              confidence estimate of vertical rate is not available.  Unlike the 100 ft tracker, the 
              25 ft tracker firmness always begins at the minimum value.

## 2.4   Mode S Ground Station

Note: 
 
Description:  The Mode_S_Ground_Station state represents the "active" and "inactive" status of each of the 15 possible Mode S ground stations which may be communicating with own aircraft"s TCAS unit.  Mode S ground stations perform surveillance and data link functions and may send messages related specifically to TCAS.  A ground station may request TCAS to send its active resolution advisory, which the station may then send on to Air Traffic Control.  The station may also send a Sensitivity Level Command (SLC) message to TCAS.  The TCAS unit can receive SLCs from up to 15 Mode S ground stations.  The smallest of these uplinked SLCs is considered in setting the TCAS sensitivity level.  An SLC message remains active until the originating Mode S ground station sends a cancellation command or until the message times out after 240 seconds.  In a multi-site region, station identifiers 1 to 15 are used to identify the multi-site ground stations, while in a single-site region, the site identifier is zero by default.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  A Mode S ground station may send a Sensitivity Level Command (SLC) message to TCAS.  A value of 1 is ignored by TCAS because that would put it into Standby mode, effectively turning TCAS off.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  The altitude separation test is passed if either (1) own aircraft is level, the threat is level, or own and threat have the same sign vertical rate and current vertical separation exceeds 600 feet, or (2) neither aircraft is level, they have opposite signs for vertical rate, and their current vertical separation exceeds 850 feet.  In addition, track firmness is high and the tracked relative altitude of the other aircraft is consistent with non crossing biased climb or descend.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  Choosing an increase in the opposite sense is better than maneuvering between the two threat aircraft.  The increase provides greater than a minimum altitude threshold and maneuvering between does not provide this minimum separation.  An increase is only considered if this is not a TCAS equipped threat.

Description:  This macro tests that the sense selected for the specified ("i") aircraft is different from that which has been previously displayed to the pilot. This warrants special consideration for changing the sense since the displayed sense is preferred to keep display continuity to the pilot.

Description:  This macro determines whether a level resolution advisory against one threat continues to provide adequate separation against both the present threat and a new threat.  If the level resolution advisory provides adequate separation, a reversal of the displayed advisory will not be considered.  The current level resolution advisory is also maintained when the new threat is non- TCAS and advisory deferral has been determined.

Description:  This macro determines whether an advisory against a new threat needs to be switched in its sense.  The macro returns true, if the second choice separation against the new threat is greater than a threshold (MAC_INC) and at least one of the following is true for the other aircraft for which conflicting sense was selected: 
 
 
(1) the second choice separation for the new threat aircraft is lower (i.e., keeping the new threat sense would be a worse choice than switching to the other sense), 
 
 
(2) the aircraft is the Low-ID TCAS controlled threat, 
 
 
(3) the opposite sense has already been displayed to the pilot on a previous cycle (there is another continuing threat), 
 
 
(4) when the two separations are equivalent, the logic simply picks the sense of the lowest numbered threat.

Description:  This macro examines several sets of conditions under which weakening of an already displayed positive resolution advisory strength would be unwarranted.  Conditions under which the positive strength should be maintained are (1) when sufficient separation has not been achieved, (2) when sufficient separation has been achieved but the time since a reversal is less than five seconds or (3) the time since the advisory last changed is less than 10 seconds or (4) track firmness is low, and when (5) own aircraft is approaching the altitude alerter-assigned altitude.  The last column and the last row are required only if the Altitude_Alerter_Report Input Interface is implemented.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  This macro tests the conditions under which the altitude predicted using the fine tracked altitude and altitude rate does not agree with the barometric altitude so that the track must be coasted.  The threshold is a function of tracker softness.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  Detection of a potential threat is partially based upon an altitude test.  The altitude criteria for a potential threat is that either the absolute value of the relative altitude is small enough relative to a threshold, or that the altitude separation is converging with a predicted time to co-altitude less than a sensitivity level-dependent threshold.

Notes:

Description:  For an intruder to be considered a potential threat, a range test must be passed.  Criteria for passing are that range rate is not diverging significantly and the predicted time to enter a protected volume is less than threshold, or range rate is diverging more than a small amount, the range - range rate product is less than a sensitivity level-dependent threshold and range is less than a potential threat minimum range threshold.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  To be considered as proximate traffic, an intruder must be within a range of  6.0 nmi beyond which visual acquisition is not likely.  Additionally, if the intruder is altitude reporting, its relative altitude must be within 1,200 ft.  If the intruder is not altitude reporting, then it is considered proximate traffic only if own altitude is below 15,500 ft where own would be in or near the airspace where altitude reporting is not required.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  This macro specifies conditions under which a resolution advisory is prohibited (i.e., TA-only mode) in situations where it would be too disruptive while allowing pilot situational awareness via the traffic display.  The traffic advisory only mode can be selected automatically based on altitude, by the pilot using a manual switch on the control panel, or commanded to sensitivity level 2 by a Mode S ground station.

Description:  This macro tests for a match between incoming surveillance reports and intruders under consideration, and identifies whether or not the report is for an intruder already under track.  For intruders already being tracked, the test is satisfied if the surveillance number in the track file matches the number (SURVNO) in the surveillance report.  For intruders that are not tracked, the test passes if the ICAO aircraft address in the other aircraft threat file matches the ICAO aircraft address (IDINTR) in the surveillance report.

Notes: 1. 
            Description:  This macro describes the two new geometric tests and new reversal 
            validation criteria introduced by Change Proposal 112E to correct some 
            deficiencies in Reversal_Geometrym-377.  The VMD and Own-Not-Follow tests are 
            described in CP112E_VMD_Reversalm-435 and CP112E_Own_Not_Follow 
            Reversalm-432,respectively. 
             
            Both tests must satisfy the pre-conditions that (1) there is only one threat, (2) CPA 
            is not imminent, (3) enough time has elapsed to allow pilot to react the initial RA, 
            (4) aircraft will be able to level off before CPA, and (5) they are in a high rate 
            vertical chase, i.e., flying in the same vertical direction at a rate greater than 
            1000 fpm (see CP112E_COMMON_CONDITIONS_PASSED).  In addition, the 
            tests must ensure (1) reversal is not issued in the cycle immediately after an 
            increase RA (see CP112E_ENOUGH_TIME_AFTER_INCREASE_RA)) and (2) 
            the aircraft pair is not projected to cross in altitude when CPA is near (see 
            CP112E_Cancel_Reversalm-431).    
             
            VMD reversals are subject to a redundancy check, requiring such reversals be 
            recommended twice in the most recent three processing cycles (see 
            CP112E_VMD_2_Out_3m-434).  Own-Not-Follow reversals are not subject to this 
            check.  They, however, do not apply if a threat aircraft is not equipped with 
            TCAS.  TCAS is ineffective if the only equipped aircraft is not obeying the TCAS 
            instructions. 

The validation of a VMD reversal is similar to that in Reversal_Geometrym-377 
except a threat aircraft"s tracked altitude rate instead of its inner or outer bound is used during the modeling of the projected separation at CPA if sense reversal were to take place.  The validation of an Own-Not-Follow reversal will assume own aircraft will continue in its current vertical rate until CPA.  An Own-Not- Follow reversal is validated if aircraft will be separated by no more than 120 feet in positive vertical separation at CPA.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  This macro contains Change Proposal(CP) 112E"s Own-Not- Follow test and determines if own aircraft is complying with its initial RA. This 
test is similar to the VMD test (see CP112E_VMD_Reversalm-435) but relaxes 
some of the test criteria and emphasizes the deviation between own aircraft's current altitude rate and its RA goal altitude rate.  If the deviation exceeds a certain threshold, this test will declare own aircraft non-compliant. This test will fail if the initial RA is a Vertical Speed Limit (VSL) RA because such RAs do not have a well defined goal altitude rate.  The test ensures that extra time has been given to the pilot to react to an RA that has recently been strengthed to a positive RA.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  This macro contains Change Proposal 112E"s Vertical Miss Distance (VMD) test.  This test is based on the high rate vertical chase test in 
Reversal_Geometrym-377 but relaxes the reversing criteria by enlarging the coaltitude band, allowing two aircraft in the same altitude band to reverse, and permitting reversal to an altitude-crossing sense against an equipped intruder.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  This macro determines whether a resolution advisory against any threat on the previous cycle has been removed on the current cycle.  To avoid confusion, the TCAS logic does not provide a clear of conflict annunciation until all resolution advisories have been removed.   Note:  The requirement that the RA be displayed for some minimum amount of time is taken care of in the transitions out of RA.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  This macro determines whether the TCAS logic will consider modeling strength of a resolution advisory required to resolve a conflict.  When the tracked range rate has been greater than zero over the previous ten cycles, enabling of strength modeling depends on the history of tracked range and range rate.  Strength modeling is always enabled when the tracked range rate is less than or equal to zero.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  This macro tests for conditions that might result in an altitudecrossing resolution advisory in TCAS-TCAS encounters where own aircraft is level, threat aircraft is not level, current vertical separation is greater than 100 ft and the two aircraft are projected to cross in altitude.  In such situations, CAS logic allows the level aircraft to delay threat declaration for up to three cycles, thereby forcing the nonlevel aircraft to choose a resolution advisory first which will usually be a noncrossing maneuver.

Description:  This macro tests whether a particular vertical speed limit (VSL), specified by the input parameter rate, will be effective in resolving the conflict with a threat.  This macro employs the VSL-OK macro to model pilot response time to the VSL to see if an altitude-dependent separation will be achieved.  If the threat is new and a resolution advisory is being issued in spite of low track firmness, the more pessimistic of the inner and outer confidence bounds around the threat"s vertical rate is used to avoid overestimating the separation that can be achieved.

Description:  This macro tests conditions to determine whether a vertical speed limit advisory will be considered against a particular threat.  The test conditions are: 
 
 
(1) threat does not have a substantial vertical rate and current relative altitude is outside threshold, 
 
 
(2) threat does not have a substantial vertical rate and current relative altitude is inside threshold and vertical miss distance (VMD) is outside the positive advisory threshold, 
 
 
(3) threat does not have a substantial vertical rate and current relative altitude is inside threshold and own has a meaningful vertical rate, 
 
 
(4) threat has a substantial vertical rate and VMD is outside the positive advisory threshold, 
 
 
(5) threat has a substantial vertical rate and own aircraft has a meaningful vertical rate.

Description:  Determines the sensitivity level (SL) that will be used in resolving a conflict with an intruder.  The conflict SL is the maximum of own aircraft"s effective SL and the intruder"s broadcast SL if this intruder is not declared a threat.  For a current threat, the previous value of the conflict SL is also considered.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  CVC (Cancel Vertical Complement) is included in the Resolution Message as a means to cancel a previously-transmitted VRC (Vertical Resolution Complement).  If own aircraft has selected a climb RA against this aircraft and at some time in the past a descend RA had been selected, CVC is assigned a value of 1.  This cancels the "do not descend" message.  If own aircraft has selected a descend RA against the aircraft and at some time in the past a climb RA had been selected, CVC is assigned a value of 2.  This cancels the "do not climb" message. Otherwise (the same sense has been kept throughout the encounter) the value assigned to CVC is zero.  For dropped threats (one cycle after ending threat status), if own aircraft selected a climb RA last cycle, then CVC is assigned a value of 1.  This  cancels the "do not descend" message.   If own aircraft has selected a descend RA last cycle, then CVC is assigned a value of 2.  This cancels the "do not climb" message.

Notes: 
1. 
Description:  This function calculates vertical separation at closest point of approach between own aircraft and an intruder, starting from an input set of altitude and altitude rate initial conditions, and accounts for a vertical maneuver in response to a resolution advisory.  The value returned is the smaller of two projected separations, one calculated using the true tau capped and the other using the modified tau capped.  Input parameters which specify the maneuver are the time from present until the advisory will be announced (START_TIME), the pilot"s time delay in beginning to execute the advised maneuver (DELAY), the goal altitude rate (ZDGOAL), the assumed maximum vertical acceleration (ACCEL) used in reaching the goal altitude rate and the direction of the advisory (DIRECTION).

Description:  Returns a projected value of vertical miss distance which is used in the altitude test to determine if an intruder qualifies as a potential threat. Vertical miss distance (VMD) is own projected altitude minus intruder projected altitude at closest approach, calculated from current relative altitude and altitude rate and the time until closest approach (tau).  VMD is projected at both the true tau (input TAU1) and modified tau (input TAU2) which delimit the critical 
interval during which range is minimal and adequate vertical separation is 
required.  If an altitude crossing will occur during the critical interval, VMD is set to zero indicating coaltitude with negligible horizontal separation.  If the same aircraft is either above or below throughout the critical interval, VMD is set to the separation which is smaller in absolute value.  VMD is positive if own is above throughout the critical interval and negative if own is below throughout the critical interval.

## Appendix C:  Event Definitions

Appendix C summarizes the event definitions at the state and variable level.  This table includes an entry for every event; each entry includes the event name, the states and variables that generate the event, and those that receive the event. Column 1 contains the name of the event. Column 2 lists input variables that generate the event and states in which transitions generate the event.  This corresponds to variables and transitions that list this event as an output action.  For example, the transition within the Intruder_Status state from Proximate_Traffic to Other_Traffic has an output action of Intruder_Status_Evaluated_Event.  Therefore, Intruder_Status is included in the "Generated By" column of the entry for Intruder_Status_Evaluated_Event in Appendix C. Column 3 lists output variables that receive the event and states in which transitions receive the event.  This corresponds to variables and transitions that list this event as a trigger event.   For example, the transition within Intruder_Status state from  Proximate_Traffic to Other_Traffic has a trigger event of Air_Status_Evaluated_Event.  Therefore, Intruder_Status is included in the "Received By" column of the entry for Air_Status_Evaluated_Event in Appendix C. Note:  An event entry in Appendix C contains only the highest-level states in which transitions generate or receive the event.  The substates of this state having transitions that generate or receive the event are not included in the entry.  For example, the trigger event for transitions within the event are not included in the entry.  For example, the trigger event for transitions within the Air_Status_Evaluated_Event is received by Intruder_Status.  Although this event is also received by  Range_Test,  Advisory, and Crossing, these states are not included in the entry in Appendix C because they are all substates of Intruder_Status.

## Appendix D:  Notation D.1  Basic Statechart Diagrams

Statecharts are finite state machines augmented with hierarchy, parallelism, and modularity. An introduction to basic statechart notation can be found in [Harel86]1.  The notation in this document differs somewhat from basic statecharts while preserving the underlying semantics. A basic state machine is composed of labeled boxes, called *states,* connected by arrows, called transitions (see Figure D-1). Statechart *default*  states, analogous to state machine start states, are signified by states whose connecting transition has no source.  In the example, state A is the default.  New states are directly reachable from current states via transitions.  In the example, states B and C are directly reachable from A.  State D is not directly reachable from A (no transitions connect the two states); however, state D is reachable from A via state *C.*  Transitions define how to get from one state to another. Sections D.2–D.4 describe statechart extensions to basic state machines.  Sections D.5–D.10 describe extensions to basic statecharts incorporated into this document.  Some notations described by [Harel86] are not used or permitted in this document. These include 
 
________________________ 
1[Harel186] David Harel, "Statecharts:  A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems".  *Science of Computer Programming*, 8, 231-
274, 1987. state boundary intersection, the history function, and the event selector. States may be grouped into *superstates.*  Such groupings reduces the number of transitions by allowing transitions to and from the superstate rather than requiring explicit transitions to and from all of the grouped states (substates). There are two ways to enter a superstate.  The transition to the superstate may end at the superstate"s border (transition A in Figure D-2).  In this case, a default state must be specified within the superstate. In the example, state S is entered upon taking transition A. Alternatively, the transition may be made to a particular state inside the superstate (transition B in Figure D-2).  Note that the same superstate may have transitions ending at the border and at any number of states within. The superstate may be exited in two ways (transitions C and D in Figure D-2).  Analogous to transitions into the superstate, transitions out of the superstate may originate from the border or from a state within.  The same superstate may contain both types of exiting transitions. 

D.2  Parallel States A *parallel* state2 contains two or more components, separated by dashed borders (Figure D-3). 

When the parallel state S is entered, *all* of the components *A, B, C,*  and D within it are entered. All components are exited when *any* transition is taken out of the parallel state. Although these states are active in parallel, co-existence of certain states may be prohibited because of their respective transition conditions. ________________________ 
2Parallel states are also known as "orthogonal products", "product states", and "and states". 

## D.3  Statechart Array

A *statechart array* is an ordered vector of identical statecharts.  Figure D-4 shows how arrays are represented in this document.  Each of the statecharts, array elements, is entered when the array is entered.  When the array is exited, all of its statecharts are exited. Individual statecharts in the array may be referenced by the array name and an index value. For example, **My-Array** [3] refers to the third statechart element in the example. Transitions within an element may reference the element value using the token "THIS".  This is useful for passing element identity to a function, e.g., For Other_Aircraft[THIS]. Traffic_Score. 

D.4  Conditional Connective Conditional connectives are used when transitions out of a particular state into two or more different states are taken based on the same event but guarded by different conditions.  (Figure D-5).  The transition from the source state to the connective is taken at the occurrence of the event.  The appropriate destination state is determined based on guarding conditions that are defined on the transitions from the connective to the destination states.  In this document, some guarding conditions may appear as part of source state to connective transition definition if all destination states share those conditions.  The guarding conditions from the connective to the destinations states must be mutually exclusive and must form a tautology. 

 
Note that neither the transition to the connective nor the transition from the connective are complete.  A complete transition begins and ends in a state. In this document, conditional connectives often appear as default "states" (Figure D-5(c)). Conditional connectives are not states.  The actual default state is chosen based on conditions on the transitions out of the conditional connective. 

D.5  Transition Bus Transition buses, are used for highly interconnected statecharts.  A transition must be defined for each source state/destination state pair, where a source state is a state with a transition to the bus and a destination state is a state with a transition from the bus.  Figure D-6 illustrates the transition bus. 

D.6  Transitions Transition definitions contain five parts: 1) the identification, 2) the location, 3) the triggering event, 4) the guarding condition, and 5) the output action. The identification, location, and triggering event are the only required parts. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## D.6.1   Identification

Each transition is identified by its source and destination states: 

|         |
|---------|
|        |
|         |
| State_D |

 Transitions split by a conditional connective are defined in two parts.  The first part of the definition is identified by the connective destination, while the second part is identified by the connective source, 

 
State_S 
 
 
or 
  
 
State_S 

respectively.  If several transitions have the same definition (*i.e.,* the same trigger, condition, and output action), then they may be defined together: 

Transitions(s): 
North 
 
East 
 
South 
  
East 
 
West 
  
East 

 Sometimes a single transition definition applies to all transitions into a particular state.  The special symbol ANY 
may be used as a shorthand for all source states in the identification field.  Note that the current state is excluded from the list of source states when using the ANY shorthand; therefore, the identity transition X  X is not included in an identification field consisting of ANY  X. For example, the above transition identification might be rewritten using this symbol: 

Transitions(s): 
ANY 
 
East 

 D.6.2  Location The location field of the transition definition shows where in the larger statechart the transition may be found.  The location is given as a hierarchical path. The  ""  symbol is used to separate the statechart labels.  For example, Location:  United-States  California  Irvines-76 means that the transition in question may be found in "Irvine", which is in "California," which is in "United-States".  The subscripted lower-case s is the state designator and the subscripted number indicates that the corresponding diagram may be found on page 76. D.6.3  Triggering Event Transitions are taken upon the occurrence of the triggering event, provided that the guarding condition is true (section D.6.4).  There are two types of events, *internal* and *external.*  The subscripted lower_case e is the event designator. Internal events are communicated within the statechart using a broadcast mechanism.  Any transition in any statechart component may trigger any generated internal event (section D.6.5). External events represent explicit communication between separate statecharts.  (Physically distinct system components are modeled as separate statecharts with defined interfaces).  This model does not prohibit the use of external events as triggering events on transitions; however, in this document, external event triggers are restricted to interface definitions (section D.9). In general, an external event begins a chain of internally generated events.  These events order the evaluation of the specified function much like parentheses.  For example, the notation (a*b)+c forces the precedence of the multiplication.   In this document, Effective_SL_Evaluated_Event forces the precedences of Effective_Sensitivity_Level calculation. A transition may also be triggered by the entering of another state.   This has the same effect as if the transition into that state had generated an event that triggers this transition.  For example, the trigger event of "Status **entered** New" on the transition "Sense_Not_Selected  ©" means that when the state of Status is assigned a value of New it outputs an event which will cause the transition "Sense_Not_Selected  ©" to occur. Appendix C summarizes the event definitions at the state and variable level.  This table includes an entry for every event; each entry includes the event name, the states and variables that generate the event, and those that receive the event.  An event entry in Appendix C contains only the highest-level states in which transitions generate or receive the event.  The substates of this state having transitions that generate or receive the event are not included in the entry. 

 
D.6.4  Condition The *condition* defines what must be true before the transition can be taken.  In this document, the condition is specified as an AND/OR table.  The far left column lists the expressions of the condition.  The other columns list values of the expressions.  These columns form disjuncts in the condition; if one of the columns evaluates to true, then the condition is satisfied.  For example, the following AND/OR table has three disjuncts. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

|                   |
|-------------------|
|                   |
| Expression_1      |
| T  F  T           |
| AND  Expression_2 |
| F  F  T           |
|                   |
| Expression_3      |
| T  T  T           |
|                   |
| Expression_4      |
| T  T  F           |

 The condition evaluates to true if any column evaluates to true.  A column evaluates to true if each of the rows, conjuncts, are satisfied. 

A dot (.) is used to indicate that the value of an expression is irrelevant for that column.  For example, OR 

|                   |  Expression_1    |  T  T    |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| AND  Expression_2 | F  .             |          |
|                   | Expression_3     | .  T     |

 is equivalent to 
{Expression_1 and not Expression_2} 
 
or  {Expression_1 and Expression_3} D.6.5  Output Action Output actions identify events that are generated, i.e., occur, when the transition is taken. Internally generated events may be either internal or external events, i.e. they are either broadcast within the statechart or are explicitly sent to another statechart (section D.9). D.7  Macros, Functions and Abbreviations 

## D.7.1  Macros

A macro is a labeled AND/OR table that is referenced in transition tables or in other macros. When transition tables become very complex, macros may be used as abbreviations.  When portions of a condition are used repeatedly on many transitions, macros may be used to reduce redundancy.  The use of macros makes transition tables more readable.  Macros may be parameterized to make them more flexible.  For macros evaluated for a particular Other_Aircraft[i], the parameter "i" is implicit.  The subscripted number on the macro name is a page reference to its definition.  The subscripted lower-case m is the macro designator. Examples of macro references appear in Figure D-7.  Examples of macro definitions appear in Figures D-8 and D-9.  Note that the parameterized macro has two parameters, Lower_Limit and Upper_Limit, whose values are substituted into the table.

|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| AND  Pressure > Upper_Limit | .  T                       |

 

## D.7.2  Functions

Rather than including complex mathematical functions directly in the transition tables, such functions are given names which are referenced in the tables.  Functions return either numerical or text values.  The subscripted number on the function name is a page reference to its definition. The subscripted lower-case f is the function designator. Functions may be parameterized to make them more flexible.  For functions evaluated for a particular Other_Aircraft[i], the parameter "i" is implicit. 

## D.7.3  Abbreviations

An abbreviation is a name which represents either an AND/OR logic table (i.e., a macro which returns either true or false), or a function which produces a numerical or a text value.  Unlike a macro or a function which has wide applicability, an abbreviation is local to a particular state transition table, macro, or function.  An abbreviation is identified by a single- or compound-word name, written in all capital letters and having no attached subscripted page reference. 

D.8  Identity Transitions Identity transitions originate and terminate in the same state.  Identity transitions are taken when no other transitions out of the state are taken.  The need for identity transitions arises when output actions on other transitions out of the state are necessary for synchronization.  Identity transitions generate the necessary output action without causing a state change.  All identity transitions are guarded by the negation of the disjunction of all conditions guarding transitions triggered by the same trigger event and originating in the same state. 

D.9  Interface Some statechart diagrams are divided into three parts separated by double solid lines (Figure D- 10).  The middle part contains statecharts as previously described.  The top and bottom parts contain input and output variables, respectively.  All statechart inputs are non-derived, black-box inputs.   All statechart outputs are derived, black-box outputs.  While all inputs and outputs may be accurately associated with the highest level statechart (and none lower),  a reader"s understanding is enhanced when the variables are associated with appropriate lower-level statecharts (e.g. own aircraft altitude appears on the own aircraft statechart rather than on the high-level TCAS statechart).  Conditional connectives are not states.  The actual default state is chosen based on conditions on the transitions out of the conditional connective. Interface descriptions follow each statechart with associated variables.  Value assignments (state changes) for input variables result from the receipt of a message from another statechart (system component).  The receipt of such a message is signaled in the statechart by the occurrence of an external RECEIVE event.  Each input interface description describes the source and destination of the message, the triggering RECEIVE event and guarding condition, the mapping of message field names and values to variable names and values, and any internally generated events resulting from the receipt of the message.  Value assignments for output variables result from the occurrence of internal events (section D.9.1) The sending of messages to other statecharts (system components) is triggered by internal events.  Each output interface description contains source and destination, the triggering internal event and guarding condition, and the internally generated external SEND event. 

 

## D.9.1  Variable Descriptions

Descriptions are given for all input and output variables.  All variable descriptions contain the following: 
 Location (the associated statechart, e.g., Own_Aircraft). 
 Source or Destination (external component, e.g. altimeter). 
 Type  (e.g., integer). 
 Expected Range (e.g. 10,000 ... 10,000). 
  Granularity (e.g. ,10). 
 Units (e.g., feet). 
 Data Rate (one per second). 
 Notes (Description and Pseudocode Reference). 
 In addition to the above items, output variable descriptions also contain triggering events and value assignments.  The values are assigned at the occurrence of the triggering event.  Internal events may be generated as a result of such value assignments; they are described as output actions. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## When Used Throughout The Document, Variables Are Subscripted By A Lower-Case V And A Page Reference To Its Description. D.10  Time

Transition definitions sometimes contain timeouts relative to state entry.  The transition is to be taken when the time limit has expired.   Rather than define triggering events for such timeouts, they are given as expressions in guarding conditions.  An example of such an expression is t  
(t(**entered** Threat) + 5.0 secs).  This expression states that the current time ("t" without an argument) is greater than or equal to the time that state Threat was entered plus 5.0 seconds. Such expressions  evaluate to true or false and generally appear as disjuncts in AND/OR tables. The current time ("t" without an argument) is the time at the beginning of the processing cycle. D.10.1  Synchrony Hypothesis This hypothesis assumes that the system is infinitely faster than the environment, and hence, the response to an external stimulus is always generated in the same step that the stimulus is introduced.  The synchrony hypothesis is an abstraction that limits the interference that may occur in the time period separating the stimulus from the response, and hence, provides a guaranteed response as a primitive construct.  In later stages of the development of the system, a more realistic modeling of the actual implementation can be done by introducing explicit delay elements if necessary. 

D.11  Constants Constants are defined in Appendix A, Constant Definitions. When constants are used in the CRS, the value of the constant is followed by a subscript consisting of the constant name in parentheses. For example, if the value of RDTHRTA is used in an equation, it will be referenced as 10 ft/s(RDTHRTA). 

D.12  Retained Values The evaluation of some transitions, macros, and functions require previous values of states, macros,  functions, and variables; the time of a previous event is also required in some cases. For purposes of this document, the required value is the value of the state, macro,  function, variable, or event at the end of the previous processing cycle.  The notation PREV(x) refers to the value of x at the end of the previous processing cycle. PREV(x) is undefined for the first evaluation.     Therefore, for all retained values, the value of PREV must be defined for the first cycle.  For example if PREV(Other_Tracked_Range) is used in the evaluation of any transitions, functions, or macros, Other_Tracked_Range1 must be defined.  Other_Tracked_Range1 is the initial value of PREV(Other_Tracked_Range). When the PREV notation refers to a state, two things should be considered.  First, the PREV notation is unnecessary for a reference to a state if the transitions within that state have not yet been evaluated during the current computation cycle.  Second, no specification for the first computation cycle is necessary, if the default states cover this condition.
