## Notes: 1.     Materials:

a.   HOSE AND FITTINGS - PER AS5960. 
b.   THE COLLARS/SOCKETS MAY BE STAINLESS STEEL. c.   SLEEVES - SEE APPLICABLE STANDARDS, TABLE 2. 
/2/ 
THIS HOSE ASSEMBLY SHALL BE QUALIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCUREMENT SPECIFICATION AS5960.  USERS OF THIS STANDARD SHALL PROCURE THE PRODUCT FROM ACCREDITED MANUFACTURERS, OR ACCREDITED DISTRIBUTORS, AS LISTED IN THE PERFORMANCE REVIEW INSTITUTE (PRI) QUALIFIED PRODUCTS LIST PRI-QPL-AS5960 FOR THIS STANDARD WHEN ISSUED.  PRIOR TO PRI-QPL ISSUANCE, USERS OF THIS STANDARD ARE ADVISED TO CONTROL SOURCE APPROVAL(S) BY STANDARD PAGE SUPPLEMENT SHEET OR SIMILAR MEANS.  WHEN ISSUED, REFER TO http://www.pri.sae.org/as5960 FOR CURRENT PRI-QPL ONLINE. 
3. 
CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE PER AS5960.  FITTINGS SHALL BE PERMANENTLY ATTACHED TO HOSE. 
4. 
OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS PER AS5960. 
/5/ 
MARKING:  MARKING SHALL BE PER AS5960 ON A STAINLESS STEEL BAND NOT OVER 1.0 IN WIDE OR ON THE COLLAR.  THE CHARACTERS SHALL BE A MINIMUM OF .06 in HIGH.  THE BAND SHALL BE SO DESIGNED AS TO REMAIN TIGHT ON THE HOSE TO PREVENT RELATIVE MOVEMENT AND RESULTANT CHAFING.  IT SHALL BE OF SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO PREVENT REMOVAL BY HAND.  HOSE ASSEMBLY DATE AND "PT" SYMBOL SHALL BE PERMANENTLY MARKED ON THE BAND OR ON AN END FITTING OR A FIRESLEEVE CLAMP. 
/6/ 
LENGTH "L" IS A FOUR DIGIT NUMBER OF WHICH THE FIRST THREE DIGITS DESCRIBE THE HOSE ASSEMBLY LENGTH IN WHOLE INCHES, AND THE FOURTH DIGIT, THE FRACTION OF AN INCH IN EIGHTHS.  LENGTH "L" IS MEASURED FROM "GAGE POINT" TO "GAGE POINT".  FOR LENGTH TOLERANCES SEE TABLE 3.  TO CONVERT "GAGE POINT" TO "GAGE POINT" TO "END TO END" MEASUREMENT, ADD "D1" AND "D3" FOR NAS1760 END 
STYLE, OR "D2" AND "D4" FOR AS4458 GLOBESEAL END STYLE TO LENGTH "L". 
/7/ 
HOSE ASSEMBLY INSIDE DIAMETER SHALL BE VERIFIED BY PASSING THE DESIGNATED, OR LARGER, SPHERICAL BALL PER TABLE 1 THROUGH THE HOSE ASSEMBLY. 
/8/ 
DISTANCE ACROSS CORNERS OF COUPLING NUT AND NIPPLE OR SOCKET/COLLAR HEX MAY EXCEED THIS DIMENSION. 
/9/ 
FITTING ENDS MUST COMPLY WITH NAS1760, AS4458, OR BE FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT.  DIMENSIONS D1, D3, AND D5 APPLY TO NAS1760 AND D2, D4, AND D6 APPLY TO AS4458.  FITTINGS SHALL MATE WITH prEN6123 OR AS5827.  STANDARD COUPLING NUTS SHALL BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OR FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT TO AS4370, AS1790, OR AS1792 EXCEPT FOR THREAD PITCH. 
/10/  DIAMETERS ARE LISTED FOR CLAMP SELECTION. 
/11/ THE TABLE 2 SLEEVE DIAMETERS FOR AS1072 SLEEV ES APPLY WHEN THE SLEEVE IS COMPRESSED, OR 
CLAMPED TO CONTACT THE HOSE.  IN THIS CASE A WRINKLE MAY OCCUR OVER APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE SLEEVE CIRCUMFERENCE.
