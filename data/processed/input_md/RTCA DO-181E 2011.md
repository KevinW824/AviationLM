## Foreword

 This document is issued as RTCA DO-181E and was prepared by RTCA Special Committee 209 
(SC-209).  It was approved by the RTCA Program Management Committee on March 17, 2011, and supersedes RTCA/DO-181D, Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System/Mode Select (ATCRBS/MODE S) Airborne Equipment, issued October 2, 2008. RTCA, Incorporated is a not-for-profit corporation formed to advance the art and science of aviation and aviation electronic systems for the benefit of the public.  The organization functions as a Federal Advisory Committee and develops consensus based recommendations on contemporary aviation issues. RTCA's objectives include but are not limited to:   
 
- 
coalescing aviation system user and provider technical requirements in a manner that helps government and industry meet their mutual objectives and responsibilities; 
 

- 
analyzing and recommending solutions to the system technical issues that aviation faces as it 
continues to pursue increased safety, system capacity and efficiency; 
 
- 
developing consensus on the application of pertinent technology to fulfill user and provider requirements, including development of minimum operational performance standards for 
electronic systems and equipment that support aviation; and 
- 
assisting in developing the appropriate technical material upon which positions for the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Telecommunication Union 
and other appropriate international organizations can be based. 
 The organization's recommendations are often used as the basis for government and private sector decisions as well as the foundation for many Federal Aviation Administration Technical Standard Orders. Since RTCA is not an official agency of the United States Government, its recommendations may not be regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the U.S. 

government organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations relate.

## 1 Purpose And Scope 1.1 Introduction

This document sets forth minimum operational performance standards for Mode Select 
(Mode S)1
 airborne equipment.  Incorporated within these standards are system characteristics that will be useful to users of the system as well as designers, manufacturers and installers. 

Compliance with these standards is recommended as a means of assuring that the equipment will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in routine operations. 

It is recognized that any regulatory application of these standards is the responsibility of appropriate government agencies. Because the measured values of equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the measurement method, standard test conditions and methods of test are recommended in this document. This document considers an equipment configuration consisting of: transponder, control panel, antenna and interconnecting cables.  It should not be inferred that all Mode S airborne equipment will necessarily include all of the foregoing components as separate units; this will depend on the design configuration chosen by the manufacturer. Additional functions and components that may refer to expanded equipment capabilities are identified as additional capabilities.  Equipment features that are beyond the scope of this document may be developed in future RTCA activities. If the equipment implementation includes a computer software package, the guidelines contained in the most current issue of RTCA/DO-178, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, should be considered.  If the equipment implementation includes design considerations for use in conjunction with TCAS functionality, the guidelines contained in the most current issue of RTCA/DO-185, Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Airborne Equipment, should be considered.   

## 1.2 System Overview 1.2.1 The Function Of Mode S

Mode S is a cooperative surveillance and communication system for air traffic control.  It employs ground-based and airborne sensors (interrogators) and airborne transponders.  
Ground-air-ground data link communications can be accommodated integrally with the surveillance interrogations and replies.  Mode S has been designed as an evolutionary addition to the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) to provide the enhanced surveillance and communication capability required for air traffic control automation.  To facilitate the introduction of Mode S into the ATCRBS system, both ground and airborne Mode S installations include full ATCRBS capability.  Mode S 
interrogators provide surveillance of ATCRBS-equipped aircraft, and Mode S 
transponders will reply to ATCRBS interrogators.  In addition, the data link potential of Mode S permits use of the transponder for a number of air traffic control (ATC) and aircraft separation assurance (ASA) functions. 

The monopulse techniques used in Mode S surveillance allow improved position determination of ATCRBS targets while reducing the number of required interrogations. This reduction of ATCRBS interrogations and replies improves the radio frequency (RF) interference environment. 

A principal feature of Mode S that differs from ATCRBS is that each aircraft is assigned a unique address code.  Using this unique code, interrogations can be directed to a particular aircraft and replies unambiguously identified.  Channel interference is minimized because a sensor can limit its interrogations to targets of interest.  In addition, by proper timing of interrogations, replies from closely-spaced aircraft can be received without mutual interference.  The unique address in each interrogation and reply also permits the inclusion of data link messages to or from a particular aircraft. 

## 1.2.2 Major Operating Characteristics

In order to facilitate a smooth transition from the existing ATCRBS system, Mode S uses the same frequencies for interrogations and replies as ATCRBS (1030 and 1090 MHz, respectively).  The Mode S waveforms (modulation techniques) have been chosen to reduce the interference between ATCRBS and Mode S.  The Mode S interrogation is transmitted using binary differential phase shift keying (DPSK).  With proper demodulation, the information content is detectable in the presence of overlaid ATCRBS signals.  The modulation of the downlink transmission from the transponder is pulse position modulation (PPM) which is inherently resistant to ATCRBS random pulses.  The information content of both uplink and downlink transmissions is further protected by parity check bits generated by a cyclic coding algorithm. 

Each Mode S interrogation contains a 24-bit discrete address which allows a very large number of aircraft to operate in the air traffic control environment without occurrence of a redundant address.  The overlaying of the parity check bits on the discrete address assures that a message will be accepted only by the aircraft addressed and that the probability of an erroneous message being accepted is extremely small. 

Because the interference resistance of the Mode S system relies on the DPSK modulation process on the uplink and the PPM format on the downlink, the DPSK demodulation processor within the transponder must be designed carefully, and precise timing of the downlink pulses is required. 

## 1.2.3 System Performance 1.2.3.1 Surveillance Performance

The Mode S interrogator provides surveillance of all beacon-equipped aircraft (both ATCRBS and Mode S) within its line-of-sight coverage.  The nominal maximum range is 
200 NM.  The Mode S interrogators can provide surveillance of a large number of aircraft with better accuracy than ATCRBS.  With the capability to reinterrogate a target within an antenna scan, the overall surveillance reliability of Mode S is greater than 99 percent. 

## 1.2.3.2 Data Link Performance

Mode S can provide for ground-to-air, air-to-ground and air-to-air data link.  The critical nature of many of the messages carried by Mode S will require a high degree of message integrity.  Error-detecting codes in both interrogations and replies are designed to produce an undetected error rate of better than one in 107.  By requiring technical acknowledgment of a correct message receipt, along with the sensor's capability to re-interrogate, if necessary, a message delivery reliability of greater than 99 percent in one antenna scan is achieved.  The Mode S data link capacity exceeds the maximum data load expected to exist in the foreseeable future. 

## 1.2.4 Basic System Protocol

As an aircraft equipped with a transponder enters the airspace served by a Mode S interrogator, it receives an ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation which has a waveform that can be understood by both ATCRBS and Mode S transponders.  ATCRBS transponders reply with a standard ATCRBS reply format, while Mode S transponders reply with a Mode S format that includes their discrete (24-bit) Mode S address.  This address, together with location of the Mode S aircraft, is entered into a file (put on rollcall), and on the next scan the Mode S-equipped aircraft is discretely addressed.  Since azimuth and range are known for all aircraft on roll-call, they are interrogated according to a precomputed schedule.  Within this schedule are ATCRBS/Mode S All-Calls which permit the tracking of known ATCRBS aircraft and the acquisition of additional ATCRBS and Mode S aircraft entering the served airspace. The discrete interrogations of a Mode S-equipped aircraft contain a command field that may lock out the Mode S transponder to further ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations 
(Mode S lockout).  ATCRBS interrogations originating from ATCRBS interrogators are not affected by this lockout; Mode S transponders reply to ATCRBS interrogations under all circumstances.  As a Mode S aircraft flies into airspace served by another Mode S interrogator, the first Mode S interrogator may pass position information and the aircraft's discrete address via ground lines to the interrogator now providing service.  
Thus, the need to unlock the Mode S transponder may be eliminated, and the second interrogator immediately schedules discrete roll-call interrogations for the aircraft.  In regions where Mode S interrogators are not connected via ground lines, a protocol exists that permits the Mode S transponder to be in a lockout state for only those interrogators which have the aircraft on roll-call.  Therefore, as the aircraft flies into airspace served by a new Mode S interrogator, the new interrogator may acquire the aircraft via its reply to an All-Call interrogation.  The Mode S-Only All-Call is used by interrogators if Mode S 
targets are to be acquired without eliciting replies from ATCRBS targets that may be present. The destination address of this interrogation consists of all ONEs.  All Mode S transponders will reply to this interrogation giving their discrete address.  In turn, an ATCRBS-Only All-Call is used by the interrogator if ATCRBS targets are to be acquired without eliciting replies from Mode S targets. 

Aircraft are tracked by the interrogator throughout its assigned airspace.  A Mode S aircraft reports in its replies either its altitude or its ATCRBS 4096 code depending on the type of discrete interrogation received.  During each scan, interrogations of ATCRBS aircraft are made in both Mode A and Mode C. If, on scanning through a Mode S-equipped aircraft's location, the interrogator does not receive a valid reply, it can re-interrogate a limited number of times.  Interrogators normally interrogate at low power and re-interrogate at high power when the low power attempt fails.  
Several ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations are transmitted during the time each ATCRBS target is in the beam.  Thus both ATCRBS and Mode S aircraft are served when flying through the system with a minimum of RF channel loading. 

## 1.2.5 Mode S Message Content 1.2.5.1 Address/Parity

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
All discrete Mode S interrogations (56-bit or 112-bit) and replies (except the All-Call reply) contain the 24-bit discrete address of the Mode S transponder upon which 24 errordetecting parity check bits are overlaid.  In the All-Call reply, the 24 parity check bits are overlaid on the Mode S interrogator's address, and the transponder's discrete address is included in the clear in the text of the reply. 

## 1.2.5.2 Surveillance

The primary function of Mode S is surveillance.  For the Mode S transponder, this function can be accomplished by use of "short" (56-bit) transmissions in both directions. In these transmissions, the aircraft reports its altitude or ATCRBS 4096 code as well as its flight status (airborne, on the ground, alert, Special Position Identification [SPI], etc.). 

There are two types of squitter transmissions, i.e., transmissions spontaneously generated by the transponder.  The short (56-bit) squitter has the format of an All-Call reply 
(DF=11) and is transmitted by a transponder approximately once every second.  This squitter is received and used by aircraft equipped with TCAS to detect the presence and 24-bit address of Mode S equipped aircraft within signal range.  The extended (112-bit) 
squitter (DF=17) contains the same fields as the short squitter, plus a 56-bit message field that is used to broadcast Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) data approximately four times per second.  The Extended Squitter is used by TCAS or other air-air applications, and ground ATC users for passive air and surface surveillance.  
"Special surveillance" interrogations from airborne collision avoidance systems are addressed to Mode S-equipped aircraft based upon the address extracted from squitter signals.  These interrogations are used for Mode S target tracking and collision threat assessment. 

## 1.2.5.3 Data Link Communications

The discrete addressing and digital encoding of Mode S transmissions permit their use as a digital data link.  The interrogation and reply formats of the Mode S system contain sufficient coding space to permit the transmission of data.  Such data transmissions may be used for air traffic control purposes, air-to-air data interchange for collision avoidance, or may be used to provide flight advisory services such as weather reports, Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS), etc. Most Mode S data link transmissions will be handled as one 56-bit message included as part of "long" (112-bit) interrogations or replies.  These transmissions include the message in addition to surveillance data and thus will generally be used in place of, rather than in addition to, a surveillance interrogation and/or reply. An efficient transmission of longer messages is accomplished by the extended length message (ELM) capability.  Using this capability, a sequence of up to 16 80-bit message segments (each within a 112-bit transmission) can be transmitted, either ground-to-air or air-to-ground and can be acknowledged with a single reply/interrogation.  ELMs do not contain surveillance data and thus cannot substitute for a surveillance interrogation-reply cycle. 

 

## 1.3 Operational Goals

Mode S is a combined secondary surveillance radar and a potential ground-air-ground data link system capable of providing aircraft surveillance and communications necessary to support automated ATC in the dense traffic environments expected in the future.  It is capable of common-channel interoperation with the ATC beacon system and thus may be implemented over an extended ATCRBS to Mode S transition period.  In supporting ATC automation, Mode S is capable of providing the reliable communications necessary for data link services. 

 

## 1.4 Operational Applications

 

## 1.4.1 The Atcrbs Environment

A great majority of the combined civil and military aircraft fleets are equipped with ATCRBS transponders.  In terms of exposure to the ATC system, this implementation is estimated to be greater than 90 percent of the hours flown. 

Because of operating requirements, approximately one half of transponder-equipped civil aircraft have altitude reporting (Mode C) capability. Requirements for operation in high altitude airspace and in specific high density terminal control areas have caused an increase in the number of aircraft equipped with Mode C. 

 

## 1.4.2 The Mode S Environment

Mode S offers more options for the aircraft operator than ATCRBS.  Different levels of service may be available to satisfy varying user requirements. 

## 1.4.3 Mode S Transponder Levels Mode S Transponders Provide For Both Ground-To-Air And Air-To-Air Surveillance.

The data link function of Mode S transponders provides for information transfer in both directions between ground and air and between airborne units.  Data link implementation varies and depends on the amount of information to be exchanged. Possible implementation configurations and additional transponder features are summarized in the following paragraphs. 

## 1.4.3.1 Level 1 Transponders

The Level 1 Transponder supports the surveillance functions of both ATCRBS and Mode S ground sensors and the surveillance functions of airborne interrogators.  This transponder can also reply to an airborne interrogator thereby making its presence known; 
to do this, it need only handle short interrogations and replies. 

Level 1 Transponders **shall** have the capabilities prescribed for: 
 
a. Mode A identity and Mode C pressure-altitude reporting, b. ATCRBS/Mode-S all-call and Mode S-only all-call transactions, 
c. Addressed surveillance altitude and identity transaction, 
d. Lockout protocols, e. Basic data protocols except data link capability reporting, and f. Air-to-air service and squitter transactions. 
Note:
 Level 1 permits SSR surveillance based on pressure-altitude reporting and the Mode A identity code.  In an SSR Mode S environment, technical performance relative to a Mode A/C transponder is improved because of Mode S selective aircraft interrogation. 

## 1.4.3.2 Level 2 Transponders

Level 2 Transponders **shall** have the capabilities of §1.4.3.1 and additionally support the receipt of long interrogations and the generation of long replies.  The Level 2 Transponder supports all of the surveillance functions and also supports: 

a. 
Bi-directional air-to-air information exchange 
b. 
Ground-to-air data uplink, Comm-A 
c. 
Air-to-ground data downlink, Comm-B 
d. 
Multisite message protocol 
e. 
Data link capability reporting 
f. 
Aircraft identification reporting 
g. 
TCAS/ACAS crosslink capability 
h. 
Overlay Command Capability (see §2.2.19.1.12.1, §2.2.19.1.12.2 & 
§2.2.19.1.12.6.2) 
The ground-air-ground data link capability comprises a multitude of services and can be implemented according to the number and kind of services available, depending on the mission requirements of the aircraft.  Protocols provide a means of reporting to the ground the specifics of each individual installation.   
Specific capabilities of a Level 2 or higher transponder have been defined for operation in European airspace.  Requirements for Elementary Surveillance (ELS) and Enhanced Surveillance (EHS) compliant transponders are included in this document (§2.2.24 and 
§2.2.25).  Specific data registers and content appropriate for these capabilities are provided.   

## 1.4.3.3 Level 3 Transponders (Uplink Elm Capability)

In addition to the capabilities of the Level 1 and Level 2 Transponders, the Level 3 transponder is able to receive ELMs from the ground.  ELMs are received in the Comm-
C format and consist of a burst of uplink transmissions that need not be replied to individually but are acknowledged in a reply containing a summary of the received interrogations. 

Level 3 Transponders **shall** have the capabilities of §1.4.3.2 and also those prescribed for ground-to-air Extended Length Message (ELM) communications. 

Note:
 Level 3 permits extended length data link communications from ground-to-air 
and thus may provide retrieval from ground-based data banks and receipt of 
other air traffic services which are not available with Level 2 transponders. 

## 1.4.3.4 Level 4 Transponders (Full Elm Capability)

In addition to all the capabilities of a Level 3 Transponder, the Level 4 Transponder can generate ELMs for transmittal to the ground by using the Comm-D format. 

Level 4 transponders **shall** have the capabilities of §1.4.3.3 and also those prescribed for air-to-ground extended length message (ELM) communications. 

Note:
 Level 4 permits extended length data link communications from air to ground 
and thus may provide access from the ground to airborne data sources and the transmission of other data required by air traffic services which are not available with Level 2 transponders. 

## 1.4.3.5 Level 5 Transponders (Enhanced Data Link Protocol Capability)

In addition to the full ELM capability, the Level 5 Transponder can support the enhanced data link protocols.  The protocols provide for increased data link capacity by permitting data link transactions with more than one Mode S interrogator at a time without the need for multisite coordination.  These protocols are fully conformant to the data link transponder protocols description of §2.2.19.1 to §2.2.20.2.1 (the standard protocols) and are therefore compatible with interrogators that are not equipped for the enhanced protocol. 

Level 5 transponders **shall** have the capabilities of §1.4.3.4 and also those prescribed for enhanced Comm-B and extended length message (ELM) communications. 

Note:
 Level 5 permits Comm-B and extended length data link communications with 
multiple interrogators without requiring the use of multisite reservations.  The 
Level 5 Transponder has a higher minimum data link capacity than the other transponder levels. 

## 1.4.4 Optional Additional Features

Some transponder installations may support additional features: 

- 
TCAS Compatibility - TCAS compatible transponders will have the capabilities 
described in §1.4.3.2, §1.4.3.3, §1.4.3.4 or §1.4.3.5, (see §2.2.22). 
 
- 
Antenna Diversity - in aircraft with gross mass in excess of 5700 kg or a maximum 
cruising true airspeed capability in excess of 324 km/h (175 kt), or co-installation with airborne collision avoidance systems may require the transponder to operate in the diversity mode, i.e., the use of two antennas, receivers and transmitting channels. 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

 
- 
Extended Squitter - Extended squitter transponders will have the capabilities of 
§1.4.3.2, §1.4.3.3, §1.4.3.4 or §1.4.3.5 also in addition to those prescribed for 
extended squitter operation (see §2.2.23).   The requirements for Extended Squitter 
message formats and information content are contained in the Minimum Operational 
Performance Standards for 1090 MHz Extended Squitter Automatic Dependent 
Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) and Traffic Information Services - Broadcast 
(TIS-B) (RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A or latest version).

adhere to the requirements contained in Appendix D. 
 
- 
Elementary Surveillance - elementary surveillance transponders will have the 
capabilities of §1.4.3.2, §1.4.3.3, §1.4.3.4 or §1.4.3.5 in addition to those 
requirements prescribed for elementary surveillance operation (see §2.2.24). 
 
- 
Enhanced Surveillance - enhanced surveillance transponders will have the 
capabilities of §1.4.3.2, §1.4.3.3, §1.4.3.4 or §1.4.3.5 in addition to those 
requirements prescribed for enhanced surveillance operation (see §2.2.25).   
 
- 
Surveillance Identifier Code (SI) - transponders with the ability to process SI 
codes have the capabilities of §1.4.3.1, §1.4.3.2, §1.4.3.3, §1.4.3.4 or §1.4.3.5 (see 
§2.2.14.4.37).   
 
These additional features and corresponding identification codes are summarized in Table 
1-1.   

| Additional Features                         | ID Code    |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| TCAS Compatibility                          | a          |

 SI capability is included by meeting the requirements in these MOPS. 

 

## 1.4.5 Minimum Output Power Level Designation

Two minimum peak output power levels are supported by this version of these MOPS, 125 watts (21.0 dBW), which is designated as Class 1 equipment, and 70 watts (18.5 dBW), which is designated as Class 2 equipment.  For more information on output power levels, see §2.2.3.2.   
Class 1 equipment is intended for use in aircraft that operate at altitudes above 15000 ft, or have a maximum cruising true airspeed in excess of 175 kt (324 km/h). Class 2 equipment may be used in aircraft that operate at altitudes not exceeding 15000 ft, and have a maximum cruising true airspeed not exceeding 175 kt (324 km/h).   
 Level 4 or 5 transponders are not expected to be developed using Class 2 power. 

Note:

## 1.4.6 Transponder Labeling

Each transponder **shall** be clearly labeled with its actual functional level, minimum peak output power, and its optional additional features.  The label **shall** contain the word 
"Level" followed by one digit between 1 and 5. (see §1.4.3.1 through §1.4.3.5), followed by the ID Codes for the incorporated optional additional features as shown in Table 1-1, followed by the transponders' minimum peak output power designation as "Class 1" or "Class 2" (see §1.4.5).   
Example 1 - For a Level 2 transponder that incorporates Extended Squitter, Elementary Surveillance and SI capabilities with a minimum peak output power of 70 watts (18.5 dBW): the transponder would be labeled "Level 2els, Class 2." 
Example 2 - For a Level 4 transponder that incorporates TCAS compatibility, antenna diversity, Extended Squitter, Enhanced Surveillance and SI capabilities, with a minimum peak output power of 125 watts (21.0 dBW), the transponder would be labeled "Level 
4adens, Class 1." 
The label should be clearly visible when the transponder is mounted on the aircraft.  In the case of a change of transponder level or capability, the label must be changed appropriately. 

Note:
 For transponders where "Level" or "additional features" might be changed through an approved software update, a means to display the labeling electronically would meet the above intent.   

## 1.4.7 Use Of The Mode S Data Link

The foregoing operational categories include Mode S applications for aircraft separation assurance services.  In addition, the data link is available for other uses including: 

a. 
flight advisory information delivered to the pilot. 
b. 
visual confirmation of ATC instructions. 
c. 
pilot participation in ATC through use of an advanced display. 
d. 
future automation of ATC. 
 

## 1.4.8 Airborne Equipment

The transponder is the principal avionics component of Mode S.  It performs all the necessary surveillance functions by providing the appropriate reply to ATCRBS and Mode S interrogations addressed to the aircraft. 

When used for data link transmissions, the transponder accepts the message as it arrives as part of an interrogation and passes it on to its destination.  A message to be transmitted to the ground is accepted by the transponder at the interface and is incorporated in a reply made to an interrogation. 

All Mode S transmissions, uplink as well as downlink, are protected by a 24-bit parity code.  The transponder performs decoding and encoding as required, so that the surveillance function as well as the message content is protected. By keeping most data link functions separate from the basic transponder functions, the complexity of the basic transponder has been kept at the minimum required for its surveillance function.  The additional complexity associated with the ground-to-air data link function is incurred only by users desiring that service. Some Mode S transponders may be equipped with uplink and downlink message interfaces providing interaction with input/output (I/O) devices.  Some transponders may include the devices as an integral part of their design. 

## 1.5 Assumptions

This document defines the basic surveillance and data link characteristics of Mode S transponders.  It is assumed that as applications of the Mode S data link mature, provisions necessary to support these applications will be designed and implemented within the system constraints set forth by this document. 

## 1.6 Test Procedures

The specified test procedures and associated limits are intended as one means of demonstrating compliance with the minimum acceptable performance parameters. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the test organization.  These alternate methods may be used if they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. 

The order of tests suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of different tests as it moves from design and design qualification into operational use.  For example, the equipment should have demonstrated compliance with the requirements of Section §2.0 as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section §3.0. 

Three types of test procedures are included which should be used at different stages in the equipment approval cycle.  These are discussed in the following paragraphs. 

## 1.6.1 Environmental Tests

Environmental tests are specified in Subsection §2.3.  The procedures and their associated limit requirements are intended to provide a means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations.  Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance in preparation of installation instructions and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture. 

## 1.6.2 Detailed Test Procedures

Detailed test procedures for hardware qualifications in ambient conditions are specified in Subsection §2.4.  The test procedures contained in Subsection §2.5 verify the transponder's surveillance and communication protocols.  These tests are conducted at the equipment level and are intended to provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Subsections §2.1 and §2.2.  Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance, for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture.  Test procedures provided in §2.6 and §2.7 verify the transponder's Elementary and Enhanced Surveillance Capabilities for requirements in §2.2.24 and 
§2.2.25.  Test procedures in §2.8 provide generic test procedures for interim use when Ground Initiated Comm-B Registers are added for requirements in §2.2.26.   

 

## 1.6.3 Installed System Tests

The installed system test procedures and their associated requirements are specified in Section §3.0.  Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included in the installed system tests, their successful completion is a precondition to completion of the installed tests.  In certain instances, however, installed system tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from or to other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc.  Installed tests are normally performed under two conditions:   

 
a. 
with the aircraft on the ground and using simulated or operational system inputs, and/or 
 
b. 
with the aircraft in flight using operational system signals appropriate to the equipment under test. 
 
Test results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the intended operational environment. In addition, the ground test procedures may be used as an optional check of equipment performance following corrective maintenance.

## 2 Mode S Transponder Equipment Performance Requirements And Test Procedures 2.1 General Requirements For All Equipment 2.1.1 Airworthiness

The design and manufacture of the equipment **shall** provide for installation that does not impair the airworthiness of the aircraft. 

 

## 2.1.2 General Performance

The equipment **shall** perform its intended function as defined by the manufacturer, and its proper use shall not create a hazard to users of the National Airspace System (NAS). 

## 2.1.3 Federal Communications Commission Rules

The equipment **shall** comply with all applicable rules of the Federal Communications Commission. 

## 2.1.4 Fire Protection

Except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire, all materials used **shall** be self-extinguishing. 

 

## 2.1.5 Operation Of Controls

The operation of controls intended for use during flight, in all possible combinations and sequences, shall not result in a condition detrimental to the continued performance of the equipment (see §2.1.2).  The operation of controls, intended for use during flight, should be designed and evaluated to ensure that they are logical and tolerant to human error.  In particular, where transponder functions are integrated with other system controls, the equipment manufacturer (transponder and controls) should ensure that unintentional transponder mode switching (i.e., an operational state to 'STANDBY' or 'OFF') is minimized.  This may take the form of a confirmation of mode switching, required by the flight crew.  Typically 'Line Select' Keys, 'Touch Screen' or 'Cursor Controlled/Trackball' methods used to change transponder modes should be carefully designed to minimize crew error.   
All possible positions, combinations and sequences of pilot accessible controls **shall not** 
result in a condition detrimental to the continued performance of the equipment or continued safe flight of the aircraft.   
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The flight crew should be aware, at all times, of the operational state of the transponder.  
If either the operational state selection, or fail warning of the transponder are not visible to the flight crew, any change of the operational state of the transponder **shall** be annunciated to the flight crew via suitable means.  An installation evaluation may be required to determine the adequacy of the annunciation means.   

## 2.1.6 Accessibility Of Controls

Controls that are not normally adjusted in flight shall not be readily accessible to flight personnel. 

## 2.1.7 Flight Crew Control Functions

The following functions **shall** be provided. 

a. A means of selecting each of the ATCRBS 4096 reply codes, and of indicating the 
code selected. 
b. A means of selecting the air/ground state:   
1) An automatic means **shall** be the only acceptable means to determine the 
air/ground state.   
2) If an automatic means is not available, the transponder **shall** ensure that the 
air/ground state is Airborne.   
c. A means of selecting the condition in which all transponder functions, other than 
transmission on the reply frequency and associated self-testing, are operational (i.e., 
the Standby condition).  Return to normal operation from this condition **shall** be 
possible within five seconds. 
d. A means of initiating the IDENT (SPI) feature. 
e. A means of inhibiting the transmission of the altitude information, while retaining the 
ATCRBS framing pulses in ATCRBS Mode C replies and while transmitting all ZEROs in the altitude field of Mode S replies. 
f. 
If the aircraft uses a flight number for aircraft identification, a means **shall** be 
provided for the variable aircraft identification to be inserted by the pilot while on the ground, or during flight.  The means for modifying and displaying aircraft 
identification **shall** be a simple crew action independent of the entry of other flight 
data.   

## 2.1.8 Optional Crew Control Functions

On an optional basis, other functions may be provided. 

## 2.1.9 Effects Of Tests

Unless otherwise provided, the application of the specified tests **shall** produce no subsequently discernible condition detrimental to the continued performance of the equipment. 

## 2.1.10 Equipment Configuration

It is not the intention of this performance standard to preclude manufacturers from establishing interfaces between the transponder, antenna, control panel and input/output devices and obtaining regulatory approval of these components.  

Note:
 For example, a transponder system with a remote control panel may have several 
panel configurations available to meet the needs of various aircraft types.  The manufacturer is allowed to establish control panel interface standards and receive approval of the various panel designs without performing tests on the total system for each panel design. 

## 2.1.11 Interrogation Signals

The following paragraphs describe the signal in space as it can be expected to appear at the transponder's antenna.  Because signals can be corrupted in transmission, tolerances for interrogator performance are more restrictive and should not be derived from this document.  The signals in space comprise two types of interrogations distinguished by different modulation techniques: pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and DPSK signals. 

## 2.1.11.1 Interrogation Carrier Frequency

The carrier frequency of received interrogations is: 

a. 1030 ±0.2 MHz from ATCRBS interrogators. 
b. 1030 ±0.01 MHz from Mode S interrogators.   
Note:
 The 1030 MHz transmitter can generate phase reversal using different methods.  
This includes hard keying with strong amplitude drop and rapid phase reversal or IQ modulation with little or no amplitude drop, but with a frequency shift of several MHz during the phase reversal.   

## 2.1.11.2 Measurement Convention

Pulse Amplitude is defined in relation to another pulse and is measured between pulse peaks. 

Pulse Duration is measured between the half voltage points of the leading and trailing edges. 

Pulse Rise Time is measured as the time interval between 10 percent and 90 percent of peak amplitude on the leading edge of the pulse. 

Pulse Decay Time is measured as the time interval between 90 percent and 10 percent of peak amplitude on the trailing edge of the pulse. 

Pulse-to-Pulse Intervals are measured between the half voltage points of their leading edges. 

Phase Reversal Location is measured from the 90-degree point of the phase transition. Phase Reversal Duration is measured between the 10 and 170-degree points of the transition. 

Phase Reversal Intervals are measured between 90-degree points of the transitions. 

## 2.1.11.3 Received Pam Signals

The following interrogations are exclusively PAM signals: 

- 
ATCRBS Mode A 
- 
ATCRBS Mode C 
- 
ATCRBS Mode A/Mode S All-Call 
- 
ATCRBS Mode C/Mode S All-Call 
- 
ATCRBS Mode A-Only All-Call 
- 
ATCRBS Mode C-Only All-Call 
All of these interrogations use two or more of the four pulses shown in §2.1.11.3.2.  The pulses are labeled P1, P2, P3 and P4.

## 2.1.11.3.3 Relative Pulse Amplitudes

P2 amplitudes will vary from P1. 

P3 amplitudes are P1 ±1 dB. 

P4 amplitudes are P3 ±1 dB. 

 

## 2.1.11.4 Received Dpsk Signals

All Mode S (P6 type) interrogations are DPSK signals.  They are structured as shown in Figure 2-2. 

 
 
Note:
 The P1 - P2 pair preceding P6 suppresses replies from ATCRBS transponders to avoid synchronous garble caused by random triggering of ATCRBS transponders by the Mode S interrogation.  A series of "chips" containing the information within P6 starts 0.5 microsecond after the sync phase reversal.  A chip is an unmodulated interval of 0.25-microsecond duration preceded by possible phase reversals.  If preceded by a phase reversal, a chip represents a ONE.  If preceded by no phase reversal, a chip represents a ZERO.  There are either 56 or 112 chips.  The last chip is followed by a 0.5-microsecond guard interval which prevents the trailing edge of P6 from interfering with the demodulation process. 

 

## 2.1.11.4.1 Pulse Shapes

Pulses P1, P2 and P5 have the same shapes as pulses P1, P2 and P3 of §2.1.11.3.1. 

P6 is either 16.25 ±0.25 microseconds or 30.25 ±0.25 microseconds in duration.  Its rise time is between 0.05 and 0.1 microseconds, and the decay time is between 0.05 and 0.2 microseconds. 

 

## 2.1.11.4.2 Relative Pulse Amplitudes

The P2 amplitude is not more than 0.25 dB below the amplitude of P1.  The first microsecond of P6 has amplitude not more than 0.25 dB below the amplitude of P1.  The amplitude variation of the envelope of P6 is less than 1 dB.  Amplitude variation between successive phase modulation chips in P6 is less than 0.25 dB. 

## 2.1.11.4.3 Phase Reversals

The first phase reversal within P6 is the sync phase reversal.  The midpoint of each following data phase reversal can occur only at a time 0.25 N ±0.02 microseconds (where N is larger than or equal to 2) after the sync phase reversal.   

Note:
 The 1030 MHz transmitter can generate phase reversal using different methods.  
This includes hard keying with strong amplitude drop and rapid phase reversal or IQ modulation with little or no amplitude drop but with frequency shift during the phase reversal and slow phase reversal (80ns).   
 

## 2.1.11.4.4 Spacings

Spacings are provided below in microseconds. 

 

P1 - P2 
2.00 ±0.05 
P2 to sync phase reversal 
2.75 ±0.05 
P6 to sync phase reversal 
1.25 ±0.05 
P5 to sync phase reversal 
0.40 ±0.05 

 
P5 may be overlaid on P6 by the interrogator as an SLS signal in any Mode S 
interrogation.  It will be overlaid on all Mode S-Only All-Call interrogations. 

 

## 2.1.11.4.5 Information Content

DPSK signals contain information in data chips within P6.  The chips are located after the possible data phase reversals assigned as indicated in §2.1.11.4.3.  The short or long P6 
pulses have 56 and 112 chips, respectively.  A phase reversal preceding a chip characterizes that chip as ONE.  No preceding phase reversal denotes a ZERO. 

 

## 2.2 Minimum Performance Standards - Standard Conditions And Signals

Note:
 Systems using Mode S capabilities are generally used for air traffic control 
surveillance systems.  In addition, certain ATC applications may use Mode S emitters e.g., for vehicle surface surveillance or for fixed target detection on surveillance systems.  Under such specific conditions, the term "aircraft" can be understood as "aircraft or vehicle" (A/V).  While those applications may use a limited set of data, any deviation from standard physical characteristics must be considered very carefully by the appropriate authorities.  They must take into account not only their own surveillance (SSR) environment, but also possible effects on other systems like TCAS.  

## 2.2.1 Definition Of Standard Conditions

The signal levels specified in this subsection exist at the antenna end of a transponder-toantenna transmission line of loss equal to the maximum for which the transponder is designed. 

Note:
 The transponder will usually be installed with less than the designed maximum 
transmission line loss.  Nevertheless, the standard conditions of this document are based on the maximum design value. 
 

## 2.2.2 Receiver Characteristics

Note:
 Although receiver characteristics for frequency and bandwidth in subparagraphs 
§2.2.2.1 through §2.2.2.4 are specified in terms of ATCRBS interrogations and replies, the specifications are adequate for both ATCRBS and Mode-S interrogations. 
 

## 2.2.2.1 Interrogation Tolerances

Paragraph §2.1.11 and its subparagraphs define a number of deviations allowed in the interrogation values.  The transponder **shall** be tolerant to all such deviations within the ranges specified in §2.1.11.   

1. The 1030 MHz transmitter can generate phase reversal using different methods.  This 
includes hard keying with strong amplitude drop and rapid phase reversal or IQ modulation with little or no amplitude drop, but with frequency shift during the phase reversal and slow phase reversal (80ns).   
2. The transponder cannot make any assumption on the type of modulation technology 
used and therefore cannot rely on the specificities of the signal during the phase 
reversal to detect a phase reversal.   
 

## 2.2.2.2 Sensitivity Variation With Frequency

The RF input level required to produce 90 percent replies **shall not** vary by more than 1 
dB and **shall** at no time be greater than a level of -69 dBm for standard ATCRBS 
interrogation signals in the frequency range between 1029.8 and 1030.2 MHz.   

 

## 2.2.2.3 Bandwidth

The standard ATCRBS interrogation signal required to trigger the transponder below 
1005 MHz and above 1055 MHz **shall** be at least 60 dB stronger than that required to trigger the transponder at 1030 MHz with the same reply efficiency. 

Note:
 There is no requirement that the 3 dB bandwidth and the skirt ratio be tested.  It 
is known that a 3 dB bandwidth of 6 MHz and a 40 dB bandwidth of 30 MHz will be optimum for Mode S performance in the presence of ATCRBS interference and will be near optimum for ATCRBS performance. 

## 2.2.2.4 Sensitivity And Dynamic Range

Given an interrogation that requires a reply, the minimum triggering level (MTL) is defined as the minimum input power level that results in a 90 percent reply ratio if the interrogation signal has all nominal pulse spacings and widths and if the replies are the correct replies assigned to the interrogation format.   

a. The MTL for ATCRBS and ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations **shall** be -73 
dBm ±4 dB. 
b. The MTL for Mode S format (P6 type) interrogations **shall** be -74 dBm ±3 dB. 
c. The reply ratio **shall** be at least 99 percent for all Mode S (P6 type) interrogations 
between MTL +3 dB and -21 dBm. 
d. The reply ratio **shall not** be more than 10 percent for interrogations at signal levels 
below -81 dBm. 
e. The variation of the MTL between ATCRBS Mode A and Mode C interrogations 
shall not exceed 1 dB. 
f. 
The reply ratio **shall** be at least 90 percent for ATCRBS and ATCRBS/Mode S All-
Call interrogations between MTL +3 dB and -21 dBm.   
g. The spurious ATCRBS reply ratio resulting from low level Mode-S interrogations 
shall be no more than: 
1. An average of 1% in the input interrogation signal range between -81 dBm and 
the Mode-S MTL, and 
2. A maximum of 3% at any given amplitude in the input interrogation signal range 
between -81 dBm and the Mode-S MTL.  

## 2.2.3 Transmitter Characteristics 2.2.3.1 Reply Transmission Frequency

The carrier frequency of all downlink transmissions from transponders with Mode S 
capabilities **shall** be 1090 MHz plus or minus 1 MHz. 

## 2.2.3.2 Rf Peak Output Power

The RF peak output power of each pulse of each reply at the terminals of the antenna shall be: 

a. minimum RF peak power for equipment intended for installation in aircraft that 
operate at altitudes not exceeding 15000 feet and that have a normal cruising speed 
less than 175 knots: 18.5 dBW (70 W). 
b. minimum RF peak power for equipment intended for installation in aircraft that have 
a normal cruising speed in excess of 175 knots: 21.0 dBW (125 W). 
c. minimum RF peak power for equipment intended for installation in aircraft that 
operate at altitudes above 15000 feet: 21.0 dBW (125 W). 
d. maximum RF peak power for all equipment: 27.0 dBW (500 W). 

## 2.2.3.3 Unwanted Output Power

When the transponder transmitter is in the inactive state, the RF output power at 1090 ±3 
MHz at the terminals of the antenna shall not exceed -50 dBm.  The inactive state is defined to include the entire period between ATCRBS and/or Mode S transmissions less 10-microsecond transition periods, if necessary, preceding and following the extremes of the transmission. 

1. This is necessary to ensure that Mode S-equipped aircraft operating as near as 0.1 
NM to an ATCRBS or Mode S sensor will not degrade the operation of that sensor. Also, an on-board 1090 MHz receiver, e.g., a collision avoidance system (CAS) 
installation, may be interfered with by CW radiation from the transponder. Therefore, lower unwanted CW power output may be required for use in aircraft installations where sufficient isolation cannot be achieved.  
 
2. If the transponder is used in conjunction with TCAS equipment, the RF power in the 
inactive state at 1090 ±3 MHz at the terminals of the Mode S transponder antenna 
must not exceed -70 dBm in accordance with §2.2.22.f.     

## 2.2.3.4 Reply Rate Capability

The total reply rate over each time interval specified below **shall** be the sum of the individual ATCRBS and Mode S reply rates over this interval, and **shall** be in addition to any squitter transmissions that the transponder is required to make.   

## 2.2.3.4.1 Atcrbs Reply Rate Capability

a. The transponder **shall** be able to continuously generate at least 500 ATCRBS 
15-pulse replies per second.  
b.  For Class 1 equipment, the transponder **shall** be capable of a peak reply rate of 1200 
ATCRBS 15-pulse replies per second for a duration of 100 milliseconds.  
c.  For Class 2 equipment, the transponder **shall** be capable of a peak reply rate of 1000 
ATCRBS 15-pulse replies per second for a duration of 100 milliseconds. 
1. A 15-pulse reply includes 2 framing pulses, the 12 information pulses, and the SPI 
pulse. 
2. The reply rate requirement of 500 replies per second establishes the minimum 
continuous reply rate capability of the transponder.  As per the altitude and speed criteria above, the 100 or 120 replies in a 100 millisecond interval defines the peak 
capability of the transponder.  The transponder must be capable of replying to this short term burst rate, but may not be capable of sustaining this rate.  If the transponder is subjected to interrogation rates beyond its reply rate capability, the reply rate limit control of §2.2.7.3.1 acts to gracefully desensitize the transponder in a manner that favors closer interrogators.  Desensitization eliminates weaker interrogation signals.

## 2.2.3.4.2 Mode S Reply Rate Capability

a. A transponder equipped for only short Mode S downlink formats (DF), **shall** have the 
following minimum reply rate capabilities: 

50 Mode S replies in any 1-second interval.  
18 Mode S replies in a 100-millisecond interval. 8 Mode S replies in a 25-millisecond interval.  
4 Mode S replies in a l.6-millisecond interval. 

b. A transponder equipped for long Mode S reply formats **shall** be able to transmit as 
long replies: 

At least 16 of the 50 Mode S replies in any 1-second interval. 
At least 6 of the 18 Mode S replies in a 100-millisecond interval. 
At least 4 of the 8 Mode S replies in a 25-millisecond interval. 
At least 2 of the 4 Mode S replies in a l.6-millisecond interval. 

c. A transponder equipped with the enhanced data link protocols (see §2.2.21) **shall** be 
able to transmit as long replies: 

At least 24 of the 50 Mode S replies in any 1-second interval. At least 9 of 18 Mode S replies in a 100-millisecond interval. 
At least 6 of 8 Mode S replies in a 25 millisecond interval. 
At least 2 of 4 Mode S replies in a 1.6 millisecond interval.  

All of the above reply rates **shall** be in addition to any squitter transmissions that the transponder is required to make. 

Note:
 Higher reply rates are required by a TCAS-compatible transponder (see 
§
.b). 

2.2.22

## 2.2.3.5 Mode S Elm Peak Reply Rate

At least once every second, a transponder equipped for ELM downlink operation **shall** 
have the capability of transmitting, in a 25-millisecond interval, 25 percent more segments than have been announced in the initialization. 

Note:
 Transponders may exist which are capable of transmitting less than the maximum allowable number of Comm-D segments in one burst.  The requirement for 25 percent surplus transmitting capacity is derived from the possible need for reinterrogation. 

## 2.2.4 Reply Pulse Characteristics

The signals in space comprise two types of replies distinguished by different modulation techniques: PAM and PPM signals.   

## 2.2.4.1 Atcrbs Replies 2.2.4.1.1 Framing Pulses

The reply function **shall** use two framing pulses nominally spaced 20.3 microseconds apart. 

## 2.2.4.1.2 Information Pulses

The designators of the information pulses and their positions from the first framing pulse shall be: 

| PULSE    |   POSITION (in microseconds)  |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Cl       |                          1.45 |

| D4       |                         18.85 |

*  The X pulse is referenced here for possible future use (see §2.2.13.1.2). 

## 2.2.4.1.3 Atcrbs-Spi

In addition to the information pulses provided, an SPI pulse, which may be used with any of the other information pulses upon request, **shall** be provided at a spacing of 4.35 
microseconds following the last framing pulse.  The SPI pulse **shall** be initiated by an IDENT switch.  Upon activation of the IDENT switch, the SPI pulse **shall** be transmitted when replying to ATCRBS Mode A interrogations for a period of 18 ±1.0 seconds.  The SPI pulse **shall** be transmitted only if the IDENT switch is first activated.  The SPI pulse shall not be transmitted when replying to Mode C interrogations. 

## 2.2.4.1.4 Atcrbs Reply Pulse Shape

All reply pulses and SPI pulses **shall** be 0.45 ±0.10 microsecond duration and have rise times of from 0.05 to 0.1 microseconds and decay times of from 0.05 to 0.2 
microseconds.  The rise and decay time may be less, providing the sideband radiation is no greater than that which would be produced theoretically by a trapezoidal wave having the stated rise and decay time.  The Mode S reply spectrum requirement of §2.2.4.2.3.d is an acceptable specification for meeting ATCRBS minimum rise and fall time requirements. The pulse amplitude variation of one pulse, with respect to any other pulse in a reply train, shall not exceed l dB. 

Note:
 The above characteristics for ATCRBS reply pulse shapes are compatible with characteristics for Mode S reply pulse shapes (see §
). 

2.2.4.2.3

## 2.2.4.1.5 Atcrbs Reply Pulse Spacing Tolerance

The pulse spacing tolerances for each pulse (including the last framing pulse) with respect to the first framing pulse of the reply group **shall** be ±0.10 microsecond.  The pulse spacing tolerance of the SPI pulse with respect to the last framing pulse of the reply group **shall** be ±0.10 microsecond.  The pulse spacing tolerance of any pulse in the reply group with respect to any other pulse (except the first framing pulse) **shall** be no more than ±0.15 microsecond. 

## 2.2.4.1.6 Atcrbs Reply Delay And Jitter

a. At all RF input levels from MTL to -21 dBm, the time delay between the arrival at 
the transponder input of the leading edge of P3 and the transmission of the leading 
edge of the first pulse of the reply **shall** be 3.0 ±0.5 microseconds. 
b. At all RF input levels from 3 dB above MTL to -21 dBm, the jitter at the leading 
edge of the first pulse of the reply with respect to P3 shall not exceed 
±0.1 microsecond. 
c. At all RF input levels from 3 dB above MTL to -21 dBm, the time delay variations 
between ATCRBS modes shall not exceed 0.2 microseconds. 

## 2.2.4.2 Mode S Replies

The reply data block is formed by PPM encoding of the reply data.  A pulse transmitted in the first half of the interval represents a ONE while a pulse transmitted in the second half represents a ZERO (see Figure 2-3).   

## 2.2.4.2.1 Mode S Preamble

The preamble **shall** consist of 4 0.5 ±0.05 microsecond pulses.  The second, third and fourth pulses **shall** be spaced 1.0, 3.5 and 4.5 microseconds, respectively, from the first transmitted pulse.  The spacing tolerance **shall** be in accordance with §2.2.4.2.4.

Example: Reply Data Block Waveform Corresponding to bit sequence 0010...001 

## 2.2.4.2.2 Mode S Data Pulses

The block of reply data pulses **shall** begin 8.0 microseconds after the first transmitted pulse.  Either 56 or 112 1-microsecond intervals **shall** be assigned to each transmission.  
A pulse with a width of 0.5 ±0.05 microsecond **shall** be transmitted either in the first or the second half of each interval.  If a pulse transmitted in the second half of one interval is followed by another pulse transmitted in the first half of the next interval, the two pulses **shall** merge and a 1.0 ±0.05 microsecond pulse **shall** be transmitted. 

## 2.2.4.2.3 Mode S Reply Pulse Shape

a. The pulse amplitude variation between one pulse and any other pulse in a reply shall 
not exceed 2 dB. 
b. The pulse rise time shall not exceed 0.1 microseconds. 
c. The pulse decay time shall not exceed 0.2 microseconds. d. The spectrum of a reply shall not exceed the following bounds:

## 2.2.4.2.4 Mode S Reply Pulse Spacing Tolerance

Mode S reply pulses **shall** start at a defined multiple of 0.5 microseconds from the first transmitted pulse.  The pulse position tolerance **shall** be ±0.05 microseconds, measured from the first pulse of the reply. 

## 2.2.4.2.5 Mode S Reply Delay And Jitter

a. At all RF input levels from MTL to -21 dBm, the first preamble pulse of the reply 
shall occur 128 ±0.25 microseconds after the sync phase reversal of the received P6

ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation.  At all RF input levels from MTL +3 dB to 
-21 dBm, the jitter of the reply delay **shall not** exceed ±0.1 microsecond, peak (99.9 
percentile). 

## 2.2.5 Side Lobe Suppression Characteristics

Side lobe suppression is accomplished separately for ATCRBS, ATCRBS-Only All-Call, ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call and for Mode S format interrogations. 

## 2.2.5.1 Side Lobe Suppression, Atcrbs, Atcrbs-Only All-Call, And Atcrbs/Mode S All-Call

The transponder **shall** react to side lobe interrogations as follows: 

a. 
Conditions Under Which the Transponder **SHALL** Be Suppressed 
The transponder **shall** reply to no more than one percent (1%) of the interrogations under all combinations of the following conditions: 

(1) 
when the pulse interval between P1 and P2 is varied over the range from 1.85 to 
2.15 microseconds, 
(2) 
when the RF input signal level of P1 is varied from 3 dB above MTL to -21 
dBm, 
(3) 
when the level of P2 equals or exceeds the level of P1. 
b. 
Conditions Under Which the Transponder SHALL NOT Be Suppressed 
The transponder **shall** reply to at least 90 percent of the interrogations over the input signal level range of 3 dB above MTL to -21 dBm, when: 

(l) 
the level of P1 exceeds the level of P2 by 9 dB or more, 
(2) 
no pulse is received at the position 2.0 ±0.7 microseconds following P1, 
(3) 
the duration of P2 is less than 0.3 microsecond. 
c. 
Conditions Under Which Transponder SHALL NOT Reply but May Initiate 
Suppression 
The transponder **shall not** reply with more than 10 percent reply ratio over the RF 
input level range from MTL to MTL +3 dB, if the amplitude of P2 equals or is greater than the amplitude of P1.  Under the same conditions, the transponder may or may not initiate suppression. 

d. 
Side Lobe Suppression Characteristics 
(1) 
The suppression duration is defined as the time between the P2 pulse initiating 
the suppression and the P1 pulse of the earliest subsequent interrogation to 
which the transponder replies.  The duration **shall** be between 25 and 45 
microseconds for all ATCRBS and ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call modes.  
(2) 
The side lobe suppression period **shall** begin after receipt of the leading edge of 
P2. 
(3) 
The side lobe suppression period **shall** be capable of being reinitiated within 
two microseconds after the end of any suppression period. 
(4) 
The receiver sensitivity for ATCRBS signals **shall** be at MTL not later than 
one microsecond after the end of the suppression period. 
(5) 
The two-pulse sidelobe suppression pair **shall** initiate ATCRBS suppression in 
a Mode S transponder regardless of the position of the pulse pair in a group of pulses, provided the transponder is not already suppressed or in a transaction cycle (see §2.2.18.2.2.k.). 
Note:
 The P3 - P4 pair of the ATCRBS-Only All-Call interrogation both prevents a 
reply and initiates suppression.  Likewise, the P1 - P2 preamble of a Mode S 
interrogation initiates suppression independently of the waveform that follows it. 

## 2.2.5.2 Side Lobe Suppression, Mode S Formats

Side lobe suppression for Mode S formats is characterized by the reception of P5, overlaying the location of the sync phase reversal of P6. 

Given an interrogation which would otherwise require a reply, the transponder **shall**: 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

a. at all signal levels between MTL +3 dB and -21 dBm, have a reply ratio of less than 
10 percent if the received amplitude of P5 exceeds the received amplitude of P6 by 3 
dB or more; 
b. at all signal levels between MTL +3 dB and -21 dBm, have a reply ratio of at least 99 
percent if the received amplitude of P6 exceeds the received amplitude of P5 by 12 
dB or more. 

## 2.2.6 Pulse Decoder Characteristics

Unless otherwise specified, the following pulse decoder characteristics **shall** apply over the RF input signal level range from MTL +1 dB to -21 dBm and nominal interrogation signal characteristics.  Applicable "valid" interrogations **shall** result in at least 90 percent replies, and interrogations which are not valid **shall** result in less than 10 percent replies. 

## 2.2.6.1 Pulse Level Tolerances 2.2.6.1.1 Atcrbs/Mode S All-Call

If the equipment receives a valid ATCRBS interrogation at any signal level from MTL +1 
dB to -21 dBm followed by a 1.6 microsecond pulse in the P4 position: 

a. it **shall** accept the interrogation as an ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation if the 
received amplitude of P4 is above the amplitude of P3 minus 1 dB; 
b. it **shall** accept the interrogation as an ATCRBS interrogation if the received 
amplitude of P4 is below the amplitude of P3 minus 6 dB. 

## 2.2.6.1.2 Atcrbs-Only All-Call

If the equipment receives a valid ATCRBS interrogation at any signal level from MTL +1 
dB to -21 dBm followed by a 0.8 microsecond pulse in the P4 position: 

a. it **shall** accept the interrogation as an ATCRBS interrogation if the received 
amplitude of P4 is below the amplitude of P3 minus 6 dB; 
b. it **shall not** accept the interrogation if the received amplitude of P4 is above P3 minus 
l dB. 
 Mode S transponders do not accept the ATCRBS-Only All-Call. 

## Note: 2.2.6.2 Pulse Position Tolerances

a. The equipment **shall** accept the pulse position of ATCRBS interrogations as valid if 
the spacing between P1 and P3 is within plus or minus 0.2 microsecond of the 
nominal spacing. 
The transponder **shall** accept the pulse position of ATCRBS/Mode S All-Calls as valid if the spacing between P1 and P3 is within plus or minus 0.2 microsecond of the nominal spacing, and if the spacing between P3 and P4 is within plus or minus 0.05 
microsecond of nominal. 

b. The transponder shall not accept the pulse position of ATCRBS, ATCRBS/Mode S 
All-Call and ATCRBS-Only All-Call interrogations as valid if the spacing between 
P1 and P3 differs from the nominal spacing by 1.0 microsecond or more. 
c. The transponder **shall not** accept an interrogation as an ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call if 
the leading edge of P4 is not detected within the interval from 1.7 to 2.3 
microseconds following the leading edge of P3. 

## 2.2.6.3 Pulse Duration Tolerances

a. The transponder **shall** accept the pulses of an ATCRBS interrogation as valid if the 
duration of both P1 and P3 is between 0.7 and 0.9 microsecond. 
The transponder **shall** accept an ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation as valid if the duration of both P1 and P3 is between 0.7 and 0.9 microsecond and if the duration of P4 is between 1.5 and 1.7 microseconds. 

b. The transponder shall not accept an ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation as valid 
if the duration of the P4 pulse is outside of the range between 1.2 and 2.5 
microseconds. 
c. For all signal levels from MTL to -45 dBm, the transponder **shall** accept no more 
than 10 percent of ATCRBS or ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations if the 
duration of either the P1 pulse or the P3 pulse is less than 0.3 microseconds. 

## 2.2.6.4 Sync Phase Reversal Position Tolerance

The transponder **shall** determine the location of the sync phase reversal relative to either the leading edge of P2 or the leading edge of P6.  If the transponder determines the sync phase reversal from P2, the sync phase reversal **shall** be accepted if it is received within the interval from 2.7 to 2.8 microseconds following the leading edge of P2.  The sync phase reversal **shall** be rejected if it is received outside of the interval from 2.55 to 2.95 
microseconds following the leading edge of P2.  In the gray zones between these limits 
(that is, in the zone from 2.55 to 2.7 microseconds and in the zone from 2.8 to 2.95 microseconds) the transponder may or may not accept the sync phase reversal.  If the transponder determines the sync phase reversal from P6, the sync phase reversal **shall** be accepted if it is received within the interval from 1.2 to 1.3 microseconds following the leading edge of P6.  The sync phase reversal **shall** be rejected if it is received outside of the interval from 1.05 to 1.45 microseconds following the leading edge of P6.  In the gray zones between these limits (that is, in the zone from 1.05 to 1.2 microseconds and in the zone from 1.3 to 1.45 microseconds) the transponder may or may not accept the sync phase reversal. 

## 2.2.7 Desensitization And Recovery Characteristics 2.2.7.1 Echo Suppression 2.2.7.1.1 Echo Suppression Desensitization

Upon receipt of any pulse more than 0.7 microsecond in duration (desensitization pulse), the transponder **shall** be desensitized temporarily for all received signals by raising the receiver threshold.  Immediately after the desensitization pulse, the receiver threshold shall be between the level of the desensitization pulse and 9 dB below that, except for a possible overshoot during the first microsecond following the desensitization pulse. 

## 2.2.7.1.2 Narrow Pulse Performance

Single pulses less than 0.7 microsecond in duration are not required to cause a specified desensitization, but if they occur shall not cause a desensitization of amplitude or duration greater than that permitted in §2.2.7.1.1 and §2.2.7.2. 

 
2.2.7.2 
Recovery 
Following desensitization, the receiver **shall** recover sensitivity within 3 dB of MTL, within 15 microseconds after reception of the trailing edge of a desensitizing pulse having a signal strength up to 50 dB above MTL.  Recovery **shall** be at an average rate not exceeding 4.0 dB per microsecond. 

 
2.2.7.2.1 
Recovery From a Mode S Interrogation If No Reply Is Required 
Following a correctly addressed Mode S interrogation which has been accepted and which requires no reply, a transponder **shall** recover sensitivity to within 3 dB of MTL no later than 45 microseconds after receipt of the sync phase reversal.   

2.2.7.2.2 
Recovery From a Suppression Pair 
The receipt of P1 and P2 suppression pulses may temporarily desensitize the transponder according to §2.2.7.1.1, but the suppression pairs shall **not** otherwise interfere with the reception of Mode S interrogations. 

 
2.2.7.2.3 
Recovery From a Mode S Interrogation Which Has Not Been Accepted 
Following a Mode S interrogation that has not been accepted, the transponder **shall** 
recover sensitivity to within 3 dB of MTL no later than 45 microseconds after receipt of the sync phase reversal. 

 
2.2.7.2.4 
Recovery From Unaccepted ATCRBS/Mode S and ATCRBS-Only All-Calls 
Following unaccepted ATCRBS/Mode S or ATCRBS-Only All-Calls, the transponder shall recover sensitivity according to §2.2.7.2. 

 
2.2.7.2.5 
Dead Time 
The time interval beginning at the end of a reply transmission and ending when the receiver has regained its sensitivity to within 3 dB of MTL shall not exceed 125 
microseconds. 

 Dead time should be minimized to maximize system reliability. 

Note:

## 2.2.7.3 Reply Rate Limiting

Reply rate limiting in a Mode S transponder **shall** be separate and independent for Mode S and ATCRBS replies. 

 

## 2.2.7.3.1 Atcrbs Reply Rate Limiting

A sensitivity-reduction reply rate limit **shall** be incorporated in the transponder for ATCRBS replies.  The limit **shall** be capable of being adjusted between 500 continuous ATCRBS Mode A and Mode C replies per second and the maximum continuous rate of which the transponder is capable, or 2000 replies per second, whichever is less, without regard to the number of pulses in each reply.  Sensitivity reduction **shall** apply only to the receipt of ATCRBS, ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call, and ATCRBS-Only All-Call interrogations. 

 

## 2.2.7.3.2 Mode S Reply Rate Limiting

If a reply rate limiting device is provided for Mode S replies, it **shall** permit at least the reply rates required in §2.2.3.4.2.  A limiting device may be used to protect the transponder from accidental over-interrogation. 

 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 2.2.8 Response In The Presence Of Interference 2.2.8.1 Response In The Presence Of Low Level Asynchronous Interference

For all received signal levels between -65 and -21 dBm, given an interrogation that requires a reply according to §2.2.17 and if no lockout condition is in effect, the transponder **shall** reply correctly with at least 95 percent reply ratio in the presence of asynchronous interference. 

Asynchronous interference consists of single 0.8 microsecond pulses with carrier frequency of 1030 ±0.2 MHz, incoherent with the Mode S signal carrier frequency and occurring at all repetition rates up to 10000 Hz at a level 12 dB or more below the level of the Mode S signal. 

Note:
 Such pulses may combine with P1 and P2 pulses of the Mode S wave form to form 
a valid ATCRBS-Only All-Call wave form.  The Mode S transponder does not respond to ATCRBS-Only All-Calls.  A preceding pulse may also combine with 
the P2 of the Mode S waveform to form a valid Mode A or Mode C wave form.  
Under such conditions, the P1 - P2 pair of the Mode S preamble takes 
precedence. 

## 2.2.8.2 Response In The Presence Of A Standard Interfering Pulse

A standard interfering pulse is defined as a 0.8 microsecond pulse with a carrier frequency of 1030 ±0.2 MHz that is incoherent with the Mode S signal of the test and that overlaps the P6 of the Mode S interrogation anywhere after the sync phase reversal. 

Given an interrogation that requires a reply, the reply ratio of a transponder **shall** be at least 95 percent if the level of the interfering pulse is 6 dB or more below the signal level for input signal levels between -68 and -21 dBm. 

Under the same conditions, the reply ratio **shall** be at least 50 percent if the interference pulse level is 3 dB or more below the signal level. 

Note:
 This measurement simulates the overlay of ATCRBS pulses over the DPSK 
modulation of the Mode S interrogation and assures that the demodulation 
scheme of the transponder is effective.  Designs such as narrow band filters that 
merely detect the occurrence of a phase change will not perform satisfactorily. 

## 2.2.8.3 Response In The Presence Of Pulse Pair Interference

The interfering signal **shall** consist of P1 and P2, spaced 2 microseconds apart, with a carrier frequency of 1030 ±0.2 MHz, that is incoherent with the Mode S signal of the test.  
The interfering pulse pair **shall** overlay any part of the Mode S interrogation except that the leading edge of the P1 interfering pulse **shall** occur no earlier than the P1 pulse of the Mode S signal.  Given an interrogation that requires a reply, the reply ratio of a transponder **shall** be at least 90 percent if the level of the interfering signal is 9 dB or more below the signal levels for signal level inputs between -68 and -21 dBm. 

Note:
 This assures that Mode S decoding is not inhibited by the receipt of ATCRBS side lobe suppression pulse pairs. 

## 2.2.8.4 Response In The Presence Of Tacan/Dme And Jtids Interference

Given a Mode S interrogation that requires a reply, the reply ratio of the transponder shall be at least 90 percent for input signal levels between -68 and -21 dBm when either of the following signals is applied with the interrogation signal: 

a. A TACAN/DME signal at a nominal repetition rate of 3600 pulse pairs per second 
for both X and Y (12 and 30 microseconds) channel pulse spacings, at a level of -30 
dBm, and over the frequency ranges of 962-1020 and 1041-1213 MHz. 
b. A single pulse with a duration of 6.4 microseconds at a rate of 2000 pulses per 
second, at a level of -80 dBm and a frequency of 1030 MHz. 
 

## 2.2.8.5 Simultaneous Interrogation Of Mode A And Mode C If A Transponder Receives Two Valid Atcrbs Pulse Patterns Simultaneously, It **Shall**:

a. Enter the ATCRBS suppression state if one of the received pulse patterns is a 
P1 - P2 suppression pair. 
b. Generate a valid Mode C reply if the two received pulse patterns are Mode A and 
Mode C interrogations. 
Note:
 Simultaneous receipt of two interrogation pulse patterns can occur wherever there are two or more interrogators transmitting in the same airspace.  For example, a single pulse from an interfering interrogator received 8 or 21 
microseconds before the second pulse of a P1 - P2 pair can cause the transponder to simultaneously recognize an ATCRBS interrogation and an ATCRBS suppression.  When this occurs, the Mode S transponder should enter the ATCRBS suppression state.  It will thereby be enabled to receive the remainder as a possible interrogation waveform following the P1 - P2 pair.  A 
single interference pulse received 8 microseconds before the P3 pulse of a Mode C interrogation (or 21 microseconds before the P3 pulse of a Mode A 
interrogation) can cause the transponder to simultaneously recognize both interrogation patterns.  When this occurs, a Mode C reply is preferred because a missing Mode A reply usually causes less degradation of beacon tracking. 

 

## 2.2.8.6 Response In The Presence Of Cw Interference

In the presence of non-coherent CW interference at a frequency of 1030 ±0.2 MHz, at signal levels of 20 dB or more below the desired ATCRBS or Mode S interrogation signal level, the transponder **shall** reply correctly to at least 90 percent of the interrogations. 

 

## 2.2.8.7 Compatibility With Tcas Atcrbs Surveillance

With P1 at MTL and S1 at MTL -6 dB, the transponder **shall** reply to ATCRBS 
interrogations at least 90 % of the time. 

With P1 at MTL and S1 at MTL -3 dB, the transponder **shall** reply to ATCRBS 
interrogations at least 70 % of the time. 

With P1 at MTL and S1 at MTL, the transponder **shall** reply to no more than 10% of ATCRBS interrogations.   
Note:
 S1 is equal to P1 in duration with the leading edge of S1 being 2.0 microseconds ahead of the leading edge of P1.  Amplitude of S1 is varied relative to P1 as indicated above. 

## 2.2.9 Undesired Replies 2.2.9.1 Atcrbs

a. The random trigger rate squitter on all ATCRBS modes shall not be greater than 5 
reply pulse groups or suppressions per second, averaged over a period of at least 30 
seconds.   
b. The random trigger rate on all ATCRBS modes **shall not** be greater than 10 reply 
pulse groups or suppressions per second, averaged over a period of 30 seconds, when operated in the presence of non-coherent CW interference at a frequency of 1030 
±0.2 MHz and at signal levels of -60 dBm or less.   

## 2.2.9.2 Mode S

a. In the absence of valid interrogation signals, Mode S transponders shall not generate 
unwanted Mode S replies more often than once per 10 seconds. 
b. In the presence of non-coherent CW interference at a frequency of 1030 ±0.2 MHz 
and at signal levels of -60 dBm or less, and in the absence of valid interrogation 
signals, Mode S transponders **shall not** generate unwanted Mode S replies more often 
than once per 10 seconds.   

## 2.2.10 Self Test And Monitor(S) 2.2.10.1 Self Test

If a self-test feature or monitor is provided as a part of the equipment: 

a. The device that radiates test interrogation signals or prevents transponder reply to 
proper interrogation during the test period **shall** be limited to intermittent use for no 
longer than that required to determine the transponder status.  The test interrogation 
rate for ATCRBS and ATCRBS-Only All-Call interrogations **shall** be 235 ±5 
interrogations per second or a sub-multiple thereof.  Test interrogations using Mode S 
formats, including ATCRBS/ Mode S All-Call, shall not exceed one of each format 
for which the transponder is equipped in any given test sequence. 
b. The self-test interrogation signal level at the antenna end of the transmission line 
shall not exceed -40 dBm. 
c. If provision is made for an automatic periodic self-test procedure, such self testing 
shall not radiate replies at an average rate exceeding one reply every ten seconds. 

## 2.2.10.2 Squitter Monitor

A squitter monitor **shall** be provided to verify that the Mode S transponder generates short and Extended Squitters at their nominal rates (see §2.2.18.2.6 and §2.2.23.1).  
Event-Driven Squitter rates are not required to be monitored to meet this requirement.  
The transponder **shall** be considered failed when the monitor has detected squitter failure. 

 

## 2.2.10.3 Mode S Address Verification

The Mode S transponder **shall** declare a transponder failure in the event that its own Mode S address is ALL ZEROs or ALL ONEs.   

 

## 2.2.10.4 Failure Annunciation

An output **shall** be provided to indicate the validity/non-validity of the transponder.  
Failure to generate squitters at the nominal rate, a failure detected by self-test or the monitoring function, or failure of Mode S address verification **shall** cause the output to assume the invalid state.  Momentary power interrupts shall not cause the output to assume the invalid state.  The status of the transponder **shall** be annunciated to the flight crew. 

 

## 2.2.11 Response To Mutual Suppression Pulses

a. If the equipment is designed to accept and respond to mutual suppression pulses from 
other electronic equipment in the aircraft (to disable it while the other equipment is 
transmitting), the equipment **shall** regain normal sensitivity, within 3 dB, not later 
than 15 microseconds after the end of the applied mutual suppression pulse. 
Note:

 This document does not establish the design parameters of the mutual 
suppression system.  However, it is recommended that all sources of mutual 
suppression pulses be DC coupled while sinks are AC coupled.  This standardization will prevent source or sink failures from disabling all users of the mutual suppression pulses.   
b. The suppression output signal **shall** precede the transponder RF transmission by no 
more than 10 microseconds and return to the inactive state in less than 10 microseconds.   
 

## 2.2.12 Diversity Operations

Diversity Mode S transponders may be implemented for the purpose of improving air-toair surveillance and communications.  Such systems **shall** employ two antennas, one mounted on the top and the other on the bottom of the aircraft.  Appropriate switching and signal processing channels to select the best antenna on the basis of the characteristics of the received interrogation signals **shall** also be provided.  Such diversity systems, in their installed configuration, shall not result in degraded performance relative to that which would have been produced by a single system having a bottom-mounted antenna. 

Note:
 TCAS operations require diversity operations.  The use of diversity is highly recommended for any transponder installation.   
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 2.2.12.1 Diversity Antenna Selection And Selection Threshold

a. 
Diversity Antenna Selection 
Antenna selection **shall** be automatic.  The transponder **shall** select one of the two antennas on the basis of the relative strengths of the detected interrogation signals, provided that both channels simultaneously receive a valid identical interrogation or pulse pair.  Antenna selection and switching may occur after the receipt of one of the following. 

(1) 
The P3 pulse of a P1 - P3 pulse pair, indicating an ATCRBS or ATCRBS/Mode 
S All-Call interrogation. 
(2) 
The P2 pulse of a P1 - P2 pulse pair, indicating a possible Mode S preamble. 
(3) 
The first microsecond of P6 of a Mode S interrogation. 
(4) 
A complete, error-free Mode S interrogation. 
The selected antenna **shall** be used to receive the remainder of the interrogation and, if necessary, to transmit the Mode S or ATCRBS reply. 

Selection Threshold 
b. 
The transponder **shall** nominally select the antenna connected to the RF port having the stronger signal.  To allow for unbalance in the characteristics of the two channels, a transition zone ±3 dB wide is permitted, in which either antenna may be selected. 

Additional selection can be made based on the correctness of a received complete Mode S interrogation.  In this case, the RF port having the correct signal will be selected.  If correctness is observed in both channels, selection **shall** be based on relative signal strength.  This additional selection criterion is an optional feature. 

## 2.2.12.2 Received Signal Delay Tolerance

If an interrogation is received at either antenna 0.125 microseconds or less in advance of reception at the other antenna, the interrogations **shall** be considered simultaneous and the reply antenna selection criteria **shall** be applied.  If an interrogation is received at either antenna 0.375 microseconds or more in advance of reception at the other antenna, the antenna selected for the reply **shall** be the one which received the earlier interrogation.  If the relative time of receipt is between 0.125 and 0.375 microseconds, the transponder **shall** select the reply antenna based on either the simultaneous interrogation criteria or the earlier time of arrival. 

## 2.2.12.3 Diversity Transmission Channel Isolation

The peak RF power transmitted from the selected antenna **shall** exceed the power transmitted from the non-selected antenna by at least 20 dB. 

## 2.2.12.4 Reply Delay Of Diversity Transponders

The total difference in mean reply delay between the two antenna channels (including the transponder to antenna cables) shall not exceed 0.08 microseconds for interrogations of equal amplitude.  This requirement is applicable to interrogation signal strengths between MTL +3 dB, and -21 dBm. 

Note:

 This requirement limits apparent jitter caused by diversity operation and by 
  cable delay differences.  The jitter requirements on each individual channel 
  remain as specified for non-diversity transponders.  Control of apparent jitter 
  caused by antenna location is specified in §
                                               .c. 

3.1.6

## 2.2.12.5 Squitter Antenna Selection 2.2.12.5.1 Acquisition Squitter

Transponders operating with antenna diversity (see §2.2.19.3.1) **shall** transmit acquisition squitters as follows: 

a. When in the derived airborne state, the transponder **shall** transmit acquisition 
squitters alternately from the two antennas; and 
b. When in the derived on-the-ground state, the transponder **shall** transmit acquisition 
squitters under control of the SAS subfield (see §2.2.23.1.7).  In the absence of any 
SAS commands, use of the top antenna only **shall** be the default condition. 
1. The acquisition squitter is suppressed by aircraft that automatically determine the 
on-the-ground state when the aircraft is declaring the on-the-ground state (Table 2-
2, §
2.2.23.1.5). 
2. "Derived" signifies the state resulting from the strut switch input, or any other input 
parameters that can be used to determine airborne or on-ground status (see §2.2.18.2.7.c). 

## 2.2.12.5.2 Extended Squitter

Transponders operating with antenna diversity (see §2.2.19.3.1) **shall** transmit Extended Squitters as follows: 

a. When broadcasting the airborne type formats, the transponder **shall** transmit each 
type of Extended Squitter alternately from the two antennas; and 
b. When broadcasting the surface type formats (see §2.2.23.1.2.b), the transponder **shall** 
transmit Extended Squitters under control of the SAS subfield (see §2.2.23.1.7.3).  In 
the absence of any SAS commands, use of the top antenna only **shall** be the default 
condition. 

## 2.2.13 Data Handling And Interfaces 2.2.13.1 Direct Data2

Direct data are those which are part of the Mode S system surveillance protocol. 

## 2.2.13.1.1 Fixed Direct Data

Fixed direct data characterize the aircraft. 

## Mode S Discrete Address A.

(1) 
Protection of Mode S address bits - During the power-on initialization process, 
the transponder **shall** read in and store its 24-bit discrete address.  Thereafter, 
the address used by the transponder shall not change from the value stored at 
power-up.  The transponder should continue to monitor the 24-bit discrete address after the initial read and store at power-up.  If a change in the 24-bit 
discrete address is detected after the initial read and store, the transponder **shall** continue to use only the 24-bit discrete address stored at power-up and **shall** 
generate a diagnostic error message in order to alert maintenance personnel to the occurrence of intermittent discrete address bit input data.  If the transponder 24-bit discrete address is set to ALL ONEs or ALL ZEROs at startup, then this 
error condition **shall** be indicated to the pilot, and the transponder **shall** either 
transition to Standby State, Power Off Condition, or operate as a pure Mode A/C Transponder.   
1. This last requirement is imposed to specifically disallow Mode S 
transponders from operating with invalid addresses.  This condition has been observed in airspace operations and it poses a number of unsafe conditions.   
2. If there is no other Mode S transponder active (not in Standby or a Failed 
condition), then TCAS will declare a "TCAS System Fail" or enter the "Standby" condition (see §2.2.22.5). 
3. If this condition occurs at startup, then the transponder should be 
deactivated until the condition is corrected, or only be able to operate in 
pure Mode A/C only.  "Pure" Mode A/C Transponders (in accordance 
with RTCA DO-144A or later version) reply to all P1 - P3 and P1 - P3 - 
P4 interrogations with a Mode A/C reply and do not transmit any squitter.

4. Accommodation should be made for those military transponders that have 
the capability to change the 24-bit address (e.g., so the aircraft can 
operate as a State aircraft with a corresponding address, or as a NATO aircraft with a NATO address).  However, under no conditions may such a transponder operate as a Mode S transponder if the address is invalid.   
(2) 
Mode S-Only All-Call Replies
 - In response to a Mode S-Only All-Call 
interrogation, the transponder **shall** place its 24-bit discrete address in the 
"AA" field (see §
), bits 9-32 of the All-Call reply. 
2.2.14.4.1
 

(3) 
All Other Mode S Transmissions
 - In each response to any Mode S 
interrogation except Mode S-Only All-Call, the transponder **shall** place its 24-
bit address, overlaid on parity, in the "AP" field, bits 33-56 of short formats and bits 89-112 of long formats (see §
). 
2.2.14.4.4
b. 
Maximum Airspeed 
In response to certain surveillance interrogations, the transponder **shall** place an encoded indication of the aircraft's maximum normal operating airspeed into bits 14- 17 of the RI field.  Coding is described in §
2.2.14.4.33.   

## Aircraft Identification Data

c. 
If the tail number or registration number of the aircraft is used to identify the aircraft for ATC purposes, it constitutes "fixed" data.  If the aircraft uses a flight number in lieu of a registration number, then the data are no longer "fixed," but classified as 
"variable" (see §
2.2.13.1.2).  
If not equipped with the aircraft identification data capability, the transponder **shall** 
insert ZEROs into the appropriate field. 

## 2.2.13.1.2 Variable Direct Data

Variable direct data characterize the flight condition of the aircraft and are therefore subject to dynamic changes.  These changes are made either automatically, based on inputs received from sensors in the aircraft, or manually by the flight crew. 

## Pressure Altitude

a. 
When operated in conjunction with a pressure-altitude encoder (digitizer) or an air data system, the transponder **shall** have the capability for pressure-altitude transmission up to its designed maximum altitude.  Pressure altitude reports **shall** be referenced to a standard pressure setting of 29.92 inches Hg (1013.25 hectopascals). 

(1) 
ATCRBS
 - When operated in the ATCRBS system, the altitude **shall** be 
transmitted in response to a Mode C interrogation, encoded in accordance with ICAO Annex 10.  If valid altitude information is not available to the 
transponder, only the framing pulses required for a Mode C response **shall** be 
transmitted. 
(2) 
Mode S
 - When operated in the Mode S system, the 13-bit AC field (bits 20 - 
32 transmitted in the short and long special surveillance reply, the altitude 
surveillance reply, and the altitude Comm-B reply) **shall** contain the encoded 
altitude of the aircraft.  For aircraft with 25-foot or better pressure altitude sources, pressure altitude-information should be reported in 25-foot 
increments.  Pressure altitude data obtained from a source with larger than 25-
foot resolution shall not be reported using 25-foot increments.  The altitude 
shall be encoded as follows: 
(i) 
Bit 26 **shall** be designated as the M bit and **shall** be ZERO if the altitude 
is reported in feet.  M equals ONE **shall** be reserved for possible future 
use to indicate that the altitude reporting is in metric units. 
Note:
 Use of the M bit as defined here does not alter any conventions regarding the X bit in ATCRBS replies. 

(ii) 
If M equals ZERO, bit 28 **shall** be designated as the Q bit.  Q equals 
ZERO **shall** be used to indicate that the Mode S altitude is reported in 
100-foot increments as defined in c below.  Q equals ONE **shall** be used 
to indicate that the altitude is reported in 25-foot increments as defined in d below.  
Note:
 Bit 28 (Q) corresponds to the D1 pulse of a Mode C reply and is not used in the ATCRBS altitude code. 

(iii) If M and Q both equal ZERO, the altitude **shall** be coded according to 
the pattern for Mode C replies specified in ICAO Annex 10.  Starting 
with bit 20, the sequence **shall** be C1, A1, C2, A2, C4, A4, ZERO, B1, 
ZERO, B2, D2, B4, D4.  
(iv) If M equals ZERO and Q equals ONE, the 11-bit field represented by 
bits 20 to 25, 27, and 29 to 32 **shall** represent a binary-coded field whose 
least significant bit has a value of 25 feet.  The binary value of the 
decimal number N **shall** be used to report pressure altitudes in the range 
(25 x N - 1000 ±12.5) feet.  
Note:
2.2.14.4.2

 The most significant bit of this field is bit 20 as required by 
  §
             .  This code is able to provide code values only 
  between -1000 feet and +50175 feet.  The coding used for Mode 
  C replies in "c" above must be used to report pressure altitudes 
  greater than 50175 feet.  

(v) 
ZERO **shall** be transmitted in each of the 13 bits of the AC field if 
altitude information is not available or if the altitude has been determined to be invalid.  

## B. 4096 Identification Code

In response to an ATCRBS Mode A or Mode S surveillance or Comm-A identity interrogation, the transponder **shall** reply with a pilot-selectable identification code.  
The code designation **shall** consist of digits between 0 and 7 inclusive, and **shall** 
consist of the sum of the postscripts of the information pulse numbers defined in 
§
2.2.4.1.2, employed as follows:  

| Digit    | Pulse Group    |
|----------|----------------|
| First    | A              |
| Second   | B              |
| Third    | C              |
| Fourth   | D              |

## Example:

Code 3615 would consist of information pulses A1, A2 (1 + 2 = 3), B2,  
B4 (2 + 4 = 6), C1 (1 = 1), D1, D4 (1 + 4 = 5). 

In the ATCRBS mode, this code, together with the framing pulses and a possible SPI pulse, makes up the complete Mode A reply.  In Mode S, the identification pulses become the "ID" field (see §2.2.14.4.17), bits 20 - 32. 

c. 

## "On-The-Ground" Condition

The transponder **shall** report the automatically determined on-the-ground state as determined by the aircraft in the Flight Status (FS), Vertical Status (VS), and Capability (CA) fields (see §
2.2.14.4.15, §2.2.14.4.42, and §2.2.14.4.6), except when reporting airborne status when on-the-ground is reported to the transponder under the conditions specified in §2.2.18.2.7. 

Note:
 The on-the-ground state determined by the aircraft does not include the effect of any TCS commands (see §
). 

2.2.23.1.7

## Special Position Identification (Spi)

d. 
In the ATCRBS mode, an SPI pulse **shall** be transmitted upon request, following a Mode A reply.  In the FS field of Mode S replies, an equivalent of the ATCRBS SPI 
pulse **shall** be transmitted upon the same request.  The code is transmitted for 18 ±1.0 
seconds after initiation and can be reinitiated at any time. 

e. Aircraft Identification Data
If the aircraft uses a flight number for aircraft identification, a means **shall** be provided for the variable aircraft identification to be inserted by the pilot while on the ground, or during flight.  The means for modifying and displaying aircraft identification **shall** be a simple crew action independent of the entry of other flight data.   

f. 
Radio Altitude Data
If available, the radio altitude data input is used to support airborne/on-the-ground determination in installations that support automatic on-the-ground condition determination as specified in §
2.2.18.2.7.  The data supports Extended Squitter airborne/surface format transmission selection and Flight Status (FS), Vertical Status (VS), and Capability (CA) fields as provided in §2.2.23.1.5, §2.2.14.4.15, §2.2.14.4.42, and §2.2.14.4.6. 

g. Ground Speed Data
If available, the ground speed data input is used to support airborne/on-the-ground determination in installations that support automatic on-the-ground condition determination as specified in §
2.2.18.2.7.  The data supports Extended Squitter airborne/surface format transmission selection and Flight Status (FS), Vertical Status 
(VS), and Capability (CA) fields as provided in §2.2.23.1.5, §2.2.14.4.15, §2.2.14.4.42, and §2.2.14.4.6. 

## Airspeed Data

h. 
If available, the airspeed data input is used to support airborne/on-the-ground determination in installations that support automatic on-the-ground condition determination as specified in §
2.2.18.2.7.  The data supports Extended Squitter airborne/surface format transmission selection and Flight Status (FS), Vertical Status 
(VS), and Capability (CA) fields as provided in §2.2.23.1.5, §2.2.14.4.15, 
§2.2.14.4.42, and §2.2.14.4.6. 

## 2.2.13.2 Indirect Data

Indirect data are those which pass through the transponder in either direction, but which do not affect the surveillance protocol.  If the transponder is designed to function with data link devices outside the transponder equipment, the input and output interfaces should satisfy the following requirements.  As used here, "transponder equipment" refers to a physical unit or group of units that would normally be installed as a system. The manufacturer is free to design the interfaces with these internal data link devices as long as the requirements of the following paragraphs are met. 

## 2.2.13.2.1 Interfaces For Indirect Data

Operational requirements of the Mode S installation influence the need for and the design of transponder interfaces for indirect data.  If such interfaces are provided, those for standard Mode S transactions (see §2.2.13.3) may be separate from those for ELM service. 

## 2.2.13.2.2 Integrity Of Interface Data Transfer

If a data link interface is employed, the interface **shall** be designed to provide communication between the transponder and peripheral devices in the normal operational aircraft environment for that class of transponder to assure error rates of less than one detected error in 103 112-bit transmissions and less than one undetected error in 107 112-
bit transmissions for both uplink and downlink transfers. 

## 2.2.13.3 Standard Transaction Interfaces

Standard Mode S transactions involve the content of all Mode S interrogation and reply formats with the possible exception of the All-Call and the Comm-C/D and the Comm-
U/V formats.  Various implementations of interfaces for uplink and downlink messages may be employed.  In general, the transponder passes data to the data link interface regardless of the content of the 56 bit data field.  The Mode S Specific Protocol (MSP) 
channel header (see §C.2.2.6.2) must be read by a TCAS compatible transponder to determine if the MA field contains a Sensitivity Level Command to be directed to the TCAS interface (see §2.2.22.1.1).  Other MSP channels may also be directed to individual interfaces (e.g., TIS MSP Channel 2, Data Flash, MSP Channel 3).   

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 2.2.13.3.1 Uplink Interface

a. Information Content
 - The interface **shall** transfer the entire content of both short and 
long accepted uplink interrogations (with the possible exception of the AP Field) except for interrogations UF=0, 11, 16 and a UF=24 interrogation containing a request for a downlink ELM transfer (RC=3).  This permits the receiving devices to properly identify the data field contents and permits possible additional parity determination at the I/O device. 
b. 
No-Storage Design - If the interface design is based on the concept of shifting data 
out of the transponder as they are received, the interface **shall** be capable of 
transferring uplink content before the start of the corresponding reply. 
c. Storage Design, Acceptance Rate
 - If the interface design is based on the concept of 
shifting data out at a slower rate, the internal storage system **shall** be able to process 
the content of Mode S interrogations (long or short) at a rate greater than or equal to: 
 

50 long interrogations in any 1-second interval 
18 long interrogations in any 100-millisecond interval 
8 long interrogations in any 25-millisecond interval 4 long interrogations in any 1.6-millisecond interval. 

Note:
 Ability to receive higher interrogation rates is required by a TCAS-
compatible transponder (see §
.b.). 

2.2.22

d. Storage Design, Non-Acceptance - The transponder may optionally accept a 
Comm-A interrogation (UF=20, 21) if the data content of that interrogation cannot be 
processed (see 'UNABLE TO PROCESS' and 'OPTION TO REPLY', Figure 2-15). 
Note:
 The Mode S reply is the sole means of acknowledging receipt of an interrogation.  Therefore, there is benefit to interrogators to receive a reply, even if the airborne data system is not capable of accepting the data contained in the interrogation.  Overlapping Mode S beams from several interrogators could lead to the requirement for considerable data handling and buffering.  The minimum, prescribed in "c" above, reduces data handling to a realistic level.   

e.  
Broadcast Information
 - Regardless of design (No-Storage or Storage), the uplink 
interface **shall** have a means to indicate to the recipient that a received message was 
sent as a broadcast. 

## 2.2.13.3.2 Downlink Interface

a. Information Content
 - The interface **shall** be able to insert into the downlink 
transmission any bit not inserted by the transponder. 
b. 
No-Storage Design
 - If the interface is designed to insert bits into the transponder for 
immediate transmission, such bits **shall** occur at the interface at least one 
microsecond before actual transmission. 
c. 
Storage Design - Buffer Rate
 - If the interface shifts data into the transponder at a 
rate slower than the transmission rate, the internal data system **shall** be able to 
provide the data to support the reply rate specified in §
. 
2.2.3.4.2
Note:
 Certain transponder designs may require downlink registers called for by an 
RR value, as well as downlink registers called for by special formats or DI content.   
d. 
Storage Design - Buffer Function - The design **shall** ensure that register content 
shall not be in a state of transition during the insertion of the content in a downlink 
reply.    
e. Unavailable Data - If an interrogation requests, as in "c" above, data that are not 
available, the transponder **shall** insert ZERO (0) into the affected fields of the reply. 
Note:

 The no-storage design requirement can be met by assuring that a nonconnected data source or an open interface connection results in zero-level 
inputs.  The storage design requirement can be met by assuring the transmission of "0" if the readout from a nonexistent register is requested. An input to provide information for air-initiated multisite directed 
transmissions (see §
 and §2.2.20.2.3.2) may have to be provided. 
2.2.19.2.3.2
 

## 2.2.13.4 Elm Service Interfaces

ELM transactions involve the content of Mode S interrogation and reply formats UF=DF=24, Comm-C and Comm-D respectively.  The reservation and closeout protocol uses the surveillance and Comm-A/B formats, UF=DF=4, 5, 20, 21. 

Separate interfaces may be provided for the uplink and the downlink, or a single interface handling both directions may be employed. 

 

## 2.2.14 Description Of The Mode S Signal Format

Note:
                                                                         2.2.17
     Protocols relating to the use of formats and fields are described in §
                                                                               
       through §2.2.19. 

 

## 2.2.14.1 Format Structure, Interrogation And Reply

Formats **shall** contain either 56 or 112 bits, the last 24 of which are used for address and parity while the rest are used for information transfer.  A summary of interrogation and reply formats is presented in Figure 2-5 and Figure 2-6.

3.  For downlink formats (DF) 0 through 23 the format number corresponds to the binary code in the first 5 bits of the 
interrogation.  Format number 24 is defined as the format beginning with "11" in the first two bit positions while the following three bits vary with the reply content.

## 2.2.14.2 Bit Numbering And Sequence

Bits are numbered in order of their transmission, beginning with bit 1.  If numerical values are encoded by groups of bits (fields), then the first bit transmitted is the most significant bit (MSB) unless otherwise stated. 

 

## 2.2.14.3 Fields

Information is coded in fields which consist of at least one bit.  The decimal equivalent of the binary code formed by the bit sequence within a field is used as the designator of the field function. 

 

## 2.2.14.3.1 Essential Fields

Each Mode S transmission contains two essential fields: One describing the format and the other a 24-bit field which carries parity information and contains either the address or the interrogator identity overlaid on parity as described in §2.2.18.2.1.  The format descriptor is the field at the beginning of the transmission and the 24-bit field always occurs at the end of the transmission.  The formats are described by the UF or DF descriptors. 

 

## 2.2.14.3.2 Mission Fields

The remaining coding space is used to transmit the mission fields.  For specific missions, a specific set of fields is prescribed.  Mission fields have two-letter designators. 

 

## 2.2.14.3.3 Subfields

Subfields may appear within mission fields.  Subfields are labeled with three-letter designators. 

 

## 2.2.14.4 Field Descriptions

## 2.2.14.4.12 Dp Data Parity

This 24 bit (bits 89 - 112) downlink field contains the parity overlaid on a "Modified AA" field established by performing a modulo-2 summation (e.g., Exclusive-Or function) 
of the discrete address most significant 8 bits and BDS1, BDS2, where BDS1 and BDS2 are provided by the "RR" and "RRS" as specified in §2.2.19.1.12.1 and §2.2.19.1.12.2.   

Example: 
Discrete Address 
= 
AA AA AA Hex = 
1010 
1010 
1010 
1010 
1010 
1010 
BDS1, BDS2 
= 
5F 00 00 Hex = 
0101 
1111 
0000 
0000 
0000 
0000 
Discrete Address 
⊕ 
BDS1, BDS2 Hex = 
1111 
0101 
1010 
1010 
1010 
1010 
"Modified AA" 
= 
F5 AA AA Hex = 
1111 
0101 
1010 
1010 
1010 
1010 

where "⊕" prescribes modulo-2 addition The resulting "Modified AA" field then represents the 24 bit sequence (a1,a2…a24) that shall be used to generate the DP field in accordance with §2.2.18.2.1.c.   

1. Effectively, the most significant 8 bits of the discrete Address (e.g., "AA" field) are 
first modulo-2 summed with the Register number of the Register being provided in 
the reply.  The result of that process is then used to generate the DP field.    
2. When the interrogator receives the reply, the parity decoder will decode the received 
"DP" into an equivalent modified "AA."  The interrogator can then modulo-2 sum 
the most significant 8 bits of this modified "AA" with the intended register BDS1, BDS2 with the result being the original "AA" used in the interrogation that requested the reply.

This 4-bit (bits 6 - 9) uplink field contains commands to the transponder which specify the reply probability to the Mode S-Only All-Call interrogation UF=11 that contains the PR.  A command to disregard any lockout state can also be given.  The assigned codes are as follows: 

| Code    | Description                                    |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0       | Reply with probability = 1.                    |
| 1       | Reply with probability = ½.                    |
| 2       | Reply with probability = ¼.                    |
| 3       | Reply with probability = 1/8.                  |
| 4       | Reply with probability = 1/16.                 |
| 5, 6, 7 | Do not reply.                                  |
| 8       | Disregard lockout, reply with probability = l. |
| 9       | Disregard lockout, reply with probability = ½. |
| 10         | Disregard lockout, reply with probability = ¼.    |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 11         | Disregard lockout, reply with probability = 1/8.  |
| 12         | Disregard lockout, reply with probability = l/16. |
| 13, 14, 15 | Do not reply.                                     |

Note:
 On receipt of a Mode S-Only All-Call containing a PR code other than 0 or 8, the transponder executes a random process and makes a reply decision for this interrogation in accordance with the commanded probability.  Random occurrence of replies enables the interrogator to acquire closely spaced aircraft whose replies would otherwise synchronously garble each other. 

## 2.2.14.4.32 Rc Reply Control

This 2-bit (bits 3 - 4) uplink field designates the transmitted segment as initial, intermediate or final if coded 0, l, 2 respectively.  RC=3 is used to request Comm-D downlink action by the transponder.  RC is part of the Comm-C interrogation, UF=24.

2.2.19.1.12.1

 If the first bit of the RR Code is ONE, the last four bits of the 5-bit RR Code, if 
  transformed into their hexadecimal equivalent, designate the number (BDS1) of 
  the requested source.  BDS2 is assumed to be ZERO if not specified by DI=3 or 7 
  and RRS, as is consistent with §
                                                 .  The data can also be extracted 
  using the protocol of §2.2.19.1.12.2.  

## 2.2.14.4.36 Special Designator (Sd), And Iis Subfield In Sd

a. 
SD Special Designator 
This 16-bit (bits 17 - 32) uplink field can contain control codes affecting transponder protocol and is part of surveillance and Comm-A interrogations UF=4, 5, 20, 21.  The content of this field is specified by the DI field.  See §
2.2.19.2.1.1 for definitions of subfields in SD.   

b. 
IIS, Subfield in SD 
This 4-bit subfield (bits 17 - 20) appears in all SD fields of uplink formats 4, 5, 20 
and 21 if the DI code is 0, 1 or 7.  IIS is the Interrogator Identifier.     

## 2.2.14.4.37 Si Surveillance Identifier

This 6-bit value **shall** define a surveillance identifier (SI) code which is derived from the CL and IC fields of UF=11, or received directly in the SIS subfield (see §2.2.19.2.1.1). These SI code values are assigned to interrogators in the range of 1 to 63.  An SI value of ZERO will not be used.  The SI codes are used with the multisite lockout protocols (see §2.2.18.2.5).  The SI codes are not be used with the multisite communications protocols, which require the use of II codes.  Therefore, an interrogator operating with an SI code will be limited to the following data link capabilities: 

a. 
Unlinked Comm-A 
b. 
Broadcast Comm-A 
c. 
Ground-Initiated Comm-B (GICB) 
d. 
Broadcast Comm-B 
e. 
TCAS/ACAS Downlink Transactions 
1. The SI lockout facility can not be used unless all Mode S transponders within 
coverage range are equipped for this purpose. 
2. This specifically excludes the use of air-initiated Comm-B (AICB) protocol, which is 
required for data flash and downlink MSPs. 

## 2.2.14.4.38 Sl Tcas Sensitivity Level Report

This 3-bit (bits 9 - 11) field appears in special surveillance reply formats DF=0, 16 (for TCAS-compatible transponders only).  This field reports the sensitivity level at which the TCAS unit is currently operating. 

The codes are: 

|   Code  | Description                         |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
|      0  | No TCAS sensitivity level reported. |

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

|   1  | TCAS is operating at sensitivity level 1.    |
|------|----------------------------------------------|
|   2  | TCAS is operating at sensitivity level 2.    |
|   3  | TCAS is operating at sensitivity level 3.    |
|   4  | TCAS is operating at sensitivity level 4.    |
|   5  | TCAS is operating at sensitivity level 5.    |
|   6  | TCAS is operating at sensitivity level 6.    |
|   7  | TCAS is operating at sensitivity level 7.    |

## 2.2.14.4.39 Tms Subfield

The Tactical Message Subfield (TMS), is a 4-bit subfield in SD (bits 29 - 32).  This subfield is used for identifying linkage of Comm-A messages, with "0" indicating an unlinked message.  Coding for this field is not described in these MOPS. 

## 2.2.14.4.40 Uf Uplink Format

The first field in all uplink formats is the transmission descriptor in all interrogations and is coded according to Figure 2-5, Note (3). 

## 2.2.14.4.41 Um Utility Message In Df=4, 5, 20, 21

This 6-bit (bits 14 - 19) downlink field in DF=4, 5, 20, 21 contains transponder status readouts. 

## 2.2.14.4.42 Vs Vertical Status

This 1-bit (bit 6) downlink field in DF=0, 16 indicates, when ZERO, that the aircraft is airborne and, when ONE, that the aircraft is on the ground.  Aircraft without the means of automatically determining the on-the-ground condition **shall** always report airborne state. 

2.2.14.4.43 
Free and Unassigned Coding Space 
Free coding space as indicated in Figure 2-5 and Figure 2-6 contains ALL ZEROs as transmitted by interrogators and transponders.  Non-assigned coding space within existing fields is reserved for possible future use. 

 

## 2.2.14.4.44 Future Coding

Because yet unassigned free coding space is transmitted as ZEROs, future coding must define a ZERO's block as a default code, i.e., no message is sent, no command given, no capability exists if a future new field contains ALL ZEROs. 

 

## 2.2.15 Antenna 2.2.15.1 Frequency Requirements

The antenna **shall** be designed to receive and transmit vertically polarized signals in the frequency range of 1030 to 1090 MHz. 

 

## 2.2.15.2 Impedance And Vswr

The VSWR produced by the antenna when terminated in a 50 ohm transmission line shall not exceed 1.5:1 over the 1030 to 1090 MHz frequency band. 

 

## 2.2.15.3 Polarization

The antenna **shall** be vertically polarized. 

 

## 2.2.15.4 Radiation Pattern

The gain **shall not** be less than the gain of a matched quarter-wave stub minus 3 dB over 
90 percent of a coverage volume from 0 to 360 degrees in azimuth and from 5 to 30 degrees above the ground plane when installed at the center of 1.2 meter (4 feet) diameter 
(or larger) flat circular ground plane. 

 

## 2.2.16 Power Interruption

The transponder **shall** regain full operational capability to within its operational limits within two seconds after the restoration of power following a momentary power interruption.  

Note:
 The transponder is not required to continue operating during momentary power 
interruptions. 
 

## 2.2.17 Mode S Transponders

The Mode S transponder supports ground-to-air and air-to-air surveillance. 

§1.4.3 of these MOPS indicates capabilities that become available through the use of Mode S and its data link.  The paragraphs which follow provide a more detailed description of these various capabilities as they relate to the specific features which must exist within Mode S avionics.  Each capability requires that the unit properly handle the associated formats, message fields, protocols and interfaces as specified in the referenced paragraphs. 

## 2.2.18 Level 1 Mode S Transponder

This transponder supports the ground-based surveillance functions of both ATCRBS and Mode S and also air-to-air surveillance.  It **shall** generate replies to valid ATCRBS Mode A and C interrogations.  The Mode S formats to be processed and protocol requirements for this transponder are defined in the following paragraphs. 

## 2.2.18.1 Mode S Formats

The transponder processes the 56-bit interrogations and 56-bit reply formats, listed in Figure 2-8 and Figure 2-9.  See §2.2.14.4 for definition and coding of the applicable fields.

## 2.2.18.2 Mode S Protocols

2.2.18.2.1 
Error Protection (Figure 2-10 and Figure 2-11) 
Parity check coding is used in Mode S interrogations and replies to provide protection against errors.  The Mode S parity check code is defined in paragraphs "a," "b" and "c" below. 

On receipt of a Mode S interrogation, the Mode S transponder **shall** perform a parity check, which is an examination of the sequence of demodulated bits to determine whether it is consistent with the code structure.  If the bit sequence is consistent, the parity check is passed; otherwise it is failed.  In this event the interrogation **shall not** be accepted. 

Similarly, the Mode S transponder **shall** encode prior to transmitting a reply or squitter so that these transmissions are consistent with the code structure. 

a. Parity Check Sequence
 - A sequence of 24 parity check bits, generated by a code 
described in "b," is incorporated into the field formed by the last 24 bits of a11 Mode S transmissions.  The 24 parity check bits are combined with either the address or the interrogator identification as described in "c."  The resulting combination then forms either the AP (Address/Parity) or the PI (Parity/Identification) field. 
b. 
Parity Check Sequence Generation
 - The sequence of 24 parity bits (P1, P2, . . . P24) 
is generated from the sequence of information bits (m1, m2, . . . mk) where k is 32 or 
88 for short or long transmissions respectively.  This is done by means of a code 
generated by the polynomial: 
 
$$\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{=}\sum_{\mathbf{i}=0}^{24}\mathbf{g_{i}x^{i}}$$. 
 
where g${}_{i}$ = 1 for I = 0, 3, 10 and 12 through 24. 0 otherwise 
 
When by the application of binary polynomial algebra the above G(x) is divided into 
[M(x)]x24 where the information sequence M(x) is expressed as: 

 
$\rm M(x)=m_{k}+m_{k,1}x+m_{k,2}x^{2}+m_{1}x^{k-1}$
 
the result is a quotient and a remainder R(x) of degree <24.  The bit sequence formed by this remainder **shall** be the parity check sequence.  Parity bit pi for any "i" from 1 
to 24, is the coefficient of x24-I in R(x). 

Note:
 The effect of multiplying M(x) by x24 is to append 24 ZERO bits to the end of the sequence. 

 
c. AP or PI Field Generation
2.2.18.2.2
 - The address used for AP field generation is either the 
discrete address (§
.a) or the All-Call address (§2.2.18.2.2.b).  The address 
shall be a sequence of 24 bits, (a1, a2 . . . a24).  In the discrete address, a1 **shall** be the 
bit transmitted first in the AA field of an All-Call reply.  This address sequence **shall** 
be used in the downlink Address/Parity field generation, while a modified form of 
this sequence (b1, b2 . . . b24) **shall** be used for uplink Address/Parity field generation. 
The interrogator identifier used for PI field generation is formed by a sequence of 24 
bits, (a1, a2, . . . a24) where the first 17 bits have ZERO value and the last seven bits 
are a replica of the CL and CI fields (see §2.2.14.4.30). 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Bit bi is the coefficient of x48-I in the polynomial G(x)A(x), where: 
 
 
A(x) = a1x23 + a2x22+ . . . + a24 

 
and 

 
 
G(x) is defined in §2.2.18.2.1 b. 

 
The sequence of bits transmitted in the AP or PI field is: 

 
$$\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{k+1}},\,\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{k+2}}\,.\,.\,.\,\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{k+24}}$$
 
The bits are numbered in order of transmission, starting with k+1. In interrogations: 

$$\mathbf{t}_{\mathrm{k+I}}=\mathbf{b}_{\mathrm{i}}\oplus\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$$
 
where "⊕" prescribes modulo-2 addition; I = 1 is the first bit transmitted in the AP field. In replies and squitters: 

$$\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{k+I}}=\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{i}}\oplus\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$$
 
where "⊕" prescribes modulo-2 addition; I = 1 is the first bit transmitted in AP or PI 
field. 

 
Note:
 Figure 2-10 and Figure 2-11 show typical implementations of the error protection circuits and a sample of bit patterns.

* As required 
 
Note:
 All timers are capable of being restarted.  On receipt of any start command, they run for their specified times.  This occurs regardless of whether they are in the running or the non-running state at the time that the start command is received.  A command to cancel a timer causes the timer to stop running and to return to its initial state in preparation for a subsequent start command.   
 
Mode S interrogations **shall** be accepted only if the address of the recipient is as defined in "a" or "b" below: 

a. Discrete Address
 - The interrogation **shall** be accepted if the address extracted from 
the received interrogation is identical to the transponder's address and UF is not 
equal to 11. 
b. 
All-Call Address
 - If the address extracted from the received interrogation consists of 
24 ONEs and UF=11, the transmission is a Mode S-Only All-Call and the received 
interrogation **shall** be accepted according to "i" below unless the lockout protocol is 
in effect.  Mode S-Only All-Call **shall not** be accepted (no replies) when in the onthe-ground state (consistent with the CA, VS and FS fields).   
c. 
ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call - An ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation (1.6 
microseconds P4) **shall** be accepted unless the TD timer is running or side lobe 
suppression is in effect or when in the "on-the-ground" state (consistent with the CA, 
VS and FS fields).   
Note:
 The acceptance of ATCRBS/Mode S All Call interrogations may be disabled in a future version of these MOPS.   

d. 
ATCRBS-Only All-Call
 - A Mode S transponder **shall not** accept the ATCRBS-
Only All-Call (0.8 microsecond P4). 
e. 
Lack of Reply Capability
 - The transponder **shall not** accept Mode S interrogations 
UF=4 or UF=5 if the code in the RR field is larger than 15. 
f. 
Side Lobe Suppression
2.2.5.1
 - Suppression as described in §
 **shall** apply to 
responses to ATCRBS and ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations. 
g. All-Call Lockout Conditions
 - On receipt of a Mode S-Only All-Call (UF=11) 
containing an Interrogator Code (IC and CL fields) corresponding to the designator 
of a running TL timer, the interrogation shall not be accepted unless the contained PR 
code is 8 through 12 and the "on-the-ground" report (CA, VS or FS field) does not include the ground condition.  Upon receipt of a Mode S-Only All-Call (UF=11) 
containing II=0, the interrogation **shall** be accepted if the TD timer is not running or if 
the received PR code is 8 through 12 and the "on-the-ground" report (CA, VS or FS 
field) does not include the ground condition. 
h. 
Formats for Which Transponder Is Not Equipped
 - The transponder shall not accept 
a Mode S format for which it is not equipped. 
i. 
Stochastic All-Calls
2.2.14.4.31
 - Upon receipt of a Mode S-Only All-Call with a PR 
(§
) code other than 0 or 8, the transponder **shall** execute a random 
process.  If the reply probability indicated by the outcome of the random process is less than or equal to the reply probability indicated by the value of PR and if no lockout condition applies (includes override, §2.2.18.2.4) and the "on-the-ground" report (CA, VS or FS field) does not include the ground condition the transponder 
shall accept the interrogation.   
If the value of PR is 5 through 7 or 13 through 15, the interrogation **shall not** be accepted. 

j. 
Mode S Reply Rate Limiting
 - Mode S interrogations shall not be accepted if the 
optional Mode S reply rate limit is exceeded. 
k. 
Transaction Cycle - If the transponder is in a transaction cycle, it shall not accept 
interrogations. 
The transaction cycle begins when the transponder has recognized an interrogation type and ends when the transponder has finished the reply or has aborted processing this interrogation. 

Note: A Mode S interrogation is recognized when the sync phase reversal has been detected.  The transaction cycle ends when either the interrogation has been accepted and has been replied to, or when the interrogation has not been accepted because of wrong address, lockout, etc.  An ATCRBS interrogation is recognized when a proper P1 - P3 interval has been detected and a following leading edge of a P4 has not been detected.  During ATCRBS 
suppression intervals recognition of P1 - P2 - P3 intervals is suspended.  In the interval between P1 and an expected P3, a transponder is not in a transaction cycle. 

 

## 2.2.18.2.3 Interrogation Reply Coordination

The transponder **shall** generate replies as follows, except when in the on-the-ground state:   

 

Interrogations 
ATCRBS Mode A 
Replies 
4096 Codes 
ATCRBS Mode C 
Altitude Codes 
ATCRBS Mode A/Mode S All-Call 
Reply is DF=11 
ATCRBS Mode C/Mode S All-Call 
Reply is DF=11 
Mode S-only All-Call (UF=11) 
Reply is DF=11 

 
Note:
 Transponders that simulate ATCRBS/Mode S All Call interrogations in self 
test/squitter transmission may occasionally open their window of non acceptance for this purpose coincident with an actual interrogation, thus generating a reply to the interrogation.  Such coincidental acceptance periods may be considered tolerable, but must not exceed one percent of transponder operating time. 
 

## 2.2.18.2.4 Lockout Protocol (Figure 2-13)

Transponders can be prevented from accepting certain interrogations by command from an interrogator. 

Non-Selective All-Call Lockout - On acceptance of an interrogation containing code 1 in the PC field or containing LOS=1 together with IIS=0 in the SD field or both of these code sets, the transponder **shall** start the TD timer.  This timer **shall** run for 18 ±1.0 
seconds after the last received command. 

Note:
 Non-selective All-Call lockout and multisite lockout are not mutually exclusive.  
Interrogators using multisite lockout protocols for interrogator networking 
coordination may use non-selective lockout commands in the same interrogation.  
The non-selective lockout may be used to prevent Mode S transponder replies with DF=11 to wrongly detected ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations from 
ATCRBS-Only All-Call interrogations because of the misinterpretation of the narrow P4 pulse as a wide P4 pulse.   

## All Transponders: Lockout Initiation 2.2.18.2.5 Multisite Lockout Protocol (Figure 2-13)

The multisite lockout command **shall** be transmitted in the SD field (§2.2.14.4.36).  A 
lockout command for an II code **shall** be transmitted in an SD with DI=1 or DI=7.  An II 
lockout command **shall** be indicated by LOS equals ONE in the presence of a non-zero interrogator identifier in the IIS subfield of SD.  A lockout command for an SI code **shall** 
be transmitted in an SD with DI=3.  An SI lockout **shall** be indicated by LSS 
(§2.2.19.2.1.1) equals ONE in the presence of a non-zero interrogator identifier in the SIS 
subfield of SD (§2.2.19.2.1).  After a transponder has accepted an interrogation containing a multisite lockout command, that transponder **shall** commence to lock out 
(i.e., not accept) any Mode S-only All-Call interrogation which includes the identifier of the interrogator that commanded the lockout.  The lockout timer (TL) **shall** persist for an interval 18 ±1 seconds after the last acceptance of an interrogation containing the multisite lockout command.  Multisite lockout **shall not** prevent acceptance of a Mode S-
only All-Call interrogation containing PR codes 8 to 12.  If a lockout command (LOS=1) 
is received together with IIS=0, it **shall** be interpreted as a non-selective all-call lockout. 

1. Fifteen interrogators can send independent multisite II lockout commands.  In 
addition, sixty-three interrogators can send independent SI lockout commands.  Each 
of these lockout commands must be timed separately. 
 
2. Multisite lockout (which uses only non-zero II codes) does not affect the response of 
the transponder to a Mode S-only All-Call interrogation containing II equals 0 or to Mode A/C/S All-Call interrogations. 
 
3. Non-selective All-Call lockout and multisite lockout are not mutually exclusive.  
Interrogators using multisite lockout protocols for interrogator networking coordination may use non-selective lockout commands in the same interrogation.  
The non-selective lockout may be used to prevent Mode S transponder replies with 
DF=11 to wrongly detected ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations from ATCRBS-
Only All-Call interrogations because of the misinterpretation of the narrow P4 pulse 
as a wide P4 pulse.   

## 2.2.18.2.6 Acquisition Squitter Protocols

Mode S transponders **shall** transmit Acquisition squitters to facilitate acquisition. 

a. Acquisition Squitter Format
 - The format used for the acquisition squitter 
transmissions **shall** be the All-Call reply, DF=11 using II=0 and SI=0 in generating 
the PI field. 
b. 
Squitter Rate
 - Acquisition squitter transmissions **shall** be emitted at random 
intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range from 0.8 to 1.2 seconds using a time quantization no greater than 15 milliseconds relative to the previous acquisition 
squitter, with the following exceptions: 
(1) 
The scheduled acquisition squitter **shall** be delayed if a mutual suppression 
interface is active. 
Note:
 A mutual suppression system may be used to connect on-board 
equipment operating in the same frequency band in order to prevent mutual interference.  Squitter action resumes as soon as practical after a mutual suppression interval. 
2.2.18.2.2.k.). 

(2) 
The scheduled acquisition squitter **shall** be delayed if the transponder is in a 
transaction cycle (see §
(3) 
The scheduled acquisition squitter **shall** be delayed if an Extended Squitter is 
in process. 
(4) 
Acquisition squitters **shall** only be transmitted when in the on-the-ground state 
if the transponder is not reporting the surface type of Mode S Extended Squitter or as specified in subparagraph c. 
An acquisition squitter **shall not** be interrupted by link transactions after the squitter transmission has begun.  A delayed acquisition squitter **shall** be transmitted as soon as the condition causing the delay no longer exists. 

 Extended Squitter applies to Level 2 or higher transponders so equipped. 

Conditions for Acquisition Squitter Transmission
c. 
2.2.23.1.7
 - The following applies to 
transponders transmitting Extended Squitters.  When commanded to report the surface type formats by TCS commands (see §
), aircraft without automatic 
means of determining the on-the-ground condition, and aircraft with such means that 
are reporting airborne state, **shall** transmit acquisition squitters in addition to the surface Extended Squitter formats unless acquisition squitter transmission has been inhibited (subparagraph d.).   

Note 1: 
This action is taken to ensure TCAS acquisition in the event that the 
ground station inadvertently commands an airborne aircraft to report the surface Extended Squitter formats.  
Note 2: 
A summary of the acquisition squitter transmission conditions is presented in the following table.  In this table, Y indicates that the acquisition squitter is regularly broadcast, and N means that the acquisition squitter is suppressed.  
Note 3:
 
The condition of no transmission of any Extended Squitter can result from 
initialization with no position, velocity, or identity data available.

Notes:
1. 
Y = regular transmission of acquisition squitters 
2. 
N = acquisition squitter suppressed 
3. 
Surveillance type Extended Squitters are airborne position, airborne velocity or surface position 
Extended Squitters 
 
d. Future Suppression of Regular Transmission of Acquisition Squitter
 Transponders 
equipped for Extended Squitter operation should have a means to disable acquisition squitters when Extended Squitters are being emitted.  After regular acquisition 
squitter suppression has been implemented, the acquisition squitter **shall** continue to 
be broadcast by transponders if they are not emitting any Extended Squitters.  
1. Provision of this means will facilitate the suppression of acquisition squitters 
when all TCAS units have been converted to receive the Extended Squitter. 
2. Broadcast of acquisition squitters when no Extended Squitter is broadcast is 
necessary in order to ensure acquisition by TCAS. 
3. A TCAS will need to retain the ability to receive the acquisition squitter even 
after that TCAS has been converted to receive the Extended Squitter. 

## 2.2.18.2.7 Flight Status And Vertical Status Protocols (Figure 2-17)

Mode S-equipped aircraft **shall** report details of their flight status.  The source of and the rules for such reports are as follows: 

a. Alert - The transponder **shall** transmit the 4096 identification code in ATCRBS 
Mode A replies and in the ID field of downlink format DF=5.  This code can be 
changed by the pilot, and when a change is made an alert condition **shall** be 
established.  If the identification code is changed to 7500, 7600 or 7700, the alert 
condition **shall** be permanent.  If the identification code is changed to any other value, the alert condition **shall** be temporary and self-canceling after 18 ±1 seconds 
(TC timer).  The TC timer **shall** be retriggered and continued for 18 ±1 seconds after 
any change has been accepted by the transponder function.  The alert condition **shall** be reported in the FS field.  The permanent alert condition **shall** be terminated and 
replaced by a temporary alert condition when the identification code is set to a value other than 7500, 7600 or 7700.  
Note 1:
 
Retriggering is performed to ensure that the ground interrogator obtains the desired Mode 3/A code before the alert condition is cleared. 

When the transponder transitions to normal operation (see §
2.1.7.c) it **shall** initiate a temporary alert for 18 ±1 seconds.   

b. On-the-Ground Report
 - The on-the-ground status of the aircraft **shall** be reported in 
the FS field and the VS field and the CA field.  If a means for automatically indicating the on-the-ground condition (e.g., a weight on wheels or strut switch) is 
available at the transponder data interface, it **shall** be used as the basis for the 
reporting of vertical status.  If a means for automatically indicating the on-the-ground 
condition is not available at the transponder data interface, the FS and VS codes **shall** 
indicate that the aircraft is airborne and the CA field **shall** indicate that the aircraft is 
either airborne or on-the-ground (CA=6).   
c. 
Validation of declared on-the-ground status 
Note 2:

 
For aircraft with an automatic means of determining vertical status, the CA field reports whether the aircraft is airborne or on the ground. ACAS II acquires aircraft using the short or Extended Squitter, both of which contain the CA field.  If an aircraft reports on-the-ground status, that aircraft will not be interrogated by ACAS II in order to reduce 
unnecessary interrogation activity.   
For Aircraft with an automatic means for determining the on-the-ground condition, transponders that have access to at least one of the following parameters (ground speed, radio altitude, airspeed) **shall** perform the following validation check: 

If the automatically determined air/ground condition is not available, or is 
"airborne," no validation **shall** be performed. 
If the automatically determined air/ground condition is available, and the "on-theground" condition is being reported, then the air/ground condition **shall** be overridden and changed to "airborne" if:   
Ground Speed > 100 knots OR Airspeed > 100 knots OR Radio Altitude > 50 feet 

Note 3: 
For Extended Squitter installations, the on-the-ground validation is 
optional for Aircraft reporting ADS-B Emitter Category Set "A" codes 0, 1 or 7 as defined in the latest version of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-
102A, §2.2.3.2.1.2. 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Note 4:
 
Modern aircraft with integrated avionics suites commonly contain 
sophisticated algorithms for determining the air/ground state based on multiple aircraft sensors.  These algorithms are customized to the airframe and designed to overcome individual sensor failures.  These algorithms are an acceptable means to determine the air/ground state and do not require 
additional validation.   
Special Position Identification
d. 
2.2.23.1.8

 - When manually selected, the transponder **shall** 
transmit the equivalent of the ATCRBS SPI in the FS field of surveillance replies DF=4, 5, 20, 21 and in the Surveillance Status Subfield (see §
) of Extended 
Squitter transmissions (DF=17) when they contain the airborne position report.  This 
code **shall** be transmitted for 18 ±1 seconds (TI timer) after initiation and can be 
reinitiated at any time. 
 

## 2.2.18.2.8 Capability Reporting

The transponder **shall** transmit a "0" value in the three-bit CA (capability) field of an All-
Call (DF=11) reply. 

 

## 2.2.18.2.9 All-Call Reply Protocol

Upon acceptance of a Mode S-Only All-Call interrogation (UF=11) the transponder **shall** 
reply by overlaying the received II or SI code on parity according to §2.2.18.2.1, resulting in the PI field which **shall** be used in the reply (DF=11).  Upon acceptance of an ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations the transponder **shall** generate the PI field using II=0. 

 

## 2.2.18.2.10 Reply Content (Figure 2-18)

The information content of a Mode S reply **shall** reflect the conditions existing in the transponder after completion of all transponder processing of the interrogation soliciting that reply.   
In the reply to UF=0, the transponder **shall** insert: 

 
VS in bit 6. RI in bits 14 to 17. 

AC in bits 20 to 32. 

In the reply to UF=4, AC **shall** be in bits 20 to 32.  In the reply to UF=5, ID **shall** be in bits 20 to 32.  In the reply to UF=11, AA **shall** be in bits 9 to 32. In replies to UF=4 and UF=5, the transponder **shall** insert ZEROs in bits 9 through 13 in the DR field. 

## 2.2.18.2.11 Data Handling And Interfaces

The transponder **shall** have the following data interfaces as described in §2.2.13: 

 

Mode S Discrete Address (AA) 
Maximum Airspeed (RI) Pressure Altitude (AC) 4096 Identification Code (ID) On-the-Ground Condition (FS, VS, CA) 
Special Position Indicator (FS) 

## 2.2.19 Minimum Level 2 Transponder Description

An overview of data link uses appears in §1.4.7.  The following subparagraphs "a" through "g" provide a general description of data link transponders. 

a. 
Formats 
Messages appear in dedicated fields (MA, MB, MC, etc.) of some Mode S formats. 

b. 
Participants 
Uplink messages are generally directed to the pilot's attention.  Downlink messages can be readouts of on-board data which do not need pilot intervention or can be messages deliberately sent by the pilot.  ("Pilot" is to be understood as any of the flight deck crew.) 

c. 
Peripherals 
Peripherals, also called I/O devices, process and store messages received and/or to be transmitted.  They translate received messages into visual or aural form, and messages to be transmitted, into agreed-upon binary coding.  Peripherals can be contained within the transponder enclosure or can be separated from the transponder. 

d. 
Interfaces 
If peripheral separation as mentioned above is used, interfaces (see §
2.2.13) **shall** be part of the transponder design. 

e. 
Message Content, Specified 
This document specifies message content only for standardized messages which have their data base within the transponder.  These are the data link capability report 
(Register 1016), and the aircraft identification report (Register 2016) using Comm-B, and the transmission and acknowledgment subfields of the downlink ELM protocol (see §
2.2.19.1.12.6, §2.2.19.1.13 and §2.2.20.1.1.1.6) 
Message Content, NOT Specified 

f. 
Message structure and coding for various data link applications will be found in the documents describing those services. 

g. 
Protocol Overview 
Data exchanges are always under control of the interrogator.  Comm-A messages are sent directly to the transponder.  Ground-initiated Comm-B replies are extracted from the transponder by suitable interrogation content.  Air-initiated Comm-B messages are announced by the transponder and are transmitted in a subsequent reply only after authorization by the interrogator.  Longer messages, either on the uplink or downlink, can be exchanged by the ELM protocol using Comm-C and Comm-D formats.  The ELM protocol provides for the interrogator transmission of up to sixteen 112-bit message segments before requiring a reply from the transponder.  It also allows a corresponding procedure for downlink ELM transmission. Air-initiated Comm-B messages are announced to all interrogators and can be extracted by any interrogator.  However, an individual interrogator can use the multisite protocol to reserve for itself the ability to close out (cancel) the Comm-B transaction.  A similar coordination technique applies to the ELM protocol.  A transponder can be instructed to identify the interrogator that has reserved the transponder for an ELM transaction.  Only that interrogator can terminate the ELM transaction. 

## 2.2.19.1 Minimum Level 2 Transponder Requirements

The operational functions described in §1.4.3.2 require that this transponder **shall**, in addition to the functions of the Level 1 transponder: 

a. Process uplink and downlink formats DF=16, UF=DF=20 and 21 (Figure 2-14).  The 
format UF=16 is optional.   
Note:
 UF=16 is supported by transponders connected to an on-board operational TCAS (see §
). 

2.2.22

b. Receive broadcast transmissions from sensors (§2.2.19.1.11). 
c. Follow the protocols for: 

Comm-A (see §2.2.19.1.10). 
Comm-B (see §2.2.19.1.12). 
Comm-U/V (air-air) (see §2.2.19.1.16). Multisite message operation (see §2.2.19.2). 
Report Codes 4 through 7 in the CA field (see §2.2.14.4.6). TCAS crosslink capability (see §2.2.19.1.18).

## 2.2.19.1.1 Interrogation Acceptance Protocol (Figure 2-15)

The interrogation acceptance protocol of §2.2.18.2.2 **shall** be used with the following additions: 

a. An interrogation may optionally be accepted or not accepted if the corresponding 
data buffer (see §2.2.13.3.1) is full. 
b. An interrogation **shall** be accepted as a "broadcast" if the UF format code is 20, 21 or 
16 (if so equipped), and if an ALL ONEs address is decoded. 
c. Only formats for which the transponder is designed, and to which it can reply, **shall** 
be accepted. 

## 2.2.19.1.2 Error Protection

The parity algorithm described in §2.2.18.2.1 **shall** be expanded to include 112-bit transmissions. 

## 2.2.19.1.3 Information Transfer

The minimum Level 2 transponder **shall** be able to transfer information to and from the appropriate data sinks (destinations) and sources (see §2.2.13 and §2.2.19.c and 
§2.2.19.d). 

## 2.2.19.1.4 Interrogation-Reply Coordination (Figure 2-16)

The transponder **shall** generate replies to interrogations as follows: 

Interrogation

Reply 
4096 Code 
ATCRBS Mode C (see Note) 
Altitude Code 
ATCRBS/Mode S All-Calls (see Note)

     The transponder does not reply when the conditions of §
                                                                  apply.   

Upon acceptance of an interrogation with UF codes 0 or 16, the transponder **shall** reply with DF=0, if RL=0, and **shall** reply with DF=16, if RL=1. 

If the transponder is not equipped with the optional long air-air formats UF=DF=16, it shall not accept UF=16 and it **shall not** reply to UF=0 containing RL=1. 

Upon acceptance of an interrogation with a UF code of 4, 5, 20 or 21, the transponder shall examine the RR code and generate downlink formats as follows: 

Uplink Format, UF 
RR Code 
Downlink Format, DF 
4

Lockout commands shall not be accepted if they occur within a broadcast interrogation. 

In addition to the rules in §2.2.18.2.4, lockout commands **shall** be accepted if they appear in interrogations UF=20 and UF=21. 

 

## 2.2.19.1.6 Flight And Vertical Status Protocols (Figure 2-17)

The FS report (see §2.2.18.2.7) **shall** also appear in DF=20 and DF=21 and VS **shall** also appear in DF=16. 

 

## 2.2.19.1.7 Capability Report

The transponder **shall** reply with a non-zero value of CA (see §2.2.14.4.6) in the capability field of DF=11 and DF=17, indicating that further data link information is available in a data link capability report (§2.2.19.1.12.6). 

## 2.2.19.1.8 Reply Content (Figure 2-18)

The reply content summary of §2.2.18.2.10 **shall** apply.  Additionally, the rules applying to formats UF=4, UF=5 **shall** also apply to formats UF=20 and UF=21 respectively. 

 

## All Transponders: Reply Content 2.2.19.1.9 Um Protocol (Figure 2-19)

The UM field **shall** support functions for the multisite protocol.  The following paragraphs contain the requirements and descriptions of the protocol. 

a. Field description is in §2.2.14.4.41. 
b. If DI=1, multisite information may be requested as specified in §2.2.19.2.1.2. 
c. If no request appears, direct Comm-B/D information may appear in UM as specified 
in §2.2.19.2.3.2 and §2.2.20.2.3.2. 
 For a Level 5 transponder, there is a TRB and TRD timer for each IIS. 

## Note: 2.2.19.1.10 Comm-A Protocol

Comm-A is the transmission of information from the ground to the aircraft by formats UF=20, 21.  In addition to the content of the corresponding short formats (UF=4, 5) the Comm-A formats contain the additional 56-bit field MA. 

The Level 2 transponder **shall** direct the content of received Comm-A formats to the interface (see §2.2.13.2). 

 

## 2.2.19.1.11 Broadcast Protocol

If a broadcast interrogation has been accepted (see §2.2.19.1.1), the minimum data link transponder **shall** make that information available at the appropriate interface.  
Other transponder functions **shall not** be affected, and a reply **shall not** be transmitted.  
The transponder does not process the control fields of a Comm-A broadcast interrogation, so the 27 bits following the UF field are also available for user data. 

 

## 2.2.19.1.12 Comm-B Protocol (Figure 2-20)

Comm-B is the transmission of information from the aircraft to the ground and follows the general protocol as outlined in §2.2.19.g.  Figure 2-20 is a flow chart containing the ground-initiated Comm-B readout, the procedures for air-initiated Comm-B transactions and the multisite procedures.

## 2.2.19.1.12.1 Data Source Designators

When Comm-B information to be transmitted resides in data sources that are part of the Mode S installation, the data sources **shall** be identified by the BDS code of 
§2.2.14.4.21.b.  The interrogator uses the RR field of surveillance and Comm-A 
interrogations to designate the BDSl of the data source from which the reply should originate.  BDS1 is represented by the last 4 bits (bits 10 - 13) of the received RR code (see §2.2.14.4.35).   
If the DI code of the Comm-B requesting interrogation is not equal to 3 or 7, the BDS2 
code of the desired reply source **shall** be "0."   
If the "DI" code of the Comm-B requesting interrogation is 0, 3, or 7, the "SD" contains the "OVC" in accordance with §2.2.19.2.1.1.h.  If the "OVC" is equal to "1," then the reply to the interrogation **shall** contain the "DP" (Data Parity) field in accordance with 
§2.2.14.4.12.  If the "OVC" is equal to "0," then the reply to the interrogation **shall** 
contain the "AP" (see §2.2.14.4.4).   
 

## 2.2.19.1.12.2 Extended Data Source Designators

The interrogator can request data to be read out from a source more specifically defined by both BDS1 and BDS2.  The readout is initiated by transmitting, in addition to the BDS1 code in RR, the BDS2 code in the SD field.  See §2.2.19.2.1.1 for definitions of subfields in SD. For transponders that support the Overlay Command Capability, if the "DI" code of the Comm-B requesting interrogation is 0, 3, or 7, the "SD" contains the "OVC" in accordance with §2.2.19.2.1.1.h.  If the "OVC" is equal to "1," then the reply to the interrogation **shall** contain the "DP" (Data Parity) field in accordance with §2.2.14.4.12.  
If the "OVC" is equal to "0," then the reply to the interrogation **shall** contain the "AP" 
(see §2.2.14.4.4). 

## 2.2.19.1.12.3 Ground-Initiated Comm-B

To read out data aboard the aircraft, the interrogator will transmit the appropriate data designators and the transponder **shall** insert the data according to §2.2.19.1.12.1 or 
§2.2.19.1.12.2.   

2.2.19.1.12.4 
Air-Initiated Comm-B 
An air-initiated Comm-B sequence **shall** start upon the acceptance of a message intended for delivery to the ground sensor.  After receipt of this message, the transponder **shall** 
insert codes 1 or 3 in the DR field of a surveillance or Comm-B reply, DF=4, 5, 20, 21. On receipt of this announcement, the interrogator transmits code 16 with DI≠7 or with DI=7 and RRS=0 in the RR field of a subsequent interrogation.  This includes when DI=4, 5 or 6, which are currently reserved.  Receipt of this code by the transponder **shall** 
constitute the authorization to transmit the data.  The resulting MB field contains a code identifying the content of the field.  This reply, and others following it, **shall** continue to contain codes 1 or 3 in the DR field.  After the message has been transmitted at least once in response to an interrogation using non-selective protocols and after closeout is received (Code 4 in the PC field) in UF=4, 5, 20, 21, the transaction **shall** be closed out and the DR code belonging to this message immediately removed.  Another message waiting to be transmitted can then set the DR code to 1 or 3 so that the reply can contain the announcement of this next message.  If RR=16 with DI≠7, or with DI=7 and RRS=0, is received while no message is waiting to be transmitted, the reply **shall** contain all ZEROs in the MB field.  An interrogation with DI=3 shall not affect the state of the Air-
Initiated Comm-B protocol.

## 2.2.19.1.12.5 Comm-B Broadcast

Note:
 A Comm-B broadcast is a message directed to all active interrogators in view.  
Messages are alternately numbered 1, 2 and are available for 18 seconds unless a waiting air-initiated Comm-B interrupts the cycle.  Interrogators have no 
means to cancel the Comm-B broadcast.   
A Comm-B broadcast starts, when no air-initiated Comm-B transaction is in effect, with the insertion of DR codes 4, 5, 6 or 7 into downlink transmissions of DFs 4, 5, 20, 21 and with the starting of the B-timer.  On receipt of the above DR codes, interrogators may extract the broadcast message by transmitting RR=16 with DI≠3 or 7, or with DI=3 or 7 
and RRS=0 in subsequent interrogations.  When the B-timer runs out after 18 ±1 seconds, the transponder will reset the DR codes as required, will discard the previous broadcast message and change from 1 to 2 (or vice versa) the broadcast message number.   
If an air-initiated Comm-B transaction is initiated during the broadcasting interval (i.e., while the B timer is running), the B timer is stopped and reset, the appropriate code is inserted into the DR field and the Comm-B transaction proceeds per Figure 2-20.  The previous Comm-B broadcast message remains ready to be reactivated for 18 ±1 seconds after conclusion of the air-initiated Comm-B transaction.   

## 2.2.19.1.12.6 Data Link Capability Report

The data link capability report provides the interrogator with a description of the data link capability of the Mode S installation.  The subfield definitions of the Data Link Capability Report are contained in Appendix B.  The report is obtained by a groundinitiated Comm-B, containing RR=17 (see §2.2.19.1.12.3). 

## 2.2.19.1.12.6.1 Subfields In Mb For Data Link Capability Report

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The subfields within MB of the data link capability report are: 
BDS1 Code "1" is assigned to this 4-bit (bits 33 - 36) subfield for all data link capability reports. 

BDS2 is a 4-bit (bits 37 - 40) subfield.  The basic report uses BDS2=0.  

## 2.2.19.1.12.6.2 Coding Of The Data Link Capability Report

BDS1: 1  =  Data Link Report 
BDS2: 0  =  Basic Report 
For AIS capability reporting in the Data Link Capability Report, see §2.2.24.   
SCS: This 1-bit (bit 66) squitter capability subfield **shall** report the capability of the transponder to transmit Extended Squitter position reports.  It **shall** be set to ONE if GICB Registers 0516 and 0616 have been updated within the last 10 ±1 seconds.  
Otherwise it **shall** be set to ZERO.  The internal insertion of data by the transponder into these registers (altitude and surveillance status) shall not qualify as a register update for this purpose. 

Note: GICB Registers 0516 and 0616 are used for the Extended Squitter airborne and surface position reports, respectively. 

SIC: This one bit (bit 67) SI capability subfield **shall** report the capability of the transponder to process SI codes.  It **shall** be set to ONE for transponders with SI code capability.  Otherwise it **shall** be set to ZERO.   
OCC:
2.2.14.4.12
 This one bit (bit 47) Overlay Command Capability subfield **shall** report the capability of the transponder to include the Data Parity (see §
) downlink field when commanded by the interrogator (§2.2.19.2.1.1.h).  It **shall** be set to ONE for transponders with Overlay Command Capability.  Otherwise, it **shall** be set to ZERO.   
Other bits are reserved for TCAS (see §2.2.22.1.2.2).  

## 2.2.19.1.12.6.3 Updating Of The Data Link Capability Report

At intervals not exceeding four seconds, the transponder compares the current basic data link capability status with that last reported and if a difference is noted, initiates a revised basic data link capability report by Comm-B broadcast for BDS1=1 and BDS2=0. 

The transponder **shall** initiate, generate and announce the revised basic data link capability report even if the aircraft data link capability is degraded or lost.  To support this requirement, the transponder **shall** set the BDS subfield for the basic data link capability report. 

Note:
 The setting of the BDS code by the transponder ensures that a broadcast change of the capability report will contain the BDS code for all cases of data link failure (e.g., the loss of the transponder data link interface). 

## 2.2.19.1.13 Aircraft Identification Reporting And Ais Aircraft Identification Subfield In Mb

This subsection contains baseline aircraft identification requirements.  More detailed requirements for implementation are provided in §2.2.24 as part of the Elementary Surveillance (ELS).   
If a transponder is equipped for AIS reporting (Aircraft Identification Reporting), it **shall** 
report the information in the AIS subfield as described below. 

## Aircraft Identification Reporting A.

If so equipped, the transponder **shall** report the aircraft identification (aircraft radio call sign) used in the flight plan.  This may be either the trip number assigned to commercial flights or the aircraft registration number, where applicable. 

Note:
 A firm requirement exists for the AIS feature in European Airspace.  In such usage, the identification number entered in field 7 of the ICAO flight plan format **shall** be transmitted in the AIS subfield. 

b. 
AIS Aircraft Identification Subfield in MB 
If a surveillance or Comm-A interrogation (UF=4, 5, 20, 21) contains RR=18 and DI 
does not equal 3 or 7, or DI equals 3 or 7 and RRS=0, the transponder **shall** report its aircraft identification number in the 48-bit (41-88) AIS subfield in MB.  

c. 

## Coding Of The Ais Subfield

The MB field containing the AIS subfield **shall** be coded as follows:

 Aircraft Identification coding permits up to eight characters.   
Note:
The BDS code for the Aircraft Identification message **shall** be BDS1=2 and BDS2=0. 

Each character **shall** be coded as a six-bit subset of the ICAO 7-unit coded character set (ICAO Annex 10) as illustrated in the following table.  The character code **shall** 
be transmitted with the most significant bit b6 first.  The reported aircraft code **shall** 
begin with the left-most character, character 1 (abbreviated as Ch 1 in the above diagram).  Characters **shall** be coded consecutively without an intervening SPACE code.  Any unused character spaces at the end of the subfield **shall** contain a SPACE 
character code. 

d. 

## Aircraft Identification Capability Reporting

Transponders that respond to a ground-initiated request for aircraft identification shall report this capability in the Data Link Capability Report according to 
§
2.2.19.1.12.6.2. 

## Change Of Aircraft Identification

e. 
If the aircraft identification reported in the AIS subfield is changed in flight, then the transponder **shall** report the new identification to the ground by use of the Comm-B 
Broadcast Message protocol. 

The transponder **shall** initiate, generate and announce the revised Aircraft Identification report even if the interface supplying the Aircraft Identification data is degraded or lost.  To support this requirement, the transponder **shall** set the BDS 
subfield for the Aircraft Identification report.

## 2.2.19.1.14 Linked Comm-A Coding

Peripherals attached to the Level 2 transponder may use the linked Comm-A protocol. The transponder is transparent to this protocol.  

## 2.2.19.1.15 Multisite Message Protocol

The Level 2 transponder **shall** use the multisite message protocol of §2.2.19.2 as it applies to Comm-B operation.   

## 2.2.19.1.16 Comm-U/V Protocol

The TCAS compatible transponder has the optional capability to receive, store and process information contained in the MU field of UF=16 and return the result of such process in the MV field of subsequent replies. The protocol described in §2.2.18.2.10 applies to the first 32 bits of UF=16 and DF=16. 

The protocol for the contents of the MU and MV fields will be as prescribed for that service. 

## 2.2.19.1.17 Data Handling And Interfaces

In addition to the interfaces described in §2.2.18.2.11, the Level 2 transponder **shall** have interfaces for indirect data as specified in §2.2.13.2. 

## 2.2.19.1.18 Tcas Crosslink Protocol

In response to a UF=0 with RL=1 (see §2.2.14.4.34) and DS≠0 (see §2.2.14.4.14), the transponder **shall** reply with a DF=16 reply in which the MV field **shall** contain the contents of the ground-initiated Comm-B register designated by the DS value.  If the requested Register is not supported by the aircraft installation, then the transponder **shall** 
reply with an MV field containing ALL ZEROs.  In response to a UF=0 with RL=1 and DS=0, the transponder **shall** reply with a DF=16 with an MV field of ALL ZEROs.  
Receipt of a UF=0 with DS non-zero but RL=0 **shall** have no associated TCAS crosslink action, and the transponder **shall** reply per §2.2.14.4.34.   

## 2.2.19.2 The Multisite Message Protocol

Under certain circumstances it may be necessary for several Mode S interrogators, which have overlapping coverage, to operate without being in direct communication with each other.  The multisite protocols described herein provide a means to prevent conflicts. All multisite protocols are covered in the following paragraphs.  However, only the Comm-B protocol **shall** apply to the Level 2 transponders.   

## 2.2.19.2.1 Multisite Data Formats 2.2.19.2.1.1 Subfields In Sd

The SD field (see §2.2.14.4.36) contains information as follows: 

a. If the DI code is 0, 1 or 7: 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
IIS: The 4-bit (17 - 20) Interrogator Identifier Subfield contains the selfidentification code of the interrogator which is numerically identical to the II code transmitted by the same interrogator in the Mode S-Only All-Call.  IIS codes are assigned to interrogators and range from 0 through 15; IIS=0 is not a valid interrogator identifier for multisite purposes. 

b. If the DI=l: 
MBS: The 2-bit (bits 21 and 22) Multisite Comm-B Subfield has been assigned the 
following codes: 

|   Code  | Description        |

RSS: 
The 2-bit (bits 27 - 28) Reservation Status Subfield can request the 
transponder to report its reservation status in the UM field.  The following codes have been assigned: 

|   Code  | Description                            |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
|      0  | No request                             |
|      1  | Report Comm-B reservation status in UM |
|      2  | Report Comm-C reservation status in UM |
|      3  | Report Comm-D reservation status in UM |

c. If the DI code is 1 or 7: 
LOS: 
The 1-bit (bit 26) Lockout Subfield, if set to ONE, initiates a multisite All-
Call lockout to Mode S-Only All-Calls (UF=11) from the interrogator 
indicated in IIS of the same interrogation.  If LOS is set to ZERO no change in lockout state is commanded.  
TMS: Tactical Message Subfield, subfield in SD 4 bits, 29 through 32.  This 
subfield is used for identifying linkage of Comm-A messages, with "0" 
indicating an unlinked message.  Coding for this field is described in 
Appendix C, §C.2.2.7.  
d. If the DI=7: 
RRS: 
Reply Request, subfield in SD, 4 bits, 21 through 24. 
Coding: Corresponding to the requested BDS2 code.  (See note in §2.2.14.4.35).  

e. If the DI=2, the SD field is used for Extended Squitter surface control (see 
§2.2.23.1.7). 
f. 
If the DI=3: SIS: 
The 6-bit (bits 17 - 22) surveillance identifier subfield in SD **shall** contain an 
assigned SI code of the interrogator (see §2.2.14.4.37).  
LSS: 
The 1-bit (bit 23) lockout surveillance subfield if set to ONE **shall** signify a 
multisite lockout command from the interrogator indicated in SIS.  LSS set to 
ZERO **shall** be used to signify that no change in lockout state is commanded.  
RRS: 
This 4-bit (bits 24 - 27) reply request subfield in SD **shall** be coded as 
specified in subparagraph d.  
g. If DI=4, 5 or 6 then the SD field has no meaning and **shall not** impact other 
transaction cycle protocols.  These DI codes remain reserved until future assignment of the SD field.     
h. If DI=0, 3 or 7: 
In addition to the requirements provided above, the "SD" **shall** contain the following: 

"OVC": 
The 1-bit (bit 28) "Overlay Command" subfield in "SD" is used by the 
interrogator to command that the Data Parity ("DP") (see §2.2.14.4.12) be used in the resulting reply to the interrogation in accordance with §2.2.19.1.12.1 and §2.2.19.1.12.2.   
When DI=1, PC field processing **shall** be completed before processing the SD field.  

Note 1: 
If SD field processing were to be performed before PC field processing in an interrogation containing a Comm–B close-out in the PC field and a request or a multisite reservation in the SD field, the results would be incorrect.

## 2.2.19.2.1.2 Subfields In Um For Multisite Protocols

If a surveillance or Comm-A interrogation (UF=4, 5, 20, 21) contains DI=1 and RSS 
equals other than "0," the following subfields will be inserted into the reply by the transponder. 

If the above interrogation contains DI=0 or 7, or when DI=1 and RSS=0, the transponder shall insert IIS and IDS codes according to a Comm-B reservation if such reservation exists or is presently requested.  In the absence of a Comm-B reservation, IIS and IDS 
codes for an existing or requested Comm-D reservation **shall** be inserted. 

IIS: 
The four-bit (bits 14 - 17) Interrogator Identifier Subfield reports the identity 
of the interrogator that has made a multisite reservation. 
IDS: 
The two-bit (bits 18 - 19) Identifier Designator Subfield reports the type of 
reservation made by the interrogator identified in IIS.  Assigned coding is: 

|   Code  | Description               |
|---------|---------------------------|
|      0  | no information available  |
|      1  | Comm-B reservation active |
|      2  | Comm-C reservation active |
|      3  | Comm-D reservation active |

## 2.2.19.2.2 Multisite Common Protocols

The multisite timers and the interrogator identity report are common to all multisite message protocols. 

## 2.2.19.2.2.1 Multisite Timers

The multisite protocols require three timers in the transponder: 

B-timer for Comm-B - (TRB) 
C-timer for Comm-C - (TRC) 
D-timer for Comm-D - (TRD) 

Each multisite timer **shall** run for 18 ±1 seconds after starting or restarting and is used for automatic closeout of the respective message type. 

 Each timer can be stopped (reset) on command from the ground. 

Note:

## 2.2.19.2.2.2 Interrogator Identity Report

Transponders **shall** insert the interrogator identifier into the UM field of the reply according to the coding of RSS. 

## 2.2.19.2.3 Multisite Comm-B Protocol (Figure 2-20)

The multisite Comm-B protocol augments the standard Comm-B protocol and when not in use **shall not** modify the standard process in any way. 

## 2.2.19.2.3.1 Multisite Comm-B Reservation

When the multisite protocol is in use, an interrogator extracts an air-initiated Comm-B by transmitting a surveillance or Comm-A interrogation containing: 

| RR     | =    | 16 (read air-initiated Comm-B)    |
|--------|------|-----------------------------------|
| DI     | =    | 1 (multisite SD format)           |
| IIS    | =    | Interrogator's site number        |

MBS 
= 
1 (Comm-B reservation request) 
The interrogator may also transmit: 
RSS=1 (Comm-B reservation status request) 
A multisite Comm-B reservation is invalid and **shall not** be granted by the transponder unless an air-initiated Comm-B message is waiting to be transmitted and the requesting interrogation contains RR=16, DI=1, MBS=1, IIS is not zero and the B timer is not running.  
Transponder protocol procedures **shall** depend upon the state of the B-timer as follows: 

a. B-timer not running 
Store IIS for Comm-B. Start B-timer. 
b. B-timer running and interrogator's IIS equals stored Comm-B IIS 
Restart B-timer. 
c. B-timer running and interrogator's IIS is not equal to stored Comm-B IIS 
No change to stored IIS or B-timer. 
Note:
 When an interrogator asks for Comm-B reservation status and receives its own 
site number in the UM field of the reply to an interrogation that contained the multisite Comm-B request, it knows that it is the reserved site for this message and that it should complete the transaction by closing out the message. 

## 2.2.19.2.3.2 Multisite Directed Comm-B Transmissions

If the airborne data system needs to direct a Comm-B message to a specific interrogator, the air-initiated Comm-B protocol **shall** be used together with the multisite protocol above.  When the B-timer is not running, the IIS of the desired destination **shall** be stored and transmitted in bits 14-17, together with IDS=1 in bits 18 and 19 of the UM field unless UM use is preempted by command from the ground.  Simultaneously the B-timer shall be started and code DR=1 transmitted. 

The reservation **shall not** be automatically timed out by the transponder but **shall** 
continue until either:  

a. the message is read and closed out by the reserved site; or  
b. the message is canceled by the data link processor.  
Note: This protocol is intended to result in delivery of the message only to the reserved site.  As in all air-initiated messages, the data link processor may withdraw the message if delivery has not been accomplished within a nominal time or if another air-initiated message is waiting to be sent.  In this protocol the B-timer in the transponder is not actually used as a timer.  However, it does retain its function as a flag to indicate that a multisite transaction is in progress (see §2.2.19.2.3.1). 

 

## 2.2.19.2.3.3 Multisite Comm-B Closeout

Multisite Comm-B closeout is accomplished using a surveillance or Comm-A 
interrogation containing: 

| Either:    | DI     | =                         | 1 (multisite SD format).    |
|------------|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| IIS        | =      | Interrogator site number. |                             |
| MBS        | =      | 2 (Comm-B closeout).      |                             |
|            |        |                           |                             |
| Or:        | DI     | =                         | 0, 1 or 7                   |
| IIS        | =      | Interrogator site number  |                             |
| PC         | =      | 4 (Comm-B closeout)       |                             |

If IIS of the interrogation equals the stored Comm-B IIS, the stored Comm-B **shall** be cleared, the B-timer stopped, the DR code 1 for this message reset and the message itself canceled.  If the site numbers do not match, the message shall not be canceled and the stored Comm-B IIS, B-timer and DR code **shall** remain unchanged.  The transponder shall not close out a multisite air-initiated Comm-B message unless it has been read out at least once by the reserved site.  

 

## 2.2.19.2.3.4 Automatic Comm-B Closeout

If the transponder B-timer runs out before a multisite closeout is accepted, the stored Comm-B IIS **shall** be set to ZERO (0), and the T-register **shall** be cleared to enable this message to be read and cleared by another site. 

 

## 2.2.19.2.3.5 Significance Of Pc Command

When the transponder is in the multisite mode, i.e., when the IIS stored for Comm-B is not ZERO (0), receipt of a closeout (PC=4) **shall** have no effect on the transaction unless accompanied by IIS equal to the stored Comm-B IIS. 

 

## 2.2.19.3 Additional Features

Additional features are refinements or extensions of the transponder design which may be required for transponders used in special circumstances or missions. 

 

## 2.2.19.3.1 Diversity

Diversity, as specified in §2.2.12, should be implemented in wide-body aircraft and in conjunction with transponders installed with airborne collision avoidance systems (CAS). 

 

## 2.2.19.3.2 Mutual Suppression System

Mutual suppression systems may be needed if the aircraft has other pulse L-band equipment on board or if the transponder is used in conjunction with certain CAS (see §2.2.11). 

## 2.2.20 Level 3 & Level 4 Transponder - Extended Length Message (Elm) Protocols 2.2.20.1 Level 3 Uplink Elm 2.2.20.1.1 Uplink Elm Capability

This additional capability described in §1.4.3.3 requires that the transponder **shall**, in addition to the functions of the Level 2 transponder: 

a. Process uplink and downlink formats UF=DF=24. 
b. Follow the protocols for Comm-C. 
c. Follow the applicable procedures for multisite operation. 
 This transponder uses all the formats shown in Figure 2-5 and Figure 2-6. 

## Note: 2.2.20.1.1.1 Comm-C/Elm Protocol (Figure 2-21 And Figure 2-22)

Uplink ELMs are transmitted in segments with each segment formed by a Comm-C 
format. In addition to the segment content in MC, two protocol fields, NC and RC, are used.  NC is the segment number transmitted. 

RC identifies the transmission as initial, intermediate or final. 

The minimum length of an uplink ELM is two segments.  The transfer of all segments may take place without intervening replies.  The minimum time between the beginning of successive Comm-C transmissions is 50 microseconds. 

## 2.2.20.1.1.1.1 Initializing Segment Transfer

The ELM transaction for an n-segment message (NCs 0 through n-l) **shall** be initiated upon receipt of a Comm-C transmission containing RC=0.  The text transmitted in MC 
shall be stored.  This text is the last segment of the message and carries NC=n-l.  Upon receipt of NC, the transponder **shall** establish the number of further segments to be received and stored.  Receipt of an initializing (RC=0) segment **shall** establish the 
"setup" in the transponder, which is now prepared to accept further segments. 

Receipt of another initializing segment **shall** result in a new setup within the transponder and cause any previously stored segments to be discarded. 

A transponder reply shall not be generated on receipt of an initializing segment. 

## 2.2.20.1.1.1.2 Intermediate Segment Transfer

Intermediate segments are characterized by RC=1 and **shall** be accepted and stored by the transponder only if the setup of the previous paragraph is in effect and if the received NC is smaller than the value stored at receipt of the initializing segment. 

A reply shall not be generated on receipt of the intermediate segment. 

 Intermediate segments may be transmitted in any order. 

Note:

## 2.2.20.1.1.1.3 Final Segment Transfer

The final segment, characterized by RC=2, **shall** be accepted by the transponder under all circumstances and requires a reply (with the standard 128-microsecond Mode S reply delay).  The segment content **shall** be stored if the setup of §2.2.20.1.1.1.1 is in effect and if the received NC is smaller than the value of the initial segment NC. 

## 2.2.20.1.1.1.4 Completed Message

The message is completed if all segments announced by NC in the initializing segment have been received.  If the message is completed, the content **shall** be transferred to the ELM interface of §2.2.13.4, and the setup **shall** be deactivated. 

## 2.2.20.1.1.1.5 Acknowledgment Reply

The transponder **shall** acknowledge receipt of a final segment by replying with a Comm-
D transmission, with KE=1.  KE=1 indicates that the MD field contains subfield TAS 
that reports which segments have been received.  This reply **shall** be transmitted 128 
microseconds plus or minus 0.25 microsecond following receipt of the sync phase reversal of the interrogation delivering the final segment. 

The information contained in the TAS subfield **shall** be continually updated while segments are received and shall not be cleared until a new initializing segment is received or until closeout occurs. 

Note:
 Segments lost in uplink transmission are noted by their absence in the TAS report and are re-transmitted by the interrogator, which will then send further final segments to assess the situation. 

## 2.2.20.1.1.1.6 Tas Transmission Acknowledgment, Subfield In Md

This 16-bit (bits 17 - 32) downlink subfield in MD **shall** report the segments received so far in a Comm-C sequence.  Starting with bit 17, which denotes segment number "0," each of the following bits is ONE if the corresponding segment of the sequence has been received.  TAS appears in MD if KE=1 in the same reply. 

 

## 2.2.20.1.1.1.7 Closeout

A closeout transmission informs the transponder that the TAS has been received and that it **shall** be cleared.  This closeout (PC=5) is contained in a surveillance or Comm-A 
interrogation. 

An uncompleted message, present when the closeout is received, **shall** be closed out. 

 

## 2.2.20.1.1.1.8 Information Transfer

Comm-C equipped transponders **shall** be able to transfer received information to the appropriate data sinks (see §2.2.13, §2.2.19.b and §2.2.19.c). 

## 2.2.20.1.2 Uplink Interface - Interrogator Identity

In addition to data transferred per §2.2.20.1.4, the uplink interface signal **shall** contain the interrogator site number (IIS) of the sensor that has transmitted an ELM by multisite protocol.  The IIS stored for Comm-C (see §2.2.20.1.3.1) when the message is completed 
(see §2.2.20.1.1.1.4) **shall** be used for this purpose.   

Note:
 If the multisite protocol is not used, an IIS code of ZERO will be stored and reported. 

 

## 2.2.20.1.3 Multisite Uplink Elm Protocol (Figure 2-21 And Figure 2-22)

Note:
2.2.19.2.1.1

 The multisite Comm-C protocol augments the standard Comm-C protocol and 
  when not in use does not modify the standard protocol in any way.  Codes used in 
  the SD and UM fields for ELM multisite protocols are described in §

## 2.2.20.1.3.1 Multisite Comm-C Reservations

When the multisite protocol is in use, an interrogator makes a reservation for an uplink ELM by transmitting a surveillance or Comm-A interrogation containing: 

 

| DI     | =                                    | 1 (multisite SD format).    |
|--------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| IIS    | =                                    | Interrogator's site number. |
| MES  = | 1 or 5 (Comm-C reservation request). |                             |

 
The interrogator may also transmit: 

 

| RSS     | =     | 2 (Comm-C reservation status request).    |
|---------|-------|-------------------------------------------|

 
Protocol procedure in response to this interrogation **shall** depend upon the state of the C-
timer as follows: 

a. C-timer not running 
 
Store IIS for Comm-C. Start C-timer. 
 
b. C-timer running and interrogator's IIS equals stored Comm-C IIS 
 
Restart C-timer. 
c. C-timer running and interrogator's IIS is not equal to stored Comm-C IIS 
 
No change to stored IIS or C-timer. 
 
Note:
 When an interrogator asks for Comm-C reservation status and receives its own 
site number in the UM field of the reply to a reservation interrogation, it proceeds with the delivery of the uplink ELM.  Otherwise, ELM activity is not started during this ground antenna scan and a new reservation request is made during the next scan. 
 

## 2.2.20.1.3.2 Multisite Comm-C Delivery

After multisite coordination is accomplished via the surveillance or Comm-A 
interrogation, uplink ELM delivery **shall** be as described in §2.2.20.1.1.  In addition, the C-timer **shall** be restarted each time a received segment is stored and the stored Comm-C 
IIS is not ZERO (0). 

Note:
 The requirement that the stored Comm-C IIS be other than "0" prevents the C-
timer from being restarted during a non-selective uplink ELM transaction. 
 

## 2.2.20.1.3.3 Multisite Comm-C Closeout

Multisite Comm-C closeout **shall** be accomplished upon receipt of a surveillance or Comm-A interrogation containing: 

 

| DI    | =    | 1 (Multisite SD format).    |
|-------|------|-----------------------------|
| IIS    | =    | Interrogator's site number.    |
|--------|------|--------------------------------|
| MES    | =    | 2, 6 or 7 (Comm-C closeout).   |
|        |      |                                |

If the stored Comm-C IIS equals the IIS of the interrogator, the uplink ELM **shall** be closed out as described in §2.2.20.1.1.1.7, the stored Comm-C IIS **shall** be cleared and the C-timer stopped.  If the site numbers do not match, the message shall not be closed out and the states of the stored Comm-C IIS and the C-timer remain unchanged. 

 
2.2.20.1.3.4 
Automatic Comm-C Closeout 
The closeout actions described in §2.2.20.1.3.3 **shall** be initiated automatically when the C-timer runs out. 

 

## 2.2.20.1.3.5 Significance Of Pc Command

When the transponder is in the multisite mode, i.e., when the IIS stored for Comm-C is not ZERO (0), receipt of a cancellation (PC=5) **shall** have no effect on the transaction unless accompanied by IIS equal to the stored Comm-C IIS. 

## 2.2.20.1.4 Uplink Interface - Data Rate

A transponder equipped for standard uplink ELM operation **shall** be able to transfer data from at least four complete 16-segment uplink ELMs in any four-second period.  A 
transponder equipped for enhanced uplink ELM operation **shall** be able to transfer data from at least four 16-segment uplink ELMs in any one-second period.  In each case, the ELMs **shall** be transferred if they are spaced no closer than 5 milliseconds from the end of one ELM to the beginning of the next.  For transponders equipped with the enhanced protocols, this 5 millisecond spacing requirement **shall** also apply to successive 16 segment ELMs bearing the same II code.  The content of any uplink ELM **shall** be available for transfer across the output interface no later than ONE (1) second after it has been received. 

Note:
 This requirement allows the transponder to operate in regions in which there are multiple interrogators operating in the multi-site or enhanced protocol mode.  It also permits the transponder to take advantage of the capabilities of a sensor with an electronically-scanned antenna 

## 2.2.20.2 Level 4 Downlink Elm 2.2.20.2.1 Full Elm Capability (Figure 2-23 And Figure 2-24)

This additional capability, described in §1.4.3.4, requires that the transponder **shall**, in addition to the functions previously described, follow the protocols for: 

a. Comm-D ELM. 
b. Applicable multisite procedures. 
c. Report Codes 4 through 7 in the CA field (see §2.2.14.4.6).

Protocol features. 

## 2.2.20.2.1.1 The Comm-D/Elm Protocol (Figure 2-24)

Downlink ELMs **shall** be transmitted only after authorization by the interrogator.  The segments to be transmitted are contained in Comm-D replies.

## 2.2.20.2.1.1.1 Initialization

To request permission to send n-segments, the transponder **shall** insert the code corresponding to the value 15+n into the DR field of a surveillance or Comm-B reply, DF=4, 5, 20, 21. 

## 2.2.20.2.1.1.2 Authorization And Transmission

The interrogator requests the transmission of Comm-D segments by a Comm-C 
interrogation characterized by RC=3.  This Comm-C format carries the SRS subfield which is a summary of the segments to be transmitted.  On receipt of this authorization the transponder **shall** transmit the first segment with the standard 128-microsecond Mode S reply delay followed by subsequent segments at a rate of one every 136 ±1 microseconds by means of Comm-D formats with KE=0 and ND corresponding to the number of the segment in MD.  Segments can be transmitted in any order.  The authorization process may be repeated by the interrogator. 

## 2.2.20.2.1.1.3 Srs Segment Request Subfield In Mc

If a Comm-C interrogation (UF=24) contains RC=3, it also contains a list of segment request-authorizations in the 16-bit (bits 9 - 24) SRS subfield.  Starting with bit 9, which denotes the first segment, each of the following bits is set to ONE if the transmission of the corresponding segment is requested. 

## 2.2.20.2.1.1.4 Closeout

A closeout transmission is used to inform the transponder that all segments have been received and that the DR field **shall** be reset.  This closeout (PC=6) is contained in a surveillance or Comm-A interrogation and **shall** be effective only after a request for transmission has been complied with at least once (see D-Register in Figure 2-23 and Figure 2-24). 

 

## 2.2.20.2.1.1.5 Information Transfer

The Comm-D/ELM-equipped transponder **shall** have access to the appropriate data sources (see §2.2.13.4, §2.2.19.b and §2.2.19.c). 

 

## 2.2.20.2.2 Downlink Message Cancellation

Downlink interfaces of storage design for both Comm-B and ELM **shall**, in addition to data transfer, accept a signal that cancels a message previously transferred into the transponder if the delivery cycle of the message has not been closed out by ground command. If more than one message is stored within the transponder for future transmission, the cancellation procedure **shall** be capable of canceling the stored messages selectively. 

 

## 2.2.20.2.3 Multisite Downlink Elm Protocol

Note:
2.2.19.2.1.1

 The multisite Comm-D protocol augments the standard Comm-D protocol and 
  when not in use does not modify the standard protocol in any way.  Codes used in 
  the SD and UM fields for ELM multisite protocols are described in §
                                                                         
  and §2.2.19.2.1.2. 

 

## 2.2.20.2.3.1 Multisite Comm-D Reservation

When the multisite protocol is in use, an interrogator makes a reservation for ground initiation of a Comm-D message transfer by transmitting a surveillance or Comm-A 
interrogation containing: 

 
 
DI 
= 
1 (multisite SD format). 
IIS 
= 
Interrogator's site number.  
 
 
MES 
= 
3 or 6 (Comm-D reservation request).  
 
The interrogator may also transmit: 

 
 
RSS  
=  
3 (Comm-D reservation status request). 
 
A multisite downlink ELM reservation shall not be granted by the transponder unless a downlink ELM is waiting to be transmitted. 

Protocol procedure in response to this interrogation **shall** depend upon the state of the D-
timer as follows: 

a. D-timer not running 
 
Store IIS for Comm-D. Start D-timer. 

 
b. D-timer running and interrogator's IIS equals stored Comm-D IIS 
 
Restart D-timer. 
 
c. D-timer running and interrogator's IIS is not equal to stored Comm-D IIS 
 
No change to stored IIS or D-timer. 

 
Note:
 When an interrogator asks for Comm-D reservation status and receives its own site number in the UM field of the reply to a reservation interrogation, it proceeds to request delivery of the downlink ELM.  Otherwise, ELM activity is not started during this ground antenna scan and a new reservation request may be made during the next scan. 

 

## 2.2.20.2.3.2 Multisite Directed Comm-D Transmissions

If the airborne data system needs to direct a Comm-D ELM message to a specific interrogator, a procedure corresponding to the directed Comm-B protocol **shall** be used.  
In effect, a "self reservation" is accomplished by storing the IIS of the desired site destination and proceeding with the usual protocol.  The stored IIS and IDS=3 **shall** be transmitted in the UM field unless UM use is preempted by command from the ground or there is a Comm-B reservation.  
For a multisite directed Comm-D message, the reservation **shall not** be automatically timed out but **shall** continue until either:  

a. the message is read and closed out by the reserved site; or  
b. the message is canceled by the data link processor.  
 This protocol is intended to result in delivery of the message only to the reserved 
site.  As in all downlink ELM messages, the data link processor may withdraw the message if delivery has not been accomplished within a nominal time or if another message is waiting to be sent.  In this protocol the D-timer in the transponder is not actually used as a timer.  However, it does retain its function as a flag to indicate that a multisite transaction is in progress (see §
). 
2.2.19.2.3.1
 
2.2.20.2.3.3 
Multisite Comm-D Delivery 
After multisite coordination is accomplished by the surveillance or Comm-A 
interrogation, downlink ELM delivery **shall** be as described in §2.2.20.2.1.1. In addition, the D-timer **shall** be restarted each time a request for Comm-D segments is received and the stored Comm-D IIS is other than "0." 
Note: The requirement that the stored Comm-D IIS be other than "0" prevents the D-
timer from being restarted during a standard downlink ELM transaction. 

2.2.20.2.3.4 
Multisite Comm-D Closeout 
Multisite Comm-D closeout is accomplished using a surveillance or Comm-A 
interrogation containing: 

 

|     | DI     | =                             | 1 (Multisite SD format).    |
|-----|--------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|     | IIS    | =                             | Interrogator's site number. |
|     | MES  = | 4, 5, or 7 (Comm-D closeout). |                             |

 
If the stored Comm-D IIS equals the IIS of the interrogator, the downlink ELM **shall** be closed out as described in §2.2.20.2.1.1.4.  The stored Comm-D IIS **shall** be cleared and the D-timer stopped.  If the site numbers do not match, the message is not closed out and the states of the stored Comm-D IIS, the D-timer and the DR code remain unchanged. 

 
2.2.20.2.3.5 
Automatic Comm-D Closeout 
If the D-timer runs out, the stored Comm-D IIS **shall** be set to "0." The Comm-D 
message and the DR field **shall not** be cleared.  (This makes it possible for another site to read and clear the Comm-D message.) 

 
2.2.20.2.3.6 
Significance of PC Command 
When the transponder is in the multisite mode, i.e., when the IIS stored for Comm-D is not ZERO (0), receipt of a closeout (PC=6) **shall** have no effect on the transaction unless accompanied by IIS equal to the stored Comm-D IIS. 

 

## 2.2.20.2.4 Downlink Interface - Data Rate

A transponder equipped for standard downlink ELM operation **shall** be able to transmit at least four downlink ELM segments in any ONE (1)-second period.  A transponder equipped for enhanced ELM operation **shall** be able to transmit at least sixteen downlink ELM segments in any ONE (1)-second period. 

 

## 2.2.21 Level 5 Transponder - Enhanced Protocols 2.2.21.1 Enhanced Air-Initiated Comm-B Protocol

Note:
 The enhanced air-initiated Comm-B protocol provides a higher data link capacity by permitting parallel delivery of air-initiated Comm-B messages by up to 16 interrogators, one for each II code.  Operation without the need for multisite Comm-B reservations is possible in regions of overlapping coverage for interrogators equipped for the enhanced air-initiated Comm-B protocol.  The protocol is fully conformant to the standard multisite protocol and thus is compatible with interrogators that are not equipped for the enhanced protocol.  

## 2.2.21.1.1 General

The interrogator **shall** determine from the data link capability report whether the transponder supports the enhanced protocols.  If the enhanced protocols are supported, Comm-B messages delivered using the multisite protocol may be delivered without a prior reservation.  If the enhanced protocols are not supported by both the interrogator and the transponder, the multisite reservation protocols specified in §2.2.19.2.3.1 **shall** be used.  

Recommendation:
 
If the transponder and the interrogator are equipped for the enhanced protocol, the interrogator should use the enhanced Comm-B protocol.  
The transponder **shall** be capable of storing 2 or more messages for each of the 16 II 
codes: (1) an air-initiated or multisite-directed Comm-B message and (2) the contents of registers for BDS1=0 and BDS2=2 through 4.  
 
Note:
 GICB Registers 0216 - 0416 are used for the Comm-B linking protocol defined in Appendix B. 

 

## 2.2.21.1.2 Enhanced Multisite Air-Initiated Comm-B Protocol 2.2.21.1.2.1 Initiation

An air-initiated Comm-B message input into the transponder **shall** be stored in the registers assigned to II=0.  

## 2.2.21.1.2.2 Announcement And Extraction

A waiting air-initiated Comm-B message **shall** be announced in the DR field of the replies to all interrogators for which a multisite directed Comm-B message is not waiting.  
The UM field of the announcement reply **shall** indicate that the message is not reserved for any II code, i.e., the IIS subfield **shall** be set equal to ZERO.  When a command to read this message is received from a given interrogator, the B Timer for the associated interrogator is started and the reply containing the message **shall** contain the same IIS 
subfield content indicating that the message is reserved for the II code contained in the interrogation from that interrogator.  After readout and until closeout, the message **shall** 
continue to be assigned to that II code.  Once a message is assigned to a specific II code, announcement of this message **shall** be no longer made in the replies to interrogators with other II codes.  If the message is not closed out by the assigned interrogator for the period of the B-timer, the message **shall** revert back to multisite air-initiated status and the process **shall** repeat.  Only one multisite air-initiated Comm-B message **shall** be in process at a time.  

## 2.2.21.1.2.3 Closeout

A closeout for a multisite air-initiated message **shall** only be accepted from the interrogator that is currently assigned to transfer the message.  

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 2.2.21.1.2.4 Announcement Of The Next Message Waiting

The DR field **shall** indicate a message waiting in the reply to an interrogation containing a Comm-B closeout to an air-initiated message if an unassigned air-initiated message is waiting and has not been assigned to an II code, or if a multisite-directed message is waiting for that II code (see §2.2.21.1.3).  

## 2.2.21.1.3 Enhanced Multisite Directed Comm-B Protocol 2.2.21.1.3.1 Initiation

When a multisite directed message is input into the transponder, it **shall** be placed in the Comm-B registers assigned to the II code specified for the message and starts the B- timer.  If the registers for this II code are already occupied, (i.e., a multisite directed message is already in process to this II code) the new message **shall** be queued until the current transaction with that II code is closed out.  
Note:
 For a multisite-directed message, the B-timer does not expire.  A multi-site directed message can only be canceled by the ADLP.  

## 2.2.21.1.3.2 Announcement

Announcement of a Comm-B message waiting transfer **shall** be made using the DR field as specified in §2.2.14.4.13 with the destination interrogator II code contained in the IIS 
subfield as specified in §2.2.19.2.1.1.  The DR field and IIS subfield contents **shall** be set specifically for the interrogator that is to receive the reply.  A waiting multisite directed message **shall** only be announced in the replies to the intended interrogator.  It **shall not** 
be announced in the replies to other interrogators.  

1. If a multisite-directed message is waiting for II=2, the surveillance replies to that 
interrogator will contain DR=1 and IIS=2.  If this is the only message in process, replies to all other interrogators will indicate that no message is waiting.  
2. In addition to permitting parallel operation, this form of announcement enables a 
greater degree of announcement of downlink ELMs.  The announcements for the 
downlink ELM and the Comm-B share the DR field.  Only one announcement can 
take place at a time because of coding limitations.  In case both a Comm-B and a 
downlink ELM are waiting, announcement preference is given to the Comm-B.  In the example above, if an air-directed Comm-B was waiting for II=2 and a multisitedirected downlink ELM was waiting for II=6, both interrogators would see their respective announcements on the first scan since there would be no Comm-B 
announcement to II=6 to block the announcement of the waiting downlink ELM.  

## 2.2.21.1.3.3 Closeout

Closeout **shall** be accomplished as specified in §2.2.19.2.3.3.   
 

## 2.2.21.1.3.4 Announcement Of The Next Message Waiting

The DR field **shall** indicate a message waiting in the reply to an interrogation containing a Comm-B closeout if another multisite directed message is waiting for that II code, or if an air-initiated message is waiting and has not been assigned to an II code (see 
§2.2.19.1.12.4).   

## 2.2.21.1.4 Enhanced Broadcast Comm-B Protocol

A broadcast Comm-B message **shall** be announced to all 16 interrogator II codes.  The message **shall** remain active for the period of the B-timer associated with each II code (i.e., the message shall not be withdrawn after a single B-timer timeout, but is intended to be read-out by each II code within view).  The provision for interruption of a broadcast by non-broadcast Comm-B as specified in §2.2.19.1.12.5 **shall** apply separately to each II 
code.  When the B-timer period has been achieved for all II codes, the broadcast message shall be automatically cleared as specified in §2.2.19.1.12.5.  A new broadcast message shall not be initiated or announced until the current broadcast has been cleared.  
Note:
 Because of the fact that broadcast message interruption occurs independently for each II code, it is possible that the broadcast message timeout will occur at different times for different II codes.

## 2.2.21.2 Enhanced Uplink Elm Protocol

Note:
 The enhanced uplink ELM protocol provides a higher data link capacity by 
permitting parallel delivery of uplink ELM messages by up to sixteen interrogators, one for each II code.  Operation without the need for multisite uplink ELM reservations is possible in regions of overlapping coverage for interrogators equipped for the enhanced uplink ELM protocol.  The protocol is fully conformant to the standard multisite protocol and thus is compatible with 
interrogators that are not equipped for the enhanced protocol.  

## 2.2.21.2.1 General

The interrogator **shall** determine from the data link capability report whether the transponder supports the enhanced protocols.  If the enhanced protocols are supported, uplink ELMs delivered using the multisite protocol may be delivered without a prior reservation.  If the enhanced protocols are not supported by both the interrogator and the transponder, the multisite reservation protocols specified in §2.2.20.1.3.1 **shall** be used.  

Recommendation:
 
If the transponder and the interrogator are equipped for the enhanced protocol, the interrogator should use the enhanced uplink ELM protocol. 
The transponder **shall** be capable of storing a sixteen-segment message for each of the 16 
II codes. 

## 2.2.21.2.2 Reservation Processing

The transponder **shall** support reservation processing for each II code as specified in 
§2.2.20.1.3.1. 

1. Reservation processing is required for interrogators that do not support the 
enhanced protocol. 
2. Since the transponder can handle simultaneous uplink ELMs for all 16 II codes, a 
reservation will always be granted. 
1. 
"Reservation" indicates that the Timer is started for this IIS. 
2. 
"Closeout" indicates that the Timer is stopped and reset, TAS is cleared and the setup is 
cancelled for this IIS. 
3. 
"0" indicates termination of the process. 
4.

5. 
If the timer for a particular IIS is running and a reservation is received for this IIS, this reservation will be granted.  Since the timer is running, a former reservation has probably been 
received and will be cleared by this new reservation. 

## 2.2.21.2.3 Enhanced Uplink Elm Delivery And Closeout

The transponder **shall** process received segments separately by II code.  For each value of II code, uplink ELM delivery and closeout **shall** be performed as specified in §2.2.20.1.3 
and §2.2.20.1.1 except that the MD field used to transmit the technical acknowledgment shall also contain the 4-bit (bits 33 - 36) IIS subfield. 

Note:
 The interrogator may use the II code contained in the technical acknowledgment in order to verify that it has received the correct technical acknowledgment. 

1. 
Bold boxes indicate Transponder States. 
2. 
Clear setup for an IIS does not clear TAS.  TAS cleared by the receipt of a closeout message. 
 

## 2.2.21.3 Enhanced Downlink Elm Protocol

Note:
 The enhanced downlink ELM protocol provides a higher data link capacity by 
permitting parallel delivery of downlink ELM messages by up to sixteen 
interrogators, one for each II code.  Operation without the need for multisite 
downlink ELM reservations is possible in regions of overlapping coverage for 
interrogators equipped for the enhanced downlink ELM protocol.  The protocol is fully conformant to the standard multisite protocol and thus is compatible with interrogators that are not equipped for the enhanced protocol. 
 

2.2.21.3.1 
General 
The interrogator **shall** determine from the data link capability report whether the transponder supports the enhanced protocols.  If the enhanced protocols are supported, downlink ELMs delivered using the multisite-directed protocol may be delivered without a prior reservation.  If the enhanced protocols are not supported by both the interrogator and the transponder, the multisite reservation protocols specified in §2.2.20.2.3.1 **shall** be used for multisite and multisite-directed downlink ELMs. 

Recommendation:

 
     If the transponder and the interrogator are equipped for the 
     enhanced protocol, the interrogator should use the enhanced 
     downlink ELM protocol. 

The transponder shall be capable of storing a sixteen-segment message for each of the 16 
II codes. 

## 2.2.21.3.2 Enhanced Multisite Downlink Elm Protocol 2.2.21.3.2.1 Initiation

A multisite message input into the transponder **shall** be stored in the registers assigned to II=0. 

## 2.2.21.3.2.2 Announcement And Extraction

A waiting multisite downlink ELM message **shall** be announced in the DR field of the replies to all interrogators for which a multisite directed downlink ELM message is not waiting.  The UM field of the announcement reply **shall** indicate that the message is not reserved for any II code, i.e., the IIS subfield **shall** be set equal to ZERO.  When a command to read out this message is received from a given interrogator, the message shall be reserved for the II code contained in the interrogation from that interrogator. After readout and until closeout, the message **shall** continue to be assigned to that II 
code.  Once a message is assigned to a specific II code, announcement of this message shall no longer be made in the replies to interrogators with other II codes.  If the message is not closed out by the associated interrogator for the period of the D-timer, the message shall revert back to multisite status and the process **shall** repeat.  Only one multisite downlink ELM message **shall** be in process at a time.

## 2.2.21.3.2.3 Closeout

A closeout for a multisite message **shall** only be accepted from the interrogator that was assigned most recently to transfer the message. 

 

## 2.2.21.3.2.4 Announcement Of The Next Message Waiting

The DR field **shall** indicate a message waiting in the reply to an interrogation containing a downlink ELM closeout if an unassigned multisite downlink ELM is waiting, or if a multisite directed message is waiting for that II code. 

 

## Enhanced Comm-D Message Handling 2.2.21.3.3 Enhanced Multisite Directed Downlink Elm Protocol 2.2.21.3.3.1 Initiation

When a multisite directed message is input into the transponder, it **shall** be placed in the downlink ELM registers assigned to the II code specified for the message.  If the registers for this II code are already in use (i.e., a multisite directed downlink ELM message is already in process for this II code) the new message **shall** be queued until the current transaction with that II code is closed out. 

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 2.2.21.3.3.2 Announcement

Announcement of a downlink ELM message waiting transfer **shall** be made using the DR 
field as specified in §2.2.20.2.1.1.1 with the destination interrogator II code contained in the IIS subfield as specified in §2.2.20.2.3.2.  The DR field and IIS subfield contents shall be set specifically for the interrogator that is to receive the reply.  A waiting multisite directed message **shall** only be announced in the replies to the intended interrogator.  It shall not be announced in replies to other interrogators.  

 
2.2.21.3.3.3 
Delivery 
An interrogator **shall** determine if it is the reserved site through coding in the UM field and, if so, it may proceed to request delivery of the downlink ELM.  The delivery **shall** 
be performed as specified in §2.2.20.2.1.1.2.  The transponder **shall** transmit the message contained in the buffer associated with the II code specified in the IIS subfield of the segment request interrogation. 

 

## 2.2.21.3.3.4 Closeout

Closeout **shall** be accomplished as specified in §2.2.20.2.3.4 except that a message closeout **shall** only be accepted from the interrogator with an II code equal to the one that transferred the message. 

 

## 2.2.21.3.3.5 Announcement Of The Next Message Waiting

The DR field **shall** indicate a message waiting in the reply to an interrogation containing a downlink ELM close-out if another multisite directed message is waiting for that II 
code, or if a downlink message is waiting that has not been assigned an II code. 

 

## 2.2.21.3.4 Enhanced Non-Selective Downlink Elm Protocol

The availability of a non-selective downlink ELM message **shall** be announced to all interrogators.  Otherwise, the protocol **shall** be as specified in §2.2.20.2.1.1. 

 

## 2.2.22 Tcas-Compatible Mode S Transponder

There are various versions of TCAS systems with which Mode S Transponders may interface as per Table 2-3.   

 TCAS Versions and Compatible Systems 
TCAS Version 
FAA TSO  
RTCA MOPS  
6.04A ("pre change 7") 
TSO-C119a 
DO-185 
7.0 ("change 7") 
TSO-C119b 
DO-185A 
7.1  
TSO-C119c (pending) 
DO-185B 

 
In addition to the Level 2 Transponder capabilities defined in §2.2.19.1, the Mode S 
transponder used in conjunction with TCAS **shall** have the following capabilities: 

a. Ability to handle the following formats: 

| Format Number    |                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| UF=16            | Long Special Surveillance Interrogation |
| DF=16            | Long Special Surveillance Reply         |

b. Ability to receive long Mode S interrogations (UF=16) and generate long Mode S 
replies (DF=16) at a continuous rate of 60 per second. 
Note:
 Although item "b" above states the minimum requirement, in certain high density traffic situations, the transponder could receive "bursts" of UF=16 interrogations at a much higher rate.  The theoretical upper limit for a burst is 120 UF=16 interrogations received in a 100-millisecond interval, with no more than 10 unique UF=16 interrogations in any 1-second interval and no more than 120 total UF=16 interrogations in any 1-second interval. 

c. Means for delivering the TCAS data content of all accepted interrogations addressed 
to the TCAS equipment. 
d. Antenna diversity (see §2.2.12). 
e. Mutual suppression capability 
f. 
RF performance compatibility with own aircraft's TCAS.  Specifically, when the Mode S transponder transmitter is in the inactive state, the RF power at 1090 ±3 
MHz at the terminals of the Mode S transponder antenna **shall not** exceed -70 dBm. 
Note:
 This unwanted power restriction is necessary to insure that the Mode S 
transponder does not prevent TCAS from meeting its requirements.  It assumes that the isolation between the transponder antenna and the TCAS antenna exceeds 20 dB.  The resultant interference level at the TCAS RF port will then be below -90 dBm. 

2.2.13.3.1.c and §2.2.22.b above. 

g. Reply rate limiting for Mode S replies.  The reply rate limiting device **shall** protect 
the transponder from over-interrogation while permitting at least the reply rates 
required in §
h. The ability to interface with both FAA TSO-C119a (for compatibility with 
RTCA/DO-185) and RTCA/DO-185A/B compatible units.    
An RTCA/DO-185A/B compatible transponder **shall** annunciate its capability to the on-board TCAS via the transponder/TCAS interface.  Likewise, an RTCA/DO-
185A/B compatible TCAS annunciates its capability to the on-board transponder via the transponder/TCAS interface.  The capability of the transponder/TCAS system is then limited to the capability of either the transponder or the TCAS unit having the least capability.  
The transponder **shall** consider the transponder/TCAS system to be compatible with RTCA/DO-185A/B if and only if both the TCAS and the transponder are compatible with RTCA/DO-185A. 

## 2.2.22.1 Message Fields And Protocols 2.2.22.1.1 Ma Message, Comm-A Used By Tcas

Note:

 Control of the TCAS sensitivity level can be accomplished by one or more 
  ground-based Mode S sensors through the transmission of Comm-A 
  interrogations, UF=20 or 21, containing TCAS Sensitivity Level Command 
  Messages to the TCAS aircraft.  The interrogator identification information 
  required to correlate the sensitivity level command with a particular originating 
  ground-based Mode S sensor site is contained in the IIS subfield (see 
  §
             ) of SD of the same Comm-A. 

2.2.19.2.1.1

## Subfields In Ma For A Tcas Sensitivity Level Command Message

ADS: A-Definition Subfield - This 8-bit (bits 33 - 40) uplink subfield in MA defines 
the data contained in the remainder of MA.  For convenience in coding, ADS is 
expressed in two groups of 4 bits each, ADS1, 33 through 36, and ADS2, 37 
through 40.  A TCAS Sensitivity Level Command Message **shall** use ADS1=0 
and ADS2=5. 
SLC: 
TCAS Sensitivity Level Command
 - This 4-bit (bits 41 - 44) subfield contains a 
sensitivity level command for the TCAS aircraft. 
The transponder **shall** monitor the TMS (see §
2.2.19.2.1.1.c) and ADS subfields of Comm-A interrogations UF=20 and 21.  If ADS1=0 and ADS2=5 and TMS=0, the IIS 
subfield of SD and the SLC subfield of MA **shall** be provided to the TCAS unit. 

## 2.2.22.1.2 Mb Message, Comm-B Used By Tcas

Airborne equipment **shall** use the MB field (see §2.2.14.4.21) of Comm-B replies to transmit a Resolution Advisories Report and a Data Link Capability Report to Mode S 
sensors. 

## 2.2.22.1.2.1 Air-Initiated Downlink Of Ra Report 2.2.22.1.2.1.1 Air-Initiated Downlink Of Ra Report For All Transponder/Tcas Systems

The following requirements apply to all transponder/TCAS systems, i.e., both those that are compatible with RTCA/DO-185A/B, and those that are **NOT** compatible with RTCA/DO-185A/B. Whenever TCAS reports that it has an active Resolution Advisory (RA), the transponder shall indicate that it has an RA Report awaiting downlink by setting the DR field in DF=4, 5, 20, 21 replies to DR=2, 3, 6, or 7 as appropriate. 

Upon receipt of a DF=4, 5, 20, or 21 reply, with DR=2, 3, 6 or 7, a Mode S sensor may request downlink of the RA Report by setting RR=19 and DI≠3 or 7, or RR=19, DI=3 or 
7 and RRS=0 in a surveillance or Comm-A interrogation (UF=4, 5, 20, or 21) to the TCAS aircraft.  When this request is received by own Mode S transponder, own transponder **shall** reply with a Comm B reply, DF=20, 21, whose MB field contains an RA Report with information previously provided to the transponder by the TCAS equipment.  
While an RA is active, the content of the MB field in the RA Report **shall** be updated at least once every second.  DR=2, 3, 6 or 7 **shall** remain set for 18 ±1 seconds following the end of the RA.  In addition, the RA Report **shall** remain "frozen," i.e., **shall** retain the last ARA and the corresponding RAC, for 18 ±1 seconds following the end of the RA, unless superseded by a new ARA. 

Subfields in MB for RA Report 

BDS: B-Definition Subfield - This 8-bit (bits 33 - 40) subfield indicates that a RA 
Report is contained in MB by BDS1=3 and BDS2=0, the combination of which is equivalent to BDS=48. 
ARA: Active Resolution Advisories - This 14-bit (bits 41 - 54) subfield indicates the 
currently active RAs (if any) generated by own TCAS unit against one or more threat aircraft. 
RAC: Resolution Advisory Complements
 - This 4-bit (bits 55 - 58) subfield indicates 
the currently active RA complements (if any) received from other TCAS aircraft equipped with on-board resolution capability. 

## 2.2.22.1.2.1.2 Air-Initiated Downlink Of Ra Report For Faa Tso-C119A Compatible Systems

The following requirements apply to all FAA TSO-C119a compatible transponder/TCAS 
systems in addition to the requirements provided in §2.2.22.1.2.1.1. 

An active RA is identified as being any NON-ZERO ARA. 

## 2.2.22.1.2.1.3 Air-Initiated Downlink Of Ra Report For Rtca/Do-185A Compatible Systems

The following requirements apply to all RTCA/DO-185A/B compatible transponder/ 
TCAS systems in addition to the requirements provided in §2.2.22.1.2.1.1. 

Subfields in MB for RA Report 
 - Additional Information BDS: B-Definition Subfield When BDS1=3 and BDS2 =0, the subfields indicated below are contained in MB.  For 18 ±1 seconds following the end of an RA, all MB subfields in the RA 
report with the exception of bit 59 (RAT) **shall** retain the information reported at the time the RA was last active. 

Except for the RAT bit, the following subfields are provided to the transponder by the TCAS for application in the RA Report. 

RAT: Resolution Advisory Terminated Indicator
 - This 1-bit (bit 59) subfield **shall** be 
set by the transponder to indicate when an RA previously generated by TCAS 
has ceased being generated.  RAT **shall** be set in accordance with the following: 
0 = The RA indicated by the ARA subfield is currently active.  The transponder 
shall set RAT to ZERO at all times except those defined for RAT =1. 
1 = The RA indicated by the ARA subfield has been terminated.  RAT **shall** be 
set to ONE for 18 ±1 seconds following termination of a previously reported RA.  Termination of the RA may result from any of the following: 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

a. Notification of termination of the RA received from own on-board 
TCAS.  
b. Notification of loss of capability received from own on-board TCAS, i.e., 
TCAS declaration of interface failure. 
c. Transponder declaration of interface failure.  
The transponder **shall** monitor the 1-bit RA Indicator (RAI) from TCAS to determine whether there is an active RA.  RAI is set to ZERO by TCAS to indicate that there is an active RA.  Otherwise, RAI is set to ONE by TCAS. Termination of the RA is indicated by the transition of RAI from ZERO to ONE. 

Note: The RAT bit is used to indicate that the RA has been terminated.  It may 
be used, for example, to permit removal of an RA indication from an Air Traffic Control display, or for assessment of RA duration within a particular airspace. 
MTE: Multiple Threat Encounter - This 1-bit (bit 60) subfield indicates whether two or 
more simultaneous threats are currently being processed by the TCAS threat resolution logic. 
TTI: 
Threat Type Indicator
 - This 2-bit (bits 61 - 62) subfield defines the type of 
identity data contained in the TID subfield (see §
). 
2.2.22.1.2.1.3
TID: 
Threat Identity Data
 - This 26-bit subfield (bits 63 - 88) contains the Mode S 
address of the threat if the threat is equipped with a Mode S transponder.  If the threat is not equipped with a Mode S transponder, then this subfield contains the altitude, range, and bearing of the threat. 
If two or more threats are simultaneously being processed by the TCAS threat resolution logic, the TID subfield contains the identity or position data for the most recently declared threat. 

If TTI=1, the TID subfield contains the Mode S address of the threat in bits 63 through 86, and bits 87 through 88 are set to ZERO. If TTI=2, the TID subfield contains the following three subfields. 

TIDA: Threat Identity Data, Altitude - This 13-bit subfield (bits 63 - 75) contains the 
most recently reported Mode-C altitude code of the threat.  Coding of the TIDA 
subfield is consistent with the coding of the Mode-C Altitude reply. 
TIDR: Threat Identity Data, Range - This 7-bit subfield (bits 76 - 82) contains the most 
recent range of the threat estimated by TCAS.  
TIDB: Threat Identity Data, Bearing
 - This 6-bit subfield (bits 83 - 88) contains the 
most recent bearing of the threat estimated by TCAS, relative to the TCAS 
aircraft heading. 

## 2.2.22.1.2.2 Data Link Capability Codes In Mb 2.2.22.1.2.2.1 Data Link Capability Codes In Mb For All Transponder/Tcas Systems Notes:

1 
The ground-based Mode S sensor learns of the specific data link capabilities on 
board the aircraft by using the data link capability report protocol specified in §
2.2.19.1.12.6, §2.2.19.1.12.6.1, §2.2.19.1.12.6.2, and §2.2.19.1.12.6.3. 
2. The data bits discussed in the following subparagraphs are modified in the MB field 
of the Data Link Capability Report by the Mode S transponder such that the data appears appropriately in response to a request for Data Link Capability Report when BDS1=1 and BDS2=0.  As such, these data bits comprise only a small fraction of the entire Data Link Capability Report which may collate data from multiple sources for 
transfer in the downlink.  Care must be taken to ensure that the data fields discussed 
in the following subparagraphs are not compromised when other sources attempt to update the Data Link Capability Report, and that updating of these bits does not compromise other parts of the Data Link Capability Report. 

## 2.2.22.1.2.2.2 Data Link Capability Codes In Mb For Faa Tso-C119A Compatible Systems

The following requirements apply to all FAA TSO-C119a compatible transponder/TCAS 
systems. 

The Mode S transponder **shall** process the TCAS-supplied capability information (RI) for inclusion in the Data Link Capability Report.  This capability information **shall** cause the transponder to set the following codes in a Data Link Capability Report: 

## Bit Codes In Mb For Data Link Capability Report

The following codes **shall** appear in the MB field for a Data Link Capability Report when BDS1=1 and BDS2=0.  
Bit 48 equals 1 indicates that the transponder/TCAS interface is operational and the transponder is receiving TCAS RI=2, 3 or 4. 

Bits 69 and 70 form a capability code subfield which indicates the aircraft's on-board resolution advisory generation capability. The codes are:  

| Bit 69                                                      |   Bit 70  | Meaning    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|

| An on-board vertical and horizontal resolution advisory     |           |            |
| generation capability exists (TCAS RI=4)                    |           |            |
| 1                                                           |        1  | Reserved   |

## 2.2.22.1.2.2.3 Data Link Capability Codes In Mb For Rtca/Do-185A Compatible Systems

The following requirements apply to all RTCA/DO-185A compatible transponder/TCAS 
systems. 

Bits 48, 69, 70, 71, and 72 are provided to the transponder by the TCAS and **shall** appear in the MB field for a Data Link Capability Report when BDS1=1 and BDS2=0. 

1. Bit 71 set to ONE indicates that the transponder/TCAS system is compatible with 
RTCA/DO- 185A. 
2. Bit 72 is "Reserved" for future use by TCAS and/or the transponder.  Until 
appropriate coding of this bit has been defined, it should be set to ZERO (0) by the TCAS. 
If the transponder detects a failure of the transponder/TCAS interface, then the transponder **shall** ensure that Bits 48, 69, 70, 71, and 72 are set to ZERO in the Data Link Capability Report. 

## 2.2.22.1.2.2.4 Data Link Capability Codes In Mb For Rtca/Do-185B Compatible Systems

The following requirements apply to all RTCA/DO-185B compatible transponder/TCAS 
systems. Bits 48, 69, 70, 71, and 72 are provided to the transponder by the TCAS and shall appear in the MB field for a Data Link Capability Report when BDS1=1 and BDS2=0. 

1. Bit 48 ("MB" bit 16) set to ONE (1) indicates that the transponder TCAS interface is 
operational and the transponder is receiving TCAS RI=2, 3 or 4.  
2. Bit 69 ("MB" bit 37) set to ONE (1) indicates capability of Hybrid Surveillance, and 
set to ZERO (0) indicates that there is no Hybrid Surveillance capability. 
3. Bit 70 ("MB" bit 38) set to ONE (1) indicates that TCAS is generating both TAs and 
RAs, and set to ZERO (0) indicates the generation of TAs only. 
4. Bits 71, 72 ("MB" bits 39, 40) are encoded in accordance with the following table: 

| Bit 72    |   Bit 71  |
|-----------|-----------|
| Meaning   |           |
| "MB"      |           |
| Bit 40    |           |
| "MB"      |           |
| Bit 39    |           |
| 0         |        0  |
| 0         |        1  |
| 1         |        0  |
| 1         |        1  |

If the transponder detects a failure of the transponder/TCAS interface, then the transponder **shall** ensure that Bits 48, 69, 70, 71, and 72 are set to ZERO in the Data Link Capability Report.   

## 2.2.22.1.2.3 Additional Mb Message Reserved For Rtca/Do-185A/B Compatible Systems

An RTCA/DO-185A/B compatible TCAS has the capability of sending the transponder a 
56-bit message for storage into one of the Ground-Initiated Comm-B (GICB) registers.  
When operating in an RTCA/DO-185A/B compatible system, the transponder **shall** store the TCAS-supplied 56-bit message into the specified transponder GICB register.  The GICB register specified for this purpose is Register 0F16.   

1. The actual structure and coding of the TCAS MB Message is not specified in this 
document and may be defined in the future.  It is the intent of RTCA/DO-185A/B 
compatible systems that the transponder/TCAS interface be implemented in a manner such that the TCAS can directly format the designated MB message and thereby alleviate the need for the transponder to know the exact structure and coding of the message. 
2. Transponders designed for use in RTCA/DO-185A/B compatible systems should 
allow for future use of other MB messages sent by TCAS. 

## 2.2.22.1.3 Mu Message, Comm-U Used By Tcas

The Mode S transponder **shall** supply the MU field (see §2.2.14.4.25) of a long special surveillance interrogation, UF=16, to TCAS only under the following conditions:  

a. The interrogation contains the transponder's discrete address and UDS=48. 
b. The interrogation contains the broadcast address (all ONES) and UDS=50. 
1. The MU field is used by TCAS to transmit a TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Message 
containing own transponder's address for the purpose of controlling interference caused by TCAS interrogations, or to transmit a TCAS Resolution Message for airto-air resolution advisory coordination. 
2. Ideally the transponder should serve as a modem for TCAS and supply the entire MU 
field to TCAS (including the UDS Field) of any received UF=16 interrogation.  
Currently implemented transponder/TCAS interface protocols do not provide the UDS Field information to TCAS so it is necessary for these transponders to select the UDS messages that are passed to TCAS.  If this interface limitation is removed in the future, then all UDS messages would be passed to TCAS. 

## Subfield In Mu For A Tcas Resolution Message

UDS: U-Definition Subfield - This 8-bit (bits 33 - 40) subfield defines the data content 
and coding in the remainder of the MU field.  For convenience in coding, UDS is 
expressed in two groups of 4 bits each; UDS1, 33 through 36, and UDS2, 37 
through 40.  TCAS Resolution Messages **shall** be identified by UDS1=3 and 
UDS2=0, the combination of which is equivalent to UDS=48. 

## Subfield In Mu For A Tcas Broadcast Message

UDS: U-Definition Subfield
 - A TCAS Broadcast Interrogation Message is identified 
by UDS1=3 and UDS2=2, the combination of which is equivalent to UDS=50. 

## 2.2.22.1.4 Mv Message, Comm-V Used By Tcas 2.2.22.1.4.1 Mv Message, Comm-V Used By Faa Tso-C119A Compatible Systems

Upon acceptance of a UF=16 containing a TCAS Resolution Message from a threat TCAS aircraft, the Mode S transponder **shall** transmit a long special surveillance reply, DF=16, to the requesting aircraft.  The MV field of this reply **shall** contain a Coordination Reply Message with information previously provided by own TCAS. 

Subfields in MV for a Coordination Reply Message 

ARA: Active Resolution Advisories

 - This 4-bit (bits 55 - 58) subfield as 
described in §
. 
2.2.22.1.2.1.1
VDS: V-Definition Subfield
 - This 8-bit (bits 33 - 40) subfield defines the content and 
coding in the remainder of MV.  For convenience in coding, VDS is expressed in two groups of 4 bits each; VDS1, bits 33 through 36, and VDS2, bits 37 through 40.  The airborne TCAS equipment is a source of long special reply MV messages containing the VDS1=3 code.  A Coordination Reply Message is 
identified by VDS1=3 and VDS2=0, the combination of which is equivalent to VDS=48. 

## 2.2.22.1.4.2 Mv Message, Comm-V Used By Rtca/Do-185A/B Compatible Systems

In addition to the requirements provided in §2.2.22.1.4.1, a RTCA/DO-185A/B 
compatible system **shall** provide the following:  
Subfields in MV for a Coordination Reply Message

2.2.22.1.2.1.3

## 2.2.22.1.5 Ri Air-To-Air Reply Information

This 4-bit (bits 14 - 17) downlink field **shall** be included in special surveillance formats DF=0, 16.  This field **shall** contain information pertaining to replying aircraft.  Where airspeed is reported (see §2.2.14.4.33), the maximum true airspeed flown in normal operations **shall** be given using the coding shown below. 

In addition to the RI coding in §2.2.14.4.33, a TCAS-Compatible Mode S transponder shall be capable of receiving additional RI codes from own TCAS for inclusion in special surveillance formats DF=0, 16 for replies to non-acquisition interrogations. 

The codes are: 

| Code    | Meaning                                                           |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0       | No on-board TCAS                                                  |
| 1       | Reserved                                                          |
| 2       | On-board TCAS with resolution capability inhibited                |
| 3       | On-board TCAS with vertical-only resolution capability            |
| 4       | On-board TCAS with vertical and horizontal resolution capability  |
| 5 - 7   | Reserved                                                          |
| 8       | No maximum airspeed data available                                |
| 9       | Airspeed is less than or equal to 75 knots                        |
| 10      | Airspeed is greater than 75 and less than or equal to 150 knots   |
| 11      | Airspeed is greater than 150 and less than or equal to 300 knots  |
| 12      | Airspeed is greater than 300 and less than or equal to 600 knots  |
| 13      | Airspeed is greater than 600 and less than or equal to 1200 knots |
| 14      | Airspeed is greater than 1200 knots                               |
| 15      | Reserved                                                          |

The following protocol **shall** apply: 
On receipt of a short special interrogation, UF=0, or a long special interrogation, UF=16, the interrogated Mode S transponder **shall** reply with a short special reply, DF=0, or a long special reply, DF=16, depending on the code contained in the RL field of the interrogation.  In this reply, the sensitivity level and the air-to-air reply information **shall** 
be supplied in the SL and RI fields.  The Mode S transponder **shall** transmit the SL field supplied by TCAS to indicate the sensitivity level at which TCAS is currently operating. Bit 14 of the RI field replicates the AQ bit (see §2.2.14.4.5) of the interrogation.  That is, codes 0 - 7 are supplied by TCAS for use in the reply to an air-to-air non-acquisition interrogation; codes 8 - 15 (indicating aircraft maximum airspeed) **shall** be supplied by the Mode S transponder for use in the reply to an acquisition interrogation.  For a reply to a non-acquisition interrogation, the Mode S transponder **shall** set the RI field to ZERO 
(0) to indicate a non-operational TCAS if the conditions for setting bit 48 to ONE (1) (see §2.2.22.1.2.2) are not satisfied.  If RI=0, the SL field has no meaning. 

## 2.2.22.2 General Requirements Of The Mode S Interface To The Tcas Equipment 2.2.22.2.1 Delivery Of Messages

The transponder **shall** transmit a valid Coordination Reply Message in response to an incoming TCAS Resolution Message if, and only if, current transponder indications show that the incoming message can be delivered to the TCAS unit.  If the transponder recognizes a valid incoming TCAS Resolution Message but does not send a valid Coordination Reply Message, all data in the incoming message **shall** be discarded. 

Note:
2.2.22
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
 This requirement implies that the manufacturer must determine the rate at which incoming interrogations can actually be accepted by the transponder (generally a rate much greater than detailed in §
.b) and the rate at which these interrogations can be passed to the TCAS unit and, if necessary, provide a queuing mechanism to ensure that accepted interrogations are not lost.  The transponder must be able to monitor the status of the queue and the status of any other relevant internal structures or pathways so as not to accept new TCAS Resolution Messages if the queue is full or if there is some other condition that would prevent delivery to the TCAS unit (e.g., the transponder/TCAS interface is not established or has failed or TCAS is indicating no resolution capability). 

If the transponder cannot accept the incoming TCAS Resolution Message contained in the MU field of a long special surveillance interrogation UF=16, the transponder **shall** 
either (a) not reply to this interrogation, or (b) reply with a long special surveillance reply DF=16 with all 56 bits of the MV field equal to ZERO (0). 

## 2.2.22.2.2 Data Integrity

The interface between TCAS and the transponder **shall** be designed to provide communication in the normal operational aircraft environment for that class of TCAS 
equipment while assuring error rates of less than one detected error in 105 bit transmissions and less than one undetected error in 109 bit transmissions for transfers in either direction.  Compliance with this requirement **shall** be demonstrated either by direct test in a simulated operational environment or by analysis based on the known characteristics of proven interface techniques. 

The Mode S transponder **shall** monitor the status of the communications interface with own TCAS.  A detected failure in the interface **shall** be recognized by the transponder as a loss of integrity and **shall** be treated as a TCAS failure (see §2.2.22.1.5 and 
§2.2.19.1.12.6). 

Note:
 Incomplete data transmission can result in erroneous execution of the TCAS 
logic algorithms. 
 
2.2.22.2.3 
TCAS Failure Data Handling 
When a TCAS failure is detected, the transponder **shall** set all areas for storage of TCAS 
data to ZERO. 

 
2.2.22.2.4 
Communication Timing 
TCAS Resolution Messages that are received by the transponder **shall** be delivered to the TCAS unit (received by TCAS from the TCAS/transponder interface) within 0.01 second of receipt by the transponder. 

Note:
 This requirement assumes the transponder input message rate of one message 
every 16.6 milliseconds (60 per second). 
 

## 2.2.22.3 Data Provided By Tcas Equipment To The Mode S Transponder 2.2.22.3.1 Data Contained In The Special Surveillance Replies (Df=0, 16)

a. 
Contents of the SL Field 
The Mode S transponder **shall** report a changed value of the sensitivity level in the SL field in any special surveillance reply, DF=0, 16 generated no later than 250 milliseconds after receipt of the changed SL value from TCAS. 

b. 
Contents of the RI Field 
The TCAS equipment provides a value for downlink transmission by the transponder in the RI field whenever the corresponding UF=0 or 16 interrogation contains AQ=0 (tracking interrogation).  The Mode S transponder **shall** report a changed resolution capability in any special surveillance reply, DF=0, 16 generated no later than one second after receipt of the changed RI value from TCAS. 

 

## 2.2.22.3.2 Data Contained In The Long Special Surveillance Reply (Df=16)

When the Mode S transponder receives a long special surveillance interrogation (UF=16) 
with RL=1 and UDS=48 in the MU field, the transponder **shall** reply with a long special surveillance reply, DF=16.  This reply **shall** contain a Coordination Reply Message (see 
§2.2.22.1.4), the contents of which were provided previously by the TCAS equipment. 

 

## 2.2.22.3.3 Data Contained In Altitude And Identity Surveillance And Comm-B Replies (Df=4, 5, 20, 21) Contents Of The Dr Field

The TCAS equipment provides a continuous indication to the Mode S transponder whenever a TCAS resolution advisory exists.  This **shall** cause the transponder to set either code 2, 3, 6 or 7 in the DR field (see §
2.2.14.4.13) within one second of first receipt of this indication. 

## 2.2.22.3.4 Data Contained In The Altitude And Identity Comm-B Reply (Df=20, 21) Resolution Advisories Report

a. 
When the Mode S transponder receives an altitude or identity surveillance or Comm-A interrogation, UF=4, 5, 20 or 21 with RR=19, the transponder **shall** reply with a Comm-B, DF=20, 21.  This reply **shall** contain a Resolution Advisories Report (§
2.2.22.1.2.1). 

Data Link Capability Report 
b. 
2.2.22.1.2.2). 

The TCAS equipment indicates to the Mode S transponder its resolution capabilities, which the transponder **shall** include in the Data Link Capability Report (see §

Note:
2.2.19.1.12.6.3
 §
 specifies that the transponder will recognize a change in 
on-board data link capability and will automatically set DR=4, 5, 6 or 7, 
causing the ground system to read out a new Data Link Capability Report. 

## 2.2.22.4 Data Provided By The Mode S Transponder To The Tcas Equipment

The transponder **shall** provide the following data to the TCAS equipment: 

a. 
The aircraft discrete address, 
b. 
The aircraft pressure altitude from the source that is the basis for own altitude in Mode C and Mode S replies, 
c. 
Quantization for pressure altitude (defined to be 25 feet or less, or 100 feet). 
Note:
 Selection of the altitude source to be used for altitude reporting is typically made 
by the flight crew.  As such, the requirements of the previous paragraph are a function of the operational installation and not the transponder directly.   
 

## 2.2.22.5 Tcas-Compatible Transponder Automatic Performance Monitoring

The transponder **shall** be capable of detecting malfunctions in the Mode S transponder system that would degrade TCAS functioning and upon detection **shall** make this information available to TCAS. 

 

## 2.2.23 Extended Squitter (Es) 2.2.23.1 Ads-B Extended Squitter

Mode S transponders may provide the capability to transmit Extended Squitters to support the broadcast of aircraft-derived position, identification and state information.  
Note:
 The broadcast of this type of information is a form of Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) known as ADS-Broadcast or ADS-B. 

 

## 2.2.23.1.1 Extended Squitter Format

The format used for the Extended Squitter **shall** be the 112-bit downlink format DF=17 
using II=0 and SI=0 in generating the PI field (§2.2.14.4.30). 

 
2.2.23.1.2 
Extended Squitter Types

     A GICB request (see §
                                       ) containing RR=16, DI=3 or 7 and 
       RRS=5 will cause the resulting reply to contain the airborne position 
       report in its MB field. 

b. 
Surface Position Squitter.  The surface position Extended Squitter **shall** use 
format DF=17 with the contents of ground-initiated Comm-B Register 0616 
inserted in the ME field.  

Note:
                           2.2.19.1.12.3
     A GICB request (see §
                                       ) containing RR=16, DI=3 or 7 and 
       RRS equals 6 will cause the resulting reply to contain the surface 
       position report in its MB field. 

c. 
Aircraft Identification and Category Squitter.  The aircraft identification and 
category Extended Squitter **shall** use format DF=17 with the contents of groundinitiated Comm-B Register 0816 inserted in the ME field.  

Note:
                           2.2.19.1.12.3
     A GICB request (see §
                                       ) containing RR=16, DI=3 or 7 and 
       RRS equals 8 will cause the resulting reply to contain the aircraft 
       identification and category report in its MB field. 

d. 
Airborne Velocity Squitter.  The airborne velocity Extended Squitter **shall** use 
format DF=17 with the contents of GICB Register 0916 inserted in the ME field. 
Note:
2.2.19.1.12.3
 A GICB request (see §
) containing RR=16, DI=3 or 7 and 
RRS equals 9 will cause the resulting reply to contain the airborne velocity report in its MB field.   
e. 
Target State and Status.  The airborne Target State and Status Extended Squitter 
shall use format DF=17 with the contents of GICB Register 6216 inserted in the 
ME field.   
Note: A GICB request (see §2.2.19.1.12.3) containing RR=22 (e.g., BDS1=6), 
DI=3 or 7 and RRS=2 (e.g., BDS2=2) will cause the resulting reply to contain the airborne Target State and Status report in its MB field.   
f. 
Aircraft Operational Status.  The airborne or surface Aircraft Operational Status 
Extended Squitter shall use format DF=17 with the contents of GICB Register 
6516 inserted in the ME field.   
Note:
 A GICB request (see §2.2.19.1.12.3) containing RR=22 (e.g., BDS1=6), 
DI=3 or 7 and RRS=5 (e.g., BDS2=5) will cause the resulting reply to 
contain the Aircraft Operational Status report in its MB field.   
g. 
Event-driven Squitter.  The event-driven Extended Squitter **shall** use format 
DF=17 with the contents of GICB Register 0A16 inserted in the ME field.   
Note:
2.2.19.1.12.3
 A GICB request (see §
) containing RR=16, DI=3 or 7 and 
RRS=0A will cause the resulting reply to contain the event-driven report 
in its MB field.  Since multiple Register contents can be multiplexed 
through Register 6116 and 0A16, GICB extractions of these Registers is 
not recommended as the reply could be indeterminate.   
 

## 2.2.23.1.3 Extended Squitter Rate

a. Initialization.
2.2.18.2.6
  At power up initialization, the transponder **shall** commence operation 
in a mode in which it broadcasts only acquisition squitters (see §
).  The 
transponder **shall** initiate the broadcast of Extended Squitters for airborne position, 
surface position, airborne velocity, target state and status, aircraft operational status 
and aircraft identification and category when data are inserted into GICB Registers 
0516, 0616, 0916, 6216, 6516 and 0816 respectively.  This determination **shall** be made 
individually for each squitter type.  The insertion of altitude data into Register 0516 
by the transponder (see §2.2.23.1.8) **shall not** satisfy the minimum requirement for 
broadcast of the airborne position squitter.   
Note 1:

 
This suppresses the transmission of Extended Squitters from aircraft that are unable to report position, velocity or identity information. 
If input to Register 0516 and 0616 stops for 60 seconds, broadcast of that Extended Squitter type will be discontinued until data insertion is resumed.  The insertion of altitude by the transponder **shall** satisfy the minimum requirement for continuing to broadcast the airborne position squitter.  After timeout (see §
2.2.23.1.4.2), this squitter type may contain an ME field of ALL ZEROs.  

Note 2:
 
Continued transmission for 60 seconds is required so that receiving 
aircraft will know that the data source for the message has been lost. 
When Extended Squitters are broadcast, transmission rates **shall** be as indicated in the following paragraphs.  Acquisition squitters **shall** be reported in addition to Extended Squitters as specified in §
2.2.18.2.6.c.  Acquisition squitters **shall** always be reported if no Extended Squitters are reported.   

b. Airborne Position Squitter Rate.
2.2.23.1.5
  Airborne position squitter transmissions **shall** be 
emitted as specified in §
 at random intervals that are uniformly distributed 
over the range from 0.4 to 0.6 seconds using a time quantization no greater than 15 milliseconds relative to the previous airborne position squitter, with the exceptions as specified in subparagraph "i." 
c. Surface Position Squitter Rate
2.2.23.1.5
.  Surface position squitter transmissions **shall** be 
emitted as specified in §
 using one of two rates depending upon whether 
the high or low squitter rate has been selected (see §2.2.23.1.6).  When the high 
squitter rate has been selected, surface position squitters **shall** be emitted at random 
intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range from 0.4 to 0.6 seconds using a 
time quantization no greater than 15 milliseconds relative to the previous surface position squitter (termed the high rate).  When the low squitter rate has been selected, surface position squitters **shall** be emitted at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds using a time quantization no greater than 15 milliseconds relative to the previous surface position squitter (termed the low rate) Exceptions to this transmission rate are specified in subparagraph "i." 
1. High and low squitter rate status is determined on board the aircraft. 

Notes: 

 2. The low rate is used when the aircraft is stationary and the high rate is used 
when the aircraft is moving. 
d. Aircraft Identification and Category Squitter Rate.
  Aircraft identification and 
category squitter transmissions **shall** be emitted at random intervals that are 
uniformly distributed over the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds using a time quantization no greater than 15 milliseconds relative to the previous identification and category 
squitter when the aircraft is reporting the airborne position squitter, or when the aircraft is reporting the surface position squitter and the high surface squitter rate has been selected.  When the surface position squitter is being reported at the low surface 
rate, the aircraft identification and category squitter **shall** be emitted at random 
intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 9.8 to 10.2 seconds using a 
time quantization no greater than 15 milliseconds relative to the previous 
identification and category squitter.  Exceptions to these transmission rates are 
specified in subparagraph "i." 
e. 
Airborne Velocity Squitter Rate.
2.2.23.1.5
  Airborne velocity squitter transmissions **shall** be 
emitted as specified in §
 at random intervals that are uniformly distributed 
over the range from 0.4 to 0.6 seconds using a time quantization no greater than 15 milliseconds relative to the previous velocity squitter, with the exceptions as 
specified in subparagraph "i."   
f. 
Airborne Target State and Status Squitter Rate.
  Airborne Target State and Status 
squitter **shall** be transmitted at rates as specified in §2.2.3.3.1.4.1 of RTCA DO-260B 
/ EUROCAE ED-102A.   
Verification of the transmission rates of Airborne Target State and Status Messages shall be performed in accordance with §2.4.3.3.1.4.1 of RTCA DO-260B / 
EUROCAE ED-102A.   

g. Aircraft Operational Status Squitter Rate.
  The Aircraft Operational Status squitter 
shall be transmitted at the rates as specified in §2.2.3.3.1.4.2 of RTCA DO-260B / 
EUROCAE ED-102A, with the exceptions as specified in subparagraph "i."  When 
transmitting the surface formats, the rate depends on whether the high or low squitter rate has been selected (see §2.2.23.1.6).    
Verification of the transmission rates of Aircraft Operational Status Messages **shall** 
be performed in accordance with §2.4.3.3.1.4.2 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A.    

h. Event-Driven Squitter Rate.  The event-driven squitter **shall** be transmitted once, 
each time that GICB Register 0A16 is loaded, while observing the delay conditions 
specified in subparagraph "i."  The maximum transmission rate for the event-driven 
squitter **shall** be limited by the transponder to twice per second.  If a message is 
inserted in the event-driven register and cannot be transmitted because of rate 
limiting, it **shall** be held and transmitted when the rate limiting condition has cleared 
If a new message is received before transmission is permitted, it **shall** overwrite the 
earlier message. 
1. The squitter transmission rate and the duration of squitter transmissions is 
application dependent.  Choices made should be the minimum rate and duration consistent with the needs of the application. 
2. The broadcast rates for Event-Driven Messages are defined in RTCA DO-260B / 
EUROCAE ED-102A, §2.2.3.3.1.4.6.1. 
i. 
Delayed Transmission.
  Extended squitter transmission **shall** be delayed in the 
following circumstances: 
2.2.18.2.2.k); or 
(1) 
the scheduled Extended Squitter **shall** be delayed if the transponder is in a 
transaction cycle (see §
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

(2) 
the scheduled Extended Squitter **shall** be delayed if an acquisition or another 
type of Extended Squitter is in process; or 
(3) 
the scheduled Extended Squitter **shall** be delayed if a mutual suppression 
interface is active. 
Note:
 A mutual suppression system may be used to connect on-board equipment 
operating in the same frequency band in order to prevent mutual interference.  Squitter action resumes as soon as practical after a mutual 
suppression interval. 
The delayed squitter **shall** be transmitted as soon as the condition causing the delay no longer exists. 

## 2.2.23.1.4 Transponder Support For Extended Squitter Registers 2.2.23.1.4.1 Data Insertion

When the transponder determines that it is time to emit an airborne position squitter, it shall insert the current value of the barometric altitude (unless inhibited by the ATS 
subfield, §2.2.23.1.9) and surveillance status into the appropriate fields of Register 0516.  
The contents of this Register **shall** then be inserted into the ME field of DF=17 and transmitted. 

Note:
 Insertion in this manner ensures that (1) the squitter contains the latest altitude and surveillance status, and (2) ground readout of Register 0516 will yield exactly the same information as contained in the previous squitter. 

## 2.2.23.1.4.2 Register Timeout And Termination 2.2.23.1.4.2.1 Timeout Of Extended Squitter Messages

a. Timeout of Extended Squitter Messages **shall** be performed in accordance with 
§2.2.3.3.2.11 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A.   
b. Verification of Extended Squitter Message timeout functions **shall** be performed in 
accordance with §2.4.3.3.2.11 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A.   

## 2.2.23.1.4.2.2 Termination Of Extended Squitter Messages

a. Termination of Extended Squitter Messages **shall** be performed in accordance with 
§2.2.3.3.2.12 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A.   
b. Verification of Extended Squitter Message termination functions **shall** be performed 
in accordance with §2.4.3.3.2.12 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A.   

## 2.2.23.1.5 Airborne/Surface Format Selection 2.2.23.1.5.1 Automatic Format Selection

The criteria for selection of airborne or surface formats are contained in the latest version of §2.2.3.2.1.2 of RTCA DO-260B [EUROCAE ED-102A].     

## 2.2.23.1.5.2 Ground Controlled Format Selection

Aircraft without such automatic means **shall** report the airborne type formats.  Aircraft with or without such automatic on-the-ground determination **shall** report the surface type formats as commanded by control codes in the TCS subfield (see §2.2.23.1.7).  After timeout of the TCS commands, control of airborne / surface type formats **shall** revert to the means described above.   

Note 1:
 
Extended squitter ground stations determine aircraft airborne or on-theground state by monitoring aircraft position, altitude and ground speed. Aircraft determined to be on-the-ground that are not reporting the surface type 
formats may be commanded to report the surface type formats via the TCS 
subfield.  The normal return to the airborne type formats is via a ground 
command to report the airborne type formats.  To guard against loss of communications after takeoff, commands to report the surface type formats 
automatically timeout.   
2.2.18.2.6.a. 

When commanded to report the surface type format by TCS commands, aircraft without automatic means of determining the on-the-ground condition, and aircraft with such means that are reporting airborne state, **shall** transmit acquisition squitters as specified in 
§

Note 2:
 
Transmission of the acquisition squitter will provide for TCAS acquisition in 
the event that an airborne aircraft is commanded to report the surface type formats.  In this case, the CA field of the acquisition and Extended Squitters 
will continue to show that the aircraft is airborne, or is unable to determine its on-the-ground state.   

## 2.2.23.1.6 Surface Squitter Rate Control

Surface squitter rate **shall** be determined as follows: 

a. 
Once per second the contents of the TRS (see §2.2.23.1.9) **shall** be read.  If the 
value of TRS is 0 or 1, the transponder **shall** transmit surface squitters at the high 
rate.  If the value of TRS is 2, the transponder **shall** transmit surface squitters at 
the low rate. 
b. 
The squitter rate determined via the TRS subfield **shall** be subject to being 
overridden by commands received via the RCS subfield (see §2.2.23.1.7).  RCS 
code 1 **shall** cause the transponder to squitter at the high rate for 60 seconds.  
RCS code 2 **shall** cause the transponder to squitter at the low rate for 60 seconds. These commands **shall** be able to be refreshed for a new 60 second period before 
timeout of the prior period.  
c. 
After timeout and in the absence of RCS codes 1 and 2, control **shall** return to the 
TRS subfield. 

## 2.2.23.1.7 Subfields In Sd For Extended Squitter

The SD field contains the following information if the DI code is 2. 

## 2.2.23.1.7.1 Type Control Subfield (Tcs) In Sd For Extended Squitter

TCS, the 3-bit (bits 21 - 23) Type Control Subfield in SD **shall** control the extended squitter airborne and surface format types reported by the transponder, and its response to ATCRBS, ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call and Mode S-Only All-Call interrogations.  These commands **shall** only affect the format type that is reported, they shall not change the aircraft determination of its on-the-ground condition.  The commands for codes 1 and 2 
shall be able to be refreshed for a new period before timeout of the prior period.   

Note 1:
 
Thus aircraft without the means to set the on-the-ground condition will 
continue to report code 6 in the CA field, and an aircraft with the means to set the on-the-ground condition that has determined that it is in the airborne state will continue to set code 5, independent of the Extended Squitter format that is emitted.  
The following TCS codes have been assigned: 

 

| TCS Codes    | Description                                            |

## 2.2.23.1.7.2 Rate Control Subfield (Rcs) In Sd For Extended Squitter

RCS, the 3-bit (bits 24 - 26) Rate Control Subfield in SD **shall** control the squitter rate of the transponder when it is reporting the Extended Squitter surface type formats.  This subfield **shall** have no effect on the transponder squitter rate when it is reporting the Extended Squitter airborne type formats.  

Note 2: 
Aircraft without the means of determining on-the-ground state or aircraft with such means that are declaring the airborne state must be commanded to 
transmit the surface format (via TCS) before they can be controlled by this 
subfield.  Both of these commands may be sent in the same interrogation. 
Note 3:
 
Both TCS and RCS have specific timeout periods.  If the surface format command times out first, the aircraft will resume broadcasting the airborne 
format (unless it is now declaring the on-the-ground state or the surface 
format is selected in accordance with the requirements of §2.2.3.2.1.2 (3) of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A).   
The following RCS codes have been assigned:   

| RCS Codes    | Description                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

Acquisition squitters **shall** be emitted during the time period when Extended Squitters are inhibited as specified in §2.2.18.2.6.c.   

Note 4:
2.2.23.1.3
 
The definition of high and low squitter rate is given in §
 and 
applies to the Surface Position, Aircraft Identification and Category, and the Operational Status Messages.   
Note 5:
2.2.18.2.6
 
As stated in §
.b.4, Acquisition squitters are transmitted when 
Surface type format Extended Squitters are not being transmitted.   
 

## 2.2.23.1.7.3 Surface Antenna Subfield (Sas) In Sd For Extended Squitter

SAS, the two bit (bits 27 - 28) surface antenna subfield in SD **shall** control the selection of the diversity antenna that is used for: (1) the Extended Squitter when it is reporting the surface type formats, and (2) the acquisition squitter when the aircraft is reporting the onthe-ground condition.  This subfield **shall** have no effect on the transponder diversity antenna selection when the aircraft is reporting the airborne status type, or if the aircraft does not have diversity antennas.  When reporting the surface type formats, the default shall be the top antenna.  The following SAS codes have been assigned:   

|   SAS Codes  | Description                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|           0  | No antenna command                                |
|           1  | Alternate top and bottom antennas for 120 seconds |
|           2  | Use bottom antenna for 120 seconds                |
|           3  | Return to the default                             |

## 2.2.23.1.8 Subfields In Me For Extended Squitter

SSS, the 2-bit (bits 38 - 39) Surveillance Status Subfield in ME **shall** report the surveillance status of the transponder when this field contains the airborne position squitter report.  The following SSS codes have been assigned: 

|   SSS Codes  | Description                                                       |

|           2  | Transponder reporting a temporary alert condition (§2.2.18.2.7.a) |
|           3  | Transponder reporting SPI condition (§2.2.18.2.7.d)               |

Codes 1 and 2 **shall** take precedence over code 3. 

ACS, the 12-bit (bits 41 - 52) Altitude Code Subfield in ME **shall** (under control of the ATS subfield, §2.2.23.1.9) report the barometric altitude when this field contains an airborne position report.  The contents of the ACS subfield **shall** be as specified for the 13-bit AC field (§2.2.14.4.2) except that the M bit (bit 26) **shall** be omitted.  When barometric altitude is being reported, the contents of the ACS subfield **shall** be inserted by the transponder from the same source that would be used to provide the altitude field of a reply to a discrete interrogation.  Transponder insertion of altitude data in the ACS 
subfield **shall** take place when the 1-bit ATS subfield has the value of ZERO.  
Transponder insertion of altitude data in the ACS subfield **shall** be inhibited when the ATS subfield has the value ONE.

## 2.2.24.3 Declaration Of Capability In Register 1016 - Data Link Capability Report 2.2.24.3.1 Purpose And Definition

Register 1016 **shall** be formatted as specified in Appendix B, Table B-3-16 and associated notes.   
Note:
 The following subsections detail the minimum requirements for servicing Register 1016 in regards to Elementary Surveillance.  Other fields in Register 
1016 that do not pertain to Elementary Surveillance need to be managed in accordance with the additional capabilities supported by the transponder.   

## 2.2.24.3.2 Data Requirements 2.2.24.3.2.1 Bits 1 Through 8, Bds Code

Bits 1 through 8 of Register 1016 shall be encoded with 10 HEX (0001 0000) (e.g., the BDS Register code).   

Note:
 The setting of the BDS Code by the transponder ensures that a broadcast change 
of the capability report will contain the BDS Code for all cases of data link failure (e.g., the loss of the transponder data link interface).   
 

## 2.2.24.3.2.2 Bits 17 Through 23, Declaration Of Mode S Subnetwork Number

Bits 17 through 23 of Register 1016 **shall** be encoded with the Mode-S Subnetwork Version Number in accordance with the following table:   

Version

To be consistent with Elementary and Enhance Surveillance requirements (e.g., this version of these MOPS), the Mode S Subnetwork Version Number **shall** be set to "5" or 
"higher".   
 

## 2.2.24.3.2.3 Bit 25, Declaration Of No Mode S Specific Services Capability

Bit 25 of Register 1016 shall not be set to ONE (1) when reporting only Aircraft Identification in Register 2016 when no other Mode S Specific Services are supported by the transponder. 

1. When Bit 25 is set to ONE (1), it indicates that at least one Mode S specific service is 
supported.  Other capability reports need to be checked in order to determine which registers are supported.  Mode S Specific Service refers to the servicing of Registers 
other than GICB services related to Registers 0216, 0316, 0416, 1016, 1716 through 
1C16, 2016 and 3016.   
2. Bit 25 is used to indicate that Register 1716 should be extracted.  The capability bits 
for the Enhanced Surveillance Registers 4016, 5016, and 6016 are used from Register 
1716 to determine if the Enhanced Surveillance Registers should be extracted.  In 
effect, Enhanced Surveillance functionality will not be detected unless bit 25 is set.   

## 2.2.24.3.2.4 Bit 33, Aircraft Identification Reporting Capability

Servicing of Register 2016 requires the updating of Register 1016 as follows: 

a. Register 1016 (Data Link Capability Report) bit 33 **shall** be set to ONE (1) if the 
transponder is receiving any data from the Aircraft installation with which to service 
Register 2016 with Flight Identification or Aircraft Registration data as provided in 
the respective sections for each BDS Register in the subsequent sections of this document.   
Note:
 This requirement is not established by the transponder LRU own capability 
to service Register 2016.  Rather, it is established by the Aircraft installation 
capability to provide the transponder with the appropriate data with which to 
then service Register 2016.   
b. Register 1016 (Data Link Capability Report) bit 33 **shall** be set to ZERO (0) if the 
transponder is receiving no data from the Aircraft installation that could be used to 
properly service Register 2016.   
Note:
 When bit 33 of Register 1016 is changed, the change is broadcast as required in §
 and further defined in §2.2.24.4.   
2.2.19.1.13

## 2.2.24.3.2.5 Bit 35, Surveillance Identifier Code (Si)

Bit 35 of Register 1016 **shall** be set to ONE (1) to indicate that the transponder supports 
"SI" code capability.   
 "SI" code support is a mandatory requirement capability for all transponders.   
Note:

## 2.2.24.3.2.6 Bit 36, Common Usage Gicb Capability Report

a. Register 1016 (Data Link Capability Report) bit 36 **shall** be toggled (i.e., changed 
from "0" to "1", or from "1" to "0") each time that the Common Usage GICB 
Capability Report (Register 1716) is changed.   
b. To avoid the generation of too many broadcast capability report changes, Register 
1716 **shall** be sampled at approximately one minute intervals to check for changes that 
may require the toggling of bit 36 as discussed in subparagraph "a."   

## 2.2.24.3.3 Maximum Update Interval

a. The maximum update interval at which Register 1016 **shall** be reloaded with valid 
data is ≤ 4.0 seconds.   
 Effectively, Register 1016 must be updated every 4.0 seconds or sooner. 

Note:

b. Register 1016 **shall** be updated within one second of the data changing and at least 
every four seconds thereafter.   
c. If a particular data field in Register 1016 cannot be updated within 8.0 seconds (e.g., 
twice the specified maximum update interval of 
≤ 4.0 seconds), then the data fie ld 
shall be ZEROed.   

## 2.2.24.3.4 Change Reporting

When Register 1016 is changed, then the Register **shall** be broadcast as described in 
§2.2.19.1.12.6.3. 

## 2.2.24.4 Register 1716, Common Usage Gicb Capability Report 2.2.24.4.1 Purpose And Definition

The format of Register 1716 **shall** be formatted as specified in Appendix B Table B-3-23 
and associated notes. 

Note:
 The purpose of Register 1716 is to indicate which registers are currently supported by the aircraft installation, i.e., currently contain data useable for operational use. 

Elementary Surveillance transponders manage the following bits of Register 1716: 

a. Bit 7 to indicate servicing of Register 2016, 
b. Bit 8 to indicate servicing of Optional Register 2116. 

## 2.2.24.4.2 Data Requirements 2.2.24.4.2.1 Required Servicing Of Register 1716 Associated With Register 2016

a. Register 1716 bit 7 **shall** be set to ONE (1) if the transponder is servicing either 
Aircraft Identification (also referred to as Flight Identification as specified in the Flight Plan) or Aircraft Registration data in the Aircraft installation.  
Note:
 This requirement is not established by the transponder LRU own capability to 
service Register 2016.  Rather, it is established by the Aircraft installation 
capability to provide the transponder with the appropriate data with which to 
then service Register 2016. 
b. Register 1716 bit 7 **shall** be set to ZERO (0) if the transponder is receiving no data 
from the Aircraft installation that could be used to properly service Register 2016. 
 

## 2.2.24.4.2.2 Requiring Servicing Of Register 1716 Associated With Optional Register 2116

Note:
 Elementary Surveillance does not require that Register 2116 be serviced.  
However, if Register 2116 is serviced, the following subparagraphs should be 
complied with.   
a. Register 1716 bit 8 shall be set to ONE (1) if the transponder is receiving Aircraft 
Registration data in the Aircraft installation.  
Note:
 This requirement is not established by the transponder LRU own capability 
to service Register 2116.  Rather, it is established by the Aircraft installation 
capability to provide the transponder with the appropriate data with which to 
then service Register 2116. 
b. Register 1716 bit 8 **shall** be set to ZERO (0) if the transponder is receiving no data 
from the Aircraft installation that could be used to properly service Register 2116. 
 

## 2.2.24.4.3 Register 1716 Change Reporting

Whenever the contents of Register 1716 change, bit 36 of Register 1016 **shall** be toggled as defined in §2.2.24.3.2.6. 

## 2.2.24.5 Register 1816 To 1C16, Mode S Specific Services Capability Report 2.2.24.5.1 Purpose And Definition

The Mode-S transponder **shall** format Register 1816 through 1C16 as defined in Appendix 
B, Table B-3-24 through Table B-3-28 and associated notes for Register 1816 through 
1C16, respectively.   
Note 1: 
Registers 1816 to 1C16 are used to indicate the capability of the aircraft 
installation to provide data for each Register, i.e., the Register or a part of the Register is managed by the transponder and it is known that data can be received from the installation to fill this field.   
Note 2:
 
This is not established by the Transponder LRU own capability.  Rather, it is established by the Aircraft installation capability to provide the transponder with the appropriate data with which to service the corresponding Register.  
Once this capability is established it remains set until power off of the transponder.   
Transponders that support Elementary Surveillance functions manage Register 1816 as follows:   

a. Register 1816 bit 41 to indicate that the installation has the capability to provide data 
in Register 1016. 
b. Register 1816 bit 34 to indicate that the installation has the capability to provide data 
in Register 1716. 
c. Register 1816 bit 33 to indicate that the installation has the capability to provide data 
in Register 1816. 
d. Register 1816 bit 25 to indicate that the installation has the capability to provide data 
in Register 2016. 
e. As an Option, Register 1816 bit 24 to indicate that the installation has the capability to 
provide data in Register 2116. 
Note 3: 
Although not a function of Elementary Surveillance, Register 1816 bit 9 is set 
when the transponder is interfaced with TCAS to indicate that the TCAS 
Active Resolution Advisory Register 3016 is supported.   
Note 4:
 
Elementary Surveillance only requires that Register 1816 be serviced.  
Therefore, if no other transponder functions require the servicing of Register 
1916 through 1C16, these Registers will be set to ALL ZERO.   

## 2.2.24.5.2 Data Requirements 2.2.24.5.2.1 Required Servicing Of Register 1816 Associated With Register 1016

a. Register 1816 bit 41 **shall** be set to ONE (1) if the transponder is required to service 
any part of Register 1016. 
Note:
 This requirement is not established by the Transponder LRU own capability 
to service Register 1016.  Rather, it is established by the Aircraft installation 
capability to provide the transponder with the appropriate data of which 
processing would result in the need to update Register 1016.   
b. Once Register 1816 bit 41 has been set to ONE (1) during a particular power-on cycle, 
then it **shall** remain set to ONE (1) until power-off of the transponder.   
 

## 2.2.24.5.2.2 Required Servicing Of Register 1816 Associated With Register 1716

a. Register 1816 bit 34 **shall** be set to ONE (1) if the transponder is required to service 
any part of Register 1716 as provided in §2.2.24.4.

the Aircraft installation that could result in the need to service Register 1816.   

## 2.2.24.5.2.4 Required Servicing Of Register 1816 Associated With Register 2016

a. Register 1816 bit 25 **shall** be set to ONE (1) if the transponder has received either 
Aircraft Identification (also referred to as Flight Identification as specified in the Flight Plan) or Aircraft Registration data in the Aircraft Installation since the poweron of the transponder. 
Note:
 This requirement is not established by the Transponder LRU own capability to service Register 2016.  Rather, it is established by the Aircraft installation capability to provide the transponder with the appropriate data with which to then service Register 2016.   

b. Once Register 1816 bit 25 has been set to ONE (1), then it **shall** remain set to ONE 
(1) until power-off of the transponder.   
c. Register 1816 bit 25 **shall** be set to ZERO (0) if the transponder has received no data 
from the Aircraft installation that could be used to properly service Register 2016 
since power-on of the transponder.   

## 2.2.24.5.2.5 Required Servicing Of Register 1816 Associated With Optional Register 2116

Note:
 Elementary Surveillance does not require that Register 2116 be serviced.  
However, if Register 2116 is serviced, the following subparagraphs need to be 
complied with.  
a. Register 1816 bit 24 **shall** be set to ONE (1) if the transponder has received Aircraft 
Registration data in the Aircraft Installation since power-on of the transponder. 
Note: This requirement is not established by the Transponder LRU own capability 
to service Register 2116.  Rather, it is established by the Aircraft installation 
capability to provide the transponder with the appropriate data with which to 
then service Register 2116. 
b. Once Register 1816 bit 24 has been set to ONE (1), then it shall remain set to ONE (1) 
until power-off of the transponder.   
c. Register 1816 bit 24 shall be set to ZERO (0) if the transponder has received no data 
from the Aircraft installation that could be used to properly service Register 2116 
since power-on of the transponder.   

## 2.2.24.5.3 Maximum Update Interval Of Register 1816 To 1C16

a. The maximum update interval at which Register 1816 (and/or Register 1916 to 1C16 if 
implemented) **shall** be reloaded with valid data is 5.0 seconds, i.e., Register 1816 
(and/or Register 1916 to 1C16 if implemented) **shall** be updated at least once every 5.0 
seconds.   
b. The time between availability of data that causes a change in Register 1816 (and/or 
Register 1916 to 1C16 if implemented) and the time that the change is made to 
Register 1816 (and/or Register 1916 to 1C16 if implemented) **shall** be less than the 
maximum update interval specified as 5.0 seconds.   
c. The setting of bits in Register 1816 to 1C16 is static.  If a bit has been set to ONE (1) 
in one of these registers since power-on of the transponder, then the bit **shall** remain 
set to ONE (1) until power-off of the transponder.   

## 2.2.24.6 Register 2016 -- Aircraft Identification And Data Sources 2.2.24.6.1 Purpose And Definition

The Mode-S transponder shall format Register 2016 as defined in Appendix B, Table B-3-
32 and associated notes.  

Note 1: 
ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV requires that the aircraft identification to be used is that employed in the flight plan.  When no flight plan is available, the registration marking is used if available, otherwise the aircraft identification is set to ALL ZERO's.   
Note 2:
 
On aircraft, it is possible to have access to data from an interface where the pilot can enter the data that is employed in the flight plan.  This could be the 
telephony designator of the aircraft operating agency, followed by the flight 
identification or the registration marking of the aircraft.  This piece of information is considered as variable data and the transponder cannot know what is really entered by the pilot (depending on operational procedure). This piece of information is named "Flight Identification" within the rest of this section. In ARINC, it is normally provided via ARINC Labels 233 through 237 or by Label 360 for block transfer data.   
In addition on some platforms it is also possible to receive another piece of data which is the registration marking (tail number). This is considered as a fixed data which does not vary during the flight. This piece of information can only be used when there is no data coming from the interface delivering the variable data.  This is referenced as "Aircraft Registration´ within the rest of this section.   

## 2.2.24.6.2 Register 2016 -- Data Requirements 2.2.24.6.2.1 Data Selection Priority

Use of Flight Identification or Aircraft Registration Data in Register 2016 **shall** comply with the following guidelines: 

a. If Flight Identification data is available at anytime during unit operation, then flight 
identification data **shall** be inserted into the character subfields of Register 2016.   
Note:
 Flight Identification data is normally provided via ARINC Labels 233 
through 237 or by Label 360 for block transfer data.  Available data means that the status of the data is not set to No Computed Data (NCD). 
b. If Flight Identification data is NOT available then Aircraft Registration, if available,  
shall be inserted into the character subfields of Register 2016.   
Note:

## 2.2.25 Enhanced Surveillance (Ehs) Compliant Transponders

This section contains requirements on Mode S transponders required to support Enhanced Surveillance (EHS). The Enhanced Surveillance application entails the use of the following Downlink Aircraft Parameters (DAPs): 

a. Magnetic Heading  
b. Indicated Airspeed and/or Mach No.  
c. Vertical Rate (climb/descend)  
d. MCP/FCU Selected Altitude e. Ground Speed f. 
Roll Angle 
g. Track Angle Rate (or True Airspeed if Track Angle Rate is not available)  
h. True Track Angle  

## I. Barometric Pressure Setting

These DAPS are embedded in three transponder Registers (4016, 5016, and 6016).  
In addition to those three Registers, the Enhanced Surveillance application uses a number of capability report Registers to assess the real time ability of the aircraft to transmit DAPs.  The format requirements related to the Enhanced Surveillance application for these capability registers are defined in §2.2.25.1 through §2.2.25.4. The Enhanced Surveillance application presents the following benefits:  

a. The provision of actual aircraft derived data, such as Magnetic Heading, Air Speed, 
Selected Altitude and Vertical Rate, enables controllers to reduce the radio telephony (RT) workload and better assess the separation situations. 
b. EHS enables Monitoring Tools and Safety Nets, which work on actual data, to be 
implemented or improved (e.g., Short Term Conflict Alert) which, in turn, will allow 
safety levels to be maintained or improved despite the increase in traffic levels. 
Transponder capable of supporting EHS must: 

a. Support ELS as defined in §2.2.24. 
b. At least be able to provide data in Registers 4016, 5016, and 6016. 
c. Support capability reporting in CA and Registers 1016 to 1F16. 
Note 1: 
Servicing Register 5F16 is not mandatory.   
Note 2:
 
For the remaining subsections of this section, servicing of a field or subfield 
in a register implies that valid data has been received at a sufficient rate to meet the update requirements specified for the given register in Appendix B. 

## 2.2.25.1 Register 1016 - Data Link Capability Report 2.2.25.1.1 Purpose And Definition

The Mode-S transponder **shall** format Registers 1816 through 1C16 as defined in Appendix B, Table B-3-24 through Table B-3-28 and associated notes for Register 1816 through 
1C16, respectively.   

Note 1: 
Registers 1816 to 1C16 are used to indicate the capability of the aircraft 
installation to provide data for each register i.e., the Register or a part of the Register is managed by the transponder, and it is known that data can be received from the installation to fill this field.   
Note 2:
 
This is not established by the Transponder LRU own capability.  Rather, it is 
established by the Aircraft installation capability to provide the transponder with the appropriate data with which to service the corresponding register.  
Once this capability is established it remains set until power-off of the 
transponder.   
Transponders that support Enhanced Surveillance (EHS) functions manage Register 1816 
as follows: 

a. Register 1816 bit 41 to indicate that the installation has the capability to provide data 
in Register 1016.

Note 3: 
Although not a function of Elementary Surveillance, Register 1816 bit 9 is set 
when the transponder is interfaced with TCAS to indicate that the TCAS 
Active Resolution Advisory Register 3016 is supported. 
Note 4: 
Combined Elementary and Enhanced Surveillance only require that Register 
1816 and 1916 be serviced;  Therefore, if no other transponder functions 
require the servicing of Register 1A16 through 1C16, these registers will be set 
to ALL ZERO.

any part of Register 5F16 as provided in §
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Note:
 This requirement is not established by the Transponder LRU own capability 
to service Register 5F16.  Rather, it is established by the Aircraft installation 
capability to provide the transponder with the appropriate data of which 
processing would result in the need to update Register 5F16.   
b. Once Register 1916 bit 18 has been set to ONE (1) since power-on of the transponder, 
then it shall remain set to ONE (1) until power-off of the transponder. 
c. Register 1916 bit 18 shall be set to ZERO (0) if the transponder receives no data from 
the Aircraft installation that could result in the need to service Register 5F16 as 
provided in §2.2.25.7. 

## 2.2.25.3.2.10 Required Servicing Of Register 1916 Associated With Register 6016

a. Register 1916 bit 17 shall be set to ONE (1) if the transponder has received either 
Magnetic Heading, Indicated Airspeed, Mach, Barometric Altitude Rate, or Inertial Vertical Velocity data in the Aircraft installation during the power-on cycle.   
Refer to Appendix B, Table B-3-96 for full definition of Register 6016.  

Note:
 This requirement is not established by the Transponder LRU own capability 
to service Register 6016.  Rather, it is established by the Aircraft installation 
capability to provide the transponder with the appropriate data with which to 
then service Register 6016.   
b. Once Register 1916 bit 17 has been set to ONE (1) since power-on of the transponder, 
then it **shall** remain set to ONE (1) until power-off of the transponder. 
c. Register 1916 bit 17 **shall** be set to ZERO (0) if the transponder receives no data from 
the Aircraft installation that could be used to properly service Register 6016 since 
power-on of the transponder. 

## 2.2.25.3.3 Maximum Update Interval Of Registers 1816 To 1C16

a. The maximum update interval at which Register 1816 and/or Register 1916 **shall** be 
reloaded with valid data is 5.0 seconds.

## 2.2.26 Generic Register Xx16 Requirements

The following subsections provide generic requirements that can be used as a basis to verify transponders that implement Registers that have not been defined in detail in this document.  When an additional Register is implemented that is not covered in §2.2.24 or §2.2.25, then the requirements in the following subsections will revert to the use of the requirement word "shall" instead of "will."   
Note:
 In the following subsections, "ddd" means the decimal equivalent to XX16.  For instance, for 4016, "ddd" = 6410 = 64.   

## 2.2.26.1 Purpose And Definition

a) Transponders will format Register XX16 as defined in Appendix B, Table B-3-ddd. 
b) The transponder will comply with all constraints and requirements for servicing 
Register XX16 that are provided with Table B-3-ddd in Appendix B.    

## 2.2.26.2 Data Requirement 2.2.26.2.1 Data Field "Y"

a. The transponder will process data from on-board aircraft data sources as provided in 
Appendix B, Table B-3-ddd of Register XX16 definition table and format the data 
into field "y" of the Register XX16 "MB" field as shown in that table. 
b. Field "y" will be encoded using two's complement coding if it is a signed arithmetic 
field unless otherwise specified. 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

c. The data loaded into the "MB" field will be rounded so as to preserve accuracy of the 
source data within ±1/2 LSB.   
d. Status Bit of field "y" will be set to ONE (1) whenever valid and up-to-date data 
(data not older than twice the maximum update interval specified in Table B-2-1 in 
Appendix B) is available in field "y". 
e. Status Bit of field "y" will be set to ZERO (0) whenever there is no valid and up-todate data with which to fill field "y".   
f. 
The data bits of field "y" will be set to ZERO if the Status Bit is set to ZERO.   
g. Any Reserved Bits will be set to ZERO.    
Note 1: 
On an ARINC platform, when data is available in BCD and in binary, transponders will preferably use binary data rather than BCD data. 
Note 2:
 
When multiple sources of data are available for a given field "y", 
transponders will use the data source that is being used to manage the 
aircraft profile or the source selected by the flight crew.  This general convention applies unless the highest integrity data is desired as in Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B).  In such cases, the highest integrity source will be used for data.   

## 2.2.26.3 Update Rate

a. The maximum update interval at which a data field in a Register will be reloaded 
with valid data is defined for each register in Table B-2-1 in Appendix B. 
b. The transponder will load valid data into the related transponder Register as soon as 
it becomes available at the Mode S Specific Services entity. 
c. The time between availability of data that causes a change in a data-field of a 
Register and the time that the change is made to the Register will be less than the maximum update interval specified in Table B-2-1 in Appendix B. 
d. If a data-field field cannot be updated with valid data within twice the specified 
maximum update interval defined for the Register or 2 seconds (whichever is the greater), then Status Bit (if specified) of the field will be set to ZERO (0) (INVALID) and that data field will be ZEROed. 

## 2.2.26.4 Service Reporting

(installation capability) in transponder Registers 1816 to 1C16. 
b. The transponder will update the common usage GICB Capability Report (transponder 
Register 1716) while periodically checking the availability of the related data. 
c. The transponder will promptly update the Data Link Capability Report (transponder 
Register 1016 bit 25 and bit 36 and broadcast Register 1016 in case of change in 
Register 1016.

## 2.3 Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in this subsection provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under conditions representative of those that may be encountered in actual aeronautical operations.  
Some of the environmental tests contained in this subsection need not be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition.  These tests are identified by the phrase "When Required."  If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional environmental conditions, then these 
"when required" tests **shall** be performed.  
The test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in RTCA Document DO-160G, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, December 8, 2010. Some of the performance requirements in Subsections §2.1 and §2.2 are not tested by the test procedures herein.  Moreover, not all tests are required to be done at each of the environmental conditions in RTCA/DO-160G.  Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Subsections §2.1 and §2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these environmental conditions. The specified performance tests cover all classes of Mode S transponders.  Only those tests that are applicable to the class of transponder being qualified need be done. Additional tests may have to be performed in order to determine performance of particular design requirements that are not specified in this document.  It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to determine appropriate tests for these functions.  
Specific transponder performance tests have been included in this section for use in conjunction with the environmental procedures of RTCA/DO-160G.  These tests have been judiciously chosen as a subset of the transponder performance tests of Subsection 
§2.4.  Normally, a MOPS document does not provide specific equipment performance tests to be used in conjunction with the environmental procedures of RTCA/DO-160G.  
However, there is a sufficiently large number of transponder performance tests in Subsection §2.4 that it would be impractical to repeat all of those tests in conjunction with all of the appropriate environmental procedures.  
 

## 2.3.1 Environmental Test Conditions

Table 2-11 lists all of the environmental conditions and test procedures (hereafter referred to as environmental procedures) that are documented in RTCA/DO-160G.  Table 2-12 lists the 16 sets of transponder performance tests that are specified in detail in this section and which are intended to be run subject to the various environmental procedures of RTCA/DO-160G.  In order to simplify the process of relating the environmental procedures to the transponder performance tests, Table 2-11 divides the environmental procedures into groups.  All of the procedures in a given group are carried out in conjunction with the same set of transponder performance tests.  Using this approach, the environmental procedures fall into six groups.  The environmental procedures that apply to all of the sets of transponder performance tests fall into Group 1.  Group 2 procedures apply to 12 of the sets of transponder performance tests.  Groups 3, 4, and 5 apply to 6, 4 and 4 of the sets of transponder performance tests, respectively.  (Group 6, which applies to none of the transponder performance tests, includes only environmental procedures that are intended to determine the effect of the transponder on rack mounting hardware, compass needles, explosive gasses, and other RF hardware.) Table 2-12 indicates which of the groups of environmental procedures is related to each set of transponder performance tests.  Each transponder performance test **shall** be validated under all of the environmental procedures in the groups required for that test as indicated in Table 2-12.

(mounts, compass needles, explosive gasses, and other RF equipment) and therefore do not involve the transponder performance requirements of this document.   
2. "When Required" in the above table means when necessary to support installation 
issues and is not specifically required by these MOPS.

## 2.3.2 Detailed Environmental Test Procedures

The test procedures set forth below are considered satisfactory for use in determining equipment performance under environmental conditions.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred.  These alternative procedures may be used if the manufacturer can show that they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternative procedures.  These transponder performance tests do not include specific pass fail criteria.  It is intended that those criteria be obtained from the transponder performance requirements presented in the referenced paragraphs in §2.2.  

## 2.3.2.1 Receiver Characteristics (§2.2.2)

)  
Step 1 Sensitivity Variation with Frequency (§2.2.2.2
Using a standard Mode A interrogation, interrogate the transponder at RF signal frequencies of 1029.8, 1030.0 and 1030.2 MHz.  Determine the required maximum RF signal level at each frequency required to produce 90% reply efficiency.   

  
Step 2 Sensitivity (§2.2.2.4.a.)
Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode C ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation.  Determine the minimum RF signal level required to produce 90% transponder reply efficiency.  
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

  
Step 3 ATCRBS and ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call Dynamic Range (§2.2.2.4.f)
Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode A interrogation at RF levels from MTL +3 dB to -21 dBm in approximately 5 equal steps.  Determine reply ratio.  Repeat for a standard Mode C ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call.  

  
Step 4 ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call Low-Level Reply Ratio (§2.2.2.4.d.)
Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode C ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call at an RF level of -81 dBm.  Determine reply ratio.  

  
Step 5 Mode S Sensitivity (§2.2.2.4.b.)
Interrogate the transponder with a Mode S Only All-Call interrogation at a standard rate with PR=0.  Determine the minimum RF level to produce 90% proper reply efficiency.  

  
Step 6 Mode S Dynamic Range (§2.2.2.4.c.)
Using the signal specified in Step 5, determine the reply efficiency for RF levels of MTL +3 dB, -50 dBm and -21 dBm. 

  
Step 7 Mode S Low-Level Reply Ratio (§2.2.2.4.d.)
Using the signal specified in Step 5, determine reply efficiency for an RF level of -81 dBm.  

## 2.3.2.2 Transmitter Characteristics (§2.2.3) 2.3.2.2.1 Reply Transmission Frequency (§2.2.3.1)

Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode A interrogation.  Use a 14 (7777) pulse reply group.  Repeat with a standard Mode A ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call.  Determine the reply frequency for both reply types.  

## 2.3.2.2.2 Rf Peak Power Output (§2.2.3.2)

  
Step 1 ATCRBS Power Output (§2.2.3.2)
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-31.  Set the transponder for a 
14-pulse (7777) reply.  Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode A 
interrogation at 1200 interrogations per second or the maximum for which the transponder is designed and measure the single pulse having the least RF power output.  Determine that the power output meets the requirements of §
2.2.3.2.

Step 2 Short Mode S Power Output (§2.2.3.2)
Repeat Step 1 with a standard Mode A ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation at the standard rate.  

Step 3 
Long Mode S Power Output 
For transponders with long reply capability (Level 2 or above), repeat Step 1 with sixteen Mode S interrogations per second using any format and coding for which a long reply is required. 

If the transponder is also Extended Squitter capable, then configure the transponder so that the transponder is transmitting the Extended Squitters (or an equivalent number of long replies) in addition to the sixteen replies. 

Step 4 
Extended Long Mode S Power Output (§2.2.3.5) 
For transponders with extended reply capability (Level 4 or above), repeat Step 3, stimulating the maximum rate of long replies for which the transponder is designed. 

Note:

 The reply rate capability has to take into account 25% surplus 
  transmitting capability.  (e.g., if the transponder has declared the 
  capacity to deliver the maximum of N ELM segments per second, it has 
  to deliver N + 25% of N in a 25-millisecond interval of each second as 
  defined in §
                 ).   

2.2.3.5

## 2.3.2.2.3 Reply Rate Capability

  
Step 1 ATCRBS Reply Rate Capability (§2.2.3.4.1.a and §2.2.3.4.2)
Set the transponder for a 15-pulse ATCRBS reply.  Interrogate the transponder at a constant rate of 500 ATCRBS interrogations per second plus 50 Mode S interrogations (with short replies) per second.  Measure the output power and frequency.  If the transponder is equipped for long Mode S reply formats, repeat the test with 16 (24 if also equipped with the enhanced data link protocols) of the 50 Mode S interrogations requiring long replies.  

  
Step 2 Continuous Reply Rate Capability (§2.2.3.4.1.a and §2.2.3.4.2)
Set the transponder for a 14 pulse plus SPI-pulse ATCRBS reply.  Interrogate the transponder at a constant rate of 500 ATCRBS interrogations per second plus 50 Mode S interrogations (with short replies) per second.  If the transponder is equipped for long Mode S reply formats, have 16 (24 if also equipped with the enhanced data link protocols) of the 50 Mode S interrogations requiring long replies.  Determine reply ratio for each type of interrogation. 

Step 3 
100 Milliseconds Peak Reply Rate Capability (§2.2.3.4.1 b & c and §2.2.3.4.2) 
Set the transponder for a 14 pulse plus SPI-pulse ATCRBS reply.  Interrogate the transponder with periodic bursts of ATCRBS and Mode S interrogations as follows: 120 ATCRBS interrogations (100 for Class 2 equipment) plus 18 Mode S interrogations (with short replies), each type of interrogation approximately uniformly spaced within a single 0.1-second interval, followed by a 0.9-second interval with no interrogations.  If the transponder is equipped for long Mode S reply formats, have 6 (9 if also equipped with the enhanced data link protocols) of the 18 Mode S interrogations requiring long replies.  Determine reply ratio for each type of interrogation.  

  
Step 4 25 Millisecond Peak Reply Rate Capability (§2.2.3.4.2)
Set the transponder for a 14 pulse plus SPI-pulse ATCRBS reply.  Interrogate the transponder with periodic bursts of ATCRBS and Mode S interrogations as follows: 30 ATCRBS interrogations (25 for Class 2 equipment) plus 8 Mode S interrogations (requiring short replies), each type of interrogation burst approximately uniformly spaced within a single 25-millisecond interval, followed by a 975-millisecond interval without interrogations.  If the transponder is equipped for long Mode S reply formats, have 4 (6 if also equipped with the enhanced data link protocols) of the 8 Mode S interrogations requiring long replies.  Determine reply ratio for each type of interrogation.  

Step 5 
1.6 Milliseconds Peak Reply Rate Capability (§2.2.3.4.1 and §2.2.3.4.2) 
Repeat Step 3 with the following modification: Use two ATCRBS interrogations plus four Mode S interrogations (with short replies), each type of interrogation approximately uniformly spaced within a single 1.6-millisecond interval, followed by a 998.4-millisecond interval with no interrogation.  If the transponder is so equipped, two of the Mode S interrogations require long replies instead of all short replies.  Determine reply ratio for each type of interrogation. 

## 2.3.2.3 Reply Pulse Characteristics (§2.2.4) 2.3.2.3.1 Atcrbs Reply Pulse Characteristics (§2.2.4.1)

  
Step 1 ATCRBS Reply Pulse Spacing and Width (§2.2.4.1)
Interrogate with a standard Mode A interrogation.  Use a 15-pulse reply group (7777 with SPI) and measure the time between the first and last framing pulses.  
This time **shall** be 20.30 ±0.10 microseconds.  Measure the width of the first and last pulses.  This width **shall** be 0.45 ±0.10 microseconds.  Observe that all code pulses are of equal width and stable in position with respect to the first pulse.  

Step 2 Reply Delay and Jitter (§2.2.4.1.6.a and §2.2.4.1.6.b)
  
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-31.  Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode A interrogation.  Measure the average delay between the leading edge of P3 and the leading edge of the first reply pulse at the 50% 
amplitude points and the extreme positions of the leading edge of the first reply pulse at signal levels of MTL +3 dB, -50 dBm and -21 dBm.  

## 2.3.2.3.2 Mode S Replies (§2.2.4.2)

Note: Under environmental conditions, the following test procedure is required only 
under High Operating Temperature conditions. 
Step 1 
Mode S Preamble (§2.2.4.2.1)  
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-31.  Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode A ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call.  Display the Mode S reply on the oscilloscope.  Measure the pulse duration of the first four reply pulses. Measure pulse spacing between the leading edge of the first and each of the second, third and fourth pulses. 

Step 2 Mode S Reply Data Pulses (§2.2.4.2.2)  
Note:
 For Steps 2 through 6, examine pulses at the beginning, middle and end 
of the replies. 
Connect equipment as in Figure 2-31.  Measure the pulse duration for both short and long reply pulses throughout the Mode S reply. 

Measure the pulse spacing of the fifth reply pulse with reference to the first reply pulse. 

Step 3 
Mode S Reply Amplitude Variation (§2.2.4.2.3.a) 
Connect the equipment as in Figure 2-31.  Measure the maximum power differential between pulses in the Mode S reply. 

Step 4 
Mode S Reply Pulse Shape (§2.2.4.2.3.b) 
Measure the rise time of the reply pulses. 

CAUTION: 
         
           If the detector is not known to be linear, checks should be made 
           to determine what amplitude points on the detected pulse 
           correspond to the 10 percent and 90 percent amplitude points of 
           the RF pulses.  In addition, checks should be made to determine 
           the rise and decay time of the detector. 

Step 5 
Mode S Reply Pulse Spacing Tolerance (§2.2.4.2.4) 
Connect equipment as in Figure 2-31.  Determine that the leading edge of any reply pulse is within 50 nanoseconds of its assigned position. 

Step 6 
Long Replies (§2.2.4.2.1 through §2.2.4.2.4) 
Repeat Steps 1 through 5 using interrogations which require long replies.

## 2.3.2.4 Side Lobe Suppression (§2.2.5)

Step 1 
SLS Decoding [§2.2.5.1.a (1) and (3)] 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-32.  Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode A interrogation plus P2 RF signal level to be at MTL +3 
dB; P2 level = P1 level.  Verify that the reply ratio is no more than one percent. 

  
Step 2 SLS Dynamic Range [§2.2.5.1.a (2) and §2.2.5.1.c]
Repeat Step 1 at RF signal levels: -60 dBm, -40 dBm and -21 dBm.  

Step 3 SLS Pulse Ratio (§2.2.5.1.b)
  
Repeat Step 1 at RF signal levels MTL +3 dB, -50 dBm and -21 dBm.  Set P2 
level 9 dB below P1 level.  Verify that the reply efficiency is at least 90%.   

Step 4 
Suppression Duration [§2.2.5.1.d (1)] 
Interrogate the transponder with a P1 - P2 ATCRBS suppression pulse pair (2 
microsecond spacing), followed after 50 microseconds with a P1 - P3 (Mode A, 8 
microseconds) pulse pair.  Reduce the spacing of the P1 - P3 pair until the transponder reply rate is below 1%.  The time interval between the leading edges of P2 and P1 (of the P1 - P3 pair) is the suppression duration.  Repeat the procedure using P1 - P3 (Mode C, 21 microseconds) pulse pair interrogations.

## 2.3.2.5 Pulse Decoder Characteristics (§2.2.6)

Step 1 Pulse Level Tolerances, ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call (§2.2.6.1.1)
  
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-31.  Interrogate at the standard rate and at an input level 10 dB above MTL.  Use an ATCRBS Mode A interrogation followed by a 1.6-microsecond P4 pulse in its nominal position.  Vary the level of the P4 pulse between -10 and 0 dB in 1 dB steps with respect to P3.  Verify the changeover from ATCRBS to Mode S replies at the relative P4 levels specified in 
§
2.2.6.1.1.a and §2.2.6.1.1.b when more than 90% of the replies are Mode S or ATCRBS.  

  
Step 2 Pulse Level Tolerances, ATCRBS-Only All-Call (§2.2.6.1.2)
Use setup and signal levels as in Step 1 above but employ a 0.8 microsecond P4.  
Vary the level of the P4 pulse between -10 and 0 dB in 1 dB steps with respect to P3.  Verify the changeover from ATCRBS replies to no replies at the relative P4 
levels specified in §
2.2.6.1.2.a and §2.2.6.1.2.b.  

  
Step 3 Pulse Position Tolerances, P1/3, ATCRBS-Type Interrogations (§2.2.6.2 a and b)
Use setup and signal levels as in Step 1 above.  Interrogate with:  

a. ATCRBS Mode A  
b. ATCRBS Mode C/Mode S All-Call  
For each interrogation type vary the P1 - P3 spacing within the required acceptance range (§2.2.6.2.a) and verify that the reply ratio is at least 90%.  

  
Step 4 Pulse Position Tolerances, P4, ATCRBS/Mode S All-Calls (§2.2.6.2  a and c)
Use setup and signal levels as in Step 1 and interrogate with an ATCRBS Mode A/Mode S All-Call.  Vary the P3 - P4 spacing within the required acceptance range.  Determine conformance to requirements as in Step 3.  

## Step 5 Pulse Duration Tolerances, Mode A/C Interrogations (§2.2.6.3)

Using signal levels as in Step 1 above, interrogate with 

(1) 
Mode A, 
(2) 
Mode C.  For each interrogation type, 
- 
vary the P1 duration within the required acceptance range and record 
the minimum reply ratio; 
- 
vary the P1 duration to fall out of the permitted acceptance range and 
record the maximum reply ratio. 
Repeat test varying the P3 duration in the same manner.   
Note: Under environmental conditions, this procedure is only required when performing Temperature testing.  Also, when doing such testing, it is acceptable to vary duration of P1 and P3 at the same time if that is the capability of the Mode S Test Equipment being used.   

## Step 6 Pulse Duration Tolerance, Mode A/C/S All-Call Interrogations (§2.2.6.3)

Using signal levels as in Step 1 above, interrogate with: 

(1) 
Mode A/Mode S All-Call, 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

(2) 
Mode C/Mode S All-Call. For each interrogation type, 
- 
vary the P1 duration within the required acceptance range and record 
the minimum reply ratio; 
- 
vary the P1 duration to fall out of the permitted acceptance range and 
record the maximum reply ratio. 
Repeat the test, varying the P3 duration in the same manner.  Repeat the test, varying the P4 duration in the same manner.   

Note: Under environmental conditions, this procedure is only required when 
performing Temperature testing.  Also, when doing such testing, it is 
acceptable to vary duration of P1 and P3 at the same time if that is the 
capability of the Mode S Test Equipment being used.   

## Step 7 Short Pulse Rejection, Atcrbs-Type Interrogations (§2.2.6.3.C)

Use setup as in Step 1 and set signal input level to MTL for each of the following interrogation types:  

a. ATCRBS Mode A  
b. ATCRBS Mode C/Mode S All-Call  
For each interrogation type set P1 duration to 0.25 microseconds and verify that less than 10% replies are generated.  Repeat test for a P3 duration of 0.25 
microseconds.  Repeat tests at -60 dBm and -45 dBm input level.  

## Step 8 Sync Phase Reversal Position Tolerance (From P2) (§2.2.6.4)

Generate a standard Mode S-Only All-Call interrogation at MTL +3 dB.  Vary the spacing between the P6 sync phase reversal and either P2 or P6 as applicable by 200 nanoseconds from the nominal spacing.  Measure the range over which Mode S replies are received.  Repeat for P1 levels of -50 dBm and -21 dBm.  

## 2.3.2.6 Transponder Recovery And Desensitization (§2.2.7) Step 1 Atcrbs Single Pulse Desensitization And Recovery (§2.2.7.1.1 And §2.2.7.2)

Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-32.  Set the master test set to generate a single pulse not less than 0.7 microseconds wide at the standard ATCRBS interrogation rate and a power level equal to 50 dB above MTL.  Set the slave test set to generate an ATCRBS Mode A interrogation delayed 3 
microseconds from the trailing edge of the single pulse.  Determine the amplitude of the slave test set signal required to produce 90% reply efficiency.  Repeat for master to slave test set delay of 15 microseconds.  

  
Step 2 Recovery from a Mode S Interrogation Requiring No Reply (§2.2.7.2.1)
With the equipment connected as shown in Figure 2-32, set the master test set to generate a short Mode S surveillance interrogation with broadcast address.  Set the slave test set to generate an ATCRBS Mode A interrogation at a power level equal to 3 dB above MTL.  Measure the delay time between the master and the slave test sets necessary to elicit a reply efficiency of 90%. 

  
Step 3 Recovery from a Mode S Comm-C Interrogation (§2.2.7.2.1)
With equipment connected as shown in Figure 2-32, set the master test set to generate the initial segment of a properly addressed Comm-C interrogation at a signal level of -21 dBm.  Set the slave test set to generate an ATCRBS Mode A inter-rogation delayed 45 microseconds from the sync phase reversal of the master interrogation.  Determine the amplitude of the slave test signal required to produce 90% reply efficiency.  

Step 4 
Recovery from a Suppression Pair (§2.2.7.2.2) 
With equipment connected as shown in Figure 2-32, set the master test set to generate a P1 - P2 pulse pair at the ATCRBS standard interrogation rate and a power level equal to -35 dBm.  Set the slave test set to generate a Mode S-Only All-Call interrogation delayed 10 microseconds from the trailing edge of the P2 
pulse of the master test set interrogation.  Determine the amplitude of the slave test set signal required to produce 90% reply efficiency.    

## 2.3.2.7 Standard Interference Pulse (§2.2.8.2) And Mode S Sls (§2.2.5.2)

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-32.  Interrogate the transponder with an interfering pulse (duration: 0.8 microseconds, level 6 dB below P6) inserted at a position 
1.8 microseconds after the leading edge of P6 of a standard Mode S-Only All-Call.  The Mode S-Only All-Call **shall** be at a power level of -50 dBm.  Observe the reply ratio while slowly moving the interfering pulse from its initial position to the end of P6.  
Repeat the test for signal levels of -21, and -68 dBm. 

Repeat the test with an interference pulse level 3 dB below the P6 level.  
Insert the interfering pulse (now acting as P5) 0.85 microseconds after the leading edge of P6 and use a level 3 dB above the level of P6.  Use signal levels of MTL +3 dB and -21 
dBm.  Reply ratio in all cases should be 10% or less (§2.2.5.2.a).  
Reduce the level of P5 to a value 12 dB below the level of P6 and repeat the test at signal levels of MTL +3 dB and -21 dBm.  Reply ratio should be 99% or more (§2.2.5.2.b).

3. UF20 with PC=4; RR=12; DI=3; SD=9000; MA=90009000900090; 
AP=AAAAAA; 
a. Connect the transponder suppression output to a frequency counter (Fluke 
7220A or similar).   
b. Set the frequency counter resolution to 1 Hz. c. Set the transponder address to any valid address other than AAAAAA in 
order to prevent Mode-S reply.   
d. Turn off transponder squitter replies.   
e. Interrogate at a rate of 100 PRF between -81dBm and the Mode-S MTL with 
the interrogations shown above, using 1 dB steps.  In order to include the Mode-S MTL as the last test point, the last step may be smaller than 1 dB.

levels between -80.5 dBm and the Mode-S MTL, in 1 dB steps, with 
interrogation "2" above.  This offsets the test by 0.5 dB in order to ensure 
that the sensitivity to signal level is checked.

## Measurement Procedure:

Step 1 
SLS Decoding [§2.2.5.1.a (1) and (3), §2.2.5.1.b and §2.2.8.5] 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-32.  Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode A interrogation including a P2 pulse.  RF signal level to be at MTL +3 dB; P2 level = P1 level.  As the P1 - P2 spacing is varied over 1.0 to 
3.0 microseconds, determine the reply efficiency.  Adjust the P1 - P2 spacing to the nominal value and insert a 0.8 microsecond pulse (equal in amplitude to P1 
and P2) such that it occurs 8 microseconds before P2.  Repeat with a 
21-microsecond spacing between the inserted pulse and P2.  Verify that the reply ratio is no more than 1 percent.   

Step 2 
SLS Dynamic Range [§2.2.5.1.a (2) and §2.2.5.1.c] 
Repeat Step 1 at RF signal levels: -60 dBm, -40 dBm and -21 dBm. 

Step 3 
SLS Pulse Ratio (§2.2.5.1.b) 
Repeat Step 1 at RF signal levels between MTL +3 dB, (-60 dBm, -40 dBm and 
-21 dBm).  Set P2 level 9 dB below P1 level. 

Step 4 
SLS Pulse Ratio (§2.2.5.1 a and b) 
Repeat Steps 1, 2 and 3 with an ATCRBS Mode A/Mode S All-Call interrogation 
(retaining the 8-microsecond spacing between P1 and P3, and add P4). 

Step 5 
Suppression Duration [§2.2.5.1.d (l)] 
Interrogate the transponder at 450 interrogations per second with a P1 - P2 pulse pair, followed after 50 microseconds by a P1 - P3 (Mode A, 8 microseconds) 
pulse pair.  The interrogation level **shall** be set at -24 dBm, reply code selection is not consequential.  Reduce the spacing of the P1 - P3 pair with respect to the P1 
- P2 pair until the transponder replies to no more than 1% of the interrogations.  
The time interval between the leading edges of P2 and P1 (of the P1 - P3 pair) is the suppression duration S(8).   
Repeat above procedure using Mode C (21-microsecond spacing) for the P1 - P3 
pair.  The result will be suppression duration S(21). 

## Step 6 Suppression Reinitiation [§2.2.5.1.D (3)]

Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-32.  With an interrogation rate of 
450 interrogations per second, generate a "first" P1 - P2 pair followed by a 
"second" P1 - P2 pair such that the spacing between P2 of the first pair and P1 of the second pair is S(8) +2 microseconds.  Generate a "third" pair, P1 - P3, Mode A to follow the second pair after 50 microseconds.  All pulse levels **shall** be set to -24 dBm; reply code is inconsequential.  Reduce the spacing of the P1 - P3 pair in respect to the P1 - P2 pairs and determine suppression duration S(8) as in Step 
4.  Repeat the test using Mode C spacing for the P1 - P3 pair and determine suppression duration S(21).   

Step 7 
Recovery After Suppression [§2.2.5.1.d (4) 
Repeat Step 5 using the following signal levels: P1 - P2 pair: -30 dBm; P1 - P3 
pair: MTL.  A reply efficiency of 90 percent should be observed when the P2 
(suppression) P1 (interrogation) spacing is no more than one microsecond greater than S(8, 21) determined in previous steps. 

Step 8 
Low Signal Level Characteristics (§2.2.5.1.c) 
Interrogate the transponder with a Mode A interrogation, including a P2 pulse 
(P2=P1 level).  Vary the signal level from MTL to MTL +3 dB.  Verify that the reply ratio does not exceed 10%. 

Step 9 
Short Duration P2 (§2.2.5.1.b.(3)) 
Interrogate the transponder with a Mode A interrogation with: 
(1)  P2 level = P1 level

ATCRBS Single Pulse Desensitization and Recovery (§2.2.7.1.1 and §2.2.7.2) 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-32.  Set the master test set to generate a single pulse not less than 0.7 microseconds wide at the standard ATCRBS interrogation rate and a power level equal to 50 dB above MTL.  Set the slave test set to generate an ATCRBS Mode A interrogation delayed three (3) microseconds from the trailing edge of the single pulse.  Determine the amplitude of the slave test set signal required to produce 90 percent reply efficiency. Repeat for master to slave test set delays of 6, 10 and 15 microseconds. 

Note: Steps 2 through 7 require replacement of one of the ATC test sets by a Mode S transponder test set. 

Step 2 
Recovery from a Mode S Interrogation Requiring No Reply (§2.2.7.2.1) 
With the equipment connected as shown in Figure 2-32, set the master test set to generate a short Mode S surveillance interrogation with broadcast address.  Set the slave test set to generate an ATCRBS Mode A interrogation at a power level equal to 3 dB above MTL.  Measure the delay time between the master and the slave test sets necessary to elicit a reply efficiency of 90%. 

Step 3 
Recovery from a Mode S Comm-C Interrogation (§2.2.7.2.1) 
With equipment connected as shown in Figure 2-32, set the master set to generate the initial segment of a properly addressed Comm-C interrogation at a signal level of -21 dBm.  Set the slave test set to generate an ATCRBS Mode A interrogation delayed 45 microseconds from the sync phase reversal of the master interrogation.  Determine the amplitude of the slave test signal required to produce 90 percent reply efficiency. 

Step 4 
Recovery from a Suppression Pair or ATCRBS-Only All-Calls or Unaccepted ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call (§2.2.7.2.2 and §2.2.7.2.4) 
With equipment connected as shown in Figure 2-32, set the master test set to generate a P1 - P2 pulse pair at the ATCRBS standard interrogation rate and a power level equal to -35 dBm.  Set the slave test set to generate a Mode S-Only All-Call interrogation delayed 10 microseconds from the trailing edge of the P2 
pulse of the master test set interrogation.  Determine the amplitude of the slave test set signal required to produce 90% reply efficiency.   
Repeat the procedure with an ATCRBS-Only All-Call in place of the suppression pair.  Set the Mode S-Only All-Call from the slave test set delayed 10 
microseconds from the trailing edge of the P4 pulse of the master test set interrogation. Lock out transponder to All-Calls (non-selective) and repeat procedure with ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations in place of the suppression pair.  Set the II field of the Mode S-Only All-Call to a value other than ZERO (0) so that it will not be affected by the lock-out condition.

## Measurement Procedure:

With the equipment connected as shown in Figure 2-32, interrogate the transponder with the standard Mode S-Only All-Call interrogation at a signal level of -50 dBm and follow Steps l through 4 below. 

Step 1 
Low Level Asynchronous Interference (§2.2.8.1) 
Insert a 0.8-microsecond wide pulse [defined in §
2.4.1.i (ll)] with amplitude 12 
dB below P1 of the standard Mode S-Only All Call at a repetition rate of 10000 
Hz.  Measure reply ratio.  Repeat the test for all signal levels between -65 and -21 dBm in 5-dB increments.   
Note: Take care to avoid synchronization of the 10000 Hz rate with the Mode S 
standard rate. 

Step 2 
Standard Interference Pulse (§2.2.8.2) and Mode S SLS (§2.2.5.2) 
Insert the interfering pulse (duration: 0.8 microsecond, level 6 dB below P6) at a position l.8 microseconds after the leading edge of P6 of a standard Mode S-Only All-Call. 

Observe the reply ratio while slowly moving the interfering pulse from its initial position to the end of P6.  Repeat the test for all signal levels between -68 and 
-21 dBm in 5-dB increments.   
Repeat the test with an interference pulse level 3 dB below the P6 level. 

Insert the interfering pulse (now acting as P5) 0.85 microseconds after the leading edge of P6 and use a level 3 dB above the level of P6.  Use signal levels between MTL +3 dB and -21 dBm in 5-dB increments.  Reply ratio in all cases should be 
10 percent or less (§2.2.5.2.a). 

Reduce level of P5 to a value 12 dB below the level of P6 and repeat the test at signal levels from MTL +3 dB to -21 dBm in 5-dB increments.  Reply ratio should be 99 percent or more (§2.2.5.2.b).   

## Step 3 Pulse Pair Interference (§2.2.8.3)

2.4.1.i(11)] 
with amplitude 9 dB below P1 of the standard Mode S-Only All-Call, at a position such that the leading edge of the pulse pair occurs 0.25 microseconds after the leading edge of P1. 

Record the reply ratio while moving the interfering pulse pair in 0.25 microsecond steps from its initial position to a position 0.25 microseconds after the falling edge of P6.  Determine the average reply efficiency from the recorded values. 

Repeat the test for all input levels between –68 dBm and –21 dBm in 5-dB 
increments. 

Step 4 
DME and JTIDS Interference Tests (§2.2.8.4)

pulses per second, with an amplitude of -80 dBm and a frequency of 1030 MHz. 

Step 5 Standard Interference Pulse Positioned at Mode A or Mode C Spacing before P2 
of a P1-P2 Suppression Pair (§2.2.8.2 and §2.2.8.5) 
Note:
 The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that when the interference 
pulse combines with the P2 pulse of the P1-P2 suppression pair in a 
manner that results in a simultaneous detection of a Mode A/C interrogation and a Suppression Pair, that the transponder goes into suppression and does not reply.  
(1) Mode A 
Insert standard interfering pulse 8 µs before, and at the same signal level as, 
the P2 pulse of a standard P1-P2 Suppression pair. 
Verify that the transponder does not reply. 
(2) Mode C 
Insert standard interfering pulse 21 µs before, and at the same signal level as, 
the P2 pulse of a standard P1-P2 Suppression pair. 
Verify that the transponder does not reply. 
Step 6 Standard Interference Pulse Positioned at Mode A or Mode C Spacing before P1 
of a Mode S Interrogation (§2.2.6.1.2.b) 
Note:
 The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that when the interference 
pulse combines with the P1 pulse of the P1-P2 pair of a Mode S 
interrogation, that the transponder does not reply with an ATCRBS 
reply. 
(1) Mode A 
Insert standard interfering pulse 8 µs before, and at the same signal level as, the P1 pulse of a standard Mode S Only All-Call interrogation. 
Verify that the transponder does not reply with an ATCRBS reply. 
(2) Mode C 
Insert standard interfering pulse 21 µs before, and at the same signal level as, the P1 pulse of a standard Mode S Only All-Call interrogation.

Note:
 In both case (1) and (2), transponders that are designed to continue 
processing of the Mode-S interrogation after discarding the Mode 
A/C Only All-Call may reply to the Mode-S interrogation.     
Step 7 Standard Interference Pulse Positioned at Mode A or Mode C Spacing before P2 
of a Mode S Interrogation (§2.2.5.1.d.(5)) 
Note:
 The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that when the interference 
pulse combines with the P2 pulse of the P1-P2 pair of a Mode S 
interrogation, that the transponder suppresses replies to ATCRBS interrogations but replies to the Mode S interrogations. 
(1) Mode A 
Insert standard interfering pulse 8 µs before, and at the same signal level as, 
the P2 pulse of a standard Mode S Only All-Call interrogation. 
Verify that the transponder replies to the Mode S Only All-Call interrogation. 
(2) Mode C 
Insert standard interfering pulse 21 µs before, and at the same signal level as, 
the P2 pulse of a standard Mode S Only All-Call interrogation. 
Verify that the transponder replies to the Mode S Only All-Call interrogation. 
Step 8 Standard Interference Pulse Positioned at Mode C Spacing before P4 of a Mode 
A Only All-Call Interrogation (§2.2.18.2.2.k) 
Note:
 The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that when the interference 
pulse combines with the P4 pulse of the P1-P3-P4 Mode A Only All-Call 
interrogation, that the transponder does not reply. 
Insert standard interfering pulse 21 µs before, and at the same signal level as, the 
P4 pulse of a Mode A Only All-Call interrogation. 
Verify that the transponder does not reply. 
Step 9 
Response in the Presence of CW Interference (§2.2.8.6) 
Interrogate the transponder with standard ATCRBS Mode A or Mode C interrogations having a signal level of –50 dBm.   
Insert non-coherent CW interference at a frequency of 1030 ±0.2 MHz and at signal levels of -70 dBm. Verify that the transponder continues to reply to at least 90 percent of all interrogations.   
Repeat the procedure using Mode S UF = 4, 5, 20 or 21 interrogations.   

Step 10 
Compatibility with TCAS ATCRBS Surveillance (§2.2.8.7) 
a. Interrogate the transponder with a Mode A interrogation, having P1 at MTL.  
Inject an S1 pulse ahead of a P1 pulse at MTL -6 dB.  Verify at least 90% 
reply rate efficiency.

Step 1 Single Channel Test (§2.2.12.3 and §2.2.12.4)
When measuring channel A and B parameters take care that any cables used for measurements are of equal length and equal loss.  Interrogate channel A only, while monitoring channel A and B.  At signal level MTL +3 dB use the following types of interrogations and record the listed observations:  

ATCRBS Mode A. ATCRBS Mode C. ATCRBS Mode A/Mode S All-Call. ATCRBS Mode C-only All-Call. Mode S formats UF=4, 11, and if so equipped, 21. 

For signal levels of -50 dBm and -21 dBm use an ATCRBS Mode C and a Mode S format of UF=4 types of interrogations and record the listed observations. Observe: 
Correct reply ratio.  
Correct reply channel. Power level of replies from channel A (§2.2.12.3).  
Power level of replies from channel B (§2.2.12.3).  
Record:
 Reply delay for each interrogation signal type and for the signal levels as specified. Repeat the above test reversing channels. Compare records of reply delays for conformance with §2.2.12.4.  
  

## Step 2 Selection Test (§2.2.12.1)

Synchronize the interrogations to channels A and B so that they are 0.125 +0.00/-0.04 microseconds apart where channel A is first.  
Use an ATCRBS Mode C and a Mode S UF=4 to interrogate at a power level on channel A of MTL and a power level on channel B of MTL +3 dB. Observe that 90 percent of the replies are on channel B. Use an ATCRBS Mode C and a Mode S UF=4 to interrogate at a power level on channel A of MTL +3 dB and a power level on channel B of MTL. Observe that 90 percent of the replies are on channel A. Synchronize the interrogations to channels A and B so that they are 0.125 +0.00/-0.04 microseconds apart where channel B is first. Use an ATCRBS Mode C and a Mode S UF=4 to interrogate at a power level on channel A of MTL and a power level on channel B of MTL +3 dB. Observe that 90 percent of the replies are on channel B. Use an ATCRBS Mode C and a Mode S UF=4 to interrogate at a power level on channel A of MTL +3 dB and a power level on channel B of MTL. Observe that 90 percent of the replies are on channel A.  

## Step 3 Delay-Selection Test (§2.2.12.2)

Synchronize the interrogations to channels A and B so that they are 0.375 +.040/-0.00 microseconds apart where channel A is first.  
Use an ATCRBS Mode C and a Mode S UF=4 to interrogate at a power level on channel A of MTL +3 and a power level on channel B of -50 dBm.  
Observe that 90 percent of the replies are on channel A. Synchronize the interrogations to channels A and B so that they are 0.375 +0.040/-0.00 microseconds apart where channel B is first. Use an ATCRBS Mode C and a Mode S UF=4 to interrogate at a power level on channel A of -50 dBm and a power level on channel B of MTL +3.  
Observe that 90 percent of the replies are on channel B.  

  

## Step 4 Squitter Antenna Selection (§2.2.12.5)

Activate the transponder and determine that squitter transmissions occur alternately from the two antennas at the prescribed rate. 

## 2.4.2.12 Data Handling And Interfaces (§2.2.13)

The procedures outlined in this paragraph are intended only to test "data in" and "data out" requirements of the transponder.  They do not constitute tests of the transponder's digital logic and protocols.  Some tests correspond to requirements of optional features, and therefore are not applicable to all transponders. 

## 2.4.2.12.1 Fixed Direct Data (§2.2.13.1.1) Equipment Required:

Mode S Transponder Test Set (§
2.4.1.i). 

Measurement Procedure: 
With the transponder RF port connected to the RF port of the Mode S transponder test set, perform the following test sequences. 

Step 1 
Mode S All-Call Addresses [§2.2.13.1.1.a (l)] 
Interrogate the transponder with a Mode S-Only All-Call interrogation with PR, IC and CL Fields set to 0.  Verify that the AA field of the transponder reply reflects the address which has been set into the transponder.  Twenty-four different addresses consisting of 23 ZEROs and a single ONE **shall** be tested. 

Step 2 
Mode S Discrete Address [§2.2.13.1.1.a (2)] 
Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode S surveillance-altitude interrogation (UF=4) with the PC, RR, DI and SD fields set to 0 and an address consisting of ONE followed by 23 ZEROs.  Verify that the transponder replies with appropriate bits set in the AP field when a like address is set into the transponder, and will not respond when each of the other combination of 23 ZEROs and a single ONE are entered as addresses. 

Step 3 
Maximum Airspeed (§2.2.13.1.1.b) 
Interrogate the transponder with a short special surveillance interrogation (UF=0) with the AQ field set to 1.  Verify that the RI field of the transponder reply corresponds to the airspeed code set into the transponder as each of the seven possible airspeed codes is used. 

Step 4

2.6.6.3.a and §2.6.6.3.b.   
Perform the test procedure provided in §

  
Step 5  Invalid AA
a. Put the transponder in the Power Off Condition and set the AA to ALL 
ZEROs.  Turn on the transponder and verify that a transponder error condition is set and a failure is declared. Repeat test "a" with the AA set to ALL ONEs.   
 
Note:
 In both cases, the transponder will normally either go into Standby 
State, revert to a pure Mode A/C transponder, or return to the Power Off Condition.   
 
b. Put the transponder in the Power On Condition with an AA set to ONE (1) 
for the first bit and ZEROs for all other bits.  Verify that the transponder replies to all properly addressed interrogations.   
 
Without putting the transponder in Power Off Condition, change the AA to ALL ZEROs.  Verify that the transponder generates a diagnostic error message for maintenance, and that it keeps operating using the initial AA read during the power-on initialization process (first bit set to ONE (1) and all other bits set to ZEROs).   

 
c. Repeat "b" with the remaining twenty-three different transponder addresses 
each consisting of 23 ZEROs (0) and a single ONE (1).   
 
d. Repeat tests "b" and "c" with the AA set to ALL ONEs, instead of ALL 
ZEROs.

source in feet quantized to greater than 25 feet to the transponder which should result in setting each of the AC field bits of the reply, one at a time. 
d. Verify that the correct bits are transmitted in the AC field of the reply with 
the Q bit set to ZERO (0) and the M bit set to ZERO (0). 
e. With the ALT switch ON, provide altitude code inputs from an altitude

the Q bit set to ONE (1) and the M bit set to ZERO (0). 
g. With the ALT switch ON, provide altitude code inputs from an altitude 
source quantized to 25 feet, or less, to the transponder.  Verify that the altitude report is correct when the input indicates pressure altitudes of between 50188 feet and 126700 feet, which should result in setting each of the AC field bits of the reply. 
h. Verify that the correct bits are transmitted in the AC field of the reply with 
the Q bit set to ZERO (0) to indicate a report to 100 feet quantization and the M bit set to ZERO (0). 
i. 
Repeat Step 3 (1) to (8) with the input indicating metric input, if available, and verify that the M bit is set to ONE (1) in the AC field of all replies. 
Verify that the AC field is ALL ZEROs when the ALT switch is set to "OFF." Set the input altitude data to invalid and verify that the AC field is ALL ZEROs. 

## Step 4 Identification Code (Mode S) (§2.2.13.1.2.B)

With the equipment connected as in Step 3, interrogate the transponder with a standard surveillance-identity interrogation (UF=5) with PC, RR, DI and SD fields set to ZERO (0) and the address the same as that provided to the transponder.  Using the identity codes specified in Step 2, verify that the proper bit patterns exist in the ID field of the reply. 

## Step 5 Flight Status And Vertical Status (§2.2.13.1.2.C)

Interrogate with UF=0 and UF=16 and verify that the VS field is a ONE (1) when the "on-the-ground port" of the transponder is set to the on-the-ground condition.  
Also, verify that the VS field is a ZERO (0) otherwise. 

Interrogate with formats UF=4, 5, 20, 21 and verify that the transponder follows the protocol of §2.2.14.4.15, and Figure 2-17.

Step l 
Uplink Interface Information Content (§2.2.13.3.1 a and e) 
Interrogate the transponder with valid Mode S interrogations of all uplink formats which the transponder is designed to accept, including broadcast interrogations.  Verify that all fields (possibly excluding AP) of the interrogations are passed correctly through the transponder and except for UF=0, 11, 16, and 24 
(when it is a request for a downlink ELM), appear at the uplink interface.  Make additional valid interrogations with the uplink formats (excluding UF=11 and UF=24) and field content randomly chosen.  Verify proper output of the uplink interface.  Verify that broadcast interrogations are identified as such, either by AP content or by a special purpose code.   

Step 2 
Uplink Interface, "No-Storage Design" (§2.2.13.3.1.b) 
Interrogate the transponder with valid Mode S interrogations of all uplink formats which the transponder is designed to accept.  Verify that all data appear correctly at the uplink interface prior to the start of the transponder reply. 

Step 3 
Uplink Interface, "Storage Design" Acceptance Rate (§2.2.13.3.1.c) 
Interrogate the transponder with valid Mode S interrogations (both short and long) at the rates and time periods specified in §
2.2.3.4.2.  Verify that all data appear correctly at the uplink interface.   

  
Step 4 Uplink Interface, Non-acceptance (§2.2.13.3.1.d)
Interrogate the transponder with valid long Mode S interrogations at a rate exceeding the one specified in §
2.2.3.4.2 for the longest time period.  Verify that the transponder does not accept interrogations after the rate for which the transponder is designed has been exceeded.  Also, verify that all data correctly appear at the uplink interface for all accepted interrogations. 

Note: With the uplink interface disconnected, the transponder may, or may not, reply to valid long Mode S interrogations.   

Step 5 
Downlink Interface, Information Content (§2.2.13.3.2.a) 
Insert an all ONEs input.  Interrogate the transponder with all uplink formats that it is designed to accept (one interrogation of each format, RR=16 for long interrogations).  Verify that all bits in the transponder replies, not set by transponder protocol requirements, are ONE.  Verify that all fields in the replies, set by transponder protocol, have the correct value.   
Repeat this procedure with MB field data context 55 5555 5555 5555.   

Step 6 
Downlink Interface, "No-Storage Design" (§2.2.13.3.2.b) 
Insert an all ONEs input.  Interrogate the transponder with a standard Comm-A, altitude interrogation.  Verify that data are inserted into the transponder at the proper time, and that the transponder reply contains the proper data. 

Step 7 
Downlink Interface, "Storage Design" Buffer Rate, Buffer Function 
(§2.2.13.3.2.c) 
Set up a sequence of Comm-B replies with the value of the last 48 bits of MB of each reply set to the number of the reply in the sequence (e.g., MB=1 for first reply).  Interrogate the transponder with a standard Comm-A, altitude interrogation at the rates specified for long interrogations in §2.2.3.4.  Verify that the replies include the proper data in the MB field.  Repeat with RR equal to all valid codes from 16 through 18.   
Step 8 
Downlink Interface, Unavailable Data (§2.2.13.3.2.e) 
Disconnect all inputs from the transponder's downlink interface port.  Interrogate the transponder with a standard Comm-A, altitude interrogation containing RR=16.  Verify that the reply contains ALL ZEROs in the MB field.  Repeat with all RR codes from 17 through 31, noting that: 

- 
For RR code 17, bits of the MB field of the reply excluding bits 1-8, 24, 26- 
36 are set to ZEROs (bits 1-8, 24, 26- 36 are or may eventually be set by the transponder itself when no interface is available). 
- 
For RR code 18, the reply contains all ZEROs excluding bits 1 - 8, in the 
MB field if the aircraft identification consists of variable direct data, or the tail number if the aircraft identification consists of fixed direct data. 
- 
For RR code 19, bits 9-56 of the MB field of the reply are set to ZEROs. 
- 
For RR codes 20 through 31, verify that the reply contains ALL ZEROs in the MB field.

Mode S Transponder Test Set. 

Transponder ELM Data Link Device. Measurement Procedure: 
Connect the transponder RF port to the RF port of the Mode S transponder test set. Connect the Mode S transponder test set of the ELM data link device to the ELM interface port of the transponder and perform the following sequences. 

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## Step 1

ELM Uplink Interface, Data Rate (§2.2.20.1.4) 
Interrogate the transponder with four 16-segment uplink ELMs (each segment having unique coding, interrogations spaced 50 microseconds apart, and a new 16-segment ELM starting 5 milliseconds after the previous ELM).  After 4 
seconds for transponders equipped for standard ELM operation or after 1 second for transponders equipped for enhanced uplink ELM operation, interrogate the transponder with another set of four 16-segment ELMs.  Verify that the correct data appears at the ELM interface no later than one second after completion of the corresponding uplink ELM for both interrogation sequences.  Verify that the interface reports an interrogator identity code of ZERO. 

  
Step 2 ELM Uplink Interface, Interrogator Identification (§2.2.20.1.2)
Repeat the procedures of Step 1 using the multisite protocol.  Use different Interrogator Identifier codes and verify that they are correctly reported at the interface. 

Step 3 
ELM Downlink Interface, Data Rate (§2.2.20.2.4 and §2.2.3.5) 
Set up a downlink ELM which conforms to the maximum capability of the transponder (each segment with unique coding) on the Mode S transponder test set or ELM data link device.  Interrogate the transponder with a Comm-C 
(UF=24) with RC=3 and SRS= "ALL ONEs."  Verify that all segments are properly transmitted 136 ±1 microseconds apart. 

 

## 2.4.2.12.5 Interface Integrity Testing (§2.2.13.2.2)

Compliance with this requirement **shall** be demonstrated either by direct test in a simulated operational environment or by analysis based on the known characteristics of proven interface techniques. 

 

## 2.4.2.12.6 Comm-B Downlink Interface, Message Cancellation (§2.2.20.2.2)

  

## Step 1 Cancellation Before Transmission

Insert a Comm-B message into the downlink interface for transmission.  
Interrogate the transponder with UF=4, 5, 20 and 21 and verify that the DR code in its replies is set to ONE (1).  Cancel the message via the interface, interrogate again and verify that the DR code is now not ONE (1). 

  
Step 2 Cancellation After Transmission
Insert message as in Step 1, interrogate and extract message as in §
2.2.19.1.12.4, using RR=16.  Cancel message via the interface, interrogate again to verify that that DR is now not ONE (1).   

  
Step 3 Cancellation in Multisite Environment
Prepare two messages of differing content, m1 and m2, for insertion into the interface.  Insert m1 as in Step 1 and extract using the multisite protocol (RR=16, DI=1, IIS>0, MBS=1).  Cancel m1 via the interface and verify that DR is not 1 and that the UM field does not show a Comm-B reservation.  After that verification, and within less than 15 seconds, insert m2 into the interface and extract using the multisite protocol with different IIS.  Verify that the second message has been extracted and close out the transaction using DI=1, IIS as for m2, MBS=2 (see §
2.2.19.2.3.3).  Verify that DR is not 1 and that the UM field does not show a Comm-B reservation. 

Note: This two-message sequence is needed to verify that a complete cancellation has been achieved by way of the interface. 

## Step 4 Cancellation Within A Queue

If the interface is designed to store more than one message in the transponder, where one message is ready to be transmitted and other messages are queued for subsequent transmission, the following test must be performed. Insert the maximum number of messages into the transponder and cancel one of the messages that is not scheduled for immediate transmission.  Extract all messages and verify that the cancelled message does not appear.  Repeat for each possible message location in the queue.  

## 2.4.2.12.7 Downlink Elm Interface, Message Cancellation (§2.2.20.2.2)

  

## Step 1 Cancellation Before Transmission

Insert an ELM message occupying as many segments as the transponder will permit into the downlink interface for transmission.  Interrogate the transponder with UF=4, 5, 20 and 21 and verify that the DR code in its replies is larger than 16 and reflects the number of inserted segments correctly.  Cancel the message via the interface, interrogate again, and verify that the DR code is now not larger than 16.  

  
Step 2 Cancellation After Transmission
Insert message as in Step 1, interrogate and extract message as in §
2.2.20.2.1.1.2, using RC=3.  Cancel message via the interface, interrogate again to verify that DR is now not larger than 16.

## 2.5 Test Procedures For The Surveillance And Communications Protocols 2.5.1 Introduction

This subsection includes tests to verify the transponder's processing functions.  (The tests described in Subsection §2.4 verify transponder performance as a receiver and transmitter of signals.)  The nature of these processing tests is such that some means of automatically controlling, sequencing and evaluating the tests is necessary if the tests are to be practical.  It is assumed that an automatic capability is available for executing these tests.  
The only exception is a technique for manual testing of Mode S parity, which is included as a simple procedure for verifying the proper implementation of the parity codes. 

## Transponder States:

Upon receipt of an interrogation, the action of a Mode S transponder is dependent upon the interrogation type and format, and the "state" of the transponder at the time of receipt. The address of the interrogation must be correct, the format must be one the transponder is equipped to receive, and the reply format requested must be within the capability of the transponder.  If all of the above criteria are met, and if the transponder is not locked out to the interrogator identity, the interrogation will be accepted.  The content of the reply will depend not only on the content of the interrogation but also on control inputs to the transponder, such as Alert and SPI, and on data existing at the transponder interfaces such as the altitude code and waiting messages. 

The overall state of a Level 1 transponder is determined by the status of 82 timers: Suppression, Lockout, Alert, SPI, and 78 selective lockout timers. Data link transponders have additional possible states defined by data link reservation timers and the condition of link protocol status registers. 

A Level 1 transponder could receive 256 ≈ 7x1016 different interrogation patterns, of which about 33 million must be accepted because they are of the correct address and format.  Of these, about 200 require that a correct reply, as specified in Subsection §2.2 
of this document, be returned.  The corresponding numbers for data link transponders are proportionally larger. Certain interrogation patterns are illogical and should never be transmitted by an interrogator.  It is also physically impossible for certain combinations of timer and register conditions to occur simultaneously in a correctly functioning transponder.  
However, if any illogical interrogation pattern is inadvertently transmitted, the transponder must not respond inappropriately or transition to an improper state.  Thus, tests are included to subject the transponder to specific illogical interrogation patterns to verify that it reacts as specified in Subsection §2.2. 

## Logic Tests:

Many of the specifications of Subsection §
2.2 involve "sufficient condition" logic.  That is, taken in the context of the entire document, the statement "On receipt of PC=1 the transponder **shall** be locked out," means: "If and only if PC=1, the transponder **shall** be locked out." The tests then must verify that PC=1 causes the lockout state, and also that other signals (some of which may include other messages in the same location used for the PC field) do not cause this state. 

Exhaustive tests would have to combine all possible interrogation patterns with all possible transponder states; verify that the transponder takes the specified action for specified combinations of interrogation patterns and transponder states; and verify that it takes no action for all other combinations. The number of possible state-pattern combinations makes it impossible to perform exhaustive tests within a reasonable time period.  A practical test procedure separates required tests into two categories: Positive tests and negative tests. 

Positive tests verify that the transponder acts as required by the specifications in Subsection §2.2 and the accompanying flowcharts.  For example, PC=1 received in the correct format must cause lockout for the specified time. Negative tests verify that the transponder does not react to unspecified codes or patterns.  
For example PC=1 must not cause lockout. 

The positive tests included are exhaustive in the sense that every action specified in Subsection §2.2 is tested.  Negative tests have been chosen according to the seriousness of a possible malfunction.  For example, negative tests of the lockout protocol are important because a malfunction can make the transponder invisible to a sensor.  Thus, all PC codes are tested. 

## Tests For Data Flow:

Data flow must also be verified.  However, totally exhaustive testing of data flow is not practical.  Tests for data flow cannot be clearly classified as positive or negative.  They are designed such that all connections between input and transponder action are verified. The procedures are intended to identify the most probable failure modes. Accuracy of data transfer by the transponder in either direction is verified by these tests. That is, message patterns entering must be identical with message patterns leaving the transponder. 

## Scope Of Tests:

The tests will verify that the functions required by the text in Subsection §
2.2 are carried out regardless of the design approach. 

## 2.5.2 Required Test Equipment

The test equipment described here is required for all procedures except Procedure #1. 

## 2.5.2.1 Automatic Test Controller

The type of interrogations to be made (ATCRBS A, C; ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call; ATCRBS-Only All-Call; Mode S formats). 
(2) 
The value (ONE or ZERO) for each bit in a Mode S interrogation, excluding the bits in the AP field. 
(3) 
The value (ONE or ZERO) for each bit of the Mode S address. 
(4) 
The timing of the interrogation. 
f. 
Generate interrogation signal levels of -60 and 0 dBm. 
 

## 2.5.2.3 Reply Receiver

The reply receiver **shall**: 

a. 
Accept all ATCRBS replies and pass on their content to the controller. 
b. 
Accept all Mode S replies, carry out the decoding function for AP or PI (Figure 2-11), and pass on the reply content and the decoded address or the interrogator identity to the controller. 
 

## 2.5.2.4 Interface Adapter

The interface adapter **shall** be able to transfer information content between all applicable interfaces and the controller in either direction. 

Some tests require the use of equipment that simulates certain functions of a TCAS unit.  
The simulation equipment should enable the transponder to send and receive data on the TCAS/transponder interface using appropriate interface protocols and response times appropriate for an actual TCAS operating with the TCAS/transponder interface.  The simulation equipment should allow specific bit configurations to be sent to the transponder and allow for information received from the transponder to be examined. 

Note:

 Interface designs are not standardized, and therefore can range from one 
universal interface to several separate interfaces for direct and indirect data. Interfaces for some functions (4096, SPI, etc.) may not be electrically accessible and would thus require manual setting. 
 

## 2.5.3 Selection And Use Of The Test Procedures Selection

a. 
Given the range of possible transponder designs and capabilities, the test procedures of §
2.5.4 must be chosen to match the transponder.  Test procedures are included for: 

 

| Transponder                    | Reference    | Procedures                |
|--------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Minimum Data Link Transponder  | §2.2.19.1    | 2 to 23&29, excluding 18A |
| Data Link ELM-C Transponder    | §2.2.20.1.1  | 2 to 25&29, excluding 18A |
| Data Link ELM-C/D Transponder  | §2.2.20.2.1  | 2 to 29, excluding 18A    |
| Enhanced Data Link Transponder | §2.2.21      | 2 to 29, excluding 18     |
| TCAS Compatible Transponder    | §2.2.22      | 30 to 39                  |

 
The Error Protection Test (Procedure #1) is used to verify the correct operation of the error protection circuitry of the test equipment and the transponder.  Its initial application is required for AP and PI.     

b. 
Use 
The test procedures in §
2.5.4 constitute a detailed set of program instructions for the test controller. 

The procedures describe a set of interrogation sequences and replies that must be carried out to verify one specific operation, protocol or action of the transponder. The number of required transactions (interrogation-reply pairs) may vary depending on the transponder design (for example, for diversity transponders, all tests must be applied to both channels) and the details of the controller instructions.  The number of verifications is fixed for each transponder design. Since each procedure sequence tests only one specific transponder action, it is possible to combine transactions such that more than one transponder action is tested.  For example, while interrogation-reply protocols are being verified, the content of the interrogations can also be checked to verify reply content. 

It is not required that the described sequences follow consecutively.  Transactions of one sequence may be used to bring the transponder into a state required for another sequence.  Other tests may be executed while waiting for timer runout. 

The transponder is required to reply to at least 99% of valid interrogations in the Mode S format and to at least 90% in the ATCRBS format.  Reinterrogation capability must be provided for instances of non-reply.  Given the large number of transactions carried out during these tests, a valid reason for rejection would be a reply failure rate, cumulatively recorded, that exceeds the specified rate. 

## 2.5.4 Test Procedures 2.5.4.1 Procedure #1: Error Protection 2.5.4.1.1 Procedure #1: Error Protection, Ap And Pi Fields (§2.2.18.2.1.C)

The correct function of the two coding-parity processes in the transponder can be automatically verified by a hardware circuit in the test generator, designed according to Figure 2-11.  The test set (signal generator/analyzer) carries out the correct encoding process.  A transponder will recognize the correct address and will in turn correctly generate the AP and PI fields. It is also possible to observe the function of the transponder's and test set's error protection circuits if the AP pattern resulting from known text and address is known.  
However, since the correct values of 24 bits must be verified from an oscilloscope presentation, the deciphering of the phase reversals in the uplink P6 or the relative pulse positions in the downlink becomes laborious. 

Patterns for the AP field exist that are easily distinguished in an oscilloscope presentation.  Combinations of text (the bit stream before the AP or PI fields) and address exist for which AP and PI consist of ALL ZEROs or of another easily recognizable and verifiable pattern.  They are presented here.   

## Equipment Required:

Test set capable of generating Mode S interrogations at a 0 dBm power level. 

DPSK modulation detector.  Use a simple diode detector for manual determination of the location of phase reversals when the Mode S signal test generator is using hard keying with amplitude drop.   
Note:
 Such a method is only possible for test purposes as some transmitters can generate the phase reversal using IQ modulator with little or no amplitude drop.   
Wide-band oscilloscope (HP1710B, or equivalent). 

## Verification Of Transponder'S Downlink Encoding Circuit For Pi

At the transponder's address setting interface, set addresses shown in the following list, depending on the internal CA report: 

If CA=0, set AA to 03 13 D4 hex. 

If CA=4, set AA to 03 2B E2 hex. 

If CA=5, set AA to FC DF EB hex. 

If CA=6, set AA to 03 37 F9 hex. 

If CA=7, set AA to FC C3 F0 hex. 

Interrogate with the ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call and verify that in the reply PI is ALL ZEROs. 

Note: This test verifies the transponder's downlink encoder without relying on the correct operation of the Mode S test set.   

## Verification Of Test Set Error Protection Circuits

When the Mode S signal generator uses a hard keying method to generate phase reversal resulting in amplitude drop, the following method can be used to verify the Test Set Error Protection circuit.   
Connect the diode detector and oscilloscope to the RF output of the test set and generate a signal strong enough to register on the oscilloscope.  Synchronize with the test set interrogation rate and observe the shape of the resulting P6 pulse.  The phase transitions within P6 will cause amplitude modulation that can be easily observed.  The following combinations of texts and interrogation addresses AA will result in AP as shown: 

UF=4, all fields = 0, AA = CO 51 F6 hex : AP = all ZEROs.  
UF=4, all fields = 0, AA = 3F AB F2 hex : AP = AA AA AA hex. UF=20, all fields = 0, AA = AC C5 55 hex : AP = all ZEROs. UF=20, all fields = 0, AA = 53 3F 51 hex : AP = AA AA AA hex. 

## Verification Of Transponder'S Downlink Encoding Circuits For Ap

Couple the modulation detector into the RF connection between the test set and transponder so that the transponder's reply waveform can be observed.  Interrogate the transponder so that the following reply formats are generated and observe the reply pulses on the oscilloscope: 

DF=5, all fields = 0, AA = 2078CE hex : AP = all ZEROs. DF=5, all fields = 0, AA = 752D9B hex : AP = 55 5555 hex.  
DF=21, all fields = 0, AA = 0B154F hex : AP = all ZEROs. DF=21, all fields = 0, AA = 5E 401A hex : AP = 55 5555 hex.

## 2.5.4.4 Procedure #4 Non-Selective Lockout Tests

(§2.2.18.2.4) Non-selective lockout is initiated on receipt of a correctly addressed interrogation UF=4, 
5, 20, 21 containing PC=1 or LOS=1 together with IIS=0.  This starts the TD timer which holds the lockout condition for 18 ±1.0 seconds. Non-selective Lockout applies to both (8 and 21 microseconds) ATCRBS/Mode S All- Calls and to UF=11 with IC and CL=0. The lockout state is verified by interrogating with the locked-out All-Call types and by observing that a reply is not generated. The lockout duration is verified by interrogation with the locked-out All-Call types 100 
milliseconds before the earliest permissible timer runout and by observing that a reply is not generated. The lockout termination is verified by interrogation with the locked-out All-Call types 
100 milliseconds after the latest permissible timer runout and by observing that a reply is generated. 

The timer restart feature is verified by transmitting a second lockout command while the lockout is still in effect and by observing that lockout termination occurs after the latest permissible timer runout reckoned from the last lockout command. Negative tests verify that interrogation patterns not specifically designated as lockout commands do not cause a lockout condition in the transponder, and that lockout affects only the specified formats. 

## 2.5.4.4.1 Positive Tests

Interrogate with UF=4, DI=3, PC=1. 

 
Lockout state, lockout duration, lockout termination. 

Verify:
Repeat with UF=5, PC=1 for Level 1 transponder.  Repeat with UF=5, UF=20, UF=21 and PC=1 for all other designs.

This test verifies that the lockout state applies only to All-Call formats and not to ATCRBS or discrete interrogations.  The interrogation patterns are: All non-All-Call formats for which the transponder is designed (Procedure #2 - §2.5.4.2). With the transponder in non-selective lockout state, interrogate with all of the above patterns and verify that they are not locked out. 

## 2.5.4.5 Procedure #5: Selective Lockout And Independence Of Non-Selective Lockout Tests (§2.2.18.2.5)

Selective lockout is initiated on receipt of a correctly addressed interrogation UF=4, 5, 
20, or 21 containing DI=1, 7; LOS=1 and IIS from 1 to 15, or DI=3, LSS=1 and SIS from 
1 to 63.  This starts the TL timer associated with the received II or SI code and holds the lockout condition for 18 ±1.0 seconds. 

Selective lockout applies only to UF=11 with II or SI corresponding to the running TL 
timer. Selective lockout and non-selective lockout are independent and not mutually exclusive. 

They can both be initiated by the same interrogation.  This is done using PC=1 to start or restart the non-selective lockout timer in the same interrogation used to start or restart a selective lockout timer with any non zero IIS or SIS code. The lockout state, duration, termination and restart are defined and tested as described in 
§2.5.4.4.  Negative tests follow the same procedures and have the same purpose as described in §2.5.4.4.

Negative test pattern:  32. 

 
Note:
 The 8 negative test patterns per UF code are as follows: For each value of DI (0 
- 7) set the IIS or SIS code correctly.  For DI code values where there is no IIS or SIS subfield within the SD field, set the corresponding bits (bits 17-20 for IIS 
or 17-22 for SIS).  If DI=1 or 7, set LOS=0, for all other values of DI, set bit 26=1.  If DI=3, set LSS=0, for all other values of DI, set bit 23=1. Set PC=0.   

## Test Sequence

Because 78 timers, each running 18 ±1.0 seconds, are involved, a test sequence is shown here that minimizes the time needed, while providing a comprehensive validation of transponder performance. 

## Principle Of Test Sequence

A lockout timer is started by a surveillance or Comm-A interrogation and with the next interrogation, the lockout state is verified for UF=11 with the corresponding II or SI.  Just before the earliest and just after the latest timer runout duration, lockout and non-lockout state is verified. 

Timer intervals must be interlaced to verify their independence and to save time. The requirement that each timer can be restarted while running must also be verified. 

Independent non-exclusive operation of selective lockout and non-selective lockout is verified during the selective lockout test by setting PC=1 in some selective lockout interrogations, and verifying that the non-selective lockout and selective lockout timers operate properly. For example: if testing the 78 selective lockout timers, for every eleventh selective timer test, set PC=1 in the interrogation.  Verify proper lockout and non-lockout of the nonselective and selective timers during this selective lockout timer test.

If the last test fails, the timer either runs too long or has been restarted by a non-valid signal. 

Note:
 Test #1 provides the basic timing of a test sequence that satisfies the principles of the test procedure while maintaining a maximum of 50 interrogations per second. Because the test sequence calls for interlacing multisite lockout timers (in this case one is started every 2 seconds), the above sequence will need to accommodate the critical timer verifications that occur at 16.9 and 19.1 seconds relative to the start of each timer.  When the test sequence reaches 16.9 and 19.1 seconds after the start of each timer it will be 0.9 and 1.1 after the start of a new timer.  Priority is given to verify the lockout of the earlier timer at the correct time, while the verification of non-lockout to all other timers is scheduled around these critical measurements. 

## Test #2 Multisite Tl Timer And Lockout: Restart Capability And Sensitivity To All Valid Formats (All Transponders)

|         23.6  | Verify non-lockout for timer's II or SI. |

Interlace all timers in approximately 0.3-second intervals. 

For Level 2 transponders and above, alternate using UF=4 and UF=20 interrogations to start the timers, and alternate using UF=5 and UF=21 interrogations to restart timers.  To test non-exclusive operation of selective lockout and non-selective lockout, here is an example.  During the fifth sequence of this test set PC=1 for the start and restart timer interrogations (PC=0 for all other interrogations) and verify lockout at 0.02 and 21.4 
seconds for both the selective and non-selective timers and non-lockout at 23.6 seconds for both the selective and non-selective timers.   
If the test at 21.4 seconds fails, the timer has not been restarted.

## 2.5.4.6 Procedure #6 Squitter Verification

(Subparagraph §2.2.18.2.6) 
The squitter function of the transponder **shall** be tested to verify that the transponder correctly generates squitters at the proper rate and with the proper content.  Squitters will occur randomly throughout operation of all test procedures.  Squitters should be noted by the reply receiver and the test controller as unsolicited replies.  Provisions should be made in the test setup to detect squitters, both acquisition and Extended Squitters, and verify their content and rate.  If a squitter is detected during the operation of any of the test procedures in this document, the procedure should delay the next scheduled interrogation so that it doesn't overlap the squitter and go undetected by the transponder. The following subparagraphs contain test procedures and expected results that vary according to the aircraft installation for which the transponder is designed, those that support automatic detection of on-the-ground status and those that do not.  If a transponder design allows either installation type, the test procedure should be conducted with the transponder switched to support automatic on-the-ground detection and repeated with the transponder switched for installation without automatic on-the-ground detection.   

## 2.5.4.6.1 Acquisition Squitter Verification

The following test **shall** verify proper transmission of Acquisition squitters when the transponder is not transmitting Extended Squitters.  The following tests **shall** be conducted with no external data input to the Extended Squitter GICB registers.  
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Step 1:  Setup the transponder to airborne status.  The Acquisition squitter transmission 
shall be verified to be at random intervals that are uniformly distributed 
between 0.8 and 1.2 seconds with a time quantization less than or equal to 15 milliseconds.  The test setup will require measuring the time difference between successive Acquisition squitters.  The time interval measured between 
successive Acquisition squitters **shall** be counted in individual 15 millisecond 
bins between 0.8 and 1.2 seconds.  Validation of the proper quantization is achieved upon receipt of at least one Acquisition squitter in each 15 millisecond time bin between 0.8 and 1.2 seconds.  Improper times are those occurring outside of the time bins between 0.8 and 1.2 seconds.  Verify that the Acquisition squitters are at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the interval between 0.8 and 1.2 seconds. 
Step 2:
 
Verify the content of the CA, AA and PI fields.  For diversity transponders, verify that the squitters occur alternately from both channels.  For transponders that are designed for aircraft installations with automatic means of determining on-the-ground condition, when the transponder is in on-the-ground status, 
verify that Acquisition squitters occur on the top antenna only at the prescribed rate.  

## 2.5.4.6.2 Extended Squitter Verification

Extended squitters occur randomly at rates determined by internal states of the transponder.  Each Extended Squitter type must be separately verified for content, rate and antenna selection which are dependent upon transponder air/ground state and Extended Squitter ground station interrogations.  The selection of airborne or surface position formats is dependent upon determination of on-the-ground status and ground station control via interrogation content.  The following tests **shall** be performed to verify proper operation of the transponder Extended Squitter functions.  The external data sources for Extended Squitter loading **shall** be connected via the appropriate interfaces.  

 

## 2.5.4.6.2.1 Extended Squitter Rate Verification

a. Verify Extended Squitter Message Rate and Timeout functions by demonstrating 
successful completion of all test procedures called out in §2.4.3.3.2.11 of RTCA DO-
260B / EUROCAE ED-102A, as required by §2.2.23.1.4.2.1.     
Note: §2.4.3.3.2.11 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A indicates that ADS-
B Message Timeout performance is tested in §2.4.3.3.2.2 through §2.4.3.3.2.8.2.  These same test procedure sections verify the Message Rate in RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A.   

b. Verify Extended Squitter Message Rate and Termination functions by demonstrating 
successful completion of all test procedures called out in §2.4.3.3.2.12 of RTCA DO-
260B / EUROCAE ED-102A, as required by §2.2.23.1.4.2.2.    
Note:
 §2.4.3.3.2.12 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A indicates that ADS-
B Message Termination performance is tested in §2.4.3.3.2.2 through 
§2.4.3.3.2.8.2.  These same test procedure sections verify the Message Rate in RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A.   

c. While performing the test procedures specified in subparagraphs "a" and "b" above, 
verify the content of the CA, AA and PI fields in the Extended Squitter Messages.     
d. For diversity transponders, setup the transponder to transmit airborne format 
Extended Squitters.  Verify that each Extended Squitter type identified in §2.2.23.1.2 
occur alternately from both channels.  For transponders that are designed for aircraft installations with automatic means of determining on-the-ground condition, set the transponder to on-the-ground status and verify that Extended Squitters occur on the 
top antenna only at the prescribed rates.  

## 2.5.4.6.2.2 Extended Squitter Protocol Verification

The following test verifies the transponder properly transmits Extended Squitters according to the protocol specified in §2.2.23.1. 

Verify the content of the CA, AA and PI fields of all Extended Squitter replies.  For the following test, connect the transponder to the appropriate source that provides altitude code input to the transponder.  Also, as required, setup to provide Extended Squitter data to ground initiated Comm-B Registers 0516, 0616, 0716, 0816, 0916, 0A16, 6216 and 6516 
through an external interface as specified in §2.2.13.2.  
Unless otherwise noted, for the following steps, setup the transponder to not inhibit Acquisition squitters and to report barometric pressure altitude in the airborne position report (subfield ATS equals ZERO).  For transponders that support automatic detection of air/ground state, set the transponder to airborne state. 

Step 1 
Disable altitude code and all other Extended Squitter data into the transponder. Set the ALT switch to the "off" position.  Upon power-up initialization of the 
transponder, verify that the transponder broadcasts Acquisition squitters but does not broadcast Extended Squitters.  Interrogate the transponder with ground initiated Comm-B requests with RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 7 and 9 
respectively.  Verify that the MB field of the corresponding replies is ZERO.  
Set the ALT switch to the "on" position.  Verify that the transponder continues to broadcast Acquisition squitters but does not broadcast Extended Squitters. 
Step 2  
Set the ALT switch to the "on" position and provide altitude code input to the transponder.  After power-up initialization, verify that the transponder does not 
broadcast Extended Squitters.  Interrogate the transponder with ground initiated Comm-B requests with RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 9 and 10 respectively. Verify that the altitude is ZERO in the airborne position report and remaining bits are ZERO.  Verify that the MB field of the remaining replies is ZERO.  
Interrogate the transponder with UF=4, RR=17 and DI≠7 and verify that the SCS subfield of the data link capability report is ZERO.  Verify that the transponder broadcasts Acquisition squitters. 
Step 3 
Provide Extended Squitter updates to the transponder at a maximum update interval as specified in Appendix B, Table B-2-1.  Include updates to GICB 
Registers 0516, 0616, 0716, 0816, 0916, 6216 and 6516.  Use other than ZERO or 
ALL ONEs for the airborne position report, aircraft identification report, and the airborne velocity report.  Verify that the transponder broadcasts airborne position squitters, airborne identification squitters and airborne velocity squitters at the proper rate and the ME data content matches the data stored in GICB Register 0516, 0816 and 0916, respectively.  Verify that the SSS and ACS 
subfields of the airborne position squitter are correct.  Interrogate the transponder with ground initiated Comm-B requests with RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively.  Verify that the MB field contains the proper data.  Repeat except vary the data content of each GICB and verify the data content of each Extended Squitter subsequent to each register update. Interrogate the transponder with RR=17 and DI≠7 and verify that the SCS 
subfield of the data link capability report is one.  

Step 4
 
Setup the transponder as in Step 3 with Extended Squitter updates to the 
transponder at a maximum update interval as specified in Appendix B, Table 
B-2-1.  Place the transponder in the airborne state.  Stop updates of all Extended Squitter data, except altitude information, to the transponder for 
GICB Registers 0516, 0616, 0716, 0816, 0916, 6216 and 6516.   
a. 
Verify that after 2 seconds, the Extended Squitter ME fields for GICB 
Register 0516 are ZERO with the exception of the ACS and surveillance 
status fields.   
b. Verify that after 2 seconds the aircraft identification and category squitter 
(GICB Register 0816) continues to be transmitted.   
c. Verify that after 2 seconds only the Selected Altitude, Selected Heading or 
Barometric Pressure Setting subfields of the target state and status squitter 
(GICB Register 6216) are set to ZERO.  Verify that the remaining Extended 
Squitter ME subfields are not cleared, as they contain other integrity, mode or status information.   
d. Verify that after 2 seconds the Extended Squitter ME fields of the aircraft 
operational status squitter (GICB Register 6516) are not cleared, as they 
contain various integrity, mode or status information.   
e. Verify that after 2.6 seconds the airborne velocity squitter is not being 
transmitted.   
f. 
Place the transponder in the ground state and verify that the surface 
position Extended Squitter ME field (GICB Register 0616) is ZERO.  
Repeat the setup as in Step 3 with Extended Squitter updates to the transponder at a one half second rate.  Place the transponder in the airborne state.  Interrogate the transponder with RR=17 and DI=7 and verify that the SCS subfield of the data link capability report is one.  After all updates (except altitude information) have ceased for 10 seconds, interrogate to extract the data link capability report and verify that the SCS subfield is ZERO.  Interrogate the transponder with ground initiated Comm-B 
requests with RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 respectively.  Verify that the MB fields are ZERO with the exception of the ACS field in the 
airborne position squitter (GICB Register 0516) and the airborne 
identification squitter (GICB Register 0816).  After all updates (except 
altitude information) have ceased for 60 seconds, verify that airborne 
identification and category Extended Squitters are still being transmitted.  
Place the transponder in the ground state and verify that the surface 
position Extended Squitter (GICB Register 0616) is no longer transmitted.  
Return the transponder to the airborne state.  Verify that the acquisition 
squitter and airborne position squitter are broadcast.  Set the ALT switch to the "off" position.  Verify that the ME field of the airborne position squitter is ZERO.  After 60 seconds, verify that the transponder no longer broadcasts airborne position squitters. 

Step 5
 
Set ALT switch to the "on" position.  Setup the transponder as in step 3 and 
provide Extended Squitter updates to the transponder at a maximum update interval as specified in Appendix B, Table B-2-1.  Stop update of GICB 
Registers 0516 and 0616 only.  After 2 seconds, verify that the ME field of the 
airborne position squitter is ZERO with the exception of the ACS subfield. Verify that the transponder broadcasts airborne position, aircraft identification and airborne velocity squitters at the proper rate and the ME data content 
matches the data stored in GICB Registers 0516, 0816 and 0916, respectively.  
Interrogate with RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 8 and 9 and verify the MB fields matches the ME field in the corresponding Extended Squitter reply.  After 10 
seconds, interrogate to extract the data link capability report and verify that SCS is ZERO.  After 60 seconds, verify that airborne position squitters are still transmitted.  
Set the ALT switch to the "off" position.  Verify that the ME field of the airborne position squitter is ZERO.  After 60 seconds, verify that the transponder no longer broadcasts airborne position squitters.  Verify that aircraft identification and airborne velocity squitters are transmitted throughout the test at the proper rate and with the correct data content. 

Step 6 
Set the ALT switch to the "on" position and provide altitude code input to the transponder.  Provide Extended Squitter updates to the transponder at a maximum update interval as specified in Appendix B, Table B-2-1.  Include 
updates to GICB Registers 0516, 0616, 0716, 0816 and 0916.  Verify that the ME 
fields of the airborne position, velocity and aircraft identification squitters match the data input.  Stop updates of Extended Squitter data to the 
transponder for GICB Registers 0816 and 0916 only.  After 15 seconds, verify 
that the ME field of the aircraft identification squitter continues to match the 
data input prior to stopping updates to GICB Register 0816.  After 2.6 seconds, 
verify that the airborne velocity squitter is no longer transmitted.  Interrogate with RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 8 and 9 and verify that the MB fields match the ME fields in the corresponding Extended Squitter reply.  Specifically, 
verify that the MB and ME fields for Register 0816 continue to match the data 
input prior to stopping the updates to GICB Register 0816.  After 10 seconds, 
interrogate to extract the data link capability report and verify that SCS is one. After 60 seconds, verify that airborne position and aircraft identification squitters are still transmitted.  Specifically, verify that the ME field of the 
aircraft identification squitter continues to match the data input prior to 
stopping the updates to GICB Register 0816.     
Step 7 
Configure the transponder to inhibit Acquisition squitters when Extended Squitters are broadcast.  Prior to providing Extended Squitter updates, verify that Acquisition squitters are broadcast.  Provide Extended Squitter updates at a maximum update interval as specified in Appendix B, Table B-2-1 to GICB 
Registers 0516, 0616 and 0816 and provide altitude code input to the transponder.  
Verify that Extended Squitters are broadcast and Acquisition squitters are not broadcast.  Verify that airborne position and aircraft identification squitters are broadcast at the proper rate and alternately on the top and bottom antenna ports as specified for airborne state if antenna diversity is supported.  Additionally 
provide updates to GICB Register 0916.  Verify the broadcast of airborne 
position squitters, aircraft identification squitters and airborne velocity squitters 
at the proper rate and the ME data content matches the data stored in GICB 
Registers 0516, 0816 and 0916, respectively.  Verify that the transponder does not broadcast Acquisition squitters. Set the ALT switch to the "off" position and stop update to GICB Registers 
0516, 0616, 0816 and 0916.  After 2 seconds, verify that the ME fields of the airborne position squitters are ZERO.  After 2.6 seconds, verify that the airborne velocity squitter is no longer transmitted.  Interrogate with UF=4, RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 8 and 9, respectively.  Verify that the MB fields of the replies match the data of the corresponding Extended Squitter reply.  
Specifically, verify that the MB fields of the replies for Register 0816 continue to match the data that was provided prior to stopping the updates to GICB 
Register 0816.  After 60 seconds, verify that Extended Squitter airborne position squitter transmissions stop.  Verify that the aircraft identification Extended Squitter transmissions are continued and that the contents of the ME field matches the data that was provided prior to stopping the updates to GICB 
Register 0816.  Verify that the transponder resumes Acquisition squitter broadcast.   
Repeat above sequence except stop update to GICB Registers 0516 and 0616 
only.  After 2 seconds, verify that the ME field of the airborne position report is ZERO.  After 60 seconds, verify that the transponder no longer broadcasts airborne position squitters and continues to broadcast airborne velocity and aircraft identification squitters.  Verify that the transponder continues to inhibit the broadcast of Acquisition squitters. 

Repeat above except stop update to GICB Register 0916 only.  After 2.6 
seconds, verify that the airborne velocity squitter is no longer transmitted, and after 60 seconds, verify that the Acquisition squitters are not transmitted. 

Step 8
 
Provide data to the transponder to trigger data to be loaded into GICB Register 
0A16.  Verify that an Event-Driven Extended Squitter is generated with the proper data content.  Repeat for all supported Event-Driven Extended Squitter Message types.  Verify that the data contained in the GICB Register corresponding to the Event-Driven Extended Squitter Message type matches the data contained in the transmitted Extended Squitter.  Update GICB Register 
0A16 at a rate less than twice every second.  Verify that an Event-Driven Extended Squitter is generated subsequent to each update with the proper data content.  Vary the data content provided externally to the transponder and verify that the data content subsequent to update of the Event-Driven report is correct.  Increase the update rate to exceed twice per second.  Verify that the Event-Driven Extended Squitter rate does not exceed twice per second, and that the data content reflects the most recent update contents.   
For the following steps, for those transponders that support automatic detection of on-the-ground status, change the transponder to on-the-ground status. Configure the transponder to not inhibit Acquisition squitters when Extended Squitters are broadcast.   

Step 9 
Upon power-up initialization of the transponder, verify that the transponder broadcasts Acquisition squitters at the proper rate but does not broadcast Extended Squitters.  For transponders that support automatic detection of onthe-ground status and diversity, verify that Acquisition squitters occur on the top antenna port only.  Interrogate the transponder with GICB requests with RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 8 and 9 respectively.  Verify that the MB field of the corresponding replies is ZERO.   
Step 10
 
Provide Extended Squitter updates to the transponder at a maximum update 
interval as specified in Appendix B, Table B-2-1.  Include updates to GICB 
Registers 0516, 0616, 0816, 0916, 6216 and 6516.  Use other than ZERO or all 
ONEs for the surface position report and the aircraft identification report.  Set TRS to ZERO.  For transponders that support automatic on-the-ground 
detection, perform the following: 
1. Verify that the transponder broadcasts surface position squitters at the high 
rate and the ME data content matches the data stored in GICB Register 
0616. 
2. Verify that the transponder broadcasts aircraft identification squitters and 
that they occur uniformly over the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds as specified in §2.2.23.1.3.d.  Verify that the ME data content matches the data stored 
in GICB Register 0816. 
3. Verify that the transponder broadcasts aircraft operational status squitters 
at the rates as specified in §2.2.3.3.1.4.2 of RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE 
ED-102A and that the data content matches the data stored in GICB 
Register 6516.  When transmitting the surface formats, the rate depends on 
whether the high or low squitter rate has been selected (see §2.2.23.1.6).   
4. Verify that the transponder does not broadcast the airborne position and the 
airborne velocity squitter. 
5. Verify that the transponder does not broadcast Acquisition squitters. 
6. Stop update of GICB Registers 0516, 0616, 0816, 0916 and 6516.  After 2 
seconds, verify that the surface position squitter ME field is ZERO.  After 15 seconds, verify that the ME field of the aircraft identification squitter continues to match the data input prior to stopping updates to GICB 
Register 0816.   
7. After 60 seconds, verify that surface position and surface aircraft 
operational status squitters stop.  Verify that the aircraft identification 
extended squitter transmissions are continued and that the contents of the ME field matches the data that was provided prior to stopping the updates 
to GICB Register 0816.  Verify that acquisition squitter transmissions 
resume.   
For transponders that do not support automatic on-the-ground detection, verify 
that airborne position squitters, airborne velocity squitters and aircraft identification squitters are transmitted at the proper rate and data content. Verify that surface position squitters are not emitted.  Verify that the 
transponder broadcasts Acquisition squitters at the proper rate. 
Repeat except vary the data content of GICB Registers 0616 and 0816 and verify the data content of each Extended Squitter subsequent to each register update. 

Step 11
 
For transponders that support automatic on-the-ground detection and can 
determine surface squitter rate, repeat step 10 with TRS set to 1 and verify that the surface position and aircraft identification squitters occur at the high rate. Change TRS to 2 and repeat except verify that the surface position squitter switches to the low rate and aircraft identification squitters occur uniformly over the range 9.8 to 10.2 seconds as specified in §
.d.   
2.2.23.1.3
In all of the above steps, interrogate the transponder with a ground-initiated Comm-B request containing RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=7 and verify that the TRS and ATS subfields are reported properly.

transponder is not transmitting surface position squitters.  Interrogate the transponder with UF=4, PC=0, RR=0, DI=2, TCS=0, RCS=1, and SAS=0.  
Verify that the transponder:   
1. continues the broadcast of the airborne position (0516), airborne velocity 
(0916), aircraft status (6116) and airborne aircraft operational status (6516) 
squitters at the proper rates.   
2. continues to broadcast the aircraft identification (0816) squitter at the high

h. Repeat Step 2.i above, except set RCS=2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively.  For 
each setting used for RCS, verify that the transponder responds as required in 
Step 2.i.    
i. 
The following verifies that reserved RCS codes have no effect when the 
transponder is transmitting surface position squitters.  Interrogate the transponder with UF=4, PC and RR=0, DI=2, TCS=2, RCS=0, SAS=0. Verify that the transponder:   
1. broadcasts surface position (0616), aircraft identification (0816), aircraft 
status (6116), and surface aircraft operational status (6516) squitters at the 
proper rates,

squitters during the 60 second period following the interrogation.   
k. Interrogate the transponder with UF=4, PC=0, RR=0, DI=2, TCS=2, RCS=1, 
and SAS=0.  Follow this interrogation within 1 second with the same interrogation except set TCS=3.  Verify that the transponder stops broadcast 
of surface position (0616) and surface aircraft operational status (6516) 
squitters.   

## Step 3 Squitter Antenna Control

The following procedure verifies that the transponder correctly broadcasts surface Extended Squitters and Acquisition squitters on the proper antenna ports as commanded by the SAS subfield.  For transponders that do not support antenna diversity, verify that the SAS commands have no impact on Acquisition or Extended Squitter transmissions.  

a. With the equipment connected as specified in Step 1, for transponders that 
support automatic on-the-ground detection, set the transponder to on-theground status.  For transponders that support automatic detection of on-theground condition, verify that the transponder:  
1. broadcasts surface position (0616), aircraft identification (0816), aircraft 
status (6116), and surface aircraft operational status (6516) squitters on the 
top antenna only, and 
2. does not broadcast Acquisition squitters.  
b. Interrogate the transponder with UF=4, PC=0, RR=0, DI=2, TCS=0, RCS=0, 
and SAS=0.  For transponders that do not support automatic detection of onthe-ground status, verify that the following interrogations have no impact to Extended Squitter and Acquisition squitter transmissions.  Otherwise, verify that the transponder broadcasts Extended and Acquisition squitters on the top 
antenna only.   
c. Repeat interrogation used in Step 3.b, except set SAS=1.  Verify that:  
1. each Extended Squitter type and Acquisition squitters occur alternately 
on the top and bottom antennas, and 
2. after 120 seconds, verify that the transponder broadcasts Extended and 
Acquisition squitters from the top antenna only.   
d. Repeat interrogation except set SAS=2.  Verify that:  
1. the transponder broadcasts Extended and Acquisition squitters for 120 
seconds from the bottom antenna only, and 
2. after the 120-second interval, that the transponder resumes broadcasting 
Extended and Acquisition squitters from the top antenna only.   
e. Repeat interrogation used in Step 3.b, except with SAS=1 followed by an 
interrogation 10 seconds later with SAS=3.  After the second interrogation, 
verify that the transponder resumes broadcasting Extended and Acquisition 
squitters from the top antenna only.   
f. 
Repeat above procedure for transponders that support automatic on-theground detection, except set the transponder to **airborne state** and verify that 
the SAS commands have no effect on Acquisition and Extended Squitter transmissions and squitters are broadcast alternately on top and bottom antenna ports.  
g. Repeat above procedure except command the transponder to report surface 
Extended Squitters via UF=4, PC=0, RR=0, DI=2, TCS=2, and RCS=0 interrogations every 60 seconds to maintain surface squitter transmissions. Set up transponders that support automatic on-the-ground detection to the 
airborne state.  Verify that the SAS command properly controls antenna 
port selection for each of the Extended Squitter types as specified for each SAS value, and that the SAS commands have no effect on Acquisition 
squitter transmissions.   

## 2.5.4.7 Procedure #7: Fs And Vs Protocol/Code Tests

The following procedure verifies the FS, VS and SSS protocol and verifies proper coding.  The FS and SSS codes are dependent upon Alert conditions input to the transponder.  The FS, VS and also the CA codes are dependent upon the automatically determined on-the-ground condition input to the transponder for installations so equipped. (§2.2.14.4.15 - FS code). (§2.2.14.4.42 - VS code). 

(§2.2.23.1.8 - SSS code). 

(§2.2.13.1.2.c, §2.2.18.2.7 - protocol). (§2.2.18.2.11 - interface). 

(Figure 2-17 - Flowchart). 

This procedure verifies the proper operation of the FS and VS protocols and codes. 

## Transponder States

A = Alert Register set. 

B = TC timer runs = 16 states, independent. 

C = TI timer runs. 

D = Ground Register set. 

## Interrogation Patterns For The Level 1 Transponder

UF=4, 5 with RR=0 = 3 patterns. 

UF=0. 

## Interrogation Patterns For All Other Transponders

UF=4, 5, 20, 21 with RR=0 and 16 through 31. UF=0, 16 = 70 patterns. 

## Transaction Summary

Level 1 Transponder: 
 
48 transactions.  
All Other Transponders:  
1120 transactions. 

## Required Code Verification Test

Observe that the FS code follows the transponder states as specified in §
2.2.14.4.15 and verify that VS=1, if and only if the "on-the-ground" input is active. 

Note:
 The Alert Register is set when the manual or interface input to the ID function is 
7500, 7600, 7700. 

The TC timer is started when the input to the ID function is changed. 

The TI timer is started when manual or interface input exists for SPI 
momentarily. 

The Ground Register is set when input to the "on-the-ground" interface indicates that condition. 

The transactions required for this test can be interlaced during the procedures required for interface verification or during any other convenient interval.  This can be arranged so that no time is lost in waiting for the timers to run out. 

## Required Timer Duration Test

Duration of each timer run (TC and TI) must be verified to be 18 ±1.0 seconds by observation of FS code change.   
Change the input of the ID function to a value other than 7500, 7600 or 7700.  Verify that the Mode A Code, temporary alert is set (FS field value is 4 or 5).  Five (5) seconds later, change the input of the ID function to a value other than 7500, 7600 or 7700 and different from the previously used value.  Verify that the Mode A Code temporary alert is set (FS field value is 4 or 5) for 18 ±1 seconds after the second change.   

## On-The-Ground Validation Test

For transponders that support automatic on-the-ground condition input and either implement Extended Squitter formatting or support the on-the-ground validation requirements of §
2.2.18.2.7.c, the following test **shall** be performed.  
The on-the-ground input is used in determining the codes for FS, VS and CA fields.  The requirements of Section §2.2.18.2.7.c utilize radio altitude, ground speed and airspeed inputs to validate the on-the-ground status when indicated by the input to the transponder.  
If the conditions for overriding the on-the-ground status indicated by the input to the transponder, the airborne status **shall** be utilized to select FS, VS and CA field coding. Also, for extender squitter format selection, airborne formats **shall** be transmitted unless overridden by ground station interrogation commands.  CA field validation for Acquisition squitters and Extended Squitters is verified as part of Procedure #6 in §2.5.4.6, so the following test can be incorporated as part of that testing. Setup the transponder to indicate on-the-ground status by input to the transponder.  With no input of radio altitude, airspeed and ground speed to the transponder, verify that the FS codes are determined by the transponder states above with the Ground Register set to on-the-ground and VS is set to 1.  Input radio altitude, airspeed and ground speed to the transponder.  Since not all aircraft installations may have access to all three inputs, testing is required for all combinations of inputs being provided to the transponder so that each input is tested individually and collectively.  This is to insure that any one input reporting a value that sets airborne status as specified in §2.2.18.2.7.c, properly outputs FS values according to Figure 2-17 with the Ground Register reset to NOT indicate on-the-ground condition and VS is ZERO.  If all inputs are supported by the transponder, a total of 27 combinations are required.  This represents 9 cases with radio altitude not input, 9 cases with a value above 50 feet and 9 cases with a value below or equal to 50 feet.  The same variation for airspeed and ground speed is required except the values selected would be above 100 knots to satisfy the requirement to reset the Ground Register to NOT indicate on-the-ground condition and a value at 100 knots or below to not modify the on-theground status. 

## Sss Code Validation Test

The SSS subfield is contained in the ME field of airborne Extended Squitters.  Setup the transponder to transmit airborne Extended Squitters at the nominal rates.  Verify the following: 

1) SSS=0 when no alert (the Alert Register is clear and TC timer is not running) and no 
SPI condition is active. 
2) SSS=1 when Alert Register is set and no SPI Condition is active. 
3) SSS=2 when the TC timer is running and returns to ZERO after the temporary alert 
has cleared after 18 ±1 seconds. 
4) SSS=3 when the TI timer is set indicating a SPI Condition is active and returns to 
ZERO after the TI timer expires. 
5) SSS=1 when Alert Register is set and SPI Condition is active.  Clear the alert and 
verify that SSS=2 as TC timer is now active.  Set the SPI Condition, which will set 
the TI timer.  Verify that SSS=2 until the TC timer expires.  Verify that SSS=3 upon 
expiration of the TC timer and that SSS=0 upon expiration of the TI timer. 
6) SSS=3 when the TI timer is started.  Prior to expiration of the TI timer, start the TC 
timer and verify that SSS=2.  Upon expiration of the TC timer, verify that SSS returns 
to ZERO. 
7) SSS=3 when the TI timer is started.  Set the Alert Register while the TI timer is 
running and verify that SSS=1. 

## Alert When Leaving Standby Condition

a. Set to the airborne state and change the input of the ID function to a value other than 
7500, 7600 or 7700. 
b. Wait 19 seconds. c. Set the transponder to STANDBY condition. 
d. Set the transponder to return to normal condition. 
e. Verify that the Mode A Code, temporary alert is set (FS field value is 2 and SSS=2 
when the transponder is ES capable) for 18 ±1 seconds after leaving the STANDBY condition. 
f. 
Repeat Steps "a" through "e", except in Step "c" set the transponder to OFF. 

## Change The Input Of The Id Function To 7500

a. Set to the airborne state and set the transponder to STANDBY condition and provide 
the transponder with the 7500 code. 
b. Set the transponder to return to normal condition. 
c. Verify that the permanent alert is set (FS field value is 2 and SSS=1 when the 
transponder is ES capable). 
d. Repeat the test with 7600 and 7700. 
e. Repeats Steps "a" through "d", except in Step "a" set the transponder to OFF.   

## 2.5.4.8 Procedure #8: Pi (Parity/Identity) Verification

(§2.2.18.2.9) This test procedure verifies the PI field generation. A separate test sequence is not required. 

## Required Verification:

During the lockout tests, the transponder generates replies to All-Call interrogations and the reply receiver receives the PI field and extracts the II or SI code received by the transponder in the preceding interrogation. 

Verify that the extracted code agrees with the II or SI of the preceding All-Call. 

Verify that the extracted code equals 0 if the preceding All-Call was an ATCRBS/Mode S type. 

 
2.5.4.9 
Procedure #9: Address Tests 
(§2.2.18.2.2 - addressing discrimination) 
(§2.2.13.1.1.a (1) - protection of Mode S address bits) (§2.2.13.1.1.a (2) - address reporting) 
(§2.2.13.1.1.a (3) and §2.2.18.2.1.c - address encoding) (§2.2.18.2.11 - address interface) 
This test procedure verifies that the address set into the address interface of the transponder is only accepted during power-up or unit reset, that the accepted address set is actually the address to which the transponder responds, and that the accepted address is the only address which the transponder reports in DF=11.  It is also verified that this accepted address pattern is used in generating the AP field of replies and that the transponder does reply only to this address. 

## Test Sequence:

 
1. Remove power from the transponder under test. 
2. Set the transponder address selector device to any valid 24-bit aircraft address (not a 
single ZERO (0) or ONE (1)), referred to as "address #1." 
3. Apply power to the transponder under test and wait a minimum of 2 seconds. 4. Interrogate the transponder with address #1 and observe: Acceptance for all formats. Correct reporting of address # 1 in AA field of DF=11. Correct encoding of address # 1 in AP field of replies. 
5. Interrogate the transponder with any Mode S address other than address #1 and 
observe: 
 
Non-acceptance of all formats. 
 
6. Set the transponder address selector device to a different randomly chosen valid 
Mode S address (not a single ZERO (0) or ONE (1)), referred to as "address #2." 
7. Verify correct reporting of address # 1 in AA field of DF=11. 8. If the transponder is designed to monitor the Mode S address, then: 9. Verify that the transponder generates an appropriate diagnostic error message to 
indicate that the transponder address has changed. 
10. Interrogate the transponder with address #2 and observe: 
 
Non-acceptance of all formats. 
 
11. Interrogate the transponder with address #1 and observe: 
 
Acceptance of all formats. 
Correct reporting of address # 1 in AA field of DF=11. 
Correct encoding of address # 1 in AP field of replies. 
 
Repeat this test with several randomly chosen valid 24-bit aircraft addresses (not a single ZERO (0) or ONE (1)) as address #1 and address #2. 

 

## 2.5.4.10 Procedure #10: Altitude Report Tests (§2.2.13.1.2.A (L) - In Atcrbs) (§2.2.13.1.2.A (2) - In Mode S) (§2.2.18.2.11 - Interface)

This test procedure verifies that the altitude code, as it is set into the interface, appears correctly in both ATCRBS and Mode S replies.   

## Transponder Designs

In ATCRBS replies only 11 of the possible 13 pulses are used; X and D1 are not part of the code.  Additionally, some transponders may not need the capability to transmit the D2 and/or D4 pulses, which start at 62000 and 30750 feet respectively.  At the other extreme, a transponder with the capability to report altitude in meters must have the capability to transmit ONEs in all 13 bits of the AC field.  
Transponders report altitude in up to six reply formats depending on the implementation level: ATCRBS Mode C, DF=0, DF=4, (Level 1 and above) the airborne position squitter, DF=17 (Extended Squitter capability), and in DF=16, and DF=20 (Level 2 and above).   

## Test Sequence:

Step 1: 
No Barometric Altitude Data 
Disconnect the interface input for altitude code or do not supply altitude information if the interface is common with other data systems.  Interrogate so that all possible altitude reporting downlink formats are generated in replies.  
For ATCRBS, verify that only the bracket pulses appear and that bits 20 through 32 of Mode S replies are ZEROs.  Setup the transponder to transmit airborne position squitters and verify that the altitude field is all ZEROs. 

Connect the altitude source to the interface input, generate a code consisting of all ZEROs and verify as above.  Repeat the test procedure while providing invalid data and verify that the AC field is set to all ZEROs. 

## Step 2: Barometric Altitude Data Available

With the altitude code source connected to the interface input, apply the Barometric Altitude Input_A values provided in Table 2-13.  Verify that the altitude appears correctly in all reply formats containing an altitude code, and in the Mode S replies and Extended Squitter the "Q" bit and the "M" bit are set to ZERO (0). 

Apply the Barometric Altitude Input_B values provided in Table 2-13.  Verify that the altitude appears correctly in all reply formats containing an altitude code, and in the Mode S replies and Extended Squitter the "Q" bit is set to ONE (1) and the "M" bit is set to ZERO (0) for cases 1 through 7.  Verify that the "Q" bit and the "M" bit are set to ZERO (0) for cases 8 through 10.

| 10                    | 62800                  |

 For aircraft installations that support shared interfaces and aircraft bus interfaces that provide multiple altitude data sources and types, perform the above test patterns and verify that the correct altitude source is selected.  Apply all sources of altitude data that are available to the transponder and verify the following: 1) the proper pressure altitude input is selected the data is referenced to the standard pressure setting of 1013.25 hectopascals (uncorrected pressure altitude), 2) that if 25-foot or better pressure altitude sources are available, pressure altitude is reported in 25-foot increments.  Verify that if 25 foot or better pressure altitude sources are not connected or are not available, that 25-
foot altitude is not reported.  

Step 3: 
Data Provided in Metric, If Available 
Repeat Step 2 with the input indicating metric input, if available, and verify that the "M" bit is set to 1 in the AC field of all replies. 

## 2.5.4.11 Procedure #11: 4096 Code Tests (§2.2.13.1.2.B) (§2.2.18.2.11 - Interface, Electrical) (§2.1.7.A - Interface, Manual)

This test verifies that the 4096 code set by the pilot appears correctly in both ATCRBS and Mode S replies. 

## Procedure Selection:

For all installations and transponder designs, the initial input of the code is set manually by the pilot.  The code selector device may or may not be an integral part of the transponder.  If an electrical input exists, it may be dedicated to this function alone, or it may be common with other data systems.  Any procedure selected ultimately must be traceable to the manual input mode, even if the pilot's selector device is provided by another manufacturer. 

## Pattern Selection:

The correlation between pulse position in ATCRBS and bit number in Mode S replies is shown in §
2.2.13.1.2.b. 

Only 12 of the possible 13 pulses or bit positions are used; X(26) is not part of the code. Test patterns are chosen so that the most likely failure modes (incorrect wiring in connectors, cables, code switches or register malfunction) are likely to be found.  The following systematic test pattern generation is required: There exist 66 code patterns consisting of two ONEs and 10 ZEROs, while another 66 patterns have two ZEROs and 10 ONEs.  These 132 patterns are used for verification because they assure that a pair of connections is not defective.  (A sequence of randomly chosen patterns is not suitable because there are many incorrect wiring possibilities and a random test can fail to detect errors). The correlation between the required test pattern and the actual code numbers as seen by the pilot follows:

## Transponder Designs:

The Level 1 transponder reports the 4096 code in ATCRBS Mode A replies and in DF=5; 264 replies must be verified.  
All other transponders report the 4096 code in ATCRBS Mode A replies and in DF=5, 21; 396 replies must be verified. 

## Test Sequence:

Enter all test patterns manually or electrically and verify that they are correct in both ATCRBS and Mode S replies. 

If the test patterns are entered electrically, a corresponding test procedure must be devised to verify the connection between 4096 codes and the electrical input to the transponder.  This should include cables and connectors. 

If the electrical input simulates an on-board data distribution system, the verification procedures for that system govern the above verification. 

A manual insertion of the 4096 codes can be prompted by an interactive readout from the controller to speed the procedure. 

## 2.5.4.12 Procedure #12: Ri, Acquisition And Maximum Airspeed (§2.2.13.1.1.B - Insertion) (§2.2.14.4.33 - Code) (§2.2.18.2.11 - Interface) (§2.2.22.1.5)

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
This test procedure verifies that the airspeed code as it is set at the fixed direct data interface appears correctly in replies and that it appears only when the interrogation shows AQ=1. 

## Pattern Selection:

Of the 4 bits of the RI field, one (bit 14) is controlled by the content of the received interrogation.  The remaining three (bits 15 - 17) show the airspeed code from the fixed direct data interface when bit 14 is ONE, and input from a variable data interface when bit 14 is ZERO.  This procedure concerns only the fixed data interface; RI action for the variable data interface is verified in Procedure #17. 

To be verified are code 0 and codes 8 through 14 of §2.2.14.4.33. 

## Transponder Designs:

The airspeed codes range to 1200 knots.  Bit 15, if ONE, characterizes all airspeeds above 300 knots.  Transponders may not have inputs for airspeeds above that limit. 

The Level 1 transponder requires interrogations with UF=0, AQ=0, 1 and RL=0 (2 interrogation patterns). All other transponders require interrogations with UF=0, 16, AQ=0, l and RL=0, l (8 interrogation patterns). 

## Test Sequence:

For each airspeed code (for which the transponder is equipped), interrogate with the required number of patterns and verify that the RI field shows the code according to §
2.2.14.4.33 or §2.2.22.1.5, as appropriate. 

Note:
 Since some transponders may enter the airspeed code through a common onboard data system, a corresponding test procedure must be used. 

## 2.5.4.13 Procedure #13: Pr, Probability Of Reply, Stochastic Acquisition (§2.2.14.4.31 - Pr Code) (§2.2.18.2.2.I - Protocol)

This test procedure verifies that the probability-of-reply decision for All-Call interrogations is carried out correctly. 

## Principle Of Test Procedure:

A large number of Mode S-only All-Call interrogations (UF=11) are made for each of the PR codes.  For each PR code, a specified fraction of the interrogations will result in a reply.  One hundred interrogations would provide a valid sample for active PR codes while a lesser number would be adequate for other codes. 

## Transponder Designs:

This test applies to all transponder designs. 

Test Sequences:

Note:
 This test is based on a small sample, and is likely that in some cases of testing, statistical variation may cause a correctly implemented transponder to fail this test.  In this case, it is equally likely that if the test is rerun one or more times, it may then be successful.   

b. 
Transponder Locked Out to All-Calls 
The transponder can be in 79 different specific lockout states as determined by the running of the one TD and the 78 TL timers.  The following test sequence must be repeated for each of the lockout states: 
Interrogate so that the transponder is locked out non-selectively or selectively as required.

## Squitter Precaution

Because squitters, which have the same format, can distort the results of this test, precautions must be taken.  Therefore, the test should be conducted during the 800- millisecond periods following squitter (§
2.5.4.6). 

Note:
 It is not necessary that this test consist of an uninterrupted sequence of All-Calls.  
The interrogations can be dispersed throughout the overall test procedure whenever convenient.   

## 2.5.4.14 Procedure #14: Not Used

2.5.4.15 
Procedure #15: Comm-A, Interface and Information Content 
(§2.2.19.1.10 - protocol) (§2.2.13.3.1.a - content) (§2.2.13.3.1.b - no-storage design) (§2.2.13.3.1.c - storage design) (§2.2.13.3.1.d - non-acceptance) (§2.2.3.4.2 - acceptance rate) (§2.2.19.1.1.b - broadcast) 
This procedure verifies that the information contained in Comm-A interrogations passes out of the transponder within the specified time interval and that such information correctly replicates the received transmission. 

In this test, the equipment must monitor both the reply content via the reply received, and the uplink interface output via the interface adapter. 

## Interrogation Patterns:

|                       |     | UF    | =                                                       |
|-----------------------|-----|-------|---------------------------------------------------------|
|                       | RR  | =     | 0.                                                      |
|                       | MA  | =     | 3080 different patterns, half containing two ONEs, half |
| containing two ZEROs. |     |       |                                                         |



Address: Use the broadcast address for 5% of the interrogations. 
Total number of interrogations if UF=20 and UF=21 are alternated: 3080. 

## Test Sequence A:

Interrogate at the normal (50/sec) rate, alternating UF=20 with UF=21 inserting RR=0 to 15, PC=0 to 7, DI=0 to 7 and SD=random.  Insert the 3080 different patterns into MA. Verify that the uplink content, as transmitted, appears at the interface in the same order as transmitted. 

Note: If the interface is of the storage design, the information may be delayed; 
coordination with the interface design is required. 

## Test Subsequence:

Within the test sequence above, make 100 interrogations in 2.0 seconds.  Schedule bursts and timing are as follows: 

| Start of Burst    | Number of      | Interrogation Rate    |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| (ms)              | Interrogations | (per sec)             |
| 0                 | 4              | 2500                  |
| 80                | 4              | 2500                  |
| 160               | 8              | 320                   |
| 320               | 8              | 320                   |
| 480               | 8              | 320                   |
| 640               | 18             | 180                   |
| 1000              | 4              | 2500                  |
| 1080              | 4              | 2500                  |
| 1160              | 8              | 320                   |
| 1320              | 8              | 320                   |
| 1480              | 8              | 320                   |
| 1640              | 18             | 180                   |

 
For the non-storage design, verify compliance with §2.2.13.3.1.b. For the storage design, verify that within two seconds of this subsequence all uplink content appears in proper order as transmitted at the interface terminals. 

## Test Sequence B (Buffer Full)

Within one second, generate interrogation bursts as shown below.  Use short replies to remain within the reply capability of the transponder. 

| Start of Burst    | Number of      | Interrogation Rate    |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| (ms)              | Interrogations | (per sec)             |
| 0                 | 4              | 2500                  |
| 80                | 4              | 2500                  |
| 160               | 8              | 320                   |
| 320               | 8              | 320                   |
| 480               | 8              | 320                   |
| 640               | 18             | 180                   |
| 750               | 16             | 180                   |

Note:
 This sequence is chosen so that the minimum data transfer rate of a storage type interface is exceeded. 

One second after the first burst, verify that the content of at least the first 50 interrogations has appeared at the interface. This test applies only if a storage design has been used. 

## 2.5.4.16 Procedure #16: Broadcast Formats (§2.2.19.1.1.B)

The broadcast function is verified as part of Procedure #15.  A negative test must be conducted to verify that the broadcast function does not occur when short formats are used. 

## Patterns And Sequence:

Interrogate with UF=0, 4, 5 and a broadcast address.  Verify that no information transfer occurs at uplink interfaces as a result of these interrogations. 

2.5.4.17 
Procedure #17: Downlink Interface, DFs 0, 16 
(§2.2.13.3.1, a and b - interface) (§2.2.19.1.16 - protocol) 
(§2.2.14.4.26 - MV) (§2.2.22.1.4) This test procedure verifies that bit insertion into the first 32-bit positions of Mode S 
replies is possible and is carried out without disturbing established fields or protocols. This test procedure also verifies that bit patterns inserted into the MV field of DF=16 are transmitted as inserted. 

## Transponder Design:

The downlink interface for DFs 0 and 16 can exist as a separate port or as one direction of a bidirectional un-buffered (real time) port.  It can also exist as an interface accepting only the bit insertion for DF=0 (short reply). 

All data link transponders use DF=0 and DF=16. 

Note:
2.2.19.1.16

 In TCAS installations, it is possible that a separate interface, according to 
  §
             , exists for UF=DF=0, 16.  Such an interface may not be accessible 
  if TCAS and transponder functions are integrated.  In such circumstances, the 
  test procedures for TCAS shall govern. 

## Patterns For Df=0, 16 Unconditional Insertion

The locations are: 
Bits 9, 10, 11: a total of 3 bits. 

Interface patterns: There are 8 possible unconditional interface patterns to be verified based on these 3 bits. 

Interrogation patterns: 
 
UF=0, RL=0, AQ=1, DS=0. UF=16, RL=1, AQ=1. 

UF=0, RL=1, AQ=1, DS any value other than 0. 

## Conditional Insertion

The locations are: 
Bits 15, 16, 17: These can be inserted only if the interrogation contained AQ=0. 

Interface patterns: There are 8 possible conditional interface patterns to be verified based on these 3 bits. 

Interrogation patterns: 
UF=0, RL=0, AQ=0, DS=0. UF=16, RL=1, AQ=0. UF=0, RL=1, AQ=0, DS any value other than 0. 

Note:  The interrogation that includes a DS value other than ZERO will test that the reply bits are not affected by TCAS Crosslink protocol.  The data content inserted in the ground-initiated Comm-B registers being tested should be other than ALL ZEROs or ALL ONEs. 

## Positive Test Sequences For Df=0, 16 Unconditional Insertion

For each interrogation pattern, generate 8 interrogations while sequencing through all 8 possible interface patterns.  Verify that the replies contain bits as inserted. 

## Conditional Insertion

For each interrogation pattern, generate 8 interrogations while sequencing through all 8 possible interface patterns.  Verify that the replies contain bits as inserted. 

## Negative Test Sequence For Df=0, 16

Disconnect the interface input for the airspeed report or enter code 0 for airspeed.  Insert ONEs for bits 14 through 17 at the downlink interface and interrogate with UF=0, RL=0, AQ=1 and with UF=16, RL=1, AQ=1. Verify that bits 15 through 17 of the replies are ZEROs. 

## Mv Test Sequence For All Data Link Transponders

This test sequence includes all unconditionally inserted bits in addition to the bit patterns of the MV field. 

## Interface Patterns And Test Sequence

Using bits 9 through 11 and 41 through 58, generate 420 interface patterns, 210 containing two ONEs and 210 containing two ZEROs. Interrogate to extract replies of the inserted patterns and verify that they are transmitted as inserted.  In the case of the interrogation with DS other than ZERO, verify that the MV field contains the data of the ground-initiated Comm-B register corresponding to the DS 
value in the interrogation. 

Note:
  The MV field will only contain the requested Comm B data if the transponder is TCAS Crosslink Capable and the requested register is supported by the transponder.  

## 2.5.4.18 Procedure #18: Comm-B Protocol (§2.2.19.1.12 Through §2.2.19.1.12.4) (§2.2.19.2.2 Through §2.2.19.2.3.1) (§2.2.19.2.3.3 Through §2.2.19.2.3.5) (§2.2.19.2.1.2 - Um) (Figure 2-20 - Flowchart)

This test procedure verifies that the Comm-B protocol is carried out correctly. 

The test procedure follows the notation of transponder states and of interrogation patterns as shown in the flowchart. 

## Transponder States

The transponder states are defined by the combinations of conditions E through I, where: 

E 
= 
B-register set: B-bit inserted. 
F 
= 
T-register set: Message has been transmitted.  
G 
= 
Timer runs: For multisite only. 
I 
= 
Next message waiting. 

There are six possible states as shown below: 

#

As above, next message waiting. 
5

1 
0 
In multisite, interrogation with wrong IIS can not close out. 
6 
1 
1 
1 
1 
In multisite, next message waiting 

State 5 must be tested with all 15 IIS codes. 

It is not necessary to test State 6 with all IIS codes with all interrogation patterns. However, the IIS used in the multisite reservation should be changed each time the transponder has to be returned to State 6 after a previous interrogation pattern that changed it to another State.

2 Condition K also includes conditions M *and* N.   
 
The symbols A, B, C, etc., correspond to the symbols on the flowchart (Figure 2-20). 

For IIS sensitive interrogation patterns, use IIS≠0 unless stated in the table. For State 6, always use the correct IIS code with the exception of interrogation pattern 24, where an incorrect IIS code is also used. 

When the IIS code must not equal ZERO (0), or must be incorrect, the value used should be varied with different interrogation patterns. 

Interrogation patterns 10, 11, 22, 23 are forbidden to the sensor.  They must be used to verify that the transponder makes reservations only when the reservation is accompanied by extraction of the message. To 'set the B-bit', use DR=1 and DR=3 commands alternately during the test sequence. 

If PC is not required to be 4, use all other codes.  If MBS is not required to be 1 or 2, use codes 0 and 3.  If RR is required to be less than 16, use all codes less than 16. 

## Test Sequence.

All 1435 combinations of the transponder states and interrogation patterns must be used. Additional interrogations may be needed to set transponder states.  The test sequence may be set up so that when the transponder enters a given state, all interrogation patterns are used that will not change the state, followed by patterns that will.  The test then proceeds with the newly acquired state.   

## Um Field Verification

During the test sequence when the DI is required to be 1, alternately use RSS=0 and 1, and when DI is not required to be 1, alternately use DI=0 and 7, so that the reply will contain IIS and IDS in the UM field according to §
2.2.19.1.9.  DI=3 is required for certain interrogation patterns and transponder states in order to verify that attempts to cancel a Comm-B via PC=4 when DI=3 does not incorrectly cancel the message and to verify that interrogations with RR=16, DI=3 and RRS=0 do not set the T register. These fields are used to verify the Comm-B reservation status and associated IIS as a result of each interrogation pattern and transponder state. 

## Required Negative Tests Concurrent Tests Are Part Of The Sequence Above.

Inserted tests must be interspersed within the sequence. 

Insert interrogations of formats other than UF=4, 5, 20, 21 and verify that they have no effect on the protocol. Such interrogations should constitute one percent of the total number of interrogations used. The interrogation patterns 2 and 14 must include, when RR=16 is used, the combinations of RR=16 with DI=3or7 and RRS Codes 1 through 15.  It must be verified that these combinations do not cause the air-initiated Comm-B message to be transmitted. Additional interrogation sequences are required to verify that SD content is not misinterpreted as Comm-B multisite reservation or cancellation requests when DI is not equal 1.  Use the following interrogations using all DI values other than 1 with SD content consistent with the Comm-B multisite reservation or cancellation requests required by interrogation patterns 7 and 12 as if DI were equal to 1: Interrogation pattern 7 DI≠0 or 7, State 5 (IIS correct) - expected results 5 a,d,e Interrogation pattern 7 DI=0 and 7, State 5 (IIS correct) - expected results 5 a,d,f  

Interrogation pattern 8 DI≠0 or 7, State 5 (IIS correct) - expected results 5 a,d,e,j 
Interrogation pattern 8 DI=0 and 7, State 5 (IIS correct) - expected results 5 a,d,f,j Interrogation pattern 12 DI≠3 or 7, State 2 - expected results 3 b,d,e,j 
Interrogation pattern 12 RR=16, DI=3 and RRS=0, State 2 - expected results 2 b,d,e,j 
Note:
 Interrogation pattern 12 can not be tested with DI=7 since the SD content would 
contain RRS≠0 when the equivalent bits for MBS=1 (for DI=1) are set.   
Additional interrogation sequences are required to verify that SD content is not misinterpreted as containing an IIS code (when DI≠0, 1 or 7) when a multisite reservation is active and a non-selective cancellation is requested.  Use the following interrogations using all DI values other than 0, 1 or 7 with SD content consistent with the correct IIS in bits 17-20 for interrogation patterns 13 and 15: 
Interrogation pattern 13 State 5 (IIS correct) - expected results 5 a,d,e 

Interrogation pattern 15 State 5 (IIS correct) - expected results 5 b,d,e,j 

## Timer Duration And Automatic Closeout Test

Arrange the sequence so that the timer runs out occasionally.  Verify timer duration and closeout. 

Either during the test sequence or in a separate test, verify that interrogation patterns 10, 11, and 12 do not restart the timer when the transponder is in state 5 and the IIS is incorrect.  Verify that interrogation patterns 10 and 11 do not restart the timer when the transponder is in state 5 and the IIS is correct.  Verify that interrogation pattern 12 does restart the timer when the transponder is in state 5 and the IIS is correct. 

## Simultaneous Tests

While the transponder is undergoing the verification of the B-protocol, the number of interrogations and replies can be used to make tests for interface action, message content, etc.  Such tests are described in Procedures 19 through 23.

## 2.5.4.18A Procedure #18A Enhanced Comm-B Protocol

If the transponder adheres to the enhanced air-initiated Comm-B protocol as described in 
§2.2.21.1.2, the following test procedures **shall** verify that the enhanced protocol is carried out correctly by the transponder. The following tests verify that: 
The transponder will properly carry out the Comm-B protocol and will operate with nonselective interrogators, interrogators in multisite configuration and interrogators that will take advantage of the enhanced protocol and extract B messages without making Comm-
B reservations.  The modified Comm-B protocol test will verify that the transponder can properly carry out the enhanced Comm-B protocol, handling 16 independent B timers, one for each II and up to 16 concurrent Comm-B messages waiting indications to ground interrogators.  

## Procedure:

The transponder **shall** be tested according to the guidelines stipulated in procedure 18 
with the following additions and/or modifications: 
Transponder conditions E and F are defined for non-selective and IIS values 1 - 15.  The transponder condition G is defined for IIS values 1 - 15.  Condition H is no longer a necessary condition since the transponder can have 15 concurrent reservations.  
Procedure 18
 is expanded to include additional combinations of conditions E, F and G.  
For current transponder state 1, produce 15 additional states with a Comm-B message not waiting for II=1 - 15.  As the II varies, vary the number of other Comm-B messages waiting for the remaining II values from 0 - 15.  States 2 and 3 must be similarly expanded except these states stipulate a Comm-B message waiting as II varies from 0 - 
15.  The number of Comm-B messages waiting concurrently with the Comm-B message for the II under test is to vary from 0 - 15.  It should be noted that state changes from interrogations will be more extensive with the enhanced protocol and that proper setup is required to produce the required transponder states.  It is necessary to produce a Comm- B message waiting for the proper IIS by input of directed Comm-Bs to the transponder or a Comm-B message for II of 0 followed by the extraction by the necessary IIS. Verification of proper transponder state requires multiple interrogations to extract the transponder state for each IIS.  An air initiated Comm-B message which is extracted by a non zero IIS potentially changes all 16 Comm-B message states.  Those interrogation patterns used to close out a Comm-B message for a given IIS must insure that the proper message for the given IIS is closed out.  The reply data for Comm-B messages **shall** be verified.  Each of the interrogation patterns 1 through 24 inclusive are now IIS sensitive and must be run for each IIS value. 

Additionally, verify for each IIS that upon B timer expiration, the message for that IIS is indicated as available to all other available II codes.  Repeat the procedures defined above for 2, 3 and 4 segment Comm-Bs and insure that the proper data is indicated in the replies.  

## Um Field Verification

In all cases, verify that the transponder reports the proper state in the UM field and the report is for the IIS contained in the interrogation pattern.

2.5.4.20 
Procedure #20: Extended Capability Report 
(§2.2.14.4.21 - BDS) (§2.2.14.4.35 - RR) (§2.2.19.1.12.2 - extended data source) (§2.2.19.1.12.6 through §2.2.19.1.12.6.2 - protocol)  
(§2.2.19.1.12.6.3 - updating) (§2.2.19.1.17 - interface) 
(§2.2.22.1.2.2) 
This test procedure verifies that the transponder, given the correct interrogation, reports its capability in the MB field of a Comm-B reply.  Also verified is the correct functioning of the interface used (if any) and the updating function if it is part of the transponder. 

## Interface

The source that generates the content of the extended capability report may be internal or external to the transponder.  If internal, only the correctness of the report can be verified, if external and not connected to the transponder, the interface action must be verified. 

## Interface Patterns

The extended capability report occupies the last 48 bits of MB and carries BDS1=1 and BDS2=0, 1; BDS2 codes larger than 1 may also be used. 

A total of 2256 interface verification patterns (Procedure #19) must be used if an external report source is used. 

## Interrogation Patterns

If during the B-protocol test procedure (Procedure #18) an interrogation pattern is used that requires RR to be larger than 16 (Column L), use RR=17 as often as required to carry out the extended capability report verification. 

## Test Sequence For Internal Report Source

Use RR=17 and, if required, RR=17, DI=7 and RRS=required BDS2 to extract the report. Verify that the content of the report is correct. If possible, change the capability and observe that the transponder gives a broadcast Comm-B request.  Verify the content of the new report. 

## 2.5.4.21 Procedure #21: Directed Comm-B (§2.2.19.2.3.2 - Protocol) (§2.2.13.3.2 - Interface [See Note])

This test procedure verifies that multisite directed Comm-B transmissions are carried out correctly by the transponder. 

## Transponder Design

The command to the transponder, that an air-initiated Comm-B **shall** be directed to a known sensor, originates in a peripheral device.  The transponder must recognize such a command and may be designed to accept it in one of two ways. 

One possible design operates as follows: Regardless of the transponder state, the interface inserts a downlink pattern containing DR=1 (the B-bit), IIS (the UM code of the desired destination), and IDS (the UM Comm-B reservation code).  Usually, the transponder would pass through the IIS and IDS codes without further examination.  For this function, however, both are sensed so that, as soon as the TRB timer is found not to be running, this pattern can be used for a routine surveillance or communication reply.  The protocol sequence as tested in Procedure #18 then takes over and completes the transaction cycle. 

Another design would provide for a separate dedicated interface which may accept only the desired destination or may be designed to take all of the directed communication. 

The interface adapter used in the test setup must conform to the design of the transponder to be tested. 

## Interface Patterns Of Test Sequence

During the B-protocol test procedure (Procedure #18), use the interface pattern as described above or enter into the special interface the patterns necessary to cause a directed Comm-B initiation. 

Use IIS codes from 1 to 15 (a total of 15 codes) and reply formats DF=4, 5, 20, 21. Verify that the pattern transmitted by the transponder corresponds to the pattern inserted. Give special attention to the BDS codes that may have been inserted, depending on transponder design. Verify that this directed Comm-B has not interrupted another existing reservation condition.  If the transponder has implemented the enhanced multisite Comm-B protocol, verify that if an air-initiated message has been extracted by a given non zero IIS and the transponder is currently reserved for the IIS extracting it, that a directed Comm-B 
message to this IIS is queued and made available subsequent to the closeout of the B message to this IIS. Verification that this Comm-B has been extracted by the assigned interrogator is intrinsic in Procedure #18 and need not be repeated. 

## 2.5.4.21A Procedure #21A Comm-B Broadcast (§2.2.19.1.12.5 Protocol)

Test Procedure: 

1. The command to the transponder that a Comm-B broadcast message **shall** be sent 
originates in a peripheral device or in the device that holds the extended capability report. 
2. The Comm-B broadcast does not affect the existing Comm-B protocol, air or ground 
initiated.  The existing test procedures remain unchanged. 
3. Verification of interface patterns is already part of the Comm-B test procedures and 
need not be repeated for the Comm-B Broadcast. 
This test procedure verifies that the Comm-B broadcast protocol is carried out correctly. 

During the B-protocol test procedure (Procedure #18) insert the appropriate DR code command and text of the Comm-B broadcast into the transponder. 

Verify that: 

1. 
The transponder does show the DR codes 4, 5, 6, or 7 only when no air-initiated 
Comm-B transaction is in progress. 
2. 
The Comm-B broadcast message can be extracted by the interrogator for 18 ±1 seconds. 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

3. 
The Comm-B broadcast annunciation (DR=4, 5, 6, or 7) and the Comm-B 
broadcast text are interrupted by an air-initiated Comm-B initiation and reappear 
when that transaction is concluded.  For transponders implementing the enhanced air initiated Comm-B protocol, the transponder will be independently interrupted by up to 16 Comm-B messages that are assigned to each II code.  After the 
Comm-B is concluded for each II, the Comm-B broadcast is again available to 
that interrogator.  Verify that the next waiting broadcast message is not announced to any interrogators until the current broadcast message has timed out for all interrogators. 
4. 
After interruption another 18 ±1 seconds of broadcast time is available to the interrogator.  For transponders implementing the enhanced air-initiated Comm-B 
protocol, the transponder will be independently interrupted by up to 16 Comm-B messages that are assigned to each II code.  After interruption, another 18 ±1 seconds of broadcast time is available for each II. 
5. 
A subsequent and different Comm-B broadcast message is announced with the 
alternate DR code and that this DR code also follows verifications 1 through 4 above.  For transponders implementing the enhanced air-initiated Comm-B 
protocol, the transponder will be independently interrupted by up to 16 Comm-B 
messages that are assigned to each II code.  The subsequent Comm-B broadcast 
is announced only after each Comm-B is broadcast timer has expired for all II 
codes. 
2.5.4.22 
Procedure #22: Downlink Interface, Storage Design, Buffer Rate 
(§2.2.13.3.2.c - buffer rate) (§2.2.13.3.2.d - buffer function) 
(§2.2.13.3.2.e - unavailable data) 
(§2.2.3.4.2 - data rate) 
This test procedure verifies that, when a storage design is used for the downlink interface, the buffer functions correctly and that the buffer capacity is sufficient.  Transponder action when data are not available is also verified. 

## Interface Patterns

The buffer must contain at least 16 MB patterns.  The 16 MB patterns can have 16 different BDS1 and 16 different BDS2 codes, a total of 256.  Several messages (MB patterns) with identical codes can exist for insertion as air-initiated Comm-B. 

## Air-Initiated Comm-B

The buffer must have space to indicate which of the stored MB patterns are intended for air-initiated Comm-B.  It must have means to sequence their insertion in the order received. 

## Message Output

If the interface circuit used for the AIS and the extended capability reports is also used in this test, message content verification has already been done.  It is recommended that differing patterns be used for different BDS codes. If the interface circuit is not the one already verified, the 2256 test patterns described in Procedure #19 must be used. 

## Buffer Input Rate

The buffer input rate must be at least 16 MB patterns per second; there is no upper limit, because aircraft data can be updated so that a newly arrived pattern replaces an already stored pattern of the same BDS code. 

## Test Sequence, Buffer Design

Enter 16 messages into the downlink interface in the following sequence: 

a. 
Five messages with different BDS codes and intended for air-initiated Comm-B. 
b. 
Eight messages with different BDSl codes intended for ground initiation. 
c. 
Two messages with BDS codes identical to the codes intended for air-initiation but with message content differing. 
d. 
One message identical in BDS code but differing in content from the group in b above. 
The object of this test sequence is to verify that: 
The five air-initiated messages are delivered in the sequence received, and the B-Protocol (Column L of the interrogation patterns listed in Procedure #18) is carried out correctly. The differing BDS codes serve to identify the sequence of the messages. The 8 ground-initiated messages are extracted by RR corresponding to their BDS1 code in a sequence chosen by the interrogator and that these messages can be extracted several times each. The buffer has separately stored messages not intended for air-initiation, i.e., the buffer must not replace existing BDS codes if they are intended for air-initiation. 

The message in "d" above has replaced (updated) one of the eight ground-initiated messages and that only this message, rather than the previous entry, is transmitted when the interrogator calls for it. An MB field consisting of ALL ZEROs is transmitted if the interrogation asks for a BDS code not presently in the buffer. 

This test sequence fits into the sequence of Procedure #18. 

## Test Sequence, Buffer Rate And Function

Enter 16 messages with differing BDS (BDS1 and BDS2) codes into the buffer. 

In the next three seconds: 

a. 
Interrogate at a rate of 1250/sec (once every 800 microseconds), extracting the messages from the buffer by use of the required RR, DI and RRS codes.  Stop interrogating after all messages have been received once. 
b. 
Start entering replacement messages with differing content but identical BDS codes at the rate of at least 16/sec. 
c. 
One second after the start of this sequence (a), start extracting the messages again.  Schedule extraction in bursts, each burst consisting of two interrogations following each other 800 microseconds apart.  Schedule eight bursts, one after each 125 milliseconds. 
d. 
Two seconds after the start, continue extracting messages at the rate of five/sec. 
Verifications: 
Test "a" above verifies that the transponder and the buffer can sustain the minimum reply rate as specified. 

Tests "b" and "c" are used to verify that messages of like BDS codes are replaced and that in this process no scrambling of messages occurs. 

Test "d" verifies that, as messages are updated, they are replaced within the buffer structure regardless of whether they have been transmitted. 

This test sequence fits into the sequence of Procedure #18. 

## 2.5.4.23 Procedure #23: Downlink Interface, No-Storage Design (§2.2.13.1.2.A - Insertion) (§2.2.13.3.2.B - No-Storage Design) (§2.2.13.3.2.E - Unavailable Data)

This test procedure verifies that the no-storage design or "real time" downlink interface performs as specified. 

## Interface Patterns

This downlink interface operates in real time in conjunction with an uplink interface that also is a no-storage design.  Message extraction commands for Comm-B appearing at the uplink interface are recognized by the message source which then enters the downlink content into the downlink interface in time to be transmitted in reply to the interrogation. 

For air-initiated Comm-B transactions, the interface can insert the B-bit Code (DR=1) into short and long replies. For directed Comm-B transmissions (Procedure #21), insertion of IIS and IDS into the UM field is required. 

Because the data rate of a real-time interface equals the data rate of the transponder by definition, rate verifications are not necessary. 

## Test Sequence

If during the B-protocol test procedure (Procedure #18) messages have to be sent or message content has to be verified, supply this interface with the patterns required. 

Verify interface design correctness by use of the 2256 test patterns described in Procedure #19. Verify that B-bit insertion is accepted by the transponder in all applicable formats and that IIS and IDS insertion is accepted by the transponder only if the UM field is not in use for another purpose. 

2.5.4.24 
Procedure #24: Comm-C Protocol 
(§2.2.20.1.1 through §2.2.20.1.1.1.8 - protocol)  
(§2.2.20.1.3 through §2.2.20.1.3.5 - multisite)  
(§2.2.19.2.1.1 through §2.2.19.2.2.2 - multisite) 
(Figure 2-21 and Figure 2-22 - Flowchart) 
This test procedure verifies that the Comm-C protocol is carried out correctly. 

The test procedure follows the notation of transponder states and of interrogation patterns as shown in the flowcharts.

Patterns 5 and 6 must be repeated 16 times for all IIS values. 

Patterns 14, 15 and 16 must be repeated 15 times for all valid NC values. 

There are 88 interrogation patterns to be used. 

## Test Sequence

All 31152 combinations of the 354 transponder states and 88 valid interrogation patterns must be used.  Interrogate so that the transponder enters a given state and then use all interrogation patterns that will not change the state, followed by patterns that will. Repeat with the now-acquired state.  This must be done until all 31152 combinations have been exhausted.  Some combinations must be repeated because more than one interrogation pattern can change the state.  Extraction of TAS (see flowchart) can be used for verification. 

## Required Negative Tests

If PC is not required to be 5, use all other codes.  If MES is not required to be l, 2, 5, 6, 7, use all other codes. If RC is not required to be 0, 1, 2, use RC=3. Insert interrogation formats other than UF=4, 5, 20, 21, 24 one percent of the time to verify that they have no effect on the protocol. 

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## Um Field Verification

During the test sequence when a multisite reservation is made (patterns 6, 12), the following reply will contain IIS and IDS in the UM field according to §
2.2.19.2.1.2.  
Verify that the UM content is correct. 

## Tas Field Verification

During the test sequence when a TAS report is requested (pattern 14), the reply will contain the TAS field.  Verify that the content of TAS is correct. 

## Timer Duration And Automatic Closeout Test

Arrange the sequence so that the timer runs out occasionally and verify timer duration and closeout. 

## Simultaneous Tests

While the transponder is undergoing the verification of the C-protocol, the interrogations can also be used to make tests for interface action and message content.  These tests are described in Procedure #25. 

## Enhanced Uplink Elm Protocol

If the enhanced uplink ELM protocol is implemented, the procedure above is modified to reflect the automatic reservation of uplink ELMs.  Transponder states 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are eliminated.  The remaining states 1, 7, 8 and 9 are expanded because of conditions H, J and K varying for each II code.  Condition H is expanded to 16 conditions, one for each II code.  Condition I is no longer meaningful.  Conditions J and K are also expanded to 16, one for each II code.  State 1 for II code of 0 is simultaneous with the other 15 II codes varying between states 1, 7, 8 and 9.  The number of iterations to run every possible combination is impractical.  The test procedure will use different combinations of the additional possible states to provide verification of parallel operations. Interrogation patterns 14, 15 and 16 are further repeated 16 times for all IIS values.  The verification procedure will include matching the reported segment data for each II code to that sent in the interrogation.  The subset of the expanded states to run are: 
 

1) 
16 states, where the conditions are met once for each of the II codes. 
2) 
15 states, where the conditions are met for II code 0 along with one single II code. 
3) 
15 states, where the conditions are met for 2 non zero II codes, 3, 4, 5, etc., to 15 parallel non zero II codes and ending with all 16 II codes meeting the conditions. 
The conditions for the other II codes not stipulated can be uniformly selected to provide a distribution of concurrent conditions. The above results in 46 states to test in replacement of state 1, 46 states from state 7, 46 states to replace state 8 and 690 states to replace state 9.  

2.5.4.25 
Procedure #25: Uplink Interface, ELM-C 
(§2.2.13.4 - interface) (§2.2.20.1.4 - interface rate) 
This test procedure verifies that the information contained in Comm-C interrogations passes out of the transponder within the specified time interval and that such information correctly replicates the received transmission content.  This test is independent of the interface design. 

## Interrogation Pattern

UF=24. 

MC=6320 different patterns, half containing two ONEs, half containing two ZEROs. 

## Test Sequence

If during the C-Protocol test procedure (Procedure #24), all segments have been received and are shifted out of the interface (Column K), verify that their content corresponds to the previously inserted patterns. Verify that the content of four 16 segment ELMs can be extracted from the interface in any four second interval or, in one second if the transponder adheres to the enhanced uplink ELM protocol. Interrogate with a burst of 16 segments and repeat 4 seconds later, one second later if the transponder adheres to the enhanced uplink ELM protocol. Verify that the content of the first burst appears at the interface before the second burst is transmitted. Verify the content of both bursts. This test fits into the sequence of Procedure #24.

(§2.2.20.2.1.1 through §2.2.20.2.1.1.5 - ELM-D) 
(Figure 2-23 and Figure 2-24 - Flowchart) 

 
This test procedure verifies that the Comm-D protocol is carried out correctly. The test procedure follows the notation of transponder states and interrogation patterns as shown in the flowcharts.

Patterns 5, 6, 11, 12, must be used at least 16 times to provide for all II codes. Pattern 14 must be used as often as necessary to exhaust the SRS and DR codes according to the capability of the transponder. Verify that cancellation does not occur when the D-register of Figure 2-23 and Figure 2-
24 is not set, i.e., when no request for transmission has been complied with yet. 

## Test Sequence

The number of combinations of transponder states and interrogation patterns is design dependent.  All combinations must be exercised. 

## Dr Verification

At the Comm-B downlink interface, apply a request for air-initiated Comm-B (DR=1), and at the Comm-D interface apply a request to send a Comm-D ELM (DR larger than 
15). 

Verify that Comm-B has priority by observing that the B-protocol must be closed out before the DR code of the Comm-D transaction appears in replies. 

Verify that the DR field in DF=4, 5, 20, 21 correctly states the number of segments waiting at the interface to be transmitted. 

## Um Verification

If a multisite reservation is made during the test sequence (patterns 6, 12), the following reply will contain IIS and IDS in the UM field according to §
2.2.19.2.1.2.  Verify that the UM content is correct. 

## Srs Verification

Consider the SRS bit pattern as a code of length corresponding to the maximum burst capability of the transponder.  Use all combinations containing two ONEs and all combinations containing two ZEROs for this word length as the test pattern for the following verifications. 

Verify that the transponder correctly transmits the number and identity of segments requested in the SRS subfield of UF=24 with RC=3. The identity of segments is indicated in the ND field of each segment and must be inserted at the ELM downlink interface. 

Verify that if SRS requests a segment identity which is not available in this transaction, the transponder will send ND according to the request but will leave the MD field of that reply all ZEROs. 

## Required Negative Tests

If PC is not required to be 6, use all other codes.  If DI is not required to be 1, use all other codes.  If MES is not required to be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 use all other codes. 

Insert interrogation formats other than UF=4, 5, 20, 21, 24 one percent of the time to verify that they have no effect on the protocol. 

## Timer Duration And Automatic Closeout Test

Arrange the sequence so that the timer runs out occasionally and verify timer duration and closeout. 

## Simultaneous Tests

While the transponder is undergoing the verification of the D-Protocol, the number of interrogations can be used to make tests for interface action and message content.  These tests are described in Procedures #27 and #28. 

## Enhanced Downlink Elm Protocol

If the transponder adheres to the enhanced multisite downlink ELM protocol as described in §
2.2.21.3, the following test procedures **shall** verify that the enhanced protocol is carried out correctly by the transponder. 

The transponder **shall** be tested according to the guidelines stipulated above with the following additions and/or modifications: 
Transponder condition E is defined for non-selective and IIS values 1 - 15.  The transponder condition F is no longer meaningful. The test will be expanded to include the additional combinations of condition E since the condition exists for each II.  The resulting transponder states consist of all combinations of conditions for each of the 16 II codes.   

## Um Verification

In all cases, verify that the transponder reports the proper state in the UM field and the report is for the IIS contained in the interrogation pattern. 

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## Dr Verification

Verify the DR code as described with the addition of DR code extraction for all IIS codes and under the conditions of concurrent B messages, B broadcast messages and downlink ELMs. 

## 2.5.4.27 Procedure #27: Directed Comm-D (§2.2.20.2.3.2 - Protocol)

This test procedure verifies that multisite directed Comm-D transactions are carried out correctly by the transponder. 

The comments on transponder design dependence of this test are essentially the same as presented in Procedure #21. 

## Interface Patterns Of Test Sequence

During the D-protocol test procedure (Procedure #26) enter into the interface a downlink pattern containing DR corresponding to the number of segments to be transmitted, IDS=3 (the UM code for Comm-D reservation) and IIS corresponding to the desired destination's code. 

Use all IIS codes from 1 to 15 and interrogate so that the downlink formats DF=4, 5, 20, 21 are used. Verify that this directed Comm-D has not interrupted an existing reservation condition. 

Reply and coding content are verified as part of Procedures #26 and #28 respectively. 

## 2.5.4.28 Procedure #28: Comm-D Interface, Rate And Content (§2.2.13.4 - Interface) (§2.2.20.2.4 - Data Rate)

This test procedure verifies that the downlink interface can sustain the required data rate and that the transponder transmits downlink content as entered. 

## Transponder Design

The Comm-D interface can exist as a separate port or as one direction of a bidirectional ELM (C/D) interface.  The downlink port can be designed to take the ND and MD fields only, leaving the UF and KE generation to internal circuitry.  Another design would need input for DF and KE as well. 

The minimum input data rate for this interface must equal the maximum reply capability of the transponder.  The maximum practical reply capability is 16 segments in four seconds, although that is not specified in this document. 

## Interface Patterns

For each ND code appropriate for the transponder under test, generate a total of 6320 MD patterns, half containing two ONEs and half containing two ZEROs. 

## Test Sequence

Use all required MD patterns and all ND patterns possible for this transponder. Verify that the patterns are transmitted as entered. 

Schedule Comm-D transactions at the maximum rate for which the transponder is designed (4 to 16 segment DELMs at a rate of one per 4 seconds for a standard DELM transponder, 16 segment DELMs at a rate of one per second for an enhanced DELM transponder). Verify that the interface can supply new MD patterns at those rates. 

Note:
 It may be necessary to schedule more Comm-D transactions than are required for the protocol test alone. 

## 2.5.4.29 Not Used 2.5.4.30 Procedure #30: Sensitivity Level Operation (§2.2.22.1.1 And §2.2.22.1.5)

This test verifies that the transponder (1) accepts incoming UF=20, 21 interrogations containing a Sensitivity Level Command Message and passes all necessary information (IIS and SLC subfields) to the TCAS unit, and (2) receives sensitivity level information from the TCAS unit and correctly reports this information in outgoing DF=0, 16 replies. 

a.

sensitivity level=6 to the transponder via the transponder/TCAS interface. 
Interrogate the transponder with a UF=0 and a UF=16 non-acquisition interrogation. Show that the transponder correctly reports the TCAS status and sensitivity level in the RI and SL fields respectively. 

b. 
Interrogate the transponder with a UF=20 interrogation containing a Sensitivity Level Command Message (ADS1=0, ADS2=5, and TMS=0) with IIS=1 and SLC=4. 
Show that the IIS and SLC subfields are correctly output on the transponder/TCAS interface. 

c. 
Interrogate the transponder with a UF=21 interrogation containing a Sensitivity Level Command Message with IIS=15 and SLC=5. 
Show that the IIS and SLC subfields are correctly output on the transponder/TCAS interface.

Show that the transponder correctly reports the TCAS status and sensitivity level in the RI and SL fields respectively. 

 
2.5.4.31 
Procedure #31: Transmission of RA Report to Mode S Sensor (§2.2.22.h and 
§2.2.22.1.2.1) 
This test verifies that the transponder correctly determines the transponder/TCAS system capability (either FAA TSO-C119a or RTCA/DO-185A/B compatibility) based on communication with the on-board TCAS unit and then reports RA information in the appropriate format.  This test requires that the transponder demonstrate proper operation with both FAA TSO-C119a and RTCA/DO-185A/B compatible transponder/TCAS 
interfaces. 

This test verifies that the transponder correctly (1) receives RA information from the TCAS unit, (2) indicates to the ground (DR field in DF=4, 5, 20, and 21 replies) that it has information awaiting downlink, (3) transmits this information in DF=20, 21 replies, (4) retains RA information for 18 ±1 seconds following the end of the RA, and (5) (for RTCA/DO-185A/B compatible transponder/TCAS systems) properly indicates the end of the RA via the RA Terminated indicator. 

Note:
 The tests refer to a "TCAS bit" in the DR field of DF=4, 5, 20, and 21 replies.  
The TCAS bit is interpreted herein as bit 12 of the 5-bit (bits 9 - 13) DR field. That is, if DR=2, 3, 6, or 7, then the "TCAS bit" is set, and the transponder is therefore indicating that it has TCAS information available.

## 2.5.4.35 Procedure #35: Mu Messages To Tcas (§2.2.22.1.3)

This test verifies that the transponder correctly:  

1) accepts UF=16 interrogations with MU data containing a TCAS Resolution Message 
(UDS=48) and passes all necessary information to the TCAS unit; 
2) accepts UF=16 broadcast interrogations with MU data containing a TCAS Broadcast 
Message (UDS=50) and passes all necessary information to the TCAS unit; and 
3) does not transfer the MU data of UF=16 discrete interrogations with UDS≠48 and 
broadcast interrogations with UDS≠50 to the TCAS unit. 
a. Interrogate the transponder with a valid UF=16 TCAS Coordination Message 
(UDS1=3, UDS2=0).  Verify that the transponder replies with a valid DF=16 Coordination Reply Message and the data content of the MU field is correctly output on the transponder/TCAS interface. 
b. In one second, interrogate the transponder with ten UF=16 interrogations, each 
containing a TCAS Broadcast Message (UDS1=3, UDS2=2, and interrogation address all ONEs), each containing a unique "own" Mode S address (i.e., ten different Mode S addresses).  Verify that the MU data for each interrogation is 
correctly output on the transponder/TCAS interface. 
c. Interrogate the transponder at the rate of 10 per second or less with 255 UF=16 
interrogations addressed to the transponder with UDS values from 0 to 255 except for UDS=48.  Verify that the transponder does not output the messages over the transponder/TCAS interface. 
d. Interrogate the transponder at the rate of 10 per second or less with 255 UF=16 
broadcast interrogations with UDS values from 0 to 255 except for UDS=50. Verify that the transponder does not output the messages over the transponder/TCAS interface. 

## 2.5.4.36 Procedure #36: Transponder Replies To Incoming Tcas Resolution Messages (§2.2.22.2.1)

This test verifies that: 

1) whenever the transponder replies with a valid Coordination Reply Message to an 
incoming TCAS Resolution Message, the incoming message is successfully delivered to the TCAS unit; and  
2) whenever the transponder's internal queue is full or some other condition is present 
which would prevent delivery of the message to TCAS, the transponder does not reply with a valid Coordination Reply Message to an incoming TCAS Resolution Message and does not pass the incoming data to TCAS. 
a. Interrogate the transponder with a UF=16 interrogation containing a valid TCAS 
Resolution Message when all of the following conditions are true: the transponder is reporting that it has an operational TCAS; no transponder queues are full; and no TCAS failure conditions exist. 
Demonstrate that the transponder transmits a valid Coordination Reply Message and that the incoming coordination information is correctly output on the transponder/TCAS interface. 

b. Interrogate the transponder with a UF=16 interrogation containing a valid TCAS 
Resolution Message when the transponder queue is full.  Demonstrate that the 
transponder does not send a valid Coordination Reply Message and does not output the incoming coordination information on the transponder/TCAS interface.  
Demonstrate that when the queue is full the transponder still replies to interrogations that do not contain information directed to the transponder/TCAS interface. 

c. Interrogate the transponder with a UF=16 interrogation containing a valid TCAS 
Resolution Message when a TCAS failure condition is present (the transponder is 
reporting no resolution advisory capability). 
Demonstrate that the transponder does not send a valid Coordination Reply Message and does not output the incoming coordination information on the transponder/TCAS interface. 

Demonstrate that when a TCAS failure is present the transponder still replies to interrogations that do not contain information directed to the transponder/TCAS interface. 

Note:
 When the transponder does not send a valid reply, it may either send no 
reply or send a DF=16 interrogation with all 56 bits of the MV field 
equal to ZERO. 

## 2.5.4.37 Procedure #37: Transponder/Tcas Throughput (§2.2.22 B And G)

This test verifies that the interrogation input rate requirement and the reply rate limiting requirement referenced above are met by the transponder.  In addition, this test is important for demonstrating that the transponder's internal structures (e.g., queues, timing) have been designed in such a way that they are compatible with any TCAS unit with which the transponder is paired. 

a. 
Interrogate the transponder with UF=16 interrogations for 5 seconds at a continuous rate of 16.6 milliseconds, i.e., 60 interrogations per second.  
Demonstrate that the transponder accepts all interrogations, transmits a valid reply to each interrogation, and correctly outputs the information on the transponder/TCAS interface in the order that it was received by the transponder. 

b. 
Interrogate the transponder with UF=16 interrogations for 5 seconds at a rate greater than that at which the transponder can accept all interrogations. 
Note:
 In some installations, interrogating at a high rate with all UF=16 interrogations 
causes the transponder's internal queue to fill, thus stopping the transponder's acceptance of and reply to interrogations because of the full queue, rather than because of the reply rate limiting.  If this is the case, it is necessary to interrogate the transponder with a mix of short and long interrogations; this mix should include the largest number of UF=16 interrogations that is possible while at the 
same time avoiding any queue overflow.  This will allow the reply rate limiting feature to be tested. 
Demonstrate that the reply rate limiting feature is exercised (i.e., there is a mechanism which recognizes the high interrogation rate and stops the transponder from accepting and replying to replies before the transponder overheats or otherwise becomes adversely affected). 

Demonstrate that the transponder can accept and reply to at least the number of interrogations specified in §2.2.13.3.1.c. 

Demonstrate that for each accepted interrogation, and only for each accepted interrogation, the transponder transmits a valid reply and correctly outputs the information on the transponder/TCAS interface in the order that it was received by the transponder. 

c. 
Interrogate the transponder with UF=16 interrogations at a burst rate greater than that which the transponder can accept.  Maintain the burst scenario for at least 5 seconds. 
Note:
 Burst interrogations must be used to insure that the TCAS interface has not failed 
because of lack of periodic data updates. 
Cause the TCAS test unit to accept information from the transponder at the slowest rate possible including a retry while still conforming to the transponder/TCAS interface protocols. 

Demonstrate that for each accepted interrogation, and only for each accepted interrogation, the transponder transmits a valid reply and correctly outputs the information on the transponder/TCAS interface in the order that it was received by the transponder. 

## 2.5.4.38 Procedure #38: Transponder Communication Timing (§2.2.22.2.4)

This test verifies that the communications timing requirement specified in §2.2.22.2.4 is met. 

a. 
Demonstrate that the elapsed time from the transponder's receipt of an incoming 
UF=16 interrogation containing a TCAS Resolution Message to the receipt by the TCAS test unit from the TCAS/transponder interface is less than or equal to 0.01 second. 
Note:
 This assumes an interrogation rate less than or equal to 60 
interrogations per second. 

## 2.5.4.39 Procedure #39: Tcas Crosslink (§ 2.2.14.4.14, §2.2.14.4.7, And §2.2.18.2.10)

This test verifies that the transponder: 

1) correctly reports the Crosslink Capability (CC) in DF=0 replies, and  
2) decodes the DS field in UF=0 interrogations and correctly responds with the contents 
of the ground initiated Comm-B register in the MV field of the corresponding DF=16 
reply. a. Interrogate the transponder with UF=0, RL=0 interrogations.  Verify that the CC 
field (bit 7) is a one in each DF=0 reply requested.  
b. Generate data for each defined ground-initiated Comm-B message for each of the 
Comm-B registers that can be controlled via an interface or are internal to the 
transponder.  The data content for each register should be unique so that it can be distinguished from all others.  Interrogate the transponder with UF=0, RL=1, and all combinations of DS (1-255).  Verify that the contents of the MV field of each DF=16 reply (whose register could be loaded with a test message) matches the contents of the corresponding Comm-B register requested.  
During the Comm-B protocol test procedure (Procedure #18) or as an extension of the above test, use a TCAS Crosslink type interrogation to extract the ground-initiated Comm-B registers in order to verify the Crosslink protocol operates and correctly reports the proper ground-initiated Comm-B data as the transponder changes Comm-B protocol state (if done as part of Procedure #18, interrogate with UF=0, RL=1, DS = 1 -255 when interrogating with ground MB extraction).

Note:
2.2.24
 Up to this point, the ELS Test Procedures have been written sequentially so as to align with the sequence of the requirements given in §
.  This was possible up to this point as neither Aircraft Identification nor Aircraft Registry data has been provided to the unit under test.  Once data is being provided to the unit under test, the changing of the data drives changes into multiple Registers at virtually the same time.  This presents a problem in attempting to develop test procedures that sequentially track the requirements which have been stated on a Register basis as opposed to a functional basis.  Therefore, the remainder of the ELS Test Procedures are developed on a functional basis with traceability to the requirements in §2.2.24 indicated in the procedures as appropriate. 

## 2.6.6 Baseline Aircraft Identification And Aircraft Registration Testing (§2.2.24.6 And §2.2.24.7)

No test procedure is required for this section since such procedures are provided in the following subparagraphs.   

 

## 2.6.6.1 Part 1: Aircraft Identification And Aircraft Registration Startup (§2.2.24.6 And §2.2.24.7)

Note 1: 
This Part 1 includes validation that back to back broadcasts are generated by the transponder.  The first broadcast for the change in Aircraft 
Identification data in Register 2016 and the second broadcast for the change 
in Data Link Capability in Register 1016 caused by the change in Register 
1016.  Subsequent Parts of §2.6 do not need to validate both broadcasts. 
Note 2: 
Review all subparagraphs of Part 1 prior to performing tests.  This is necessary to establish the appropriate timing between changing data inputs and interrogations.   

## A. Data Initialization: 2.2.24.6.2.1 (§ , §2.2.24.6.3.A, And §2.2.24.7.2)

(1). Provide the transponder with Aircraft Identification Data as specified in the

1. Aircraft Identification only uses eight characters in the downlink "MB" field; 
however, some equipment has indicated that ten input characters may be desired in the future.  Therefore, this table provides for up to ten input characters. 
2. IA-5 refers to International Alphabet No. 5 (IA-5) as provided in Table 8-2 of ICAO 
Annex 10, Volume III, Part 1, last update.  Encoding is shown above being MSB left 
justified (e.g., b7, b6, …….b2, b1.). 
3. DO-181E encoding refers to DO-181E §2.2.19.1.13.f encoding which is equivalent to 
ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, §3.1.2.9.1.2, Table 3-7.  Encoding is shown above being MSB left justified (e.g., b6, b5, ….. b2, b1.). 
4. LSB Encoding shows the IA-5 Encoding reversed with the LSB being Left Justified.  
This encoding is typical of serial input protocols which transmit data LSB first. 
(2). 

## If Implementing Aircraft Registration:

Provide the transponder with Aircraft Registration Data as specified in the following table at a maximum update interval of 1.5 seconds for each character provided.

Note 1: 
         The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
         Comm-B Broadcast is initiated when Aircraft Identification Data is 
         changed. 

Within FIVE (5) seconds of starting the interrogations, verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply with:   
 
The 5 seconds is based on the update rate specified for Register 2016.

Bit 65 ["AIS" subfield (bit 33 of the "MB" field)] set to ONE (1) to indicate Aircraft Identification capability. 
(4). 
Bit 67 [Surveillance Identifier (SI) (bit 35 of the "MB" field)] set to ONE (1) to indicate that the transponder DOES Have "SI" Capability. 
Note 1:
  At this time, the "B" timer started in Part 1.b. should have expired and a 
second (e.g., new) "B" Timer started to annunciate a Datalink Capability 
Report Change for 18 ±1 seconds.  Verification that the first "B" Timer has expired is demonstrated by the transponder replying with the contents of 
Register 1016 as opposed to Register 2016. 
As soon as the reply specified above in this step is observed, start a new Test Timer in order to monitor the "B" timer.   
Verify that the elapsed time of the Test Timer started in Part 1.b is 18 ±1 second.   

## E. Comm-B Broadcast Because Of Data Link Capability Change Termination:

Continue to interrogate the transponder with the interrogation described in Part 1. c. (e.g., the last step) until the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply with "DR" NOT EQUAL to 4, 5, 6, or 7. 

Verify that the elapsed time of the Test Timer started in Part 1.d (e.g., the last step) is 
18 ±1 second.   
Note:
 At this time, the "B" timer started in Part 1.d, as broadcast because of a change in Data Link Capability, should have terminated.

1. Aircraft Identification only uses eight characters in the downlink "MB" field; however, 
some equipments have indicated that ten input characters may be desired in the future. Therefore, this table provides for up to ten input characters. 
2. IA-5 refers to International Alphabet No. 5 (IA-5) as provided in Table 8-2 of ICAO 
Annex 10, Volume III, Part 1, last update.  Encoding is shown above being MSB left justified (e.g., b7, b6, …….b2, b1.). 
3. DO-181E encoding refers to DO-181E §2.2.19.1.13.f encoding which is equivalent to 
ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, §3.1.2.9.1.2, Table 3-7.  Encoding is shown above being 
MSB left justified (e.g., b6, b5, …..b2, b1.). 
4. LSB Encoding shows the IA-5 Encoding reversed with the LSB being Left Justified.  This 
encoding is typical of serial input protocols which transmit data LSB first.

## 2.7 Test Procedures For Enhanced Surveillance (Ehs) Compliant Transponder (§2.2.25)

No test procedure is required for this section since §2.2.25 is introductory material for Enhanced Surveillance (EHS).   

## 2.7.1 Register 1016 - Data Link Capability Report (§2.2.25.1) 2.7.1.1 Purpose And Definition (§2.2.25.1.1)

No direct test procedure is required for this section since the format of each required bit in Register 1016 is verified in subsequent tests.   

## 2.7.1.2 Data Requirements (§2.2.25.1.2) Introduction:

The purpose of this procedure is to verify the setting of the Data Link Capability Report as required in §
2.2.25.1.2 when no capability has been established.  The setting of appropriate bits in Register 1016 as capability is established or changed is demonstrated or verified in subsequent sections. 

Test Procedure: 
Note:
 The primary intent of Part 1 is to validate appropriate capability declaration of No Capability prior to providing data to Register 4016, 5016, or 6016. 

Ensure that NO Aircraft Identification or Aircraft Registration data is being provided to the transponder. 

Ensure that the TCAS / Transponder interface is NOT ACTIVE.  If the interface is active, TCAS will provide data to set the Data Link Capability and thereby compromise the results of the following tests.  Likewise, TCAS could attempt to set the Resolution Advisory Report and thereby compromise the results of the following tests. Ensure that no other data is being provided to the transponder that could result in the loading of BDS registers internal to the transponder. Disable the Extended Squitter and Mode-S Specific Services ("MSSS") functions prior to starting the following procedures in order to keep from setting various BDS registers during the following tests.

Note:
2.2.25
 Up to this point, the EHS Test Procedures have been written sequentially so as to align with the sequence of the requirements given in §
.  This was possible up to this point as NO ELS or EHS data has been provided to the unit under test. Once data is being provided to the unit under test, the changing of the data drives changes into multiple registers at virtually the same time.  This presents a problem in attempting to develop test procedures that sequentially track the requirements which have been stated on a register basis as opposed to a functional basis.  Therefore, the remainder of the ELS Test Procedures are developed on a functional basis with traceability to the requirements in §2.2.25 
indicated in the procedures as appropriate.

1. 
The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a Comm-B Broadcast is initiated.   
2. 
In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents of Register 4016 
changing.  This change causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a 
change to Register 1016, which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B 
Broadcast.   
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer 
runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

1. For bit 48, "0" indicates that no mode information is being provided with which to set bits 49 
through 51,  and "1" indicates that mode information is being provided with which to set bits 49 through 51.  For bits 49 through 51, "0" indicates that the mode is "Not Active", and "1" indicates that the mode is "Active". 
2. When No FMS Vertical Mode Bit information is provided to the transponder, it is expected that 
bits 48 through 51 will be set to "0". 
(5). Target Altitude Bits:
2.2.25.5.2.6

1. For bit 54, "0" indicates that no information is being provided with which to set bits 55 and 56, 
and "1" indicates that information is being provided with which to set bits 55 and 56.  For bits 55 and 56, "01" indicates that the target altitude source is Aircraft Altitude. 
2. When No Target Altitude Bit information is provided to the transponder, it is expected that bits 
54 through 56 will be set to "0".

Note:
 The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated because servicing of Register 5F16 capability 
has changed.  Note that the update to Register 5F16 may take up to one 
minute to change the "DR" Field to declare the broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. 
(2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer 
runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

Note:
 The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated because servicing of Register 5F16 capability 
has changed.  Note that the update to Register 5F16 may take up to one 
minute to change the "DR" Field to declare the broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. 
(2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer 
runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

Comm-B Broadcast is initiated because servicing of Register 5F16 capability 
has changed.  Note that the update to Register 5F16 may take up to one 
minute to change the "DR" Field to declare the broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. 
(2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer 
runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

## 2.7.5.15 Part 15 - Reduced Data Rate (§2.2.25.5.3) Notes:

1. The primary intent of Part 6 beyond data validation in Register 4016 is to validate 
that the MCP /FCU Selected Altitude, FMS Selected Altitude, Barometric Pressure 
Setting, and FMS Vertical Mode Bit Counts in Register 5F16 go to "00" as parameter 
data inputs are reduced to rates that are less than the minimum acceptable rate. 
2. Review all subparagraphs of Part 6 prior to performing tests.  This is necessary to 
establish the appropriate timing between changing data inputs and interrogations. 
a. Data Input Initialization:
2.2.25.5.1
  (§
 and §2.2.25.5.2) 
(1). Mode Control Panel Selected Altitude:
2.2.25.5.2.1
  (§
) 
Via the appropriate Mode Control Panel (or other) interface, set the rate at which valid Selected Altitude data is provided to less than once per two seconds. 
(2). Flight Management System (FMS) Selected Altitude:
2.2.25.5.2.2
  (§
) 
Via the appropriate FMS (or other) interface, set the rate at which valid FMS Selected Altitude data is provided to less than once per two seconds. 
(3). Air Data System (ADS) input of Barometric Pressure Setting:
2.2.25.5.2.3
  (§
) 
Via the appropriate ADS (or other) interface, set the rate at which valid Barometric Pressure Setting data is provided to less than once per two seconds. 
(4). FMS Vertical Mode Bits:
2.2.25.5.2.4
  (§
) 
Via the appropriate interface, set the rate at which valid FMS Vertical Mode data is provided to less than once per two seconds. 
(5). Target Altitude Bits:
2.2.25.5.2.6
  (§
) 
Via the appropriate interface, set the rate at which valid Target Altitude data is 
provided to less than once per two seconds. 
b. Register 4016 **Capability Verification**:
2.2.25.1.4
  (§
 and §2.2.25.5 through 
§2.2.25.5.3) 
Within ONE (1) second of providing the transponder with data as detailed in Part 6.a, interrogate the transponder with the following GICB Extraction interrogation in order to extract the Register 4016 - Selected Vertical Intention data.

Note:
 The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated because servicing of Register 5F16 capability 
has changed.  Note that the update to Register 5F16 may take up to one 
minute to change the "DR" Field to declare the broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. 
(2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer 
runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

## 2.7.5.16 Part 16 - Multiple Data Sources  (§2.2.25 Through §2.2.25.5)

If Multiple Data Sources of Register 4016 parameters are provided to the Unit-Under-Test 
(UUT), then REPEAT all applicable sections of Part 2 for each additional data source that was not tested while performing Parts 1 through 14 above. 

 

## 2.7.6 Register 5016 Enhanced Surveillance - Protocol And Interface (§2.2.25.6) Introduction:

The intent of this test procedure is to validate all aspects of Enhanced Surveillance Servicing of Register 5016.   

## 2.7.6.1 Part 1 - Capability Verification (§2.2.25.6) Test Procedure:

Note:
 The primary intent of Part 1 is to validate appropriate capability declaration of No Capability prior to providing data to Register 5016.   
Ensure that NO Flight Identification or Aircraft Registration data is being provided to the transponder.   
Ensure that the TCAS / Transponder interface is NOT ACTIVE.  If the interface is active, TCAS will provide data to set the Data Link Capability and thereby compromise the results of the following tests.  Likewise, TCAS could attempt to set the Resolution Advisory Report and thereby compromise the results of the following tests. Ensure that no other data is being provided to the transponder that could result in the loading of BDS registers internal to the transponder.  This includes NO Servicing of Register 4016.   
Disable the Extended Squitter function prior to starting the following procedures in order to keep from setting various BDS registers during the following tests.   

## A. Register 5016 Initial Setting - Part A: 2.2.25.6 (§ )

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents of Register 5016 
changing.  This change causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a 
change to Register 1016, which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B 
Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer 
runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

Continue to interrogate the transponder with the interrogation described in Part 2. g. (e.g., the last step) until the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply with "DR" NOT EQUAL to 4, 5, 6, or 7. Verify that the elapsed time of the Test Timer started in Part 2.b.(2) is 18 ±1 second. 

Note:
 At this time, the "B" timer started in Part 2.b.(2), as broadcast because of a change in Data Link Capability, should have terminated. 

## 2.7.6.3 Part 3 - Register 5016 - Track And Turn Report - Data Change Validation (§2.2.25.6 And §2.2.25.6.1) Notes:

1. The primary intent of Part 3 beyond data validation in Register 5016 is to validate 
Declaration of Capability as data has been terminated. 
2. Review all subparagraphs of Part 3 prior to performing tests.  This is necessary to 
establish the appropriate timing between changing data inputs and interrogations. 

## A. Data / Source Change: 2.2.25.6.2 (§ )

(1). Roll Angle Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.1
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, terminate provision of valid data to the transponder with Roll Angle data.

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents (e.g., servicing) of 
Register 5016 changing as data for Register 5016 has been terminated.  This 
change causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to Register 
1016, which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes 
to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer 
runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds. 
"DR"

Continue to interrogate the transponder with the interrogation described in Part 3.g. (e.g., the last step) until the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply with "DR" NOT EQUAL to 4, 5, 6, or 7. Verify that the elapsed time of the Test Timer started in Part 3.b.(2) is 18 ±1 second. 

Note:
 At this time, the "B" timer started in Part 3.b.(2), as broadcast because of a change in Data Link Capability, should have terminated. 

## 2.7.6.4 Part 4 - Register 5016 - Track And Turn Report - Data Change Validation - Set 2 (§2.2.25.6 And §2.2.25.6.1) Notes:

1. The primary intent of Part 4 beyond data validation in Register 5016 is to validate 
Declaration of Capability while starting Register 5016 Servicing with a single 
parameter, e.g., Roll Angle. 
2. Review all subparagraphs of Part 4 prior to performing tests.  This is necessary to 
establish the appropriate timing between changing data inputs and interrogations. 
a. Data / Source Change - Set 2:
2.2.25.6.2
  (§
) 
(1). Roll Angle Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.1
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, provide the transponder with the following Roll Angle data at a minimum rate of 5 per second in order to provide appropriate Roll Angle information.

-30.0585937 
(329.9414063) 
1_1 0101 0101 

1. Data Input Value and Typical Binary Encoding represent the data as it is 
provided to the transponder in two's complement format.  Sign Bit often referred to as 0 = Right Wing Down, 1 =  -180 or Left Wing Down 
2. Rounded Input Data Value and Rounded Input Encoding represent the data as 
it is expected to be seen in the "MB" field of Register 5016. 
Data must be rounded a resolution of 0.17578125 degrees; therefore, 

   1_110 1010 101 0 1011 
   1_110 1010 101 1 1010 = 1_1 0101 0101  
+    000 0000 000 1 0000 

Register 5016 "MB" encoding = 1_1 0101 0101  (bits 2 through 11) (355 Hex) 
 

Note: Register 5016 does not take the 90 degree bit:  Therefore, to get the real 
value of the 355 Hex encoding, the sign must be extended to result in the 
actual two's complement encoding of 755 Hex which is equivalent to 
329.9414063 or -30.0585937 degrees. 
(2). True Track Angle Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.2
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, terminate provision of valid data to the transponder with True Track Angle data. 
(3). Ground Speed Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.3
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, terminate provision of valid data to the 
transponder with Ground Speed data. 
(4). Track Angle Rate Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.4
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, terminate provision of valid data to the 
transponder with Track Angle Rate data. 
(5) 
True Airspeed Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.5
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, terminate provision of valid data to the transponder with True Airspeed data. 

## B. Register 5016 Capability Verification: 2.2.25.6 (§ Through §2.2.25.6.3)

Within 1.3 seconds of providing the transponder with data as detailed in Part 4.a, interrogate the transponder with the following GICB Extraction interrogation in order to extract the Register 5016 - Track and Turn Report data.

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents (e.g., servicing) of 
Register 5016 changing as Roll Angle data has been re-started.  This change 
causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to Register 1016, 
which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes 
to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer 
runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 

2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents (e.g., servicing) of 
Register 5016 changing as True Track Angle data has been re-started.  This 
change causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to Register 
1016, which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents (e.g., servicing) of 
Register 5016 changing as Ground Speed data has been re-started.  This change 
causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to Register 1016, 
which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer 
runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

## 2.7.6.12 Part 12 - Register 5016 - Track And Turn Report - Data Change Validation - Set 10 (§2.2.25.6 And §2.2.25.6.1) Notes:

1. The primary intent of Part 12 beyond data validation in Register 5016 is to validate 
Declaration of Capability while starting Register 5016 servicing with a single 
parameter, e.g., True Airspeed data. 
2. Review all subparagraphs of Part 12 prior to performing tests.  This is necessary to 
establish the appropriate timing between changing data inputs and interrogations. 

## A. Data / Source Change - Set 10: 2.2.25.6.2 (§ )

(1). Roll Angle Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.1
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, terminate provision of valid data to the transponder with Roll Angle data. 
(2). True Track Angle Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.2
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, terminate provision of valid data to the transponder with True Track Angle data. 
(3). Ground Speed Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.3
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, terminate provision of valid data to the transponder with Ground Speed data. 
(4). Track Angle Rate Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.4
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, terminate provision of valid data to the transponder with Track Angle Rate data. 
(5) 
True Airspeed Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.5
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, provide the transponder with the following True Airspeed data at a minimum rate of 5 per second in order to provide appropriate True Airspeed information.

1. Data Input Value and Typical Binary Encoding represent the data as it is 
provided to the transponder in two's complement format.  Sign Bit is always positive (e,g., = "0").  
2. Rounded Input Data Value and Rounded Input Encoding represent the data as 
it is expected to be seen in the "MB" field of Register 5016. 
Data must be rounded to a resolution of 2.0 knots;  therefore:

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents (e.g., servicing) of 
Register 5016 changing as True Airspeed data has been re-started.  This change 
causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to Register 1016, 
which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

## 2.7.6.14 Part 14 - Reduced Data Rate (§2.2.25.6.3) Notes:

1. The primary intent of Part 14 beyond data validation in Register 5016 is to validate 
Declaration of Capability as data inputs are reduced to rates that are less than the minimum acceptable rate. 
2. Review all subparagraphs of Part 14 prior to performing tests.  This is necessary to 
establish the appropriate timing between changing data inputs and interrogations. 
 

a. Data / Source Change:
2.2.25.6.2
  (§
) 
(1). Roll Angle Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.1
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, set the rate at which valid Roll Angle data is provided to less than once in 2.6 seconds. 
(2). True Track Angle Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.2
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, set the rate at which valid True Track Angle data is provided to less than once in 2.6 seconds. 
(3). Ground Speed Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.3
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, set the rate at which valid Ground Speed data is provided to less than once in 2.6 seconds. 
(4). Track Angle Rate Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.4
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, set the rate at which valid Track Angle Rate data is provided to less than once in 2.6 seconds. 
(5) 
True Airspeed Data Input:
2.2.25.6.2.5
  (§
) 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Via an appropriate input interface, set the rate at which valid True Airspeed data is provided to less than once in 2.6 seconds. 

## B. Register 5016 Validation: 2.2.25.6 (§ Through §2.2.25.6.3)

Within 1.3 seconds of changing the data sources in Part 14.a, interrogate the transponder with the following GICB Extraction interrogation in order to extract the Register 5016 Track and Turn Report Data:

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents (e.g., servicing) of 
Register 5016 changing as data for Register 5016 has effectively been terminated.  
This change causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to 
Register 1016, which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

Continue to interrogate the transponder with the interrogation described in Part 14.g. 

(e.g., the last step) until the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply with "DR" NOT EQUAL to 4, 5, 6, or 7. Verify that the elapsed time of the Test Timer started in Part 14.b.(2) is 18 ±1 second. 

Note:
 At this time, the "B" timer started in Part 14.b.(2), as broadcast because of a change in Data Link Capability, should have terminated. 

 

## 2.7.6.15 Part 15 - Multiple Data Sources   (§2.2.25 Through §2.2.25.4, And §2.2.25.6)

If Multiple Data Sources of Register 5016 parameters are provided to the Unit-Under-Test 
(UUT), then REPEAT all applicable sections of Part 2 for each additional data source that was not tested while performing Parts 1 through 13 above.   

Note:
 GPS Data Sources may not provide data more often than once every 1.2 seconds.  
If GPS Data Sources are used to provide data, ensure that the data is provided at 
the minimum rate of once every 1.2 seconds.  For Register 5016, this may apply to 
the True Track Angle data and/or Ground Speed data.    
 

## 2.7.7 Register 6016 - Enhanced Surveillance - Protocol And Interface (§2.2.25.8) Introduction:

The intent of this test procedure is to validate all aspects of Enhanced Surveillance Servicing of Register 6016. 

 

## 2.7.7.1 Part 1 - Capability Verification (§2.2.25.8) Test Procedure:

Note:
 The primary intent of Part 1 is to validate appropriate capability declaration of No Capability prior to providing data to Register 6016. 

Ensure that NO Flight Identification or Aircraft Registration data is being provided to the transponder. 

Ensure that the TCAS / Transponder interface is NOT ACTIVE.  If the interface is active, TCAS will provide data to set the Data Link Capability and thereby compromise the results of the following tests.  Likewise, TCAS could attempt to set the Resolution Advisory Report and thereby compromise the results of the following tests. Ensure that no other data is being provided to the transponder that could result in the loading of BDS registers internal to the transponder.  This includes NO Servicing of Register 4016 and / or Register 5016.

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents of Register 6016 
changing.  This change causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a 
change to Register 1016, which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B 
Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents of Register 6016 
changing as provision of all parameter data has been terminated.  This change 
causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to Register 1016, 
which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents of Register 6016 
changing as Magnetic Heading data has been re-started.  This change causes a 
change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to Register 1016, which then 
results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. 
(2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents of Register 6016 
changing as Indicated Airspeed data has been re-started.  This change causes a 
change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to Register 1016, which then 
results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. 
(2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents of Register 6016 
changing as Barometric Altitude Rate data has been re-started.  This change 
causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to Register 1016, 
which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes 
to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents of Register 6016 
changing as Inertial Vertical Rate data has been re-started.  This change causes 
a change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to Register 1016, which 
then results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

## 2.7.7.14 Part 14 - Reduced Update Rate (§2.2.25.8.3) Notes:

1. The primary intent of Part 3 beyond data validation in Register 6016 is to validate 
Declaration of Capability as data inputs are reduced to rates that are less than the minimum acceptable rate. 
2. Review all subparagraphs of Part 3 prior to performing tests.  This is necessary to 
establish the appropriate timing between changing data inputs and interrogations. 
a. Data / Source Change - Set 1:
2.2.25.8.2
  (§
) 
(1). Magnetic Heading Data Input:
2.2.25.8.2.1
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, set the rate at which valid Magnetic Heading data is provided to less than once in 2.6 seconds. 
(2). Indicated Airspeed Data Input - ADS:
2.2.25.8.2.2
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, set the rate at which valid Indicated Airspeed data is provided to less than once in 2.6 seconds. 
(3). Mach Data Input - ADS:
2.2.25.8.2.3
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, set the rate at which valid Mach data is 
provided to less than once in 2.6 seconds. 
(4). Barometric Altitude Rate Data Input - ADS:
2.2.25.8.2.4
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, set the rate at which valid Barometric Altitude Rate data is provided to less than once in 2.6 seconds. 
(5). Inertial Vertical Rate Data Input - FMS / IRS:
2.2.25.8.2.5
  (§
) 
Via an appropriate input interface, set the rate at which valid Inertial Vertical Rate data is provided to less than once in 2.6 seconds. 

## B. Register 6016 Capability Verification: 2.2.25.8 (§ Through §2.2.25.8.3)

Within 1.3 seconds of providing the transponder with data as detailed in Part 2.a, interrogate the transponder with the following GICB Extraction interrogation in order to extract the Register 6016 - Heading and Speed Report data.

1. The transponder should initiate the "B" timer for 18 ±1.0 seconds since a 
Comm-B Broadcast is initiated. 
2. In this case, the Comm-B Broadcast is caused by the contents of Register 6016 
changing as provision of all parameter data has effectively been terminated.  
This change causes a change to Register 1716, which then forces a change to 
Register 1016, which then results in the initiation of the Comm-B Broadcast. 
(1). Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply. (2). During replies to this interrogation sequence and subsequent interrogations 
during this test procedure, monitor the "DR" field.  If the "DR" field changes to 4, 5, 6, or 7, then the transponder has initiated a Comm-B Broadcast.   
When the "DR" field changes, start a Test Timer to monitor that the "B"-Timer runs for 18 ±1.0 seconds.

## 2.8.1 Purpose And Definition (§2.2.26.1)

Note: In the following subsections, "ddd" means the decimal equivalent to XX16.  For instance, for 4016, "ddd" = 6410 = 64.   
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
For any newly added given Register XX16, refer to Appendix B, Table **B3-ddd** for appropriate format and definition of the Register. 

## 2.8.2 Data Requirement (§2.2.26.2)

a. Ensure that no data is being provided to the transponder that could be used to fill any 
field in the Register XX16 that is being tested. 
b. Interrogate the transponder using GICB protocols as specified in §2.2.19.1.12.3 
(refers to §2.2.19.1.12.1 and §2.2.19.1.12.2). 
Note 1:
2.7.7.1

c. Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply with Bits 33 through 88 (bits 
1 through 56 of the "MB" field) set to ALL ZERO (0). 
Note 2:

 
Some registers are required to fill bits 1 through 8 with the Register 
Number, e.g., XX16.  In such cases, bits 1 through 8 of the "MB" field will 
contain the Register number XX16 and the remaining bits (9 through 56) of 
the "MB" field will be set to ZERO (0). 

## 2.8.2.1 Data Field "Y" (§2.2.26.2.1)

a. Via an appropriate interface, provide the transponder with appropriate valid data for 
each parameter "y" in Register XX16 that is to be tested. 
b. Interrogate the transponder using GICB protocols as specified in §2.2.19.1.12.3 
(refers to §2.2.19.1.12.1 and §2.2.19.1.12.2). 
Note:
2.7.7.1
 
See §
.a and b as example interrogations used to extract Register 
6016.   
c. For each "y" parameter, verify that the transponder replies with an "MB" field 
having: 
(1). Each "y" parameter encoded in the proper register location 
(2). Each "y" parameter encoded in two's complement arithmetic unless otherwise 
specified. 
(3). Each "y" parameter value properly rounded to preserve accuracy of ±½ LSB. 
(4). Status bit for each applicable "y" parameter set to ONE (1) if data is valid and 
set to ZERO (0) if data is invalid. 
 

## 2.8.3 Update Rate (§2.2.26.3)

Change the data provided to the transponder and repeat the interrogation given in 
§2.8.2.1.b as necessary to complete the following steps: 

a. For each "y" parameter, verify that the data changes to the appropriate value required 
in §2.8.2.1.c within the maximum update interval time specified in Appendix B, 
Table B-2-1 for the given Register XX16 being tested. 
b. If the appropriate value required in "a" above cannot be realized within twice the 
maximum update interval time specified or 2 seconds (whichever is greater), verify 
that the parameter "y" subfield and its associated status bit is set to ALL ZERO (0). 

## 2.8.4 Service Reporting (§2.2.26.4)

Change the data provided to the transponder and repeat the interrogation given in 
§2.8.2.1.b as necessary to complete the following steps: 

a. Verify that the servicing of Register XX16 during the power-on cycle of the 
transponder is properly reported in Registers 1816 through 1C16 as required in

## 3.3 Test Procedures For Installed Equipment Performance

The test procedures set forth below are considered satisfactory in determining required installed equipment performance.  Testing requirements are stated, in a manner that will make maximum use of bench test data while limiting flight tests to those requirements which cannot be tested conveniently by other means.  
Although suggested test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the installing activity.  These alternate procedures may be used if the installing activity can show that they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. 

Installed equipment performance tests confirm surveillance functions.  Data link functions will be dealt with in a future document. 

Current U.S. operating regulations require tests similar to those described herein be performed bi-annually to ensure against deterioration of performance.  Since equipment installation requires initial performance of these tests, they are included herein. 

 

## 3.3.1 Conformity Inspection

Visually inspect the installed equipment to determine the use of acceptable workmanship and engineering practices.  Verify that all mechanical and electrical connections have been made properly and that the equipment has been installed and located in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.

b. 
Verify that transponders intended for operation at altitudes not above 15000 feet have a peak pulse power at the antenna end of the transmission line of at least +18.5 dBW and not more than +27 dBW. 
 
3.3.11 
Mode S Address 
Verify that the 24-bit discrete address transmitted in the Mode S squitter is the Mode S address that has been assigned to this aircraft.  (See Advisory Circular 20-131A for information regarding Mode S address assignment.) 

 
3.3.12 
Received Reply 
Interrogate the equipment with its discrete address and verify received reply. 

 

## 3.3.13 Airspeed Fixed Field

Interrogate the equipment to confirm the maximum airspeed report. 

 

## 3.3.14 On-The-Ground Condition

Verify that the equipment correctly reports the "on-the-ground" condition.  If it is feasible to simulate the airborne condition, verify that the equipment correctly reports an "airborne" condition. 

Also verify that when the unit is in the "on-the-ground" condition, the transponder generates Mode S squitters and replies to discretely-addressed Mode S interrogations (UF=0, 4, 5, 16, 20, 21, 24), but does not reply to ATCRBS, ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call or Mode S-Only All-Call interrogations.   
If the unit is in the airborne condition, verify that the transponder generates Mode S squitters and replies to ATCRBS, ATCRBS/Mode S All-C all or Mode S-Only All-Call and discretely-addressed Mode S interrogations (UF=0, 4, 5, 16, 20, 21, 24).   

 

## 3.3.15 Diversity Antenna Installations

Verify that the antennas on the aircraft are no more than 7.6 meter (25 feet) apart in the horizontal plane.  The cables **shall** be essentially of equal electrical length. 

 

## 3.4 Flight Test Procedures

This guidance material offers examples of flight test procedures for demonstration of selected performance functions.  Flight demonstration of installed performance may be required by the aircraft operator or by airworthiness inspection agencies. A schedule must be arranged with the area air traffic control facility so that a controller is available to observe the transponder reply and communicate with the test aircraft to confirm performance of the transponder. Select a test area such that line-of-sight signal propagation is assured.  Test maneuvers may include standard rate turns through 360 degrees, climbs and descents so that ATC can confirm valid return through normal flight attitudes. Verification of Ident codes selected and reported altitude response to Mode C should be checked.

## A.2 Definition Of Terms

ACAS  -  The Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) is an aircraft system based on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) transponder signals which operates independently of ground-based equipment to provide advice to the pilot on potential conflicting aircraft that are equipped with SSR transponders.  In this document ACAS refers to ACAS II, which is equal to TCAS II, version 7 or higher.   
Accuracy  -  A measure of the difference between the A/V position reported in the ADS-B message field as compared to the true position.  Accuracy is usually defined in statistical terms of either 1) a mean (bias) and a variation about the mean as defined by the standard deviation (sigma) or a root mean square (rms) value from the mean.  The values given in this document are in terms of the twosigma variation from an assumed zero mean error. 

Active Waypoint  -  A waypoint to or from which navigational guidance is being provided.  For a parallel offset, the active waypoint may or may not be at the same geographical position as the parent waypoint.  When not in the parallel offset mode (operating on the parent route), the active and parent waypoints are at the same geographical position. 

ADS-B Broadcast and Receive Equipment  -  Equipment that can transmit and receive ADS-B messages.  Defined as Class A equipment. 

ADS-B Broadcast Only Equipment  -  Equipment that can transmit but not receive ADS-B messages.  Defined as Class B equipment. 

ADS-B Message  -  A modulated packet of formatted data which conveys information used in the development of ADS-B reports. 

ADS-B Report  -  Specific information provided by the ADS-B user participant subsystem to external applications.  Reports contain identification, state vector, and status/intent information.  Elements of the ADS-B Report that are used and the frequency with which they must be updated will vary by application.  The portions of an ADS-B Report that are provided will vary by the capabilities of the transmitting participant. 

ADS-B Subsystem  -  The set of avionics or equipment that performs ADS-B 
functionality in an aircraft or for ground-based, non-aircraft, participants.  
ADS-B System  -  A collection of ADS-B subsystems wherein ADS-B messages are broadcast and received by appropriately equipped participant subsystems. Capabilities of participant subsystems will vary based upon class of equipage. 

Advisory  -  An annunciation that is generated when crew awareness is required and subsequent crew action may be required; the associated color is unique but not red or amber/yellow.  (Source:  Advisory Circular AC 25-11). 

Aircraft Address  -  The term "address" is used to indicate the information field in an ADS-B message that identifies the ADS-B unit that issued the message. The address provides a continent means by which ADS-B receiving units—or end applications—can sort messages received from multiple issuing units. 

Aircraft/Vehicle (A/V)  -  Either (1) a machine or service capable of atmospheric flight, or (2) a vehicle on the airport surface movement area.  In addition to A/Vs, ADS-B equipage may be extended to temporarily uncharted obstacles (i.e., obstacles not identified by a current NOTAM). 

Air Mass  -  Air mass data includes barometric altitude and air speed. Alert Zone  -  In the Free Flight environment, each aircraft will be surrounded by two zones, a protected zone and an alert zone.  The alert zone is used to indicate a condition where intervention may be necessary.  The size of the alert zone is determined by aircraft speed, performance, and by CNS/ATM capabilities. 

Algorithm  -  A set of well-defined rules for the solution of a problem in a finite number of steps. 

Along-Track Distance  -  The distance along the desired track from the waypoint to the perpendicular line from the desired track to the aircraft. 

Applications  -  Specific use of systems that address particular user requirements.  
For the case of ADS-B, applications are defined in terms of specific operational scenarios. 

Application Interface
  -  The Application Interface is responsible for the extraction of ADS-B Reports from the Report Output Storage Buffer via the Report to Application Interface.  Requirements for the Application Interface and Report to Application Interface are to be specified in various Application Interface specifications and therefore are not addressed in this document. Barometric Altitude  -  Geopotential altitude in the earth's atmosphere above mean standard sea level pressure datum surface, measured by a pressure (barometric) altimeter. 

Barometric Altitude Error  -  For a given true barometric pressure, Po, the error is the difference between the transmitted pressure altitude and the altitude determined using a standard temperature and pressure model with Po.   
Burst  -  A series of interrogations.  
 
Call Sign  -  The term "aircraft call sign" means the radiotelephony call sign assigned to an aircraft for voice communications purposes.  (This term is sometimes used interchangeably with "flight identification" or "flight ID").  For general aviation aircraft, the aircraft call sign is normally its national registration number; for airline and commuter aircraft, it is usually comprised of the company name and flight number (and therefore not linked to a particular airframe); and for the military, it usually consists of numbers and code words with special significance for the operation being conducted.   
Cancellation  -  This is a protocol used by the ADLP to cancel downlink messages that are queued in the transponder awaiting extraction by the Mode S ground system.   
Caution  -  An annunciation that is generated when immediate crew awareness is required and subsequent crew action will be required; the associated color is amber/yellow.  (Source: Advisory Circular AC 25-11).   
Closeout  -  This is a protocol that confirms to a transponder that Comm-B, Comm-C (ELM) or Comm-D (ELM) transactions have been successfully completed and must be cleared from the transponder.   
Closest Point of Approach (CPA)  -  The minimum horizontal distance between two aircraft during a close proximity encounter, a.k.a. miss distance. 

Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI)  -  A function which provides the pilot/flight-crew with surveillance information about other aircraft, including their position.  The information may be presented on a dedicated multi-function display (MFD), or be processed for presentation on existing cockpit flight displays.  Traffic information for the CDTI function may be obtained from one or multiple sources (including ADS-B, TCAS, and TIS) and it may be used for a variety of purposes.  Requirements for CDTI information will be based on intended use of the data (i.e., application). 

Collision Avoidance  -  An unplanned maneuver to avoid a collision. Conflict  -  Any situation involving two or more aircraft, or an aircraft and an airspace, or an aircraft and ground terrain, in which the applicable separation minima may be violated. 

Conflict Detection  -  The process of projecting an aircraft's trajectory to determine whether it is probable that the applicable separation minimum will not be maintained between the aircraft and either 1) another aircraft or vehicle, 2) a given airspace, or 3) ground terrain.  The level of uncertainty in the projection is reduced with increased knowledge about the situation, including aircraft capabilities, flight plan, short term intent information, etc. 

Conflict Management  -  Process of detecting and resolving conflicts. Conflict Probe  -  The flight paths are projected to determine if the minimum required separation will be violated.  If the minima are not [projected to be] violated, a brief preventive instruction will be issued to maintain separation.  If the projection shows the minimum required separation will be violated, the conflict resolution software suggests an appropriate maneuver. 

Conflict Resolution  -  The process of identifying a maneuver or set of maneuvers that, when followed, do not cause a conflict or reduce the likelihood of conflict between an aircraft and either 1, another aircraft or vehicle, 2, a given airspace, or 3, ground terrain.  Maneuvers may be given to multiple aircraft to fully resolve a conflict. 

Conformance  -  The condition established when the surveillance report of an aircraft's position at some time "t" (established by the Automated Tracking function) is within the conformance region constructed around that aircraft at its nominal position at time "t", according to the agreed upon trajectory. 

Cooperative Separation  -  This concept envisions a transfer of responsibility for aircraft separation from ground based systems to the air-crew of appropriately equipped aircraft, for a specific separation function such as In-trail merging or separation management of close proximity encounters.  It is cooperative in the sense that ground-based ATC is involved in the handover process, and in the sense that all involved aircraft must be appropriately equipped, e.g., with RNAV and ADS-B capability, to perform such functions. 

Co-ordinated Time Scales  -  A time scale synchronised within stated limits to a reference time scale. Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the time scale maintained by Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), and the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS), which forms the basis of a coordinated dissemination of standard frequencies and time signal. It corresponds exactly in the rate with the International Atomic Time (TAI), but differs from it by an integer number of seconds.  
Cross-link
  -  A cross-link is a special purpose data transmission mechanism for exchanging data between two aircraft - a two-way addressed data link.  For example, the TCAS II system uses a cross-link with another TCAS II to coordinate resolution advisories that are generated.  A cross-link may also be used to exchange other information that is not of a general broadcast nature, such as intent information. Desensitization  -  Temporary reduction of transponder sensitivity after receipt of a signal.  Used to reduce echo (multipath) effects. 

Desired Course  -  Can be either  (1) True: A predetermined desired course direction to be followed (measured in degrees from true north), or (2) Magnetic: A predetermined desired course direction to be followed (measured in degrees from local magnetic north). 

Diversity  -  A method of selecting the reply transmission path based on the relative amplitude of the received interrogation signal from two or more channels with independent antennas. 

Downlink  -  A signal propagated from the transponder. Dynamic Range
  -  The ratio between the overload level and the minimum triggering level in a transponder. Effective Update Interval  -  The time interval between successful message receipt with at least  98% probability of successful reception.  For example, if 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
ADS-B messages are sent at one second intervals in signal-to-noise conditions with 75% probability of success per transmission, then the probability of obtaining at least one message in three tries is = 1.0 - (0.25)3  ~ 98.4%.  Thus the effective update interval for this case = 1 seconds x 3 = 3 seconds. 

Effective Update Rate  -  The reciprocal of effective update interval, e.g.,  rate = 
1/3 ~ 0.33 Hz for the example above.   
En Route  -  A phase of navigation covering operations between departure and termination phases.  En route phase of navigation has two subcategories: en route domestic/continental and en route oceanic. 

Event-Driven
  -  Messages that are broadcast periodically for a duration of the operational condition.  Examples of Event-Driven Messages include the Extended Squitter Aircraft Status Message with the Emergency/Priority Status and TCAS RA subtypes (ref. RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A).

More precisely, it is the ratio of the standard deviation of the position error to the standard deviation of the measurement errors, assuming all measurement errors are statistically independent and have a zero mean and the same standard distribution.  GDOP is the measure of the "goodness" of the geometry of the multi-lateration sources as seen by the observer; a low GDOP is desirable, a high GDOP undesirable.  (See also PDOP, HDOP and VDOP.) 
Geometric Height  -  The minimum altitude above or below a plane tangent to the earth's ellipsoid as defined by WGS84. 

Geometric Height Error  -  Geometric height error is the error between the true geometric height and the transmitted geometric height.

transponder from replying to 'All-Call' interrogations.  See ICAO Annex 10 §3.1.2.6.9 for full information. Message  -  An arbitrary amount of information whose beginning and end are defined or implied.  In this document, the information content of the message fields MA, MB, MC, FlD, MU and MV.   
Minimum Triggering Level (MTL)  -  The minimum input power level that results in a 90% reply ratio in the Mode A/C format or in the Mode S format if the interrogation signal has all nominal spacings and widths and if the replies are the correct replies assigned to the interrogation format.   
Mode Select Specific Services  -  A set of communication services provided by the Mode S system which are not available from other air-ground subnetworks and therefore not interoperable.   
Monopulse  -  A radar system using a receiving antenna having two or more partially overlapping lobes in the radiation pattern.  Sum and difference channels in the receiver compare the amplitudes or phases of the received signal.

National Airspace System (NAS)  -  The common system of facilities, equipment, regulations, procedures and personnel providing services and standard procedures for the safe and efficient movement of civil and military aircraft within the jurisdiction of the United States. 

Near Term  -  Near-term applications are defined as those that can be supported by an initial ADS-B implementation and that may be operationally feasible within the context of a current ATC system or the ATC systems of the near future. 

Normal Maneuver
  -  Any maneuvers within the aircraft's approved flight-loads envelope that does not exceed 60 degrees angle of bank, or results in an abrupt change in the aircraft's attitude or accelerations.  Abrupt changes in accelerations are those that exceed the values shown below.  Note that g = acceleration of gravity = 9.8 m/s2.

Periodic Status  -  Status Messages that are broadcast independently in the same manner as the Airborne Position, Surface Position, Airborne Velocity and Aircraft Identification Messages.  Examples of Periodic Status Messages include the Target State and Status and the Aircraft Operational Status (ref. RTCA DO-
260B / EUROCAE ED-102A).   
Planned Primary Means  -  Use of ADS-B for Planned Primary Means will be possible for selected airspace operations based upon predictable conditions, e.g., GNSS constellation, type of operation, and extent of ADS-B equipage for participating aircraft. That is, ADS-B will be available as a primary means of surveillance for particular periods of time in particular geographical regions for approved operations.

limited navigation aid coverage or no navigation aid coverage. 
2. En Route/Domestic  -  Aircraft sequences above 15500 feet while not 
actively flying a SID, or is above 15500 and sequences the last waypoint of a SID, or the phase of flight is Oceanic and radio updating is viable. 
3. Terminal  -  Aircraft sequences below 15000 feet; or when the aircraft is 
in Approach and exceeds 3000 feet above arrival airport  elevation if there is no missed approach holding point, or the missed approach holding point is sequenced; or the aircraft is in Takeoff and exceeds 3000 feet above departure airport  elevation if no SID exist in active flight plan, or the last waypoint of the SID is sequenced below 15500.

Power Off Condition  -  The condition in which the transponder electrical power is not applied to the receiver, transmitter or related components.   
Primary Means of Navigation
  -  The airborne navigation equipment that meets the requirements of radio navigation for the intended phase of flight (route to be flown).  These requirements include satisfying the necessary level of accuracy, integrity, continuity, and availability for a particular area, route, procedure, or operation.  Examples of systems which provide a primary means of navigation include: 

a. VOR for domestic en route, terminal, and non precision approach where 
it is available; 
b. VOR/DME for domestic en route above flight level 240, terminal, and 
non precision approach where it is available; 
c. OMEGA for Oceanic Operation; 
d. INS for Oceanic Operation; 
 
Protected Zone  -  In the Free Flight environment, each aircraft will be surrounded by two zones, a protected zone and an alert zone.  The protected zone must remain sterile to assure separation.  It can be envisioned as a distance-based "hockey puck" with radius equal to half the horizontal separation minimum and vertical extent equal to + half the vertical separation minimum.  The size of the protected zone is a direct reflection of the position determination accuracy. 

Protocol

Special Position Identification (SPI)  -  A special pulse used in ATCRBS located 
4.35 microseconds following the last framing pulse.  When used in Mode S, SPI appears as a code in the flight status (FS) field and in the surveillance status subfield (SSS). 

Squitter  -  The transmission of a specified reply format at a minimum rate without the need to be interrogated.   
Standby State  -  The condition in which transponder electrical power may be applied to the receiver, transmitter and related components but the transponder is disabled from transmitting.  In this state the transponder does not reply to interrogations and does not squitter any information in any Mode A/C/S format.   
Station-keeping  -  Station-keeping provides the capability for a pilot to maintain an aircraft's position relative to the designated aircraft.  For example, an aircraft taxiing behind another aircraft can be cleared to follow and maintain separation on a lead aircraft.  Station-keeping can be used to maintain a given (or variable) separation.  An aircraft that is equipped with an ADS-B receiver could be cleared to follow an FMS or GNSS-equipped aircraft on a GNSS/FMS/RNP approach to an airport.  An aircraft doing station-keeping would be required to have, as a minimum, some type of CDTI. 

Supplemental Means of Navigation
  -  An approved navigation system that can be used in controlled airspace of the NAS in conjunction with a sole means of navigation. 

 
Tactical Parameters  -  Tactical information may be used to enhance the performance of designated applications.  System designs should be flexible enough to support tactical parameters; however, it is not required to provide the parameters in all implementations. 

Technical Acknowledgment  -  Acknowledgment by the recipient that a message was received without error, with no inference of the recipient's intended reaction to that message. 

Terminal Area  -  A general term used to describe airspace in which approach control service or airport traffic control service is provided.

Transaction  -  The process of accepting and processing an interrogation and generating a corresponding reply. 

  -  Detection of ADS-B or Ground Uplink synchronization sequence.

In this sense, a curve may be defined by performance of the airplane relative to the air mass.   

 
Warning  -  An annunciation that is generated when immediate recognition and corrective or compensatory action is required; the associated color is red. (Source:  Advisory Circular AC 25-11) 
World Geodetic Survey (WGS)  -  A consistent set of parameters describing the size and shape of the earth, the positions of a network of points with respect to the center of mass of the earth, transformations from major geodetic datums, and the potential of the earth (usually in terms of harmonic coefficients).

## B. Aircraft Register Formats B.1 Introduction

The purpose of this Appendix is to specify technical provisions for the definition for data/message formats of aircraft registers which can be extracted using Ground Initiated Comm-B (GICB) protocols, as defined in Appendix C.  In addition, this Appendix includes implementation guidelines for registers that are utilized in support of Elementary and Enhanced Surveillance.    
Note: Appendix B is arranged in the following manner: 
 

Section B.1 Introduction 
Section B.2 Data Formats for Transponder Registers 
Section B.3 BDS Registers Tables 
Section B.4 Implementing Guidance  

## B.2 Data Formats For Transponder Registers B.2.1 Register Allocation

Applications shall use the allocated Register numbers as shown in the Table B-2-1.  The details of the data to be entered into the assigned Registers are defined in §B.3.  Table B-
2-1 specifies the maximum update intervals at which the appropriate transponder Register(s) shall be reloaded with valid data.  Any valid data shall be reloaded into the relevant Register field as soon as it becomes available at the Mode S Specific Services entity (SSE) interface, regardless of the update rate.  If data is not available for a time no greater than twice the specified maximum update interval or 2 seconds (whichever is the greater), the status bit (if specified for that field) shall indicate that the data in that field is invalid and the field shall be ZEROed.  The Register number shall be equivalent to the Comm-B data selector (BDS) value used to address that Register.  The data link capability report (Register 1016) shall be updated within one second of the data changing and at least every four (4) seconds thereafter.

## Notes: 1. The Term "Minimum Update Rate" Is Used In This Document.  The Minimum Update Rate Is Obtained When Data Is Loaded In One Register Field Once Every Maximum Update Interval.

2. If Extended Squitter is implemented, then Register 0816 is not cleared or ZEROed once either Flight 
Identification or Aircraft Registration data has been loaded into the Register during the current 
power-on cycle.  Register 0816 is not cleared since it provides information that is fundamental to 
track file management in the ADS-B environment.  (See §2.2.5.1.11.c in RTCA DO-260B / 
EUROCAE ED-102A).  Refer to §B.4.3.3 for implementation guidelines regarding Register 0816 and 
2016.  

## B.2.2 General Conventions On Data Formats B.2.2.1 Validity Of Data

The bit patterns contained in the 56-bit transponder Registers (other than Registers accessed by BDS Codes 0,2; 0,3; 0,4; 1,0; 1,7 to 1,C; 2,0 and 3,0) are considered as valid application data only if:   

1) The Mode S Specific Services capability bit is set in Register 1016.  This is indicated 
by bit 25 being set to "ONE," and   
2) The GICB service corresponding to the application is shown as "supported" by the 
corresponding bit in the GICB capability report Registers 1716 to 1C16 being set to 
"ONE," and   
1. The intent of the capability bits in Register 1716 is to indicate that useful data are 
contained in the corresponding transponder Register.  For this reason, each bit for a Register is cleared if data becomes unavailable (see ICAO Doc 9871, §A.2.5.4.1) and set again when data insertion into the Register resumes.   
2. A bit set in Registers 1816 to 1C16 indicates that the application using this 
Register has been installed on the aircraft.  These bits are not cleared to reflect 
the real-time loss of an application, as is done for Register 1716 (see ICAO Doc 
9871, §A.2.5.4.2). 
3) The data value is valid at the time of extraction.  This is indicated by a data field 
status bit (if specified for that field).  When this status bit is set to "ONE" the data 
field(s) which follow, up to the next status bit, are valid.  When this status bit is set to "ZERO", the data field(s) are invalid. 

## B.2.2.2 Representation Of Numeric Data

Numerical data shall be represented as follows: 

1) Numerical data are represented as binary numerals.  When the value is signed, 2s 
complement representation shall be used, and the bit following the status bit are the sign bit. 
2) Unless otherwise specified, whenever more bits of resolution are available from the 
data source than in the data field into which that data are to be loaded, the data are 
rounded to the nearest value that can be encoded in that data field. 
Note: Unless otherwise specified, it is accepted that the data source may have less bits of resolution than the data field.  

3) When the data source provides data with a higher or lower range than the data field, 
the data are truncated to the respective maximum or minimum value that can be encoded in the data field.   
4) In all cases where a status bit is specified in the data field it shall be set to "ONE" to 
indicate VALID and to "ZERO" to indicate INVALID.   
1. This facilitates partial loading of the registers. 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

2. VALID indicates that the data contained in the field, represents real operational 
information which can be used by the application.  This facilitates partial loading of the registers. 
3. As an example, where ARINC 429 data are used, the single status bit specified in 
the field is derived from ARINC 429 status bits 30 and 31 bits as follows: 
a) If bits 30 and 31 represent "Failure Warning, No Computed Data" then the 
status bit shall be set to "INVALID". 
b) If bits 30 and 31 represent "Functional Test" then the status bit shall be set 
to "INVALID". 
 
c) If bits 30 and 31 represent "Normal Operation," "plus sign," or "minus 
sign," then the status bit shall be set to "VALID" provided that the data are being updated at the required rate (§B.2.1).   
 
d) If the data are not being updated at the required rate (§B.2.1), then the 
status bit shall be set to "INVALID". 
 

5) When specified in the field, the switch bit indicates which of two alternative data 
types is being used to update the parameter in the transponder Register. 
6) The bits in the MB field are numbered in the order of their transmission, beginning 
with bit 1.  Unless otherwise stated, numerical values encoded by groups (fields) of 
bits are encoded using positive binary notation and the first bit transmitted is the most significant bit (MSB).  Information will be coded in fields which consist of at least one bit.   
7) Registers containing data intended for broadcast Comm-B have the broadcast 
identifier located in the eight most significant bits of the MB field. 
1. When multiple data sources are available, the one with the highest resolution should 
be selected.   
2. By default, values indicated in the range of the different fields of registers have been 
rounded to the nearest integer value or represented as a fraction. 

## B.2.2.3 Representation Of Alphanumeric Character Encoding

For Registers requiring alphanumeric character encoding, each character shall be coded as a 6-bit subset of the International Alphabet Number 5 (IA-5) as illustrated in Table B-
2-2.  The character code shall be transmitted with the high order unit (b6) first and the reported character string shall be transmitted with its left-most character first.  Characters shall be coded consecutively without intervening SPACE code.  Any unused character spaces at the end of the subfield shall contain a SPACE character code.

indicate if the subsequent Register shall be extracted.  For example: upon 
detection of bit 9 = 1 in Register 1016, then Register 1116 shall be 
extracted.  If bit 9 = 1, in Register 1116, then Register 1216 shall be 
extracted, and so on (up to Register 1616).  Note that if bit 9 = 1 in 
Register 1616, then this shall be considered as an error condition.

10) The Mode-S transponder may update bits 1-8, 16, 33, 35 and 37-40 independent of 


the ADLP.  These bits are provided by the transponder when the data link capability report is broadcast as a result of a transponder detected change in capability reported 
by the ADLP (§3.1.2 of ICAO Annex 10 Volume IV). 


11) Bit 33 indicates the availability of Aircraft Identification data.  It shall be set by the 
 
 
transponder if the data comes to the transponder through a separate interface and not through the ADLP. 


12) The Mode-S Subnetwork Version Number shall be coded as follows:

13) Uplink ELM average throughput capability shall be coded as follows: 

       0      =  No UELM Capability 

       1      =  16 UELM segments in 1 second 

       2      =  16 UELM segments in 500 ms 

       3      =  16 UELM segments in 250 ms 

       4      =  16 UELM segments in 125 ms 

       5      =  16 UELM segments in 60 ms 

       6      =  16 UELM segments in 30 ms 

       7      =  Unassigned 


14) Downlink ELM throughput capability shall be coded as follows: 

       0      =  No DELM Capability 

       1      =  One 4 segment DELM every second 

       2      =  One 8 segment DELM every second 

       3      =  One 16 segment DELM every second 

       4      =  One 16 segment DELM every 500 ms 

       5      =  One 16 segment DELM every 250 ms 

       6      =  One 16 segment DELM every 125 ms 

       7-15 =  Unassigned 


15) Bit 16 shall be set to ONE (1) to indicate that the transponder TCAS interface is 
operational and the transponder is receiving TCAS RI=2, 3 or 4. 


16) Bit 37 shall be set to ONE (1) to indicate the capability of Hybrid Surveillance, and 
set to ZERO (0) to indicate that there is no Hybrid Surveillance capability. 


17) Bit 38 shall be set to ONE (1) to indicate that the TCAS is generating both TAs and 
RAs, and set to ZERO (0) to indicate the generation of TAs only.

## B.4 Implementation Guidelines

This section provides implementation guidelines on data formats for applications using Mode S Specific Services contained in this Appendix.  The section is intended for use by the avionics industry and by the developers of air traffic services (ATS) applications.   

## B.4.1 Transponder Register 1016 (Icao Doc 9871, Edition 2, §D.2.4.1)

The following sections state the guidance material that apply for the setting of some specific bits of transponder Register 1016. 

## B.4.1.1 Bit 9 (Continuation Flag)

This bit should be set as specified in Table B-3-16. 

In order to determine the extent of any continuation of the data link capability report 
(into those Registers reserved for this purpose: Register 1116 to Register 1616), bit 9 is reserved as a 'continuation flag' to indicate if the subsequent Register can be extracted.  
For example: upon detection of bit 9=1 in Register 1016 then Register 1116 can be extracted.  If bit 9=1 in Register 1116 then Register 1216 can be extracted, and so on (up to Register 1616).  Note that if bit 9=1 in Register 1616 then this shall be considered as an error condition. 

As long as transponder Registers 1116 to 1616 are undefined, bit 9 should be set to ZERO 
(0). 

## B.4.1.2 Bit 16 And Bits 37 - 40 (Tcas Bits)

The setting of these bits is dynamic.  They are set by TCAS and possibly overwritten by the transponder. These bits should be set as specified in Table B-3-16. Bit 16 should be set to ONE (1) to indicate that the transponder TCAS interface is operational and the transponder is receiving TCAS RI=2, 3 or 4. Bit 37 should be set to ONE (1) to indicate the capability of Hybrid Surveillance, and set to ZERO (0) to indicate that there is no Hybrid Surveillance capability. Bit 38 should be set to ONE (1) to indicate that the TCAS is generating both TAs and RAs, and set to ZERO (0) to indicate the generation of TAs only. 

Bits 39 and 40 should be set according to the TCAS version: 

|   Bit 40  |   Bit 39  | Meaning                      |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
|        0  |        0  | DO-185 (6.04A)               |
|        0  |        1  | DO-185A                      |
|        1  |        0  | DO-185B                      |
|        1  |        1  | Reserved for future versions |

Note: Future versions of TCAS will be identified using Part Numbers and Software Version Numbers specified in Registers E516 and E616.    
 

## B.4.1.3 Bits 17 - 23 (Mode S Subnetwork Version Number)

These bits should be set as specified in Table B-3-16. 

Bits 17 - 23 reflect the Mode S Subnetwork Version Number.

 The Mode S Subnetwork Version Number should be set to a non-zero value if at least one DTE or Mode S Specific Service is installed.  For example, if Register 4016 is loaded with data, it means that the GICB service associated to Register 4016 is installed.  In that case bits 17-23 will be set to a non zero value, e.g., value 3 if the format of Register 4016 
meets the requirements of Amendment 77 (applicable in 2002). If the installed DTE or the Mode S Specific Services meet the requirements of Amendment 71 (applicable in 1996) only, then the Mode S Subnetwork Version Number should be set to ONE (1). If the installed DTE or the Mode S Specific Services meet the requirements of Amendment 73 (applicable in 1998) only and/or the transponder Register formats meet the requirements of ICAO Doc 9688 version 1, then the Mode S Subnetwork Version Number should be set to TWO (2). If the installed DTE or the Mode S Specific Services meet the requirements of Amendment 77, then the Mode S Subnetwork Version Number should be set to THREE 
(3). The Mode S subnetwork number is set to 5 by a transponder implementing any Mode S 
Specific Services as defined in this edition of RTCA DO-181E / EUROCAE ED-73E.

The setting of these bits is static. 

## B.4.1.4 Bit 24 (Transponder Enhanced Protocol Indicator)

This bit is set to ONE (1) when the transponder is a Level 5 Transponder.  This bit is set by the Transponder itself.  It is a static bit. 

## B.4.1.5 Bit 25 (Mode S Specific Services Capability)

This bit should be set as specified in Table B-3-16, item 2. 

When Bit 25 is set to ONE (1), it indicates that at least one Mode S specific service is supported and the particular capability reports should be checked. 

Note:  Registers accessed by BDS Codes 0,2; 0,3; 0,4; 1,0; 1,7 through 1,C; 2,0 and 
3,0 do not affect the setting of Bit 25. 

This bit actually indicates if the aircraft installation enables the loading of airborne parameters in at least one register not accessed by the BDS Codes mentioned above. 

The setting of this bit is preferably static. 

## B.4.1.6 Bits 26 - 32 (Uplink And Downlink Elm Throughput Capability)

Bits 26 - 28 indicate the uplink ELM average throughput capability.  These bits are set by the transponder and are preferably static. Bits 29 - 32 indicate the throughput capability of downlink ELM containing the maximum number of ELM segments that the transponder can deliver in response to an interrogation.  These bits are set by the transponder and are preferably static. 

## B.4.1.7 Bit 33 (Aircraft Identification Capability)

This bit should be set as required in ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, §3.1.2.9.1.3. 

Aircraft identification capability report.  Transponders which respond to a groundinitiated request for aircraft identification shall report this capability in the data link capability report (ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, §3.1.2.6.10.2.2.) by setting Bit 33 of the MB subfield to ONE (1). 

This bit actually indicates whether the aircraft installation supports an interface to load the aircraft identification into the transponder Register 2016.  It does not take into account the consistency of the data loaded into the Register. The setting of this bit is preferably dynamic.  In case it is statically handled it should be forced to ONE (1). 

When this bit is dynamic, it is always equal to Bit 7 of Register 1716.  It might be different from Bit 25 of Register 1816 since the bits of Registers 1816 to 1C16 are not reset once they are set.  If the interface availability changes during the flight Bit 33 of Register 
1016 and Bit 7 of Register 1716 will be updated accordingly whereas Bit 25 of Register 
1816 will remain unchanged. 

Note 1: The intent of the capability bits in Register 1716 is to indicate that useful data 
are contained in the corresponding transponder Register.  For this reason, 
each bit for a Register is cleared if data becomes unavailable (see ICAO Doc 
9871, §A.2.5.4.1) and set again when data insertion into the Register resumes. 
Note 2: A bit set in Registers 1816 to 1C16 indicates that the application using this 
Register has been installed on the aircraft.  These bits are not cleared to 
reflect the real-time loss of an application, as is done for Register 1716 (see 
ICAO Doc 9871, §A.2.5.4.2). 
It is also to be noted that Register 1016 will be broadcasted twice following the interface availability change.  The first time because Bit 33 will change, then because Bit 36 will also toggle approximately one minute later to indicate that the content of Register 1716 
has changed. 

## B.4.1.8 Bit 34 (Squitter Capability Subfield)

This bit should be set as specified in Table B-3-16. 

The Squitter Capability Subfield (SCS) is interpreted as follows: 
0 = squitter registers are not updated 
1 = squitter registers are being updated In addition, ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV states in §3.1.2.6.10.2.2.1: 
SCS: This 1-bit Squitter Capability Subfield reports the capability of the transponder to transmit Extended Squitter position reports.  It shall be set to ONE (1) if Registers 0516 
and 0616 have been updated within the last ten ±1 seconds.  Otherwise, it shall be set to ZERO (0). 

Bit 34 is therefore an AND of Bits 1 and 2 of transponder Register 1716 and the setting of this bit is dynamic. 

Note that Register 1016 will be broadcast twice in case Bit 34 changes.  The first time because Bit 34 will change, then because Bit 36 will also toggle one minute later to indicate that the content of Register 1716 has changed. 

## B.4.1.9 Bit 35 (Si Code Capability)

This bit should be set as specified in Table B-3-16, item 6. 

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The Surveillance Identifier (SI) bit is interpreted as follows: 
0 = no surveillance identifier code capability 
1 = surveillance identifier code capability In addition, ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV states in §3.1.2.6.10.2.2.1: SIC: This 1-bit surveillance identifier capability subfield reports the capability of the transponder to support the Surveillance Identifier (SI) codes. 

The setting of this bit is static.  If the transponder software version handles SI codes then this bit should be set to (1). 

## B.4.1.10 Bit 36 (Common Usage Gicb Capability Report)

This bit should be set as specified in Table B-3-16, item 7. 

Bit 36 toggles each time the common usage GICB capability report (Register 1716) 
changes.  To avoid the generation of too many broadcast capability report changes, Register 1716 is sampled at approximately one minute intervals to check for changes.  
The setting of this bit is therefore dynamic. 

## B.4.2 Transponder Registers 1816 To 1C16 (Icao Doc 9871, Edition 2, §D.2.4.2)

The bits contained in Registers 1816 to 1C16 indicate the capability of the installation and are therefore specific to the platform on which the transponder is installed. 

It is accepted that these bits can be set once the corresponding data has been received by the transponder over a period of time.  This can happen at any time and not only during the power-on cycle of the transponder as equipment providing expected information could be powered on later. Once a bit is set, it remains set until the power-off of the transponder. 

## B.4.3 Transponder Register 2016 (Icao Doc 9871, Edition 2, §D.2.4.3) B.4.3.1 Airborne Function

ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV requirements (ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, §3.1.2.9.1.1) 
state the following for data in transponder Register 2016:   
AIS, aircraft identification subfield in MB.  The transponder shall report the aircraft identification in the 48-bit (41 - 88) AIS subfield of MB.  The aircraft identification transmitted shall be that employed in the flight plan.  When no flight plan is available, the registration marking of the aircraft shall be inserted in this subfield. 

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Note: When the registration marking of the aircraft is used, it is classified as 'fixed 
direct data' (see ICAO Annex 10 Vol. IV, §3.1.2.10.5.1.1).  When another 
type of aircraft identification is used, it is classified as 'variable direct data' (see ICAO Annex 10 Vol. IV, §3.1.2.10.5.1.3)." 
When the aircraft installation does not use an external source to provide the aircraft identification (most of the time it will be the call sign used for communications between pilot and controllers), the text above means that the aircraft identification is considered as variable direct data.  It also means that such data characterize the flight condition of the aircraft (not the aircraft itself) and are therefore subject to dynamic changes.  It further means that variable direct data are also subject to the following requirement when data become unavailable. Paragraph §B.2.1 states:  
"If data is not available for a time no greater than twice the specified maximum update interval or 2 seconds (whichever is the greater), the status bit (if specified for that field) shall indicate that the data in that field are invalid and the field shall be ZEROed."   
Therefore, if the external source providing the aircraft identification fails or delivers corrupted data, transponder Register 2016 should be ZEROed.  It should not include the registration marking of the aircraft since the airborne installation has initially been declared as providing variable direct data for the aircraft identification. The loss of the aircraft identification data will be indicated to the ground since transponder Register 2016 will be broadcast following its change.  If the registration marking of the aircraft was inserted in lieu of the call sign following a failure of the external source, it would not help the ground systems since the registration marking of the aircraft is not the information that was inserted in the aircraft flight plan being used by the ground ATC systems. In conclusion, the aircraft identification is either fixed (aircraft registration) or variable direct data (call sign).  It depends whether the aircraft installation uses a data source providing the call sign; if so, data contained in transponder Register 2016 should meet the requirement of the ICAO SARPs.  When data becomes unavailable because of a data source failure, transponder Register 2016 should contain ALL ZEROs.   

## B.4.3.2 Ground Considerations

Aircraft identification data can be used to correlate surveillance information with flight plan information.  If the data source providing the aircraft identification fails, the aircraft identification information will no longer be available in the surveillance data flow.  In this case, the following means could enable the ground system to continue correlating the surveillance and flight plan information of a given target. 

If the aircraft identification is used to correlate surveillance and flight plan data, extra information such as the Mode A code, if any, and the ICAO 24-bit aircraft address of the target could be provided to the flight data processing system.  This would enable the update of the flight plan of the target with this extra information. 

In case the aircraft identification becomes unavailable, it would still be possible to correlate both data flows using (for example) the ICAO 24-bit aircraft address information to perform the correlation.  It is therefore recommended that ground systems update the flight plan of a target with extra identification information that is available in the surveillance data flow, e.g., the ICAO 24-bit aircraft address, the Mode A code (if any) or the tail number (if available from transponder Register 2116). 

This extra identification information might then be used in lieu of the aircraft identification information contained in transponder Register 2016 in case the data source providing this information fails.   

## B.4.3.3 Register 2016 And 0816 Implementation Considerations

Detailed implementation requirements for Register 2016 are provided in §2.2.24.6.  
§B.2.1, Table B-2-1, Note 2 provides an introduction to Register 0816 implementation.  
Implementation of Register 0816 should also consider the following:   

a. If valid Flight Identification data is available, then the data should be used to 
populate the character subfields in Register 0816. 
b. After using Flight Identification data to populate the character subfields in Register 
0816 in a given power-on cycle, if Flight Identification data becomes invalid or not 
available, then the last known valid Flight Identification data should be retained and 
used to continue population of the character subfields in Register 0816 for the 
duration of the power-on cycle. 
c. If valid Flight Identification data is not available, but valid Aircraft Registration data 
is available in a given power-on cycle, then the valid Aircraft Registration data 
should be used to populate the character subfields in Register 0816 for the duration of 
the power-on cycle. 
d. If Register 0816 has been populated using Aircraft Registration data in a given poweron cycle, and valid Flight Identification data becomes available, then the Flight 
Identification data should be used to populate the character subfields in Register 0816 
for the remainder of the power-on cycle. 
e. Once valid Flight Identification data has been used to populate Register 0816 in a 
given power-on cycle, Aircraft Registration data should not be used to populate the 
character subfields of Register 0816, even if Flight Identification data becomes 
invalid or not available during the power-on cycle.    

## B.4.4 Transponder Register 4016 (Icao Doc 9871, Edition 2, §D.2.4.4)

Paragraph §B.4.4.1 gives a general example of what are the different selected altitudes and the relationship with the target altitude and introduces the meaning of the different parameters and notions used in this section. Paragraphs §B.4.4.2 and §B.4.4.3 provide more detailed information for some specific platforms.   

## B.4.4.1 General Example For The Loading Of Data In Register 4016

Figure B-4-1 provides a general example for the loading of data in Register 4016. 

The goal of Figure B-4-1 is to clarify the differences between the FMS selected altitude and the FCU/MCP selected altitude, and also to clarify how the target altitude of the aircraft and the MCP/FCU mode bits are determined depending on the phase of flight in the vertical profile.   

## Notions And Terms Used:

 Cleared flight level: Flight level cleared by the controller, i.e., the flight level aircraft 
should reach and maintain.   
 MCP/FCU selected altitude:   
o 
The Autopilot Flight Director System (AFDS) is more commonly known as 
autopilot (A/P).  Its task is to laterally and vertically control the aircraft when selected by the crew.  In general in modern aircraft, the AFDS is a system consisting of several individual Flight Control Computers (FCCs) and a single Flight Control Panel (FCP) mounted directly between the pilots just under the windshield.  Fundamentally, the autopilot attempts to acquire or maintain target parameters determined either by manual inputs made by the pilot or by computations from the Flight Management System.   
o 
MCP: Mode Control Panel is the usual name given on Boeing platforms to the FCP which provides control of the Autopilot, Flight Director, Altitude Alert and Autothrottle System.  The MCP is used to select and activate Autopilot Flight Director System (AFDS) modes and establish altitudes, speeds and climb/descent profiles. 
o 
FCU: Flight Control Unit is similar to MCP but for Airbus platforms. 
o 
MCP/FCU selected altitude: The altitude set by pilots on the MCP/FCU controlling the auto-pilot system.  In the great majority of cases pilots set the 
MCP/FCU altitude to the altitude cleared by Air Traffic Control (ATC) before engaging a vertical mode.  The autopilot will try to reach this MCP/FCU selected altitude using different selectable vertical modes: constant vertical rate (e.g., V/S), Flight Level change at a given airspeed (e.g., FL CH), vertical path given by the FMS (VNAV), and maintain it using the altitude hold mode (ALT HOLD). 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Note: If the aircraft is not equipped with an autopilot this information may be derived from equipment generating an alert when the FL is reached (e.g., altitude alerter system).   

 FMS selected altitude:   
o 
The Flight Management System (FMS or FMC for Flight Management Computer) is a computer onboard aircraft that controls the navigation, performance, flight planning, and guidance aspects of flight.  The FMS navigation component determines where the aircraft is.  The FMS performance component calculates necessary performance data.  The FMS flight planning component allows for the creation and modification of flight plans.  The FMS guidance component issues commands necessary to guide the aircraft along the route programmed into the FMS.  The current and programmed paths of the aircraft are monitored three-dimensionally, by flying from waypoint to waypoint 
and by obeying crossing restrictions. 
o 
The FMS guidance component will therefore compute selected altitude constraints to be reached at different points.  This is known as FMS selected altitude.  These selected altitudes are used to control the aircraft in specific 
modes of autopilot for example when Vertical Navigation mode (VNAV) is selected on MCP/FCU.  VNAV mode is the highest level of vertical profile automation, and maximizes fuel economy. 
 Target altitude: this is the next altitude at which the aircraft will level-off if in a 
climb or descent, or the aircraft current intended altitude if it is intending to hold its altitude. o 
The target altitude may be: 
- 
The MCP/FCU selected altitude when the autopilot is directly controlled by command entered by the crew. 
- 
The FMS selected altitude when in VNAV or similar modes. 
- 
The current altitude. 
- 
Unknown. 
 MCP/FCU mode bits: 
o 
VNAV indicates when a VNAV or equivalent mode in which the A/P is controlled by FMS is selected. 
o 
ALT HOLD indicates when A/P Alt Hold mode is selected.  It does not correspond to a general altitude capture and does not cover VNAV hold situation. 
o 
Approach indicates that a mode to capture ILS localizer and glide slope is engaged. 
 Priority of MCP/FCU selected altitude on FMS selected altitude: 
The MCP/FCU selected altitude is the altitude that the aircraft shall not violate and therefore it has always priority on FMS selected altitude.   

## Example For The Loading Of Data In Register 40Hex

Hypothesis on information available to transponder The FMS selected altitude (calculated by the FMS) and the target altitude source information are available on aircraft buses (this is not necessary the case today) as well as the MCP/FCU mode bits. Bits 48 and 54 are set to 1 all the time with this hypothesis. The reverse hypothesis would require bits 48-51 and bits 54-56 to be all set to 0 and the FMS selected altitude field to be all zeroed.

## Explanation Of The Different Steps In Figure B-4-1:

Generally, Figure B-4-1 shows a theoretical sequence of cases which should not be considered as a real operational sequence.  For example, some steps may be more realistic when the aircraft is in descent. 

Step 1: The MCP/FCU selected altitude has been set to first cleared flight level (FL100). 

The Autopilot/Flight Director is engaged and the aircraft is holding the latest MCP/FCU selected altitude which has been reached before Step1.  The target altitude is the MCP/FCU selected altitude.  VNAV mode is not engaged.  The FMS selected altitude is not the target altitude. 

Step 2: A new clear flight level has been allocated to the aircraft by ATC.  The pilot has entered this value into the MCP/FCU resulting in a new MCP/FCU selected altitude. The pilot has engaged the VNAV mode.  The aircraft speed/path is determined by the FMS.  The FMS contains a flight path with an altitude restriction at a given waypoint (FL250).  The FMS selected altitude corresponds to the associated altitude restriction. This FMS selected altitude is less than the MCP/FCU selected altitude and therefore becomes the target altitude to which the aircraft is climbing. 

Step 3: There is an altitude restriction associated with a waypoint.  The aircraft has captured and is maintaining the FMS selected altitude until crossing the way point.  The VNAV mode remains active.  In an operational environment, aircrew should also set the MCP/FCU altitude to the intermediate levels on a stepped climb SID if workload permits. 

Step 4: The waypoint with restricted altitude is passed.  A new FMS selected altitude is now valid.  The aircraft resumes its climbing to try to reach this new FMS selected altitude.  VNAV mode is still engaged.  Although the aircraft is trying to reach the FMS 
selected altitude (FL350) it will level-off at the MCP/FCU selected altitude which is lower than the FMS selected altitude therefore the selected altitude is the MCP/FCU selected altitude. 

Step 5: The MCP/FCU selected altitude is lower than the FMS selected altitude.  The aircraft therefore first approaches this MCP/FCU selected altitude which is a limit to not violate.  This MCP/FCU altitude is captured and held by the aircraft.  This automatically disengages the VNAV mode. 

Step 6: The flight crew has disengaged the autopilot and is flying the aircraft manually.  
The target altitude is not known.  However on an operational point of view it must be noted that such mode would not be allowed in regulated airspace unless the aircrew had declared an emergency or had obtained a new ATC clearance.  In the latter case the ATC clearance should be entered in the MCP/FCU.  It is more probable that this case may happen on a "descent when ready" profile.  In all cases the MCP/FCU selected altitude may still be useful because it should be the value used in the altitude alerter.   
Step 7: The pilot selects altitude hold (Alt Hold or equivalent mode) making the current altitude equivalent to the target altitude.  Note that although MCP/FCU selected altitude could become the same (pilot entering the new flight level in the MCP/FCU) this is not mandatory and therefore only altitude represents with full confidence the level the aircraft is maintaining. 

 

## B.4.4.1.1 Target Altitude Summary

If MCP/FCU altitude is between your current altitude and FMS Selected Altitude, then the target altitude is MCP/FCU.  If VNAV is engaged and the previous case is not in effect, then FMS is the target altitude.  If Alt Hold is selected and the current altitude is not equal to either of the selected altitudes, then target altitude is altitude. 

 

## B.4.4.1.2 Possible Uses Of Selected Altitude And Target Altitude

1. MCP/FCU selected altitude will be downlinked as an additional read-back in order to 
check that the cleared flight level has been correctly understood and entered in the airborne system by the pilot.   
2. Target altitude and associated mode of flight may be of interest to reduce the Short 
Term Conflict Alert false alarm rate.   
 

## B.4.4.1.3 Target Altitude Implementation Difficulties

It is recognized that all information to determine which altitude is the target altitude or which mode of flight is currently used may not always be available to the transponder in the current airborne implementation.  In addition it may be very dependent on the platform.  It is therefore preferable to set to ZERO (0) the corresponding bits of Register 
4016 rather than sending wrong information.   

## B.4.4.2 Transponder Register 4016 On Boeing 747-400, 757 And 767 Aircraft

In order to clarify how selected altitude information from the altitude control panel and target altitude is reported in transponder Register 4016, a mapping has been prepared to illustrate how the status and mode bits can be derived.

The selected altitude from the mode control panel may be obtained from label 102 (source ID 0A1).  The status bit may be derived from the SSM of label 102. 

## B.4.4.3 Setting Of The Target Altitude Source Bits (Bits 54 - 56)

These bits should be set as required in Table B-3-64, item 5: 
Bit 54 indicates whether the target altitude source bits (55 and 56) are actively being populated. 

0 = No source information provided 1 = Source information deliberately provided 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Bits 55 and 56, indicate target altitude source: 
00 = Unknown 01 = Aircraft altitude 
10 = FCU/MCP selected altitude 11 = FMS selected altitude Aircraft which are not equipped with the logic described in §B.4.3.1 and §B.4.3.2 are not able to determine the target altitude source of the aircraft.  In that case bit 54 should be set to ZERO (0) (no source information provided), and bits 55 and 56 should be set to 00 (unknown).   

## B.4.4.4 Setting Of The Reserved Bits (Bits 40 To 47, 52 & 53)

Bits 40 to 47, 52 and 53 of Register 4016 "MB" field should be set to ZERO (0).

The status bits are determined as explained in §B.2.2.2.  The data is rounded as specified in §B.2.2.2.  The encoding accuracy of the data in the subfield is ±½ LSB by rounding. For ARINC GAMA configuration, label 335 is not used for the track angle rate but for another parameter.  For this particular ARINC configuration the track angle rate field should be loaded with ALL ZEROs.  In such cases, ground applications can compute the equivalent of the track angle rate thanks to the true air speed and the roll angle information.

The status bits are determined as explained in §B.2.2.2.  The data is rounded as specified in §B.2.2.2.  The encoding accuracy of the data in the subfield is ±½ LSB by rounding. "Barometric Altitude Rate" contains values that are solely derived from barometric measurement.  The Barometric Altitude Rate may be very unsteady and may suffer from barometric instrument inertia. The "Inertial Vertical Velocity" is also providing information on vertical attitude of the aircraft but it comes from equipments (IRS, AHRS) which use different sources used for navigation.  The information is a more filtered and smoothed parameter.

## C. Mode-S Specific Services (Msss) C.1 Introduction C.1.1 Purpose

This Appendix sets forth minimum operational performance standards for the Mode S Specific Services (MSSS).  The MSSS provides a standard communication interface and service through which avionics application processors may exchange data with ground based application processors via the Mode S transponder.  Compliance with these standards is required to assure that the Mode S Specific Services characteristics will perform its intended functions satisfactorily under normal operating conditions. Incorporated within these standards are system characteristics that will facilitate the design and implementation of the Mode S Specific Services.   

 

## C.1.2 Scope

This Appendix defines the functional requirements for the Mode S Specific Services, and describes the architecture within which the Mode S Specific Services entity will operate. It does not define data link applications that will be supported by Mode S and other data links.   

 

## C.1.3 Mode-S Application Entity (Ae) / Transponder Interface Management

The Mode S Application Entity (AE) controls the interface to the Mode S Transponder based on information received from the Higher-Layer Entity (HLE) via the Specific Services Entity (SSE) interface, and based on the internal processing requirements of the AE.  Additionally, the Mode S AE receives information via the AE/Transponder interface, which must be processed and transferred to the HLE. 

The Mode S AE must also establish and maintain the local relationship between the Mode S Aircraft AE and the various Mode S Ground AEs with which it communicates. 

Note: In the framework of these Mode S Specific Services referenced herein, the Mode S AE supports the functionality required to support implementation of these capabilities.  A Mode S ADLP would provide the Mode S AE functionality required, but in the context of this Appendix, it does not necessitate the need for full Mode S ADLP capabilities.   

 

## C.2 Design Requirements C.2.1 Basic Operations

The Mode S Specific Services **shall** offer the following types of services to the user. 

a. Mode S Protocol service: The Mode S Protocol (MSP) service transfers limited data 
between air and ground application peers, using extremely low overhead.  The MSP 
service does not use diagnostic, flow control, or interrupt procedures as defined within ISO 8208.  Such mechanisms should be defined within the application entities. 
b. Broadcast Protocol service (Comm-A, Comm-B): The Mode S subnetwork is capable 
of supporting information delivery to all interrogators participating in data link operations for that aircraft through the use of the Broadcast Comm-B protocol.  It is 
also able to receive messages directed to all transponders through the use of the 
Broadcast Comm-A protocol.   
c. Ground Initiated Comm-B service: The Mode S subnetwork allows for the access of 
prestored data within the Mode S transponder (256 register set) from ground application entities. 

## C.2.2 Mode-S Specific Services Entity (Sse) Interface Requirements C.2.2.1 General

The AE **shall** support the accessing of Mode S Specific Services through the provision of one or more separate AE interfaces.   

Note: Mode S Specific Services consist of the broadcast Comm-A and Comm-B, 
Ground Initiated Comm-B (GICB) and MSP.   

## C.2.2.2 Functional Capability

The AE **shall** support the accessing of Mode S Specific Services through the provision of one or more separate AE interfaces.    
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Message and control coding via the MSSS interface **shall** support all of the capabilities specified in §B.2.2.6.   

Note: Mode S Specific Services consist of the broadcast Comm-A and Comm-B, 
Ground Initiated Comm-B (GICB) and MSP. 

## C.2.2.3 Mode-S Specific Services Architecture

The Mode S Specific Services architecture, as shown in Figure C-2-1, provides for the top level architecture, which is inclusive of the Mode S Specific Services Entity (SSE), the SSE interface to a higher layer application process, frame processing function, Mode S transponder (aircraft component), and Mode S interrogator (ground component). Between air and ground, the peer interface entities are identified as being, SSE Data, Frames, and Mode S link protocol (RF).   

## C.2.2.4 Transponder To Application Entity (Ae) Interface

The AE **shall** accept an indication of protocol type from the transponder in connection with data transferred from the transponder to the AE.  This **shall** include the following types of protocols: 

a. Surveillance interrogation, 
b. Comm-A interrogation, 
c. Comm-A broadcast interrogation, d. Uplink ELM. 
The AE **shall** also accept the II code of the interrogator used to transmit the surveillance, Comm-A or uplink ELM.   

Note: Transponders will not output all call and Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance 
System (TCAS) information on this interface.  Use of SI code limited to Comm-A and Comm-A broadcast interrogations. 
The AE **shall** accept control information from the transponder indicating the status of downlink transfers.  This **shall** include: 

a. Comm-B closeout, 
b. Comm-B broadcast time out, 
c. Downlink ELM closeout. 
The AE **shall** have access to current information defining the communication capability of the Mode S transponder with which it is operating.  This information **shall** be used to generate the Data Link Capability Report. 

## C.2.2.5 Application Entity (Ae) To Transponder Interface

The AE **shall** provide an indication of protocol type to the transponder in connection with data transferred from the AE to the transponder.  This **shall** include the following types of protocols: 

a. Ground initiated Comm-B, 
b. Air initiated Comm-B, 
c. Multisite directed Comm-B, 
d. Comm-B broadcast, e. Downlink ELM, 
f. Multisite directed downlink ELM. 
The AE **shall** also provide: 

1. The II code for transfer of a multisite directed Comm-B or multisite directed 
downlink ELM, and  
2. The Comm-B Data Selector (BDS) code for a ground initiated Comm-B.   
Note: Use of SI code limited to Ground-initiated Comm-B and Comm-B Broadcast. 

 

## C.2.2.6 Mode-S Specific Services Processing

Mode S Specific Services **shall** be processed by an entity in the application termed the Mode S Specific Services entity.   
 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## C.2.2.6.1 Processing Notes:

1. There are three Mode S Specific Services protocol types; broadcast, GICB and MSP. 2.  Control data can consist of information permitting message length, BDS code used 
to access the data format for a particular register, and aircraft 24 bit address. 
 

## C.2.2.6.1.1 Downlink Processing

Note: This section describes the processing of control and message data received from the Mode S Specific Services interface. 

 

## C.2.2.6.1.1.1 General

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The AE **shall** be capable of receiving control and message data from the Mode S 
Specific Services interface(s) and sending delivery notices to this interface.  The control data **shall** be processed to determine the protocol type and the length of the message data.  When a message or control data provided at this interface are erroneous (i.e., incomplete, invalid or inconsistent) the AE **shall** discard the message and deliver an error report at the interface.   
Note: The diagnostic content and the error reporting mechanism are a local issue. 

 

## C.2.2.6.1.1.2 Broadcast Processing

The control and message data **shall** be used to format the Comm-B broadcast message as specified in §C.2.2.6.4 and transfer it to the transponder.   

 

## C.2.2.6.1.1.3 Ground-Initiated Comm-B (Gicb) Processing

The GICB service consists of defined data available on board the aircraft being put into one of the 255 transponder registers (each with a length of 56 bits) in the Mode S transponder at specified intervals by a serving process, e.g., airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS), aircraft data link processor (ADLP), or an application entity (AE).  A 
Mode S ground interrogator or an ACAS unit can extract the information from any of these transponder registers at any time and pass it for onward transmission to ground based or aircraft applications.   
The assignment of Registers **shall** be as specified in Appendix B. 

## C.2.2.6.1.1.4 Msp Processing

The MSP message length, channel number (M/CH, §C.2.2.6.2.1) and optionally the interrogator II code **shall** be determined from the control data.  The MSP message content **shall** be extracted from the received message data.  If the message length is 26 
bytes or less, the SSE **shall** format an air initiated Comm-B message for transfer to the transponder using the Short Form MSP Packet (see §C.2.2.6.2.1).  If the message length is 27 to 159 bytes and the transponder has adequate downlink ELM capability, the SSE 
shall format an ELM message for transfer using the Short Form MSP Packet.  If the message length is 27 to 159 bytes and the transponder has a limited downlink ELM 
capability, the SSE **shall** format multiple Long Form MSP Packets (see §C.2.2.6.2.2) 
using ELM messages as required utilizing the L bit and the M/SN Fields for association of the packets.  If the message length is 27 to 159 bytes and the transponder does not have downlink ELM capability, the SSE **shall** format multiple long form MSP packets using air initiated Comm-B messages, as required utilizing the L bit and M/SN fields for association of the packets.  Different frame types **shall** never be used in the delivery of an MSP message.  Messages longer than 159 bytes **shall** be discarded.  The assignment of downlink MSP channel numbers **shall** be as specified in Table C-2-2.   
For an MSP, a request to send a packet **shall** cause the packet to be multisite-directed to the interrogator II code as specified in control data.  If no II code is specified, the packet shall be down linked using the air-initiated protocol.  A message delivery notice for this packet **shall** be provided to the Mode S specific interface when the corresponding closeout(s) have been received from the transponder.  If a closeout has not been received from the transponder in Tz seconds, as specified in Table C-2-2, the MSP packet **shall** be discarded.  This **shall** include the cancellation in the transponder of any frames associated with this packet.  A delivery failure notice for this message **shall** be provided to the Mode S Specific Services interface.

## C.2.2.6.1.2 Uplink Processing

Note: This section describes the processing of Mode S Specific Services messages received from the transponder.   

## C.2.2.6.1.2.1 General

The AE **shall** be capable of receiving Mode S Specific Services messages from the transponder via Frame Processing.  The AE **shall** be capable of delivering the messages and the associated control data at the specific services interface.  When the resources allocated at the interface are insufficient to accommodate the output data, the AE **shall** 
discard the message and deliver an error report at this interface. 

 

## C.2.2.6.1.2.2 Broadcast Processing

If the received message is a broadcast Comm-A, as indicated by control data received over the transponder/AE interface, the broadcast ID and user data (see §C.2.2.6.4) **shall** 
be forwarded to the Mode S Specific Services interface, along with the control data that identifies this as a broadcast message.  The assignment of uplink broadcast identifier numbers **shall** be as specified in Table C-2-3.   

 

## C.2.2.6.1.2.3 Msp Processing

If the received message is an MSP, as indicated by the packet format header (see 
§C.2.2.6.2), the User Data Field of the received MSP packet **shall** be forwarded to the Mode S Specific Services interface together with control data that identifies this as an MSP message.  L bit processing (see §C.2.2.6.3) **shall** be performed as required.  The assignment of uplink MSP channel numbers **shall** be as specified in Table C-2-3.   

 

## C.2.2.6.2 Msp Packet Formats C.2.2.6.2.1 Short Form Msp Packet

The format for this packet **shall** be as follows: 

 
DP:1 
MP:1 M/CH:6 
FILL 1:0 or 6 
UD:v 
 
Data Packet: Type (DP) This field **shall** be set to ZERO (0). MSP Packet Type (MP): This field **shall** be set to ZERO (0) to indicate that this is a Short Form MSP Packet. 

MSP Channel Number (M/CH): The field **shall** be set to the channel number derived from the SSE control data (Table C-2-5). 

Fill Field. (FILL1: 0 or 6): The Fill length **shall** be 6 bits for a downlink SLM Frame.  
Otherwise the Fill length **shall** be ZERO (0). 

User Data (UD): The User Data Field **shall** contain message data received from the Mode S Specific Services interface. 

## C.2.2.6.2.2 Long Form Msp Packet

The format for this packet **shall** be as follows: 

**DP:1** | **MP:1** | **SP:2** | **L:1** | **M/SN:3** | **FILL 2:0 or 2** | **M/CH:6** | **UD:v** |

Data Packet Type (DP): This field **shall** be set to ZERO (0). MSP Packet Type (MP): This field **shall** be set to ONE (1) to indicate that this is not a Short Form MSP Packet. 

Supervisory Packet (SP): This field **shall** be set to ZERO (0). L Field (L): A value of one **shall** indicate that the packet is part of an L bit sequence with more packets in the sequence to follow.  A value of ZERO (0) **shall** indicate that the sequence ends with this packet. 

MSP Sequence Number Field (M/SN): This field **shall** be used to detect duplication in the delivery of L bit sequences.  The first packet in an L bit sequence **shall** be assigned a sequence number of ZERO (0).  Subsequent packets **shall** be numbered sequentially.  A 
packet received with the same sequence number as the previously received packet **shall** 
be discarded.   
MSP Channel Number (M/CH): The field **shall** be set to the channel number derived from the SSE control data (Table C-2-5).   
User Data (UD): The User Data Field **shall** contain message data received from the Mode S Specific Services interface.   

## C.2.2.6.3 L-Bit Processing

L bit processing **shall** be performed only on the Long Form MSP Packet. Upon receipt of a long form MSP Packet the AE **shall** construct the User Data Field by: 

a. Verifying that the packet order is correct using the M/SN Field (see §C.2.2.6.2.2). 
b. Assuming that the User Data Field in the MSP Packet is the largest number of 
integral bytes that is contained within the frame. 
c. Associating each User Data Field in an MSP Packet received with a previous User 
Data Field in an MSP Packet that has an L bit value of ONE (1). 
d. Truncating the assembled User Data Field to 151 bytes if necessary. 
Note: Truncation of the user data field is a condition that cannot be reported. 

e. If an error is detected in the processing of an MSP packet, the packet **shall** be 
discarded. 
In the processing of an L bit sequence, the AE **shall** discard any MSP packets that have duplicate M/SN values.  The AE **shall** discard the entire L bit sequence if a long form MSP Packet is determined to be missing by use of the M/SN Field. 

The packets associated with any L bit sequence whose reassembly is not completed in Tm seconds (Table C-2-4) **shall** be discarded.   

## C.2.2.6.4 Broadcast Format

The first byte of the broadcast MA field **shall** contain the broadcast identifier as specified in Table C-2-1.   

## C.2.2.7 Frame Processing C.2.2.7.1 Uplink Frames C.2.2.7.1.1 Uplink Slm Frames

An uplink SLM frame **shall** be composed of up to 4 selectively addressed Comm-A 
segments. 

Note: Each Comm-A segment (MA Field) received by the AE is accompanied by the first 32 bits of the interrogation that delivered the segment.  Within these 32 bits is the 16 bit Special Designator (SD) Field.   

## C.2.2.7.1.1.1 Sd Field

When the Designator Identification (DI) Field (bits 14-16) has a code value of 1 or 7, the Special Designator (SD) Field (bits 17-32) of each Comm-A interrogation **shall** be used to obtain the Interrogator Identifier Subfield (IIS, bits 17-20) and the Linked Comm-A 
Subfield (LAS, bits 30-32).  The action to be taken **shall** depend on the value of LAS.  
The contents of LAS and IIS **shall** be retained and **shall** be associated with the Comm-A 
message segment for use in assembling the frame as indicated below.  All fields other than the LAS Field **shall** be as defined in §2.2.19.2.1.1.

## C.2.2.7.1.1.2 Las Coding

The three bit LAS subfield **shall** be coded as specified in Table C-2-4. 

LAS 
(decimal) 
Meaning 
0 
Single segment 
1 
Linked, 1st segment 
2 
Linked, 2nd but not final segment 
3 
Linked, 3rd but not final segment 
4 
Linked, 4th and final segment 
5 
Linked, 2nd and final segment 
6 
Linked, 3rd and final segment 
7 
Unassigned 

## C.2.2.7.1.1.3 Single Segment Slm Frame

If LAS=0, the data in the MA Field **shall** be considered a complete frame and **shall** be made available for further processing.   

## C.2.2.7.1.1.4 Multiple Segment Slm Frame

The AE **shall** accept and assemble linked 56 bit Comm-A segments associated with all 
16 possible Interrogator Identifier (II) codes.  Correct linking of Comm-A segments **shall** 
be achieved by requiring that all Comm-A segments have the same value of IIS.  If LAS=1 through 6 the frame **shall** consist of two to four Comm-A segments as specified in the following:   

Note 1: 
The number of linked Comm-A's is limited to four because longer linked 
Comm-A transmissions would result in inefficient utilization of the Mode S 
link, as well as slow frame delivery.  Longer frames can be transferred more 
efficiently using the ELM protocol.   
Initial Segment:  If LAS = 1, the MA Field **shall** be assembled as the initial segment of an SLM frame.  In this case, the initial segment **shall** be stored until all segments of the frame have been received or the frame is canceled. 

Intermediate Segment:  If LAS = 2 or 3, the MA Field **shall** be assembled in numerical order as an intermediate segment of the SLM frame.  It **shall** be associated with previous segments containing the same value of IIS. 

Final Segment:  If LAS = 4, 5 or 6, the MA Field **shall** be assembled as the final segment of the SLM frame.  It **shall** be associated with previous segments containing the same value of IIS.   

Note 2: 
A two segment linked Comm-A will consist of an initial segment (LAS=1) 
and a final segment (LAS=5). 
Frame Completion:  The frame **shall** be considered complete and **shall** be made available for further processing as soon as all segments of the frame have been received.   
Frame Cancellation:  An incomplete SLM frame **shall** be canceled if one or more of the following conditions apply:   

a. A new initial segment (LAS=1) is received with the same value of IIS.  In this case, 
the new initial segment **shall** be retained as the initial segment of a new SLM frame. 
b. The sequence of received LAS codes (after the elimination of duplicates) is not 
contained in the following list:   
 
1.   LAS = 0 
 
2.   LAS = 1,5 
 
3.   LAS = 1,2,6 
 
4.   LAS = 1,6,2 
 
5.   LAS = 1,2,3,4 
 
6.   LAS = 1,3,2,4 
 
7.   LAS = 1,2,4,3 
 
8.   LAS = 1,3,4,2 
 
9.   LAS = 1,4,2,3 
 
10. LAS = 1,4,3,2 
c. Tc (seconds) have elapsed since the last Comm-A segment with the same value of 
US was received.  See Table C-2-6. 

## Segment Cancellation

A received segment for an SLM frame **shall** be discarded if it is an intermediate or final segment and no initial segment has been received with the same value of IIS. 

## Segment Duplication

If a received segment duplicates a currently received segment number with the same value of IIS, the new segment **shall** replace the currently received segment.   

Note 3: 
The action of the Mode S link protocols may result in the duplicate delivery of Comm-A segments. 

## C.2.2.7.1.2 Uplink Elm Frame

An uplink ELM frame **shall** consist of from 20 to 160 bytes and **shall** be transferred from the interrogator to the transponder using the protocol defined in §2.2.20.  The first 4 bits of each uplink ELM segment (MC Field) **shall** contain the Interrogator Identifier (II) 
code of the Mode S interrogator transmitting the ELM.  The AE **shall** check the II code of each segment of a completed uplink ELM.  If all of the segments contain the same II 
code, the II code in each segment **shall** be deleted and the remaining message bits retained as user data for further processing.  If all of the segments do not contain the same II code, the entire uplink ELM **shall** be discarded.   

Note: An uplink ELM frame consists of 2 to 16 associated Comm C segments, each of 
which contains the 4 bit II code.  Therefore, the capacity for packet transfer is 
19 to 152 bytes per uplink ELM frame.   

## C.2.2.7.2 Downlink Frames

Note: Data is transferred from an AE to a "Ground Application Entity" using 
downlink frames.   

## C.2.2.7.2.1 Downlink Slm Frame

A downlink SLM frame **shall** be composed of up to 4 Comm-B segments.  The MB Field of the first Comm-B segment of the frame **shall** contain a 2 bit Linked Comm-B Subfield 
(LBS, bit 1 and 2 of the MB Field).  This subfield **shall** be used to control linking of up to 4 Comm-B segments.   

Note: The LBS uses the first two bit positions in the first segment of a multi or single 
segment downlink SLM frame.  Hence, 54 bits are available for Mode S packet data in the first segment of a downlink SLM frame.  The remaining segments of the downlink SLM frame, if any, have 56 bits available. 

## C.2.2.7.2.1.1 Lbs Coding

Linking **shall** be indicated by the coding of the LBS subfield of the MB Field of the initial Comm-B segment of the SLM frame.   
The coding of LBS **shall** be as specified in Table C-2-5.   

LBS 
(decimal) 
Meaning 
0 
Single segment 
1 
Initial segment of a two-segment SLM frame 
2 
Initial segment of a three-segment SLM frame 
3 
Initial segment of a four-segment SLM frame 

## C.2.2.7.2.1.2 Linking Protocol

In the Comm-B protocol, the initial segment **shall** be transmitted using the air initiated or multisite directed protocols.  The LBS Field of the initial segment **shall** indicate to the ground the number of additional segments to be transferred (if any).  Before the transfer of the initial segment to the transponder, the remaining segments of the SLM frame (if any) **shall** be transferred to the transponder for transmission to the interrogator using the ground initiated Comm-B protocol.  These segments **shall** be accompanied by control codes that cause the segments to be inserted in ground initiated Comm-B Registers 0216, 
0316 or 0416, associated respectively with the second, third, or fourth segment of the frame.   
Closeout of the air initiated segment that initiated the protocol **shall** not be performed until all segments have been successfully transferred.   

1. The linking procedure including the use of the ground initiated Comm-B protocol is 
performed by the AE.   
2. When the Mode S interrogator detects a non-zero LBS code in an air initiated or 
multisite directed Comm-B segment, it can proceed immediately with the ground 
initiated Comm-B protocol and request the remaining segments of the SLM frame.  
When it has received all of the segments, it closes out the air initiated or multisite directed segment that began the linked Comm-B protocol.   
3. This linking protocol, as well as the linked Comm-A protocol, is transparent to the 
transponder. 
C.2.2.7.2.1.3 
Directing SLM Frames 
If the SLM frame is to be multisite directed, the AE **shall** determine the II code of the Mode S interrogator or cluster of interrogators that **shall** receive the SLM frame.

## C.3 Mode-S Specific Services Test Procedures

The test procedures set forth below constitute a satisfactory method of determining required Mode S Specific Services performance.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred.  Such alternate methods may be used if the manufacturer can show that they provide at least equivalent information.  
Therefore, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures.   

## C.3.1 General Characteristics

The test configuration (Figure C-3-1) provides a means of validating the information content of any message received from the Aircraft Application Entity (AAE), as well as the Ground Application Entity (GAE), which is processed and managed by both the Aircraft - Specific Services Entity (A-SSE), and the Ground - Specific Services Entity (G-SSE).    
The test configuration should be capable of generating or accepting messages in the form of MSPs, Broadcast and GICB.  The test configuration should be able to format and populate the data content for MSSS type messages. The test configuration should be capable of generating the entire content of a Long and Short Mode S uplink message, and accept the entire content of a Long and Short downlink message according to the following: 

(1) 
Long Mode S messages are 112 bits, encoded per §2.2.14 and §2.2.19.  Short Mode S messages are 56 bits, also coded according to §2.2.14 and §2.2.19.  
When required, the coding of these messages is contained in the appropriate test procedure of this Appendix. 
(2) 
For uplink Extended Length Messages (ELM)s, the test configuration should be able to convey a control field called Interrogator Identification Subfield (IIS) to the A-SSE independently of the messages described in (1) above. 
(3) 
The test configuration should be able to convey delivery status of Mode S downlink messages to the A-SSE independently of the messages described in (1) 
above. 
(4) 
The test configuration should be able to accept from the A-SSE a Mode S frame 
cancellation message independently of the messages described in (1) above. 
 

## C.3.2 Detailed Test Procedures C.3.2.1 Downlink Processing C.3.2.1.1 Broadcast Processing (§C.2.2.6.1.1.1 - General) (§C.2.2.6.1.1.2 - Broadcast Processing) (§C.2.2.6.4 - Broadcast Format)

Objective: This test is designed to validate the downlink broadcasting function of the MSSS, which includes broadcast processing and formatting of the broadcast messages. 

Step 1 
Generate two 56 bit downlink broadcast messages.  The 56-bit message data 
field will consist of an alternating one zero pattern and alternating zero one 
pattern for alternate packets.  Send the two broadcast messages to the A-SSE. 
Step 2 
At the G-SSE, verify that the transponder has generated two broadcast Comm- B segments whose MB Fields are equal to the message data fields of the broadcast messages.  Verify format and content of the broadcast message.  
Step 3 
If supported by the interface, generate a downlink broadcast message from the 
A-SSE with the data field length greater than 56 bits.  Verify that an error 
message to the A-SSE is generated, and that no request for a Comm-B 
downlink appears at the RF interface.

(§C.2.2.6.2.1 - Short Form MSP Packet) 
(§C.2.2.6.2.2 - Long Form MSP Packet)  
(§C.2.2.7.2.3 - Delivery Status) 
 
Objective: This test is designed to validate the downlink MSP processing function of the MSSS, which includes MSP processing, delivery status and formatting of the short form and long form MSP packets.  The tests cover both SLM and ELM capabilities of the Mode S Transponder. 

## Slm Capable

Step 1 
Uniquely identify the UD fields of each MSP packet by using recognizable sequences of bit and/or byte patterns.  One method for uniquely identifying 
each packet for this test is to insert the MSP channel number in the UD Field. 
Step 2 
From the AAE, generate the following MSP packets: 

# of 
Packet

Step 3 
For groups "a" through "d," extract all Comm-B segments, and follow each 
with a closeout, as necessary.  Verify that the control codes are DP=0, MP=0 (indicating the Short form MSP) and M/CH field corresponds to the selected MSP packet group (M/CH=48 to 41 for group a., M/CH = 52 to 49 for group b., etc.).  Verify that the status of each downlink is sent to the A-SSE. 
Note: 
The packet from group "e" is oversize and cannot be transmitted in entirety. This portion of the test requires the A-SSE to use Long Form MSP packets 
with L bit assembly.   
Step 4 
Verify that the first Comm-B message contains 26 bytes of user data identical 
to the first 26 bytes of the UD Field in the original MSP message, and the L bit is set.  Verify that the second Comm-B message contains one segment with the 
MB Field identical to the last three bytes of user data in the original MSP message, and the L bit is not set. 
Step 5 
Send the data from group f to the A-SSE.  Verify that no request for Comm-B downlink appears at the A-SSE RF interface. 

## Elm Capable

Step 1 
Repeat the group e test described in the previous paragraph with the condition that the oversize packets are to be sent in total using downlink ELM containing 
Short MSP packets. 

## C.3.2.2 Uplink Processing

C.3.2.2.1 
Broadcast Processing 
(§C.2.2.6.1.2.1 - General) (§C.2.2.6.1.2.2 - Broadcast Processing) 
(§C.2.2.6.4 - Broadcast Format) (§C.2.2.7.2.4 - Interrogator Identifier) 
Objective: This test is designed to validate the uplink broadcasting function of the MSSS, which includes broadcast processing, interrogator identifier, and formatting of the broadcast messages. 

Step 1 
Send twelve uplink Comm-A Broadcast messages divided into two groups of 
six interrogations.  The first group will be uplinked with a UF Field = 20 and the second group with UF = 21.  Within each group of six interrogations, the 56 bit MA fields will contain a combination of the following bit patterns: all ones, all zeros, alternating ones and zeros and alternating zeros and ones.  For each frame, set DI = 1 or 7, IIS = 15, and SD (except IIS) = 0, and provide an indication that the frame is an unlinked Comm-A (LAS = 0). 
Step 2 
Verify that the data delivered to the A-SSE interface contains the 56 bits of data in the MA field, the 32 bits Mode S frame header information, the II code, the broadcast ID and an indication that the frames are Comm-A broadcast 
frames." 

## C.3.2.2.2 Msp Processing (§C.2.2.6.1.2.3 - Msp Processing) (§C.2.2.6.2.1 - Short Form Msp Packet) (§C.2.2.6.2.2 - Long Form Msp Packet)

Objective: This test is designed to validate the uplink MSP processing function of the MSSS, which includes MSP processing and formatting of the short form and long form MSP packets.  The tests cover both SLM and ELM capabilities of the Mode S 
Transponder.  The test uplinks several packets on different Mode S MSP channel numbers.  The A-SSE is required to reformat Short and Long MSP packets into message and control data for the AE Separate Interface. 

Step 1 
Uniquely identify the UD fields of each MSP packet by using recognizable 
sequences of bit and/or byte patterns.  One method for uniquely identifying each packet for this test is to insert the MSP channel number in the UD Field. 
Step 2 
Send the following MSP messages to the AAE from the G-SSE interface: 

Group 
# of 
Packets 
UD Field Length 
Packet Size 
MSP Channel Numbers 
a. 
8 
6 bytes

27 bytes 
4 segments 
60 - 57 
e.

29 bytes 
See text 
63 - 61 

 Step 3 
Verify that the A-SSE forwards the contents of the UD fields, as well as a 
means for identifying the packets as MSP data, to the AAE interface.   
Step 4 
In case e), send to the A-SSE 2 Mode S linked Comm-A frames containing 2 
linked Mode S Long Form MSP Packet on the selected MSP channel number.  
The first packet will have L bit set to one and contain 26 bytes of user data. The second frame will have L bit set to zero and contain 3 bytes of user data. Make sure the A-SSE forwards the contents of the UD Field in its entirety and 
correct order to the AAE. 
Step 5 
If ELM capability is available, repeat Step e) but this time send a Mode S Short Form MSP packet to the A-SSE containing 29 bytes of data in the UD 
Field.  Verify that the A-SSE forwards the contents of the UD Field as a means 
for identifying the packet as MSP data, to the AAE.

(§C.2.2.7.1.1.3 - Single Segment SLM Frame) 
(§C.2.2.7.1.1.4 - Multiple Segment SLM Frame) (§C.2.2.7.2.5 - Frame Cancellation) 
Objective: This test is designed to validate the uplink frame function of the MSSS, which includes processing of the SLM frame, SD field, LAS coding, the frame cancellation function, and the management of single segment and multiple segment SLM frames. 

## Single Segment Slm Frame

Step 1 
From the G-SSE interface, generate 4 unlinked Comm-A frames containing 
Mode S Short Form MSP Packets having uniquely identifiable data in each of the 6 byte UD fields. 
Step 2  
Send this data to the A-SSE using MSP Channel Number 48 for the first frame, 
47 for the second frames, etc., and use II = 6 for all frames. 
Step 3  
Verify that the A-SSE accepts control and message data from the transponder 
interface indicating 4 unlinked Comm-A segments with IIS = 6 and LAS = 0 in 
each case.  Also, verify also that the A-SSE forwards the content of the UD Field to the A-SSE interface as well as a means for identifying the packets as 
MSP data, to the A-SSE interface. 
Note: 
If this test is to be performed in conjunction with Mode S transponder validation, the message field must be duplicated exactly in the Mode S RF interrogation, and uplink formats 20 and 21 must both be used.  
SD Field LAS Coding Frame Cancellation Multiple Segment SLM Frame This test requires the transmission of linked Comm-A segments over MSP channels. 

In order for the A-SSE to reformat the frames, it is necessary to have segment number one contain the Short Form MSP Packet header. Linked Comm-A messages can be canceled either whole or in part if the segments are not correctly received as determined by the LAS Field.   

Step 1 
Generate the following table of uplink frame data.  Uniquely identify the data in the MA fields of each segment by using recognizable sequences of bit and/or byte patterns.  All segments should be delivered by the same sensor II code, that is sensor 1, except frames 13 and 15 which should be delivered by sensor number 2. 
Step 2 
Send the following sequence of frames to the A-SSE:

Step 3 
Send each frame at 10 second intervals, except frame 7.  After sending frame 6, wait at least Tc plus one second before sending frame 8.  Thereafter, 
continue with 10 second intervals. 
Step 4 
Verify that frames 1, 3, 11, 12/14, 13/15, and 16/17 are sent to the A-SSE 
interface.  Verify the 0.25 second reformatting time requirement and the data content for completeness and proper order. 
Step 5 
Frames 9 and 10 should comprise a complete linked Comm-A.  However, segment 3 is duplicated in frame 10 and should be discarded.  Verify that frames 9 and 10 are sent to the A-SSE interface.  Verify from the length and 
content that the duplicate segment has been discarded. 
Step 6 
Frames 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 should all be discarded; no message data should result. 
 Each of these frames meets one of the conditions of §C.2.2.7.1.1.4 for uplink 
frame cancellation. 

## Link Frame Cancellation Timer Tc

Step 1 
Generate two Short Form MSP packets with a 27 byte UD Field to fit into a 
four segment linked Comm-A message.  The content of the UD Field will be a 
1 in the first byte, 2 in the second byte, etc.  Set II = 1 for all segments. 
Step 2 
Send only the first three Comm-A segments of the first frame to the A-SSE.  
Impose a delay of Tc minus two seconds, then send the final segment. 
Step 3 
Verify that the A-SSE forwards to the AAE interface a MSP message with a 27 
byte UD Field in correct order and content. 
Step 4 
Repeat the process just described and transmit the first three Comm-A 
segments of the second frame.  However, this time impose a delay of Tc plus two seconds between the transmission of the third and the final Comm-A 
segments.  Verify that there is no output to the AAE. 

## C.3.2.3.2 Uplink Elm Frames

(§C.2.2.7.1.2 - Uplink ELM Frame) 
Objective: This test is designed to validate the uplink frame function of the MSSS, and is intended to demonstrate that the A-SSE can receive segments of an ELM.  ELM protocol is strictly a transponder issue; the A-SSE has no part in the message handling until the transponder sends a complete ELM.   
The data content of each of the segments of the ELM will be identical to the transponder MC Fields after the receipt of an ELM.  The bit pattern contained in the MC Field should permit each segment's data to be uniquely identified.  Note that the first four bits of each uplink ELM MC Field contains the II code of the sensor.  Therefore, there are 76 bits of User Data in each uplink ELM segment.  All segments should be delivered by the same sensor 1, code. 

Step 1 
Send the following table of ELM frames (UF = 24) containing the Short Form 
of MSP packets, to the A-SSE at the transponder interface:

Step 2 
Verify also that the A-SSE forwards the contents of the UD fields of the MSP 
packets and a means for identifying the packet as MSP data, to the AAE interface. 

## Negative Uplink Elm Frame Test

The A-SSE must discard the entire uplink ELM if all of the segments do not contain the same II code. 

Step 1 
Repeat the previous test with data from group "a" of the test but send the last segment with an II code different from the II code contained in the first segment.   
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Step  2 
Verify that no output is generated to the A-SSE.

Objective: This test is designed to validate the downlink frame function of the MSSS, which includes processing of the SLM frame, LBS coding, linking protocol, directing and delivery status of SLM frames.  This test requires the transmission single and linked Comm-B segments over MSP channels. 

## Slm Capable

Step 1 
Uniquely identify the UD fields of each MSP packet by using recognizable sequences of bit and/or byte patterns.  One method for uniquely identifying each packet for this test is to insert the MSP channel number in the UD Field.  
Set II=1 for all packets in this section.   
Step 2 
Send the following MSP messages to the A-SSE from the AAE interface:

Step 3 
Extract each Comm-B segments from the A-SSE and send Comm-D closeouts, as necessary.  Verify the A-SSE sends an indication of the downlink delivery status to the AAE.  Verify the correct association of LBS value with the number of segments delivered and that the M/CH field decrements 
correctly.   
Note: 
Since the transponder is not downlink ELM capable, the packets from group "e" will be sent via Comm-B segments with MSP L bit procedures.   
Step 4 
Verify that the first Comm-B message from group e consists of 4 segments and 
contains 26 bytes of data in the MB Field(s) and that the second Comm-B 
message contains one segment with three bytes of data in the MB Field.

Step 3 
Extract the Comm-D segments from the A-SSE and send Comm-D close-outs, 
as necessary.  Verify the A-SSE sends an indication of the downlink delivery status to the AAE interface.  At the GAE interface, verify the correct association of the ND value with the number of segments delivered and that 
the M/CH field increments correctly for each packet. 

## C.3.2.4 Msp Operations (§C.2.2.6.1.1.4, §C.2.2.6.1.2.3 - Msp Processing) (§C.2.2.6.3 - L-Bit Processing) (§C.2.2.8 - System Timers)

Objective: This test is designed to validate the MSP operations by using L-bit linking, MSP processing and System Timers in associated with these operations. 

Step 1 
Send 4 bytes of CONTROL MESSAGE data from the AAE interface on 
channel 1.  Verify at the G-SSE interface that the A-SSE has sent a Mode S 
short form MSP packet on channel 1.   
Step 2 
Send 42 bytes of CONTROL MESSAGE DATA from the AAE interface on channel 1.  At the G-SSE, verify that two Mode S MSP packets (long form) are 
received from the A-SSE on channel 1.  The first frame will have L bit set to one and contain 26 bytes of user data.  The second frame will have L bit set to zero and contain 16 bytes of user data.   
Step 3 
Send a Mode S frame containing a Mode S MSP (short form) Packet to the A- SSE on channel 2.  Fill the UD Field with five bytes of the bit pattern 01010101.  At the A-SSE interface, verify the reception of a CONTROL MESSAGE DATA on channel 2.   
Step 4 
Generate 42 bytes of Control Message Data from the G-SSE interface on MSP 
channel 1 in a total of 2 MSP packets (Long Form).  The first MSP packet will have L-bit set to 1 and contain 26 bytes of User Data.  The second MSP packet 
will have L-bit set to 0 and contain 16 bytes of User Data.  At the A-SSE 
interface, verify that an MSP packet (Long Form) is received from the A-SSE on channel 1.   

## C.3.2.5 L-Bit Linking (§C.2.2.6.3 - L-Bit Processing) (§C.2.2.8 - System Timers)

Objective: This test is designed to validate the L-bit linking function of the MSSS for long form MSP channels, and the use of the Tm timer for L-bit linking. 

The Long Form MSP Packet test procedures are designed to test the A-SSE's ability to link Mode S Long Form MSP Packets when the packet size is greater than 28 bytes and the transponder has no downlink ELM capability. 

Step 1 
Use a selected MSP number, fill the Used Data Field with 32 bytes of the bit pattern 01010101.  At the G-SSE interface, verify that two mode S long form 
MSP packets are received on the selected MSP channel from the A-SSE.  The first frame will have L bit set to one and contain 26 bytes of user data.  The 
second frame will have L bit set to zero and contain 6 bytes of user data. 
Step 2 
Send two Mode S Comm-A frames containing a linked Mode S Long Form 
MSP Packet to the A-SSE on a MSP channel number.  Fill the UD Field with 
26 bytes and 6 bytes respectively with the bit pattern 10101010.  At the A-SSE 
interface, verify that a Mode S long form MSP packet is received from the AAE.  Verify the UD Field for content and order. 

## L-Bit Delivery Timer (Tm)

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Step 1 
From the GAE, create 2 long form MSP packets for delivery to the AAE.  The first packet will have 26 bytes of user control data and L-bit set to ONE (1).  
The seconds packet will have 16 bytes of user control data and L-bit set to 
ZERO (0) for a complete sequence. 
Step 2 
After sending the first packet, send the second packet within the Tm time period.  At the AAE interface, verify the receipt of this constructed packet containing 42 bytes of user control data in correct order and content. 
Step 3 
Repeat the process to generate the long form MSP packets again to the A-SSE, 
except this time, send the second packet after Tm time period.  This allows the A-SSE to discard the complete sequence since the expiration of the Tm timer 
for L-bit sequencing. 
Verify that there's no related output for this transaction at the AAE interface. 

 

## C.3.2.6 Link Frame Cancellation Timer (Tc) (§C.2.2.7.2.5 - Frame Cancellation) (§C.2.2.8 - System Timers)

Objective: This test is designed to validate the Tc frame cancellation timer of the frame processing function. 

Step 1 
From the GAE, generate two Short Form MSP packets with a 27 byte UD Field to fit into a four segment linked Comm-A message.  The content of the 
UD Field will be a 1 in the first byte, 2 in the second byte, etc.  Set II = 1 for all segments. 
Step 2 
Send only the first three Comm-A segments of the first frame to the A-SSE.  
Impose a delay of Tc minus two seconds, then send the final segment. 
Step 3 
Verify that the A-SSE receives an MSP message with a 27 byte UD Field in 
correct order and content. 
Step 4 
Repeat the process just described and transmit the first three Comm-A 
segments of the second frame.  However, this time impose a delay of Tc plus two seconds between the transmission of the third and the final Comm-A 
segments.  Verify that there is no output to the AAE. 
 

## C.3.2.7 Interrogator Link Timer (Tz) (§C.2.2.6.1.1.4 - Msp Processing) (§C.2.2.8 - System Timers)

Objective: This test is designed to validate the Tz interrogator link timer of the MSSS. 

Step 1 
From the GAE, generate a short form MSP packet for delivery to the AAE (data content can be any). 
Step 2 
For this downlink, do not allow for a closeout from the G-SSE.  This will force 
the Tz timer in the A-SSE to start its countdown for the non-closeout action. 
Step 3 
After 30 seconds elapse, verify that there's no output in the form of the MSP packet at the GAE, since the packet would have been discarded by the A-SSE 
due to the Tz timeout. 

## C.4 Dataflash Application C.4.1 Introduction

Eurocontrol has defined a Table of parameters available from aircraft systems that will be downlinked via Mode S to ATC ground systems.  This information is intended to provide the ATC systems with more information to improve knowledge, amongst other things, on the aircraft's current status and its short term intent.  The parameters are called Downlink Aircraft Parameters (DAPs).  They can be acquired via the Mode S system by the use of either one of two Mode S protocols as follows: 
Ground initiated Comm B (GICB) which requires regular interrogation of the aircraft to extract the parameter.   
Dataflash is a contract-based service specified by ICAO in the Manual on Mode S 
Specific Services (ICAO Doc 9871, Appendix A).  It relies on the aircraft system, announcing in its Mode S replies to surveillance interrogations, that a parameter in a contracted transponder register has changed according to rules agreed in the contract.  It therefore does not require regular interrogations to check the status of the parameter.   
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
 

## C.4.2 The Choice Of Protocol

Data that needs to be updated every few scans of the ground radar will normally be extracted by the ground system using the GICB protocol.  To use this protocol to acquire data which does not necessarily change very often, results in a lot of interrogations and replies which provide the same information as the previous transaction, therefore causing unnecessary interference on the radio frequency channel.   
Dataflash is a much more radio frequency channel efficient protocol that can be used to extract information that may not change very often, and Eurocontrol states using Mode S will therefore need to use this protocol.   

## C.4.3 Eurocae Documentation

The Mode S transponder functions and protocols are fully covered by Eurocae ED-73C 
MOPS, and the Mode S Aircraft Data Link Processor (ADLP) functions and protocols by the ED-82A MOPS.  The latter, however does not include MOPS for the Dataflash function because Dataflash is a Mode S Specific Services Application, and as such is not covered by the Mode S Subnetwork standards or MOPS. A characteristic for a Mark 4 transponder has now been published in ED-86, requiring the Dataflash function to be part of the Mark 4 transponder.  To locate Dataflash elsewhere would require a lot of data already residing in the transponder to be shipped out to the Dataflash function for monitoring and back in again when action is required.  
This would result in an unnecessary aircraft wiring and data-bus load.  In order to permit full certification of such a transponder, Dataflash MOPS are required. If the Dataflash application is implemented in an ADLP and a failure of the ADLP occurs, the only possible recovery mechanism is a power up restart to ensure that the ADLP is in the initialization state.  Failure of the ADLP **shall** not impair the surveillance function of the transponder. 

In the case of a single ADLP connected to two transponders, it **shall** be possible to switch over to the standby transponder without affecting the ADLP states. 

## C.4.4 Dataflash Requirements

All the requirements of Uplink MSP channel 6 when the Service Request header is set to 
1 and those of Downlink MSP channel 3 **shall** be met as specified in ICAO Doc 9871, Appendix A. The detailed requirements are stated in §C.4.6. 

## C.4.5 Document Precedence

If there is any conflict between this Appendix and ICAO Doc 9871, Appendix A, the latter takes precedence. 

## C.4.6 Uplink Msp Channel 6 (Ground-To-Air Request)

C.4.6.1 
Purpose To provide a means of requesting access to services supported by the aircraft.  When implemented, bit 6 of the register accessed by Register 1D16 **shall** be set to ONE (1).   

 
C.4.6.2 
Format The request **shall** be transferred in an uplink MSP packet with the channel number set to 
6 and, in the case of a long form MSP packet, with SP set to ZERO (0).  The first byte of the user data field contains a service request (SR) header.  The contents and format of the service request are specified by the application.   

 
C.4.6.3 
SR Header Assignments The decimal value of SR **shall** be interpreted as follows: 
 

| 0        | Unassigned              |
|----------|-------------------------|
| 1        | Dataflash               |
| 2        | Local System Management |
| 3 to 255 | Unassigned              |

 
C.4.6.4 
Dataflash Request Format The purpose of Dataflash service is described in §C.4.7.1.  The format of the user data field is shown in Table C-4-1.  The user data field of the requesting MSP packet **shall** 
contain the decimal value of "ONE" in the first byte (SR header), followed by one or more requests for Dataflash services.  Each request **shall** contain a two byte Dataflash request header (DH), followed by a one byte field to define the minimum time interval permitted between reports (MT field), a four bit field to determine the event criterion (EC field), a four bit field to determine stable time (ST field), and if indicated in EC, a Change Quanta field (CQ) and a Change Threshold (CT) field.  The 4 bit ST field **shall** 
indicate the decimal value in seconds, how long the changed data has been stable before a message **shall** be initiated.  ALL ZEROs in the Dataflash header (DH) **shall** indicate that there are no more Dataflash requests in the packet.  When an MSP packet is completely filled with Dataflash requests, or when there is not sufficient room in the packet for another Dataflash request header, it **shall** be assumed that the Dataflash request sequence is complete.   
 
A single Dataflash contract relates to a single contract number for a single register for a particular II code.  This meets the requirement that multiple Dataflash services, with different DH values for each II code, can be established simultaneously with the same aircraft.  These may be modified or discontinued independently of each other.  All aircraft equipment and installations **shall** support 16 Dataflash contracts.  All aircraft Dataflash equipment and installations originally certified after 1 January 2001 **shall** 
support 64 Dataflash contracts. 

Note: When a request has been accepted by the aircraft system a data flash response 
will be triggered immediately regardless of thresholds or event criteria.  If no response is received in 30 seconds then a check should be made that the aircraft 
is still available on roll call, and if so a new request should be generated.  In 
order to avoid repeated Dataflash requests that produce no response, the number of such requests (N) should be limited (N=3). 
 When a new contract request is received for a contract already in existence, the old contract **shall** be discontinued and replaced immediately by the latest one.   

 

## C.4.6.5 Dataflash Header (Dh) 16 Bits The 16 Bit Dh Field Is Divided Into Three Subfields Separated By 3 Currently Unassigned Bits 14 Through 16 (See Table C-4-1). C.4.6.5.1 Contract Number Subfield (Cns) 4-Bits. (Bits 9 To 12 Of The Uplink Msp 6 User Data Field)

This subfield **shall** be interpreted as a contract number permitting 16 different contracts to be associated with the register specified by the BDS1 and BDS2 codes of this contract request. Contract numbers available are 0 to 15.   

 

## C.4.6.5.2 Request Data Subfield (Rds) 1-Bit. (Bit 13 Of The Uplink Msp 6 User Data Field)

This subfield **shall** indicate whether or not the contents of the register being monitored by the requested contract must be sent in the MSP Packets on Downlink channel 3 that are sent each time the criterion for the contract is met. 

The subfield **shall** be interpreted as follows: RDS = 0 
Send only bits 1 to 40 of the user data field on Downlink MSP 3 when the contract criterion is met.   

 RDS = 1 
Send bits 1 to 96 of the user data field on Downlink MSP 3 when the contract criterion is met.   
 
Note: 
RDS only indicates the length of the user data field in Downlink MSP3 
when responding with a value zero in the CI field (see §C.4.7.4.3.1).   
 

C.4.6.5.3 
BDS1 and BDS2 Codes of the Register for Which the Contract is Required.  8 Bits. 
(Bits 17 to 24 of the Uplink MSP 6 User Data Field) 
BDS1 and BDS2 codes are specified in Annex 10 Volume IV. 
C.4.6.6 
Minimum Time (MT) 8 Bits The decimal value of the 8 bit MT field represents the minimum time in seconds that shall elapse after a report has been event triggered and sent to the transponder, before a new report can be initiated.  The report sent to the transponder **shall** always be the most current data available. 

 

## C.4.6.7 Event Initiation Event Initiation **Shall** Be Controlled By The Two Following Fields.

 
C.4.6.7.1 
Event Criterion Field (EC) 4 Bits These are the four bits following the MT field.  If multiple events occur within a single register being monitored by a Dataflash contract, (e.g., if more than one parameter shows a significant change) only one message **shall** be triggered. 

 
The decimal value of the EC field **shall** be interpreted as follows: 
0 =  No report required, discontinue service for the contract specified in the DH 
field. 

 
1 =  Report any change. 
2 =  56 bit change field (CQ) follows ST. Only report changes to bits indicated 
by a "ONE" in CQ. 
3 =  56 bit field CQ follows ST. For each parameter report all status changes and 
all changes of the parameter greater than the quantum value indicated in the same units and resolution of the field in CQ corresponding to that parameter. A zero in the field in CQ corresponding to the parameter indicates that no reports are required. 
4 =  112 bits CQ plus CT follow ST.  The first 56 bits are as for the EC value 3 
above. The second 56 bits are the CT field indicating a threshold value in the field corresponding to the parameter. Report all changes above the threshold 
where the value in CQ gives the change quantum. 
5 =  112 bits of CQ and CT follow ST.  Same as for the EC value 4 above except: 
report all changes below the threshold. 
6 =  112 bits of CQ and CT follow ST.  Same as for ECS values 4 and 5 above 
except report only when the threshold is crossed (in either direction).  
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

 7 to 14 =  Not currently assigned. 
15 = Cancel all contracts for the II code in this request. 
C.4.6.7.2 
Stable Time Field (ST) 4 Bits These are the four bits following the EC field.  The decimal value of ST **shall** indicate in seconds, how long the changed data have been stable to within the change quanta specified in CQ field, before a message **shall** be initiated.  A value of ZERO (0) in this subfield **shall** indicate that there is no minimum stable time and any change immediately initiates a message.  The significance of the ST will differ slightly depending upon which EC mode is being used.  In particular, for EC modes 4 & 5, regarding stability whilst above/below a threshold, if a parameter value remains above/below the defined threshold for greater than the ST time then a Dataflash **shall** be generated even if the value does not remain stable to within one quantum.  Subsequent quantum changes which are stable for greater than the ST time **shall** generate further Dataflash messages until the value falls below / rises above the threshold. 

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
C.4.6.8 
Change Fields - Change Quanta (CQ) and Change Threshold (CT) 
These fields **shall** be present when indicated in EC.  For a GICB service (i.e., for DH 
from 1 to 255 inclusive), CQ **shall** be contained in bits 41 to 96 of the MSP 6 User Data Field.  CT when required **shall** be contained in bits 97 to 152 of the MSP 6 User Data Field.  The quantum value in the CQ field **shall** be in the same units and resolution as those specified for the register being monitored and it specifies the amount by which the parameter **shall** change, from its value at the initialization of the contract, and thereafter from the value last reported by a Dataflash response on downlink channel MSP 3.

## C.4.7 Downlink Msl Channel 3.  Dataflash Service

C.4.7.1 
Purpose Dataflash is a service which announces the availability of information from air-to-ground on an event triggered basis.  This is an efficient means of downlinking information which changes occasionally and unpredictably.  When implemented, bit 31 of the Register accessed by Register 1D16 **shall** be set to ONE (1).   

C.4.7.2 
Service Initiation and Termination The Dataflash service **shall** be initiated or discontinued by a service request.  It is received on uplink MSP channel 6 with a decimal value of ONE in the service request (SR) header which is contained in the first byte of the user data field.  This indicates that the rest of the user data field contains Dataflash request.  On the receipt of such a request a Dataflash message from the register concerned with the request, **shall** immediately be made available and announced to the ground regardless of the setting of the RDS field in the contract request and of any event criteria. 

The response **shall** be as follows: 
 

1. When the requested register is being serviced, the contract **shall** be established 
and an MSP Packet as in Table C-4-2 **shall** be announced to the ground on MSP 
channel 3.  The CI field **shall** be set to a value of 1.  The message **shall** be used 
by the ground system to confirm that the service has been initiated. 
 
2. If the requested register is not being serviced the contract **shall** not be 
established.  This **shall** be indicated by announcing the MSP Packet on 
Downlink MSP channel 3 to the ground as shown in Table C-4-2, and with a 
value of 2 in the CI field. 3. If the maximum number of contracts that can be supported are already 
established then the new contract **shall** be refused.  This **shall** be indicated by 
announcing to the ground an MSP Packet on Downlink channel 3, as shown in 
Table C-4-2, and with a value of 3 in the CI field. 4. In the case of a request from the ground to terminate the service for a particular 
register the termination of the service **shall** be confirmed by announcing to the 
ground, an MSP Packet on Downlink channel 3, as shown in Table C-4-2, and 
with a value of 4 in the CI field. 5. In the case of a request from the ground to terminate the service for all contracts 
to a particular II code.  The termination of the service **shall** be confirmed by 
announcing to the ground, an MSP Packet on Downlink channel 3, as shown in 
Table C-4-2, and with a value of 5 in the CI field. 
 
6. When the register service fails for an established contract, the contract **shall** be 
terminated by the airborne application.  This **shall** be indicated by announcing an 
MSP Packet on Downlink channel 3, to the ground, as shown in Table C-4-2, 
and with a value of 7 in the CI field.  Register service **shall** be deemed to have 
failed when any of the parameters specified to be monitored in the negotiation of the contract is not being updated at the specified minimum rate. 

 7. When a contract is refused due an invalid value of the EC field in the contract 
request this **shall** be indicated by announcing an MSP Packet on Downlink 
channel 3 to the ground as shown in Table C-4-2, and with a value of 15 in the 
CI field. 8. If any message is not extracted from the transponder by a ground interrogator 
within 30 seconds the aircraft subnetwork cancels the message and generates a 
delivery failure notice (i.e., the Tz timer expires) which is delivered to the 
aircraft MSP service provider.  When a delivery failure notice is received the 
service **shall** be automatically terminated by the Dataflash function with no 
indication to the ground system.   
 
Note: This is to prevent the transponder message queues being blocked when the 
ground interrogator stops supplying the message extraction service, either due to a fault or loss of cover.  It is the responsibility of the ground application to monitor the Dataflash service taking this into account. 9. When the transponder has not been selectively interrogated by a Mode S 
interrogator with a particular II code for 60 seconds (this is determined by monitoring the IIS subfield in all accepted Mode S interrogations), all Dataflash 
contracts related to that II code **shall** be cancelled with no indication to the 
ground system. 
C.4.7.3 
Service Provision On the reception of a Dataflash request the requested parameters **shall** be monitored and transferred to the ground using the Mode S air initiated protocols directed to the II code that was contained in the requesting interrogation.  In order to prevent the flooding of the transponder with Dataflash messages, an upper limit of ten messages in a six seconds period **shall** be imposed.  When the limit of ten messages within a six seconds period is reached, further messages **shall** be queued until they can be sent.  Messages queued in this way **shall** respond with a CI field value of 6. If after initiating a Dataflash message to the ground, the change criterion is met again prior to the message being entered into the transponder for announcement, the message is considered stale and **shall** be replaced by the most up to date information.   

C.4.7.4 
Downlink Message Structure The information **shall** be transferred in a downlink MSP packet with the channel number M/CH = 3.  The format is shown in Table C-4-2.   
 
The first two bytes of the User Data (UD) field **shall** contain a Dataflash header (DH), which are identical to the DH field that was contained in the request for the service.   

C.4.7.4.1  
Bits 17 to 31 of UD form the II code Contract Report Field in which each bit **shall** 
indicate that at least one contract is active with the II code which the bit represents when it is set to a ONE, otherwise there are no active contracts with that II code.   
 
C.4.7.4.2  
Bits 32 to 36 of UD are not assigned. 
 
C.4.7.4.3  
Bits 37 to 40 of UD form the Contract Information (CI) field which shall be interpreted as follows:

C.4.7.4.3.1  
When the CI field is equal to ZERO the response **shall** be as requested by the RDS field 
in the Dataflash header of the contract (see §C.4.6.5.2).  When the CI field is not equal to 
ZERO the response **shall** only contain bits 1 to 40 of the user data field on downlink 
MSP 3 (see Table C-4-2).   
 
C.4.7.5 
Data Extraction by Mode-S Ground Stations The Dataflash transaction **shall** be announced as a downlink frame in replies to interrogations UF 4, 5, 20, or 21.  The transaction announced **shall** be either a single segment Comm B frame, or a two segment Comm B frame, as requested by the contract negotiation.  The Air Directed Comm B first segment **shall** contain the MSP header, Dataflash header, and control information for that particular contract.  In the case of a contract for a single segment response, if the data is required, it is acquired by the ground station extracting the register in question directly.

## C.4.8 Test Procedures For Dataflash Application

C.4.8.1 
Test Equipment 
a. A Mode S transponder and a means to input and record test data into the Mode S 
transponder registers from simulated aircraft data buses at the required rates.  (This 
may be done via an ADLP if the transponder does not have the Dataflash application inside it).   
b. A means to interrogate the Mode S transponder at a regular rate between 6 and 10 
seconds with surveillance interrogations and decode the replies.   
c. A means to send data to the transponder, extract air initiated messages announced by 
the transponder, and extract the data from the transponder registers of the transponder, by means of interrogations with the appropriate control codes set.   
d. A means to set up, record, and monitor Dataflash contracts by interrogating the 
Mode S transponder.  Also a means of extracting and recording the data from the 
transponder when announced in the reply to a background surveillance interrogation. 
 
The test equipment and its configuration will be dependent on where the Dataflash function resides.  There are several possibilities, two examples of which are, either in an ADLP separate from a transponder, or in a combined ADLP transponder unit such as a Mark 4 transponder.  The manufacturer **shall** declare the monitoring points to be used and offer a test equipment configuration to meet the requirements of the tests.  Two possible test equipment configurations are shown in Figure C-4-1.   
 

## C.4.8.2 Test Procedures C.4.8.2.1 Procedure #1: Initialization And Checking For Dataflash Support

(Reference: §C.4.6.1) 
This test procedure **shall** be carried out at the start of each test sequence to verify that the airborne Mode S system is functioning correctly and can support uplink MSP channel 6, downlink MSP channel 3, and the appropriate transponder registers. 

## Step 1 - Msps Installed And Require Service

a. Switch on the Mode S system under test and the test equipment and set the test 
interrogation II code to a non-zero value.   
b. Start a regular pattern (one interrogation every 6 to 10 seconds) of Mode S 
Surveillance interrogations as shown in Table C-4-4. 

|    |    |    |    |     | UF = 4 or 5    | PC = 0    | RR = 0    | DI = 7    | SD      | AP    |
|----|----|----|----|-----|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|
|    |    |    |    | IIS | RRS = 0        |           | LOS = 0   |           | TMS = 0 |       |

c. Check that the specified replies are received and decoded correctly. 
d. Extract the data from a transponder register using an interrogation as in Table C-4-4, 
but setting the RR field to 17 and the RRS subfield to ZERO (0).  (This is a request for the Data Link Capability Report.)   
e. Verify in the MB field of the reply that bit 25 is set to ONE (1).  (This indicates that 
MSP services are supported.)   
f. Extract the data from a transponder register using an interrogation as in Table C-4-4, 
but setting the RR field to 17 and the RRS subfield to 13.  (This is a request for one of the Mode S Specific Services MSP capability report registers.)   
g. Check in the MB field of the reply that bit 6 is set to ONE (1) indicating that MSP 
Uplink Channel 6 is installed and requires service, and that bit 31 is set to ONE (1) indicating that Downlink Channel 3 is installed and requires service.   

## Step 2 - Transponder Register Data Sources Installed

a. Extract the data from a transponder register using an interrogation as in Table C-4-4, 
but setting the RR field to 17 and the RRS subfield to 8.  (This is a request for one of the Mode S Specific Services MSP capability report registers.)   
b. Check in the MB field of the reply and record the bits that are set to a ONE 
indicating that a transponder register service is indicated as installed.   
c. Repeat Step 2 four times incrementing the RRS subfield by 1 each time to give RRS 
values 9, 10, 11, and 12.   

## Step 3 - Transponder Register Data Loading

a. Load known data into all transponder registers, indicated as installed from Step 2 
above, in the transponder that contain other than static data (i.e., GICB capability report register etc.) at the minimum rate specified in ICAO Document 9688.   
b. Extract the data from each register and verify that the data is correct. c. Cease loading data into the transponder registers.   
d. After a delay of at least twice the required update rate extract the data from each 
register and verify that the data is ALL ZEROs.   

## C.4.8.2.2 Procedure #2: Requesting The Setup Of Dataflash Contracts

(Reference: §C.4.6.3, §C.4.6.4, §C.4.6.5.2, §C.4.6.5.3, §C.4.6.7.1, §C.4.7.2.(1), §C.4.7.2.(2), §C.4.7.2.(3), §C.4.7.4.1, §C.4.7.4.3 & §C.4.7.4.3.1) 
This test procedure is to check that the Dataflash application will not set up a contract for a transponder register that is not being serviced and that a contract can be set up when the transponder register is being serviced.  It also checks that the maximum number of contracts for which the system is declared to be capable of handling can be set up.  It also tests the function of CR field, the RDS field, and CI field values 1, 2, and 3.   

## Step 1 - Dataflash Contract Request For Transponder Registers Not Being Loaded With Data

a. Ensure that no data is being loaded into the installed transponder registers.   
b.  Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing an MSP packet as shown 
in Table C-4-5, on uplink MSP channel 6 with the BDS1 and BDS2 codes of the 
transponder register with which the contract is intended set into the DH field.   

|    |         |         |       | SR =1    | DH    | MT = 0    | EC = 1    | ST = 0    |
|----|---------|---------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|    | CNS = 0 | RDS = 1 | Spare | BDS1     | BDS2  |           |           |           |

 
Note: Mode S Frames are specified and tested in EUROCAE document ED-82.   

c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance 
interrogation sent to the transponder 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was received by the transponder. 

d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as shown in Table C-4-6 and it contains a DH equal to the value in 
the request interrogation and a value of 2 in the CI field.  (This indicates that the contract was not accepted).  Also verify that the CR field contains ALL ZEROs. (This indicates that there are no Dataflash contracts in existence.)   
Note: Since RDS = 1 in the contract request this test also verifies that the message register content is not sent when the register is not being loaded with data.   

e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder. 
f. Repeat Step 1 requesting a contract for all transponder registers indicated as installed 
in the results of Procedure 1 Step 2. 

## Step 2 - Contract Establishment For Transponder Registers Being Loaded With Data

a. Ensure that data is being loaded into the installed transponder registers and record 
the data being loaded into each transponder register.   
b. Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder as specified in Table C-4-5 but with 
RDS=0, containing an MSP packet on uplink MSP channel 6.   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was sent. 
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as shown in Table C-4-7 and that it contains a DH equal to the value 
in the request interrogation.  Verify that the CI field is set to ONE (1) when the 
contract is accepted, and that CI = 3 and the MSP packet is as shown in Table C-4-7, 
when the maximum number of contracts is exceeded.  (This indicates that the contents of the transponder register are made available when the contract is established even though RDS=0).  Also verify that in the CR field, the bit relating to the II code in the requesting interrogation is set to a ONE (1) for all II codes for which contracts have been accepted.  (This indicates the contracts that have been accepted and are active.) 
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder. 
f. Change the data in the transponder register so that the criterion for a Dataflash 
message to be triggered is met.   
g. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the data changed. 
h. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as shown in Table C-4-6.  Verify that it contains a DH equal to the 
value in the request interrogation in Step 2 "b".  Verify that the CI field is set to 
ZERO (0).  (This indicates that after the contract has been established the transponder register data is not made available because RDS=0 in the contract request.)   

| DH (16 bits)    | CR (15 bits)    | Not Assigned (5 bits)    | CI (4 bits)    |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------|

i. 
Repeat Step 2 "b" to "c" but setting RDS=1 in Step 2 "b".  
j. 
Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as shown in Table C-4-7, and that it contains a DH equal to the value 
in the request interrogation.  Also verify that the CI field is set to ONE (1) when the contract is accepted and CI = 3 when the maximum number of contracts is exceeded. Also verify that in the CR field, the bit relating to the II code in the requesting interrogation is set to a ONE (1) for all II codes for which contracts have been accepted.  (This indicates the contracts that have been accepted and are active.) Verify that the register message content is that which was loaded into the register specified in the contract request.   

| DH (16 bits)             |
|--------------------------|
| Register message content |
| (56 bits)                |

k. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder.   
l. 
Change the data in the transponder register so that the criterion for a Dataflash message to be triggered is met.   
m. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance 
interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 second after the data changed.   
n. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as shown in Table C-4-7.  Verify that it contains a DH equal to the 
value in the request interrogation in Step 2 "b".  Verify that the CI field is set to 
ZERO (0).  (This indicates that after the contract has been established the transponder register data is made available because RDS=1 in the contract request.)   
o. Repeat Procedure 2 Step 2 "a" to "e", using a different non-zero II code each time 
requesting contracts up to a value equal to the maximum number of contracts that the system is declared to be capable of handling plus one.  Use other transponder 
registers indicated as "installed" in the results of Procedure 1 Step 2 if the maximum 
number of contracts is more than 16.   
p. Record the maximum number of contracts accepted, and verify that the number is at 
least 16, and that it is the maximum number declared by the manufacturer for the unit under test.   
q. Use the techniques in §C.4.8.2.3 Procedure 3 to terminate all the contracts.   
 

## Step 3 - Multiple Contract Requests Contained In A Single Msp Packet On Msp Channel 6

a. Ensure that data is being loaded into the installed transponder registers and record 
the data being loaded into each transponder register. 
b. Depending on the transponder Level, send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder 
containing an MSP packet as shown in Table C-4-8 or Table C-4-9 with RDS=1 in 
the Dataflash Header(DH), on uplink MSP channel 6 with different BDS codes of transponder registers being loaded in a above for each contract request.   
 

|        | Contract 1    | Contract 2    | END    |
|--------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| CT     |               |               |        |
| SR=1   | DH            | MT            | EC=1   |
| CQ     |               |               |        |
| Quanta | Threshold     |               |        |
| DH=0   |               |               |        |

 
This will result in an Uplink 4 Segment Linked Comm A frame.   
 

|        | Contract 1    | Contract 2    | Contract 3    | END    | Fill data    |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------|--------------|
| CT     |               |               |               |        |              |
| SR=1   | DH            | MT            | EC=1          | ST     | DH           |
| CQ     |               |               |               |        |              |
| Quanta |               |               |               |        |              |
| DH     | MT            | EC=4          | ST            |        |              |
| CQ     |               |               |               |        |              |
| Quanta | Threshold     |               |               |        |              |
| DH=0   |               |               |               |        |              |
| All    |               |               |               |        |              |
| ZEROs  |               |               |               |        |              |
|        |               |               |               |        |              |

This will result in an Uplink ELM frame 

c. Verify that downlink transactions directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction in "b" above, are announced by the transponder in replies to surveillance interrogations sent to the transponder, the first one, no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was sent and one for each subsequent contract request as soon as the previous transaction has been closed out.   
d. Extract each downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as shown in Table C-4-7, and that it contains DH equal to the value 
in the contract request interrogation, and verify that the CI field is set to ONE (1) and the relevant bit of the CR field is set to ONE (1) indicating the same II code as was 
set in the interrogation requesting transaction in "b" above.  (This indicates that the contract was accepted and is active.)   

e. Verify that all the requested contracts have been accepted. 
f. Closeout each downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder. 
g. Use the techniques in §C.4.8.2.3 Procedure 3 to terminate all the contracts.   

## Step 4 - Tests Of  Wrong Values In The Service Request (Sr) Header In Msp Packet On Uplink Msp Channel 6

a. Ensure that data is being loaded into the installed transponder registers and record 
the data being loaded into each transponder register. 
b. Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing an MSP packet as in 
Table C-4-5, on uplink MSP channel 6, but with the SR field set to ZERO (0). 
c. Verify that no downlink transaction is announced by the transponder in the reply to a 
surveillance interrogation as in Table C-4-4, sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 
seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was sent.  (No downlink response indicates that the contract was not accepted.)   
d. Repeat Step 1 requesting the same contract using all other SR values. i.e., 2 to 255 
inclusive and verify that no Dataflash downlink transactions are announced by the transponder.   

## C.4.8.2.3 Procedure #3: Termination Of Dataflash Contracts (Reference: §C.4.6.7.1, §C.4.7.2.(4), §C.4.7.2.(6), §C.4.7.2.(8), §C.4.7.2.(9), & §C.4.7.4.3)

This Procedure tests the different methods of terminating Dataflash contracts and can be performed in conjunction with Procedure 2 of §C.4.8.2.2 in order to minimize the total number of tests required.   

## Step 1 - Dataflash Contract Termination By The Interrogator Using The Ec Field

a. Establish the maximum number of contracts as in Procedure 2 §C.4.8.2.2. b. For an established contract send a Mode S uplink Frame containing an MSP packet 
as in Table C-4-5, on uplink MSP channel 6, but with the EC Field set to ZERO (0).  
(This should cause the contract to be cancelled.)   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance 
interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after each uplink frame in "b" above was sent.   

d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet as shown in 
Table C-4-7, on Downlink MSP channel 3 and it contains a DH field corresponding 
to the contract to be cancelled and that the CI field is set to a value of 4.  (This indicates that the contract has been cancelled.)   
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder.   
f. Repeat Step 1 for all the established contracts.   

## Step 2 - Dataflash Contract Termination By Transponder Register Losing Its Source Data

a. Establish the maximum number of contracts as in Procedure 2 Step 2 sections "a" to 
"e" in §C.4.8.2.2.   
b. For an established contract discontinue the loading of the relevant transponder 
register.  (This should cause the contract to be cancelled.)   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance 
interrogation shown in Table C-4-4, sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds 
after each uplink frame in "b" above was sent.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH field corresponding to the 
contract for the transponder register which is no longer serviced and that the CI field is set to a value of 7.  (This indicates that the contract has been cancelled.)   
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder.   
f. Repeat Step 1 for all the established contracts.   

## Step 3 - Dataflash Contract Termination By The Airborne Application Due To Link Failure

a. Establish a contract as in Procedure 2 Step 2 sections "a" to "e," in §C.4.8.2.2.   
b. Change and record the data pattern being loaded into the relevant transponder 
register.   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction is announced by the transponder, directed to the II 
code that was used in the requesting transaction, in the reply to a surveillance 
interrogation shown in Table C-4-4, sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds 
after the data change in "b" above.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH field equal to that in the 
request interrogation, and verify that the CI field is set to ZERO.  (This indicates that 
the contract has detected the change in data and is functioning correctly.) 
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder.   
f. Change and record the data pattern being loaded into the relevant transponder 
register.  
g. Verify that a downlink transaction is announced by the transponder in the reply to a 
surveillance interrogation no later than 1 second after the data change in "f" above.   
h. Wait 35 seconds. i. 
Verify that a downlink transaction is no longer announced in replies to surveillance interrogations.  (This indicates that the airborne system has declared a link failure and should have terminated the contract).   
j. 
Change the data pattern being loaded into the relevant transponder register and 
record the new pattern. 
Verify that NO downlink transaction is announced by the transponder in the reply to surveillance interrogations after the data change in "j" above.  (This means that the contract has been cancelled by the airborne system.) 

## Step 4 - Dataflash Contract Termination Due To Loss Of Service From An Interrogator With The Same Ii Code As The One That Initiated The Contract

a. Establish a contract as in Procedure 2 Step 2 sections "a" to "e," in §C.4.8.2.2.   
b. Change and record the data pattern being loaded into the relevant transponder 
register.   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction is announced by the transponder, directed to the II 
code that was used in the requesting transaction, in the reply to a surveillance 
interrogation shown in Table C-4-4, sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds 
after the data change in "b" above.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH field equal to that in the 
request interrogation, and verify that the CI field is set to ZERO.  (This indicates that the contract has detected the change in data and is functioning correctly.)   
e. Change the II code of all interrogations to the transponder, record the new II code, 
and repeat "a" to "d" above.  Verify in the CR field of the response in "d" above, that 
contracts are indicated for both the original and the new II codes.   
f. Wait 60 seconds from the time of the last interrogation with the original II code and 
repeat "b" to "d" above.  Verify in the response to "d" above that the CR field indicates no contracts for the original II code.  (This confirms that the contracts to the original II code have been cancelled.)   
g. Repeat the whole of Step 4 "a" to "f" to test all II codes as the original II code. 

## C.4.8.2.4 Procedure #4: Dataflash Header (Dh) Field Tests

(Reference: §C.4.6.5.1) 
This Procedure tests for the correct interpretation of the Contract Number Subfield 
(CNS) in the DH field.  The BDS code subfield interpretation is tested in §C.4.8.2.2 
Procedure #2 Step 2. 

## Step 1 - Establishing Multiple Contracts With A Single Transponder Register

a. Ensure that data is being loaded into the installed transponder registers and record 
the data being loaded into each transponder registers.   
b. Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing an MSP packet on uplink 
MSP channel 6 as in Table C-4-5, with the BDS1 and BDS2 codes set for a contract 
with a selected transponder register.   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was sent.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in the 
request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ONE (1).  (This indicates that the new contract was accepted and is active.)   
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder.   
f. Repeat Step 1 "a" to "e" using the same BDS1 and BDS2 codes in the interrogations 
in "c" above, and setting each of the other values in the CNS subfield in turn in "b" 
above.   
g. Repeat Step 1 "a" to "f" for at least three different transponder registers.   
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Note: If in "f" or "g" above the maximum number of contracts that the transponder can handle is reached, the contracts must be terminated by the method used in Procedure 3 Step 1 in §C.4.8.2.3 above, and this test continued to test all CNS 
values. 

h. Terminate all contracts by the method used in §C.4.8.2.3 Procedure 3 Step 1. 

## C.4.8.2.5 Procedure #5: Minimum Time (Mt) Field Tests

(Reference: §C.4.6.6 & §C.4.7.4.3) 
This Procedure tests for the correct interpretation of the Minimum Time (MT) field contained in the MSP packet of uplink MSP channel 6. 

## Step 1 - Data Changing At Longer Intervals Than The Value In The Mt Field

a. Ensure that data is being loaded into the installed transponder registers and record 
the data being loaded into each transponder registers.

MSP channel 6 as in Table C-4-5.   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance 
interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was sent.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP Packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in the 
request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ONE (1).  (This indicates that the new contract was accepted and is active.)   
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder. 
f. Change the transponder register data being loaded into the transponder register 
which was indicated in the contract initiated in "a" to "d" above. 
g. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the transponder register data was changed in the transponder register.   
h. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP Packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in the 
request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ONE (1).   
i. 
Use an interrogation as in Table C-4-4 but with the RR field and RRS subfield set to 
extract the GICB that was specified in the Dataflash request in Step 1 "f."  Verify 
that it contains the new changed data that was loaded into that transponder register. (This indicates that the changed data is immediately available as requested in the MT field.) 
j. 
Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the transponder. 
k. Repeat Step 1 "f" to "j" at least 10 times and verify that all the data changes are 
reported. 
l. 
Repeat  Step 1 "f" to "k" for values of 10, 50, 100, 150, and 255 seconds set into the 
MT field of the MSP packet in "b" above, and the transponder register data changes 
of "f" above, at rates of 11, 51, 101, 151, and 256 seconds respectively.  
m. Terminate all contracts by the method used in §C.4.8.2.3 Procedure 3 Step 1. 

## Step 2 - Data Changing At Shorter Intervals Than The Value In The Mt Field

a. Ensure that data is being loaded into the installed transponder registers and record 
the data being loaded into each transponder registers.   
b. Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing an MSP packet on uplink 
MSP channel 6 as in Table C-4-5.   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was sent.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in the 
request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ONE (1).  (This indicates that the new contract was accepted and is active.)   
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder. 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

f. Change the contract by sending a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing 
an MSP packet on uplink MSP channel 6 as in Table C-4-5, but with the MT field set 
to ONE (1) second. 
g. Change data being loaded into the transponder register at time intervals 
approximately equal to a quarter of the time indicated in the MT field of the requesting contract. 
h. Verify that a downlink transaction is NOT announced by the transponder in the reply 
to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder at any time earlier than the value in MT field.   
i. 
Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than the value in the MT field plus 0.1 seconds after the previous data extraction.   
j. 
Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in the 
request interrogation and the CI field is set to ZERO (0).  (This indicates a response to an existing contract.)   
k. Use an interrogation as in Table C-4-4 but with the RR field and RRS subfield set to 
extract the GICB that was specified in the Dataflash request in Step 2 "f" above.  
Verify that it contains the latest data that was loaded into that transponder register before expiry of the time value in the MT field.  (This indicates that the MT field is being interpreted correctly.)   
l. 
Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the transponder. 
m. Repeat Step 1 "f" to "l" with MT values of 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 255 seconds 
being set into the MSP packet on MSP uplink channel 6 of "f" above. 
n. Terminate the contract by the method used in §C.4.8.2.3 Procedure 3 Step 1. 

## C.4.8.2.6 Procedure #6: Event Criterion (Ec) Field Tests (Reference: §C.4.6.7.1, §C.4.6.8, §C.4.7.2.(5), §C.4.7.2.(7), & §C.7.4.3)

This Procedure tests the 4 bit Event Criterion Field (EC. Tests for the EC values of ZERO (0) and ONE (1) are covered in the previous Procedures.  CI field values 0, 1, 3, and 5, and CR field bit tests are included in this Procedure.   

## Step 1 - Tests With Ec Field = 2

a. Ensure that data is being loaded into one of the installed transponder registers and 
record the data being loaded into the transponder register. 
b. Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing an MSP packet on uplink 
MSP channel 6 as in Table C-4-10 with BDS1 and BDS2 codes to set up a contract 
with the register being loaded in "a" above, and the bits in the Change Quanta (CQ) 
field set to alternating Zeros and Ones, starting with a ZERO (0).   
 

|    |       |         |       | SR=1    | DH    | MT=0    | EC=2    | ST=0    | CQ Quanta (56 bits)    |
|----|-------|---------|-------|---------|-------|---------|---------|---------|------------------------|
|    | CNS=0 | RDS = 1 | Spare | BDS1    | BDS2  |         |         |         |                        |

 
Note: When EC=2 the Change Quanta (CQ) field is interpreted as 56 individual bits.  
When a bit is set to ZERO, the corresponding bit in the transponder register is not monitored and when it is set to a ONE a report is sent whenever the corresponding bit in the transponder register changes.   

c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame 
in "b" above was sent.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP Packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in the 
request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ONE (1).  (This indicates that the new contract was accepted and is active.)   
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder. 
f. For each bit in the transponder register in turn, change that bit and perform "g," "h," 
"i," "j," and "k" below. 
g. When the corresponding bit in the CQ Quanta is set to a ONE verify that a downlink 
transaction is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame

i. 
Extract all announced downlink transactions, and verify that they are MSP Packets 
on Downlink MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and they contain a DH equal to the 
value in the request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ZERO.   
j. 
Use an interrogation as in Table C-4-4 but with the RR field and RRS subfield set to 
extract the GICB that was specified in the Dataflash request in Step 1 "b" above.  
Verify that it contains the data that was loaded into that transponder register.  (This indicates that the change monitoring is functioning correctly.)

transponder. 
l. 
Repeat the whole of Step 1 for all of the transponder registers capable of being 
serviced.

Note: When EC=3 the Change Quanta field (CQ) is sub-divided into the same fields as 
the transponder register with which the contract is being made.  For each of these sub-divided fields ALL ZEROs indicates that changes to that parameter 
are not to be reported and ALL ONEs indicates that any change to that 
parameter **shall** be reported.  Otherwise the value in the subfield for a 
parameter **shall** be the decimal value of the quantum of the minimum change in 
that parameter, taking any sign bit into account, which has to be reported.  The units of the change parameter are the same as the least significant bit of the parameter being monitored.  Status and switch bits are treated as separate fields for change field monitoring.   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was sent.

When the sub divided field represents a numerical value set it to the least 
significant bit value. 
(ii) 
When the sub field represents a character or status information set it to ALL ONEs. 
c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was sent.

d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP Packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in the 
request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ONE (1).  (This indicates that the new contract was accepted and is active.)

i. 
Use an interrogation as in Table C-4-4 but with the RR field and RRS subfield set to 
extract the GICB that was specified in the Dataflash request in Step 3 "b" above.  
Verify that it contains the data that was loaded into that transponder register.  (This indicates that the change monitoring is functioning correctly.)

amount equal to less than its most significant bit.   
l. 
Verify that NO downlink transaction is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder after the parameter change in "i" above was sent.  (This indicates that the contract is functioning correctly.) 
m. Repeat the whole of Step 3 for all of the transponder registers capable of being 
serviced.   
n. Terminate all contracts by the method used in §C.4.8.2.3 Procedure 3 Step 1. 

## Step 4 - Tests With Ec Field = 4 (Only Report Changes Above A Threshold Value)

a. Ensure that data having a value of the least significant bit is being loaded, into all the 
fields that represent numerical values, into one of the installed transponder registers and record the data being loaded into the transponder register.   
b. Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing an MSP packet on uplink 
MSP channel 6 as in Table C-4-12 with BDS1 and BDS2 codes to set up a contract 
with the register being loaded in "a" above.  Set the sub fields in the Change Quanta 
(CQ) field to a value equal to a maximum of one quarter of the MSB, or to the LSB, in each case where the field represents a numerical value.  Set the CQ field to ALL ONEs where the field represents a character or status information etc.  Also set a Threshold value equal to the MSB for all fields that represent a numerical value in the CT Threshold. 

CT Threshold

EC=4 
STS=0 
CQ Quanta

Note: When EC=4 the Change Threshold (CT) field is sub-divided into the same subfields as the transponder register with which the contract is being made.  For each of these sub-divided fields ALL ZEROs indicates that changes to that parameter are not to be reported.  Otherwise the value in the subfield for a parameter **shall** be the decimal value of the threshold for that parameter taking any sign bit into account.  Only parameter changes that cross the threshold criterion are reported.  The Change Quanta (CQ) field is similarly divided into subfields which indicate that a change will not be reported for that subfield until the parameter has changed by at least the CQ value since the contract was agreed in the case of a first report, or since the last report generated by this contract. 

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was sent. 
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP Packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in the 
request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ONE (1).  (This indicates that the new contract was accepted and is active.)

transponder. 
f. For each parameter in the transponder register in turn, increment the parameter value 
every time a surveillance interrogation is sent to the transponder, in steps equal to the value that has been specified for it in the CQ Quanta until the threshold has been crossed by at least four increments, or has reached its maximum value, and perform the actions of "g," "h," "i," and "j" below. 
Note: The reason for crossing the threshold by four increments if possible is to verify 
that all changes greater that CQ that are above the threshold crossing are reported.   
g. Extract any announced downlink transaction and verify that they are MSP Packets on 
Downlink MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and they contain a DH equal to the 
value in the request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ZERO (0). 
h. Use an interrogation as in Table C-4-4 but with the RR field and RRS subfield set to 
extract the GICB that was specified in the Dataflash request in Step 4 "b" above.  
Verify that it contains the data that was loaded into that transponder register and that the data is equal to or has exceeded the value set in the threshold for the parameter under test.  (This indicates that the change monitoring is functioning correctly.)

Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the transponder. 
j. 
Verify that a correct downlink transaction was only received for each parameter 
increment that gave a value higher than the threshold. 
k. Repeat the whole of Step 4 for all of the transponder registers capable of being 
serviced.   
l.

MSP channel 6 as in Table C-4-13, with BDS1 and BDS2 codes to set up a contract 
with the register being loaded in "a" above, and the subfields in the Change Quanta (CQ) field set to the least significant bit value in each case where the subfield represents a numerical value, and to ALL ONEs where the field represents a character or status information etc.  Set a Threshold value equal to the MSB for all fields that represent a numerical value in the CT Threshold.   

CT Threshold

EC=5 
STS=0 
CQ Quanta

Note: When EC=5 the Change Threshold field (CT) is divided into the same subfields as the transponder register with which the contract is being made.  For each of these subfields ALL ZEROs indicates that changes to that parameter are not to be reported.  Otherwise the value in the subfield for a parameter **shall** be the decimal value of the threshold for that parameter taking any sign bit into account.  Only changes in the parameter that are equal to or greater than the CQ Quanta value and are lower than the threshold are reported.   

c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame 
in "b" above was sent.

MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in the 
request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ONE (1).  (This indicates that the new contract was accepted and is active.)   
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder.   
f. For each parameter in the transponder register in turn, decrement the parameter value 
every time a surveillance interrogation is sent to the transponder, in steps equal to the 
value that has been specified in the Dataflash contact request in Step 5 "b" above for 
it in the CQ Quanta until the threshold has been crossed by at least four decrements, or has reached its minimum value, and perform the actions of "g," "h," "i," and "j" below.   
g. Extract any announced downlink transactions and verify that they are MSP Packets 
on Downlink MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and they contain a DH equal to the 
value in the request interrogation.   
h. Use an interrogation as in Table C-4-4 but with the RR field and RRS subfield set to 
extract the GICB that was specified in the Dataflash request in Step 5 "b" above.  
Verify that it contains the data that was loaded into that transponder register and that the data is equal to or has gone below the value set in the threshold for the parameter under test.  (This indicates that the change monitoring is functioning correctly.)    
i. 
Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the transponder.   
j. 
Verify that a correct downlink transaction was only received for each parameter increment that gave a value lower than the threshold.   
k. Repeat the whole of Step 5 for all of the transponder registers capable of being 
serviced. 
l. 
Terminate all contracts by the method used in §C.4.8.2.3 Procedure 3 Step 1. 

## Step 6 - Tests With Ec Field = 6 (Only Report Changes When The Threshold Is Crossed)

a. Ensure that data having a value of at least 4 Quanta below the threshold or the 
minimum for the parameter, is being loaded into all the fields that represent numerical values, into one of the installed transponder registers and record the data being loaded into the transponder register.   
b. Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing an MSP packet on uplink 
MSP channel 6 as in Table C-4-14, with BDS1 and BDS2 codes to set up a contract 
with the register being loaded in "a" above, and the sub divided fields in the Change Quanta (CQ) field set to the least significant bit value in each case where the field represents a numerical value, and to ALL ONEs where the field represents a character or status information etc.  Set a Threshold value equal to the MSB for all fields that represent a numerical value in the CT Threshold.   

CT Threshold 
SR=1

MT=0 
EC=6 
ST=0 
CQ Quanta

CNS=0 
RDS = 1 
Spare 
BDS1

Note: When EC=6 the Change Threshold field (CT) is sub-divided into the same fields as the transponder register with which the contract is being made.  For each of these sub-divided fields ALL ZEROs indicates that changes to that parameter are not to be reported.  Otherwise the value in the subfield for a parameter **shall** 
be the decimal value of the threshold for that parameter taking any sign bit into account.  Only changes in the parameter that are equal to or greater than the CQ Quanta value and cross the threshold in either direction are reported.

request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ONE (1).  (This indicates that the new contract was accepted and is active.) 
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder.   
f. For each parameter in the transponder register in turn, increment the parameter value 
every time a surveillance interrogation is sent to the transponder, in steps equal to the 
value that has been specified in the Dataflash contract request in Step 6 "b" above (in 
the CQ Quanta) until a downlink transaction is announced in the reply to a surveillance interrogation then perform tests "g," "h," "i," and "j" below.   
g. Extract any announced downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP Packet on 
Downlink MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value 
in the request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ZERO (0).   
h. Use an interrogation as in Table C-4-4 but with the RR field and RRS subfield set to 
extract the GICB that was specified in the Dataflash request in Step 1 "b" above.  
Verify that it contains the data that was loaded into that transponder register and that the data has crossed the value set in the threshold for the parameter under test.  (This indicates that the change monitoring is functioning correctly.)   
i. 
Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the transponder. 
j. 
Verify that only one downlink transaction was announced and extracted and that it contained the data value for the first increment after the threshold was crossed. (This indicates that the threshold is functioning correctly.)   
k. Ensure that data having a value of at least 4 Quanta above the threshold, or the 
maximum value for the parameter, is being loaded into all the fields that represent 
numerical values, into one of the installed transponder registers and record the data being loaded into the transponder register.

c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was sent.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink

request interrogation.  Also verify that the CI field is set to a value of ONE (1) and the bit in the CR field corresponding to the II code used in "b" above is set to a value of ONE (1).  (This indicates that the contract was accepted and is active.)   
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder. 
f. Repeat Step 8 "a" to "e" incrementing the II code in the interrogation in "b" above 
until the maximum number of contracts that can be handled by the system under test have been established.  If the maximum number of contracts that can be handled exceeds the number of II codes repeat "a" to "e" above accessing different transponder registers by setting different values the BDS1 and BDS2 subfields in the

a. Ensure that fixed data is being loaded into one of the installed transponder registers 
and record the data being loaded into the transponder register.   
b. Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing an MSP packet on uplink 
MSP channel 6 as in Table C-4-16 with BDS1 and BDS2 codes to set up a contract 
with the register being loaded in "a" and ST set to ONE (1).    

|    |       |         |       | SR=1    | DH    | MT=0    | EC=2    | ST    | CQ Quanta (56 bits)    |

c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder no later than 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame 
in "b" above was sent.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP Packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in the 
request interrogation and the CI field is set to a value of ONE (1).  (This indicates that the new contract was accepted and is active.)   
e. Use an interrogation as in Table C-4-4 but with the RR field and RRS subfield set to 
extract the GICB that was specified in the Dataflash request in Step 1 "b" above, and 
with EC = 2.  Verify that it contains the data that was loaded into that transponder register for the parameter under test.   
f. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder.   
g. Change and record the data being loaded into any parameter of the transponder 
register by an amount that exceeds the Quanta value specified in the contract, at intervals equal to one quarter of the value in ST.   
h. Verify that NO downlink transaction is announced by the transponder in the reply to 
surveillance interrogations whilst the data is changing as in "g" above.   
i. 
Stop changing the data being loaded into the transponder register and record the register data.   
j. 
Verify that a downlink transaction is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder not earlier than a time equal to ST, and no later than time equal to the value of ST plus 0.1 seconds after the data was 
first changed.   
k. Extract all announced downlink transactions and verify that they contain MSP 
Packets on Downlink MSP channel 3 as in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal 
to the value in the request interrogation and the CI field is set to ZERO (0).   
l. 
Use an interrogation as in Table C-4-4, but with the RR field and RRS subfield set to 
extract the GICB that was specified in the Dataflash request in Step 1 "b" above.  
Verify that it contains the same data that was loaded into that transponder register at 
"i" above.   (This indicates that ST is functioning correctly.)   
m. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder. 
n. Repeat the "f" to "l" above, for each parameter in the transponder register. 
o. Repeat the "a" to "l" above setting values of ST = 2, 4, 8, 12, and 15 seconds in "b" 
above. 
p. Repeat the whole of Step 1 using at least three different transponder registers. q. Terminate all contracts by the method used in §C.4.8.2.3 Procedure 3 Step 1.

## C.4.8.2.8 Procedure #8: Maximum Message Rate

(Reference: §C.4.7.3, & §C.4.7.4.3) 
This Procedure tests that no more than ten Dataflash messages are output in any six seconds period and that waiting messages are queued and announced to the ground with an indication of delay by setting CI = 6 in the response, as soon as the maximum message criterion allows.   

## Step 1 - Initializing Contracts

a. Ensure that NO data is loaded into any of the transponder registers.   
b. Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing an MSP packet as shown 
in Table C-4-5, on uplink MSP channel 6.  With the BDS1 and BDS2 codes of the 
transponder register with which the contract is intended set into the DH field.   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was received by the transponder.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as shown in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in 
the request interrogation and a value of 2 in the CI field.  (This indicates that the new contract was not accepted.)  Also verify that the CR field contains ALL ZEROs. (This indicates that there are no Dataflash contracts in existence.)   
Note: Since RDS=1 in the contract request this test also verifies that the message register content is not sent when CI is not equal to ZERO.   

e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder. 
f. Repeat Step 1 requesting a contract for at least two transponder registers

at a rate faster than the minimum rate specified for each register.   
b. Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing an MSP packet as shown 
in Table C-4-5, on uplink MSP channel 6.  With the BDS1 and BDS2 codes of the 
transponder register with which the contract is intended set into the DH field.   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogation sent to the transponder 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was received by the transponder.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as shown in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in 
the request interrogation and a value of ONE (1) in the CI field.  (This indicates that the new contract was accepted.)   
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder.   
f. Change the data in one or more of the registers in order to trigger ten Dataflash 
messages every six seconds.   
g. Verify that downlink transactions, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, are announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance interrogations sent to the transponder 0.1 seconds after the each of the data changes in "e" above were received by the transponder.   
h. Extract and closeout the downlink transactions and verify that they are MSP packets 
on Downlink MSP channel 3 as shown in Table C-4-7, and they contain a DH equal 
to the value in the request interrogation and a value of ZERO (0) in the CI field. (This indicates that they are responses to an existing contract.)   
Note: Closeout each downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to 
the transponder. 

## Step 3 - Dataflash Message Triggering Rate Greater Than Six Messages Per Second

a. Ensure that fixed data is being loaded into the installed registers and being updated 
at a rate faster than the minimum rate specified for each register. 
b. Send a Mode S uplink frame to the transponder containing an MSP packet as shown 
in Table C-4-5, on uplink MSP channel 6 with the BDS1 and BDS2 codes of the 
transponder register with which the contract is intended set into the DH field.   
c. Verify that a downlink transaction, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction, is announced by the transponder in the reply to a surveillance 
interrogation sent to the transponder 0.1 seconds after the uplink frame in "b" above was received by the transponder.   
d. Extract the downlink transaction and verify that it is an MSP packet on Downlink 
MSP channel 3 as shown in Table C-4-7, and it contains a DH equal to the value in 
the request interrogation and a value of ONE (1) in the CI field.  (This indicates that the new contract was accepted.)   
e. Closeout the downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to the 
transponder. 
f. Change the data in one or more of the registers in order to trigger more than ten 
Dataflash messages every six seconds for a period of at least twelve seconds.   
g. Verify that downlink transactions, directed to the II code that was used in the 
requesting transaction are announced by the transponder in the replies to surveillance interrogations sent to the transponder starting 0.1 seconds after the first of the data changes in "f" above were received by the transponder.   
h. Extract and closeout all the downlink transactions and verify that they are MSP 
packets on Downlink MSP channel 3 as shown in Table C-4-7.  Verify that they 
contain a DH equal to the value in the request interrogation and do not exceed a rate of ten messages in any six seconds period.  Verify that messages, which are not delayed due to the Dataflash message limit of ten within six seconds, contain a value of ZERO (0) in the CI field.  (This indicates that they are normal responses to an existing contract.)  Also verify that Dataflash messages which have been delayed by queuing in order to remain within the limit for Dataflash messages contain a value of 6 in the CI field.  (This indicates that the responses to an existing contract which have been delayed due to Dataflash message limit queuing.)   
Note: Closeout each downlink transaction by means of a surveillance interrogation to 
the transponder.

## C.4.10 Implementation Guidelines For Dataflash C.4.10.1 Overview

Dataflash is a service which announces the availability of information from air-to-ground on an event-triggered basis.  This is an efficient means of downlinking information which changes occasionally and unpredictably. A contract is sent to the airborne application through the Mode S transponder and the ADLP using an uplink Mode S specific protocol (MSP) (MSP 6, SR = 1) as specified in ICAO Doc 9871, Appendix A.  This uplink MSP packet contains information specifying the events which should be monitored regarding the changes of data in a transponder register.  When the event occurs, this is announced to the ground installation using the AICB protocol. The ground installation may then request the downlink information which takes the form of a downlink MSP packet on channel 3 constituted of one or two linked Comm-B 
segments.  The second segment is a direct copy of the relevant transponder register specified in the contract. 

The ground system with the embedded dataflash application should determine if an aircraft supports the dataflash protocol as follows: 

 
- 
if bit 25 of transponder register 1016 is set to 1, the system will extract transponder 
register 1D16, then,  
 
- 
if bit 6 and bit 31 of transponder register 1D16 are set to 1, then the aircraft supports 
the dataflash service. 
 
C.4.10.2 
Minimum number of contracts 
The minimum number of contracts activated simultaneously that can be supported by the airborne installation should be at least 64.  In the case of a software upgrade of existing installations, at least 16 dataflash contracts should be supported. 

 

## C.4.10.3 Contract Request For A Transponder Register Not Serviced By The Airborne Installation

On the receipt of a dataflash service request, a downlink dataflash message should immediately be announced to the ground regardless of any event criteria.  This message is used by the ground system to confirm that the service has been initiated.  The message will only consist of one segment.  In the case of a service request for an unavailable transponder register, the message sent to the ground should only contain bits 1 to 40 of the downlink message structure with a CI field value of 2.  This value will indicate to the ground system that the service request cannot be honored because of the unavailability of the transponder register.  The service will then be terminated by the airborne dataflash function, and the ground system should notify the user which has initiated the request that the service request cannot be honored by the airborne installation. When a transponder register (which was previously supported) becomes unavailable and is currently monitored by a dataflash contract, a downlink dataflash message containing bits 1 to 40 will be sent with a CI field value of 7.  This will indicate to the ground that the transponder register is not serviced anymore.  The related contract is terminated by the airborne application, and the ground system should notify the user which has initiated the request that the service request has been terminated by the airborne installation.  An alternative means for the ground system to detect that the transponder register is not serviced any longer is to analyze the resulting transponder register 1016 which will be broadcast by the transponder to indicate to the ground system that transponder register 
1716 has changed.  The Mode S sensor should then extract transponder register 1716 and send it to the ground application.  The ground application should then analyze the content of this transponder register and should notice that the transponder register monitored by a dataflash contract is no longer supported by the airborne installation. 

## C.4.10.4 Service Continuity In Overlapping Coverage With Radars Using The Same Ii Code

Depending on the system configuration the following guidance should be taken into account to ensure service continuity in overlapping coverage of radars working with the same II code. 

 
C.4.10.4.1 
Radar with the dataflash application embedded in the radar software 
For this configuration it is necessary to manage the contract numbers which will be used by each station and to ensure that the same contract number for the same transponder register is not used by another sensor having overlapping coverage and working with the same II code.  The reason for this is that a sensor has no means of detecting if a contract it has initialized has been overwritten by another sensor using an identical dataflash header.  Also one sensor could terminate a contract because an aircraft is leaving its coverage and no other sensor would know that this contract had been closed.  For this reason, no dataflash contract termination should be attempted by either sensor in order to ensure a service continuity. When two ground stations with overlapping coverage and having the same II code each set up dataflash contracts with the same transponder register for the same aircraft, it is essential to ensure that the contract number is checked by each ground station prior to the closeout of any AICB which is announcing a dataflash message. 

 
C.4.10.4.2 
Use of an ATC centre-based dataflash application 
The ATC system hosting the dataflash application should manage the distribution of contract numbers for sensors operating with the same II code.  This ATC system will also have the global view of the aircraft path within the ATC coverage to either initiate or close dataflash contracts when appropriate.  This is the preferred configuration since a central management of the contract numbers is possible which also allows a clean termination of the contracts. 

 
C.4.10.5 
Ground management of multiple contracts for the same transponder register 
The ground system managing the dataflash application must ensure that when it receives a request from ground applications for several contracts to monitor different parameters, or different threshold criteria, related to the same transponder register for a particular aircraft/II code pair, it assigns a unique contract number for each contract sent to the aircraft. 

 

## C.4.10.6 Service Termination

There are three ways to terminate a dataflash service (one from the ground initiative, two from the airborne installation): 

1. The ground can send an MSP with the ECS field set to 0 which means that the 
service is to be discontinued by the airborne installation. 
2. The airborne installation will terminate the service with no indication to the ground 
system if any message is not extracted from the transponder by a ground interrogator 
within 30 seconds following the event specified in the dataflash contract (TZ timer). 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

3. When the transponder has not been selectively interrogated by a Mode S interrogator 
with a particular II code for 60 seconds (this is determined by monitoring the IIS subfield in all accepted Mode S interrogations), all dataflash contracts related to that II code will be cancelled with no indication to the ground system. 
The termination from the ground initiative is the preferable way to terminate the service since both the ground and the airborne systems terminate the service thanks to a mutually understood data link exchange.  This termination should nevertheless not be allowed in certain configurations especially with adjacent sensors (with the dataflash application embedded in the sensor software) working with the same II code as explained in §C.2.1. If the termination of the contract by a ground system is to be exercised, it should also be noticed that the ground system should anticipate the exit of the aircraft from its coverage to send the close-out message. 

## C.4.10.7 Dataflash Request Containing Multiple Contracts

It is possible to merge several contracts into one single dataflash request.  If multiple events occur which are related to several contracts of the initial dataflash request, one downlink message for each individual event should be triggered containing the associated transponder register.  Each of these downlink messages should use the air initiated protocol. 

## C.4.10.8 Transponder Register Data Contained In The Downlink Message

The transponder register data received by the ground system following the extraction of a downlink dataflash message consisting of two segments are the transponder register data at the time of the event.  The transponder register data may be up to 1 aerial scan old since the event may occur just after the illumination of the aircraft.  Should the end-user need more up-to-date data, the user should use the event announcement to trigger extraction via GICB protocol to get the latest transponder register data.

## D. For The Potential Addition Of Hijack Mode Operations 2.1.7 Flight Crew Control Functions The Following Functions **Shall** Be Provided.

a. 
Means of selecting each of the ATCRBS 4096 Identity Codes and of indicating the code selected. (1). 
If the Hijack Mode (§2.2.27) is activated by means that do not involve 
the Control Function, then the "7500" Hijack Code shall NOT be 
displayed by the Control Function. 
Note: 
An example of a means that does not involve the Control Function would be an input discrete connected to a switch. 

b. 
ATCRBS, ATCRBS/Mode S All Call, and Mode S-only All Call Interrogations 
(1). 
Non-Hijack Mode (§2.2.27): 
Means of selecting the condition in which the transponder is rendered incapable of generating replies to ATCRBS, ATCRBS/Mode S All Call, and Mode S-only All Call interrogations, but continues to generate Mode S squitter transmissions and continues to reply to discretely addressed Mode-S interrogations when the aircraft is on the ground (§2.2.13.1.2.c, 
§2.2.23.3.7, §2.2.18.2.7.b and §2.2.18.2.7.c) and NOT in the Hijack Mode (§2.2.27).  Return to normal operation from this condition **shall** be possible within five seconds.  If this condition is enabled automatically when the aircraft is on the ground, a flight crew switch is not necessary.  
If performed manually, this condition **shall** have no effect on the transmission of extended squitters (§2.2.23.1.2) or on the reporting of on-the-ground state (§2.2.13.1.2.c, §2.2.23.3.7, §2.2.18.2.7.b, and §2.2.18.2.7.c). Transponders that simulate ATCRBS/MODE S All Call interrogations in self-test/squitter transmission may occasionally open their window of non-acceptance for this purpose coincidental with an actual interrogation, thus generating a reply to the interrogations.  Such coincidental acceptance periods may be considered tolerable, but must not exceed one percent of transponder operating time. 

(2). 
Hijack Mode (§2.2.27): 
No method **shall** be capable of rendering the transponder incapable of generating replies to ATCRBS and Mode-S Only All-Call interrogations whenever the transponder is in the Hijack Mode (§2.2.27) whether in the airborne or in the on-ground state (§2.2.13.1.2.c, §2.2.23.3.7, 
§2.2.18.2.7.b and §2.2.18.2.7.c).  The transponder **shall** also continue to generate Mode S squitter transmissions and reply to discretely addressed Mode-S interrogations when the aircraft is in the Hijack Mode (§2.2.27). 

c. 
Standby Selection: 
(1). 
Non-Hijack Mode (§2.2.27): 
Means of selecting the condition in which all transponder functions, other than transmissions on the reply frequency and associated selftesting, are operational (i.e., the Standby condition) when NOT in the Hijack Mode (§2.2.27).  Return to normal operation from this condition shall be possible within five seconds. 

(2). 
Hijack Mode (§2.2.27): 
No method **shall** be capable of placing the transponder into the Standby Mode once the transponder has entered the Hijack Mode (§2.2.27) except as specified in §2.2.27.5.2. 

d. 
Means of initiating the IDENT (SPI) feature. 
e. 
Inhibiting Altitude Reporting: 
(1). 
Non-Hijack Mode (§2.2.27): 
Means of inhibiting the transmissions of altitude information, while retaining the ATCRBS framing pulses in ATCRBS Mode C replies and while transmitting all ZERO's in the altitude field of Mode S replies when NOT in the Hijack Mode (§2.2.27). 

(2). 
Hijack Mode (§2.2.27): 
No method **shall** be capable of placing the transponder in a mode that inhibits the transmission of altitude information when in the Hijack Mode (§2.2.27) and in the airborne state (§2.2.13.1.2.c, §2.2.23.3.7, 
§2.2.18.2.7.b and §2.2.18.2.7.c) except as specified in §2.2.27.2.1.1.b. 

f. 
If the aircraft uses a flight number for aircraft identification, a means **shall** be 
provided for the variable aircraft identification to be inserted by the pilot. 
 
2.1.10.1 
Antenna / Transponder Configurations When implementing the Hijack Mode (§2.2.27), a means **shall** be provided to distinguish to the transponder that the installation is primarily configured either as described in §2.1.10.1.a or as described in §2.1.10.1.b.

§2.1.10.1.a, §2.1.10.1.b, §2.1.10.1.c.(1), or §2.1.10.1.c.(2) **shall** be 
considered to be the same as the Single Antenna System and Dual Diversity Transponder configuration identified in subparagraph §2.1.10.1.b. 
Note: 
The single antenna system and single diversity transponder is included in this configuration type. 

 
2.2.27 
Mode S Transponder Hijack Mode 
Note: 
The following requirements address the implementation of the Hijack Mode via the Mode-S Transponder upon being commanded to enter the mode via Flight 
Crew Control functions (§2.1.7) or discrete inputs as identified in the 
subsequent paragraphs.  The following requirements **DO NOT** preclude 
implementation of the Hijack Mode function within existing transponder system installations using appropriate control components or functions which are fully external to the transponder unit itself. 
 
2.2.27.1 
Hijack Mode Entry Procedures 
Note 1: The term "Active On", introduced in the following subparagraphs, refers to 
the state where the transponder is not in the Hijack Mode nor the Standby state.  Refer to Section §2.1.7.c, which specifies the Standby state and thereby 
implies the Normal state, which is equivalent to the Active On state.   
Note 2: The terms "Active Hijack" mode and "Standby Hijack" mode, introduced in 
the following subparagraphs, refers to two different modes of operation as described below.  The term "Hijack Mode" is a generic term and refers to both the Active Hijack Mode and the Standby Hijack Mode of the transponder. 
 
2.2.27.1.1 
Standard "7500" Code Entry Upon continuous receipt (or selection) of 4096 Identity Code **"7500"** (see §2.1.7.a and 
§2.2.13.1.2.b) for a minimum period of 10 seconds, transponders **shall** operate depending upon the intended configuration and the initial state of the unit as follows: 

Note: 
The period of 10 seconds applies to "as seen by the transponder."  Any additional latency that is applied by the control function that is providing the "7500" code must be taken into consideration at the installed system level. 

## 2.2.27.1.1.1 Dual Antenna Systems And Dual Diversity Transponder Configuration Transponders Intended For Dual Antenna Systems And Dual Diversity Transponder Configuration (See §2.1.10.1.A) **Shall** Operate As Follows:

a. 
The Active On transponder **shall** enter the Active Hijack Mode. 
b. 
The Standby transponder **shall** enter the Standby Hijack Mode  
 
2.2.27.1.1.2 
Single Antenna System and Dual Diversity Transponder Configuration 
Transponders intended for Single Antenna System and Dual Diversity Transponder 
configurations (see §2.1.10.1.b) **shall** operate as follows: 
a. 
The Active On transponder **shall** enter the Active Hijack Mode. 
b. 
The Standby transponder **shall** enter the Active Hijack Mode.  
Note: 
For Single Antenna Set - Dual Diversity Transponder Configurations a means 
should be provided to ensure that the Standby transponder will not cause adverse emission effects on-board the aircraft. This may be implemented by having the transponder "check" if there is an antenna actually connected 
before transmitting in the Active Hijack Mode or ensuring that the standby transponder antenna ports are properly terminated. 

 
2.2.27.1.2 
"7500" Code Entry with SPI 
Upon receipt (or selection) of 4096 Identity Code "7500" (see §2.1.7.a and §2.2.13.1.2.b) and activation of the Special Position Identifier (SPI, Ident.) (see §2.1.7.d and 
§2.2.13.1.2.d) being coincident in any order, transponders **shall** operate depending upon the intended configuration and the initial state of the unit as follows: 

Note: 
        The requirement is written with any coincidence or order between the "7500" 
        Identity Code and the SPI since some controls immediately send the 4096 
        Identity Code upon activation of the SPI.  Other controls may add latency to 
        the code entry but not the SPI.  Still other installations may implement a 
        separate SPI activation such as a remotely activated discrete that is not a 
        direct function of the Control Panel. 

 
2.2.27.1.2.1 
Dual Antenna Systems and Dual Diversity Transponder Configuration Transponders intended for Dual Antenna Systems and Dual Diversity Transponder configurations (see §2.1.10.1.a) **shall** operate as follows:

b. 
The Standby transponder **shall** immediately enter the Standby Hijack Mode  
 
2.2.27.1.2.2 
Single Antenna System and Dual Diversity Transponder Configuration Transponders intended for Single Antenna System and Dual Diversity Transponder configurations (see §2.1.10.1.b) **shall** operate as follows: 

a. 
The Active On transponder **shall** immediately enter the Active Hijack Mode. 
b. 
The Standby transponder **shall** immediately enter the Active Hijack Mode. 
 
2.2.27.1.3 
Hijack Mode Discrete Initialization 
a. 
The transponder **shall** provide for a discrete input to allow Hijack mode 
activation.   
b. 
De-bounce time necessary to verify that the discrete was properly activated **shall** 
NOT exceed 1.0 seconds. 
c. 
Upon detection of the discrete input, transponders **shall** operate depending upon 
the intended configuration and the initial state of the unit as follows: 
 
2.2.27.1.3.1 
Dual Antenna Systems and Dual Diversity Transponder Configuration 
Transponders intended for Dual Antenna Systems and Dual Diversity Transponder 
configurations (see §2.1.10.1.a) **shall** operate as follows: 
a. 
The Active On transponder **shall** immediately enter the Active Hijack Mode. 
b. 
The Standby transponder **shall** immediately enter the Standby Hijack Mode. 
 
2.2.27.1.3.2 
Single Antenna System and Dual Diversity Transponder Configuration Transponders intended for Single Antenna System and Dual Diversity Transponder configurations (see §2.1.10.1.b) **shall** operate as follows: 

a. 
The Active On transponder **shall** immediately enter the Active Hijack Mode. 
b. 
The Standby transponder **shall** immediately enter the Active Hijack Mode. 
 
2.2.27.2

Mode-S replies. 
b. 
Set the SPI (see §2.2.4.1.3) active in all Mode-A ATCRBS replies for a period of 
18 ±1 seconds.

When in the Active Hijack Mode both an Airborne transponder and an On Ground transponder **shall** continually provide the transmission of valid altitude information (see §2.1.7.e.(2)) in all replies to interrogations required by §2.1.7.b and §2.1.7.e regardless of flight crew or other commands that may attempt to inhibit the reporting of altitude data. 

b. 
Invalid Altitude Information: 
 
When in the Active Hijack Mode, invalid altitude information **shall** result in 
both an Airborne transponder and an On Ground transponder continuing to: 
(1). 
Provide ATCRBS Mode C replies with ATCRBS Framing Pulses only 
(2). 
Provide Mode S replies with all ZERO's in the altitude field 
 
2.2.27.2.1.2 
TCAS Communication Requirements (if TCAS equipped) 
When in the Active Hijack mode, the transponder **shall** continue to support all TCAS 
operations as required with the following exceptions: 

a. 
The transponder **shall** set the Sensitivity Level Control sent to the on-board 
TCAS to a maximum capability of "TA Only" mode.  The following constraints 
shall apply: 
(1). 
If the Sensitivity Level Control (SLC) received by the transponder from its associated Control function is set to indicate a mode that is less than 
the "TA/RA" mode (i.e., SL=1 or 2) then the same SLC **shall** be 
provided to the on-board TCAS. 
(2). 
If the Sensitivity Level Control received from the Control function is set 
to TA/RA mode, then it **shall** be changed to TA Only (i.e., SL=2) prior 
to the transponder providing it to the on-board TCAS. 
Note 1: ARINC-735A, Attachment 6D provides the following definition for Manual Sensitivity Level Control via the ARINC-429 Label "016" 
TCAS, Mode-S, and TA/RA Display control word.

The transponder **shall** set the 4096 Identity Code sent to the on-board TCAS to 
the code of "7500" at all times while in the Active Hijack Mode. 

Note: 
        This action should be performed, as it may be advantageous in the 
        future to advise the on-board TCAS that the transponder system is set 
        to the Hijack mode. 

 
2.2.27.2.2 
On-Ground State Only The transponder **shall** continue to operate in accordance with §2.1.7.b when in the Active Hijack Mode and in the On-Ground state (§2.2.13.1.2.c, §2.2.23.3.7, §2.2.18.2.7.b and §2.2.18.2.7.c). 

 
2.2.27.2.3 
Loss of Control Once in the Active Hijack Mode, the transponder **shall** ensure that it remains in the Active Hijack mode even if all communication is lost with the Control function.  
Specifically, the transponder shall NOT enter the Active On, Standby or Standby Hijack modes upon determining that it is no longer receiving control information. 

Note: 
TCAS System installations require that the transponder pass control 
information to the TCAS Computer "AS RECEIVED."  Loss of control 
information to the transponder will result in loss of control information to the TCAS Computer, which in turn may result in a "TCAS System Fail" indication to the operator. 

## 2.2.27.3 Standby Hijack Mode Operations 2.2.27.3.1 General Requirements (Airborne And On-Ground States) Upon Entry Of The Standby Hijack Mode, Both An Airborne Unit And A Unit On The Ground Shall:

a. 
Accept no further transponder control information. 
Note: 
The typical Control functions implemented for the transponder include but are not limited to Standby/On selection, Altitude Reporting selection, SPI initiation, 4096 Identity Code selection, Altitude Data Source selection, Transponder "1/2" selection, and Functional Test activation. 
b. 
NOT reply to ATCRBS interrogations. 
c. 
NOT reply to Mode S interrogations. 
d. 
NOT emit squitter transmissions. 
e. 
Remain in Standby Hijack Mode until the Hijack Mode Exit procedure is performed 
(see 
subparagraph 
§2.2.27.5 
and 
specifically 
§2.2.27.5.2).  
Specifically, the transponder shall NOT be capable of exiting the Standby 
Hijack Mode and entering the Active Hijack or the Active ON Mode. 
 
2.2.27.3.2 
TCAS Communication Requirements (if TCAS equipped) 
When in the Standby Hijack mode, the transponder **shall** continue to support all TCAS 
operations as required with the following exceptions: 

a. 
The transponder **shall** set the Sensitivity Level Control sent to the on-board 
TCAS to a maximum capability of TA Only mode.  The following constraints 
shall apply: 
(1). 
If the Sensitivity Level Control (SLC) received by the transponder from 
its associated Control function is set to indicate a mode that is less than 
the TA/RA mode (i.e., SL=1 or 2) then the same SLC **shall** be provided 
to the on-board TCAS. 
(2). 
If the Sensitivity Level Control received from the Control function is set

the code of "7500" at all times while in the Standby Hijack Mode. 
Note: 
This action should be performed, as it may be advantageous in the future to advise the on-board TCAS that the transponder system is set 
to the Hijack mode. 
 
2.2.27.3.3 
Loss of Control Once in the Standby Hijack Mode, the transponder **shall** ensure that it remains in the Standby Hijack mode even if all communication is lost with the Control function.  
Specifically, the transponder shall NOT enter the Standby, Active On, or Active Hijack modes upon determining that it is no longer receiving control information. 

Note: 
TCAS System installations require that the transponder pass control 
information to the TCAS Computer "AS RECEIVED."  Loss of control information to the transponder will result in loss of control information to the TCAS Computer, which in turn may result in a "TCAS System Fail" indication 
to the operator. 
 
2.2.27.4 
Hijack Mode Indication 
a. 
A means **shall** be provided to indicate that the transponder is in the Active 
Hijack Mode. 
b. 
A means **shall** be provided to indicate that the transponder is in the Standby 
Hijack Mode for transponders intended for installation in the Dual Antenna Systems and Dual Diversity Transponder configuration. 
Note: The Standby Hijack Mode indication is required to give some indication that the transponder is in that mode.  Otherwise, it would be impossible to verify that the transponder exits the mode upon proper execution of the exit procedures. 

c. 
Momentary power interrupts shall NOT cause the indication described in 
subparagraph §2.2.27.4.a. to give a false indication that the Active Hijack Mode 
is active. 
d. 
Momentary power interrupts shall NOT cause the indication described in 
subparagraph §2.2.27.4.b. to give a false indication that the Standby Hijack Mode is active. 
Note: 
The Hijack Mode Indication is specifically not intended for flight deck implementation.  Some installations may not desire an indication of the Hijack Mode: however, the transponder must be capable of providing such capability if other installations or regulatory agencies should require such indication.   
 
2.2.27.5 
Hijack Mode Exit Procedures 
Note: 
Refer to §2.2.13.1.2.c, §2.2.23.3.7, §2.2.18.2.7.b, and §2.2.18.2.7.c for 
determination of Airborne or On-Ground (i.e., Surface) state. 
 
2.2.27.5.1 
Airborne State Performance of Hijack Mode Exit Procedures (§2.2.27.5) while in the airborne state shall result in the transponder NOT exiting the Active Hijack Mode nor the Standby Hijack Mode. 

 
2.2.27.5.2 
On-Ground State While in the On-Ground State, a means **shall** be provided that **shall** result in: 

a. 
The Active Hijack Mode transponder exiting the Active Hijack mode. 
b. 
The Standby Hijack transponder exiting the Standby Hijack Mode. 
c. 
The following indications that the Hijack Mode Exit operation has successfully been accomplished. (1). 
Provide a satisfactory visual indication (e.g., illuminating the Functional Test Lamp) for a minimum period of 1 second. 
(2). 
Ensuring that the Active Hijack Mode Indication (§2.2.27.4.a) indicates 
that the Active Hijack Mode is NOT active. 
(3). 
Ensuring that the Standby Hijack Mode Indication (§2.2.27.4.b) 
indicates that the Standby Hijack Mode is **NOT** active. 
 
2.2.27.6 
Power Interrupt Conditions If the Hijack Mode Exit procedure has not been performed as per §2.2.27.5.2, transponders that have the capability to retain last known state information prior to a Power Off condition (e.g., Non-Volatile Memory, etc.) **shall** provide the capability for the transponder to return to the Active Hijack Mode or Standby Hijack Mode upon restoration of power. 

2.5.4.40 
Procedure #40 Mode S Transponder Hijack Mode (§2.2.27) 
Part 1 of this procedure verifies that the transponder intended for a Dual Antenna System and Dual Diversity Transponder Configuration properly executes all the Hijack Mode Entry requirements specified in §2.2.27 for the Mode S Transponder Hijack Mode. Part 2 of this procedure verifies that the transponder intended for a Single Antenna System and Dual Diversity Transponder Configuration properly executes all the Hijack Mode Entry requirements specified in §2.2.27 for the Mode S Transponder Hijack Mode. Parts 3 and 4 of this procedure tests the functions of the Hijack Modes and contains the actual tests which are common to both types of installation configuration.  These tests are called out specifically in Parts 1 and 2 as needed. Part 5 of this procedure tests the power interrupt operations of the Hijack Modes. 

Note: 
        This entire procedure assumes that the transponder is configured such that the 
        Air/Ground discrete inputs are being used to inhibit replies in accordance with 
        §2.1.7.b.

## Appendix E Details Of The Changes From Do-181D To Do-181E

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## Executive Summary

The update to the Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System/Mode Select (ATCRBS/Mode S) Airborne Equipment, published by RTCA on October 2, 2008 as RTCA DO-181D, is contained herein as The Details of the Changes from RTCA DO-181D to DO-181E, and has been produced to reflect the changes that have resulted in requirements and test procedures for airborne transponder equipment.   
This **Appendix** represents **The Details of the Changes from RTCA DO-181D to DO-181E**.  
RTCA Special Committee 209 (SC-209) and EUROCAE Working Group 49 (WG-49) were reconvened for the purpose of updating their respective Transponder MOPS documents to include changes that were necessary to reflect other changes that were made when the ADS-B MOPS 
documents (RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A) were published in December 2009.   
The primary changes to the ADS-B MOPS that required modifications to the Transponder MOPS 
dealt with: 

1. 
The changes to the characteristics of the ADS-B Target State and Status (Register 6216) and 
the Aircraft Operational Status (Register 6516) Messages, which were removed from under the 
Event-Driven Protocol and given specific broadcast rates as Periodic Status Messages. Additional issues relate to resolving the requirements related to timeout and termination of these Registers.   
2. 
The changes to the specification for the maximum number of squitters from a hard limit of 6.2 
per second to "6.2 per second averaged over any 60 second interval, except during an 
emergency condition."   
3. 
The changes to the timeout and termination of the ADS-B Velocity Message.   
4. 
The changes to Transponder MOPS test procedures to more closely align with those in the ADS-B MOPS (RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A).   
There were additional changes that were required to the Transponder MOPS to correct errors that have been discovered in the test procedures and certain other typographical errors uncovered by manufacturers as they have implemented transponders compliant with RTCA DO-181D. 

Additionally, the ICAO Aeronautical Surveillance Panel Technical Subgroup identified and discussed issues that have been reported by Civil Aviation Authorities since the publication of RTCA DO-181D in October 2008 and there were changes to the Transponder MOPS documents that were requested to be discussed and resolved in the following areas: 

a. 
To clarify the differences in the treatment of the ADS-B Identification Register 0816 and the 
Enhanced Surveillance (EHS) Identification Register 2016.   
b. 
To resolve the issues that have led to Mode S interrogators in Europe that support EHS receiving the contents of a Register that was not requested.  This issue has come to be referred to as "BDS Swap."   
c. 
To resolve the issue of how a Transponder should reply to an unassigned DI Codes. 
d. 
To clarify the reply rate requirements in the ICAO SARPs and Transponder MOPS and 
potentially adopt changes to clarify current requirements.   
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

e. 
Clarified the Transponder processing for the Comm-B Protocol and enhanced the test 
procedures.   
f. 
To propose language to strengthen the Flight ID requirements such that the display of Flight 
ID and the crew entry must be simple to access and modify both on-the-ground and in flight.   
g. 
To enhance aircraft monitoring by defining a clear set of parameters in a newly defined 
Register for Transponder maintenance and diagnostics.   
h. 
To specify changes in the Mode S Subnetwork Version Number as a result of the proposed 
changes to the Transponder MOPS and the corresponding changes that are being specified for the ICAO Doc 9871, Edition 2 to correspond to ADS-B Version 2 formats.   
i. 
To provide a means to control the on-the-ground condition for aircraft operating without a squat switch and to clearly indicate that when on the surface that all surface format messages 
would be broadcast if so commanded.  Resolution of these issues led to changes in the TCS 
and RCS commands.  Additional changes to the RCS command removed the ability to inadvertently suppress the broadcast of Extended Squitters.   
j. 
To investigate and potentially attempt to resolve issues raised by a signal-in-space study 
commissioned by EASA related to measuring and analyzing the actual signal-in-space as it 
exists in several parts of the European airspace with respect to radar and transponder performance.  This issue came to be known as the I/Q modulation issue.   
k. 
To clarify that the transponder should interpret multisite lockout in an interrogation where 
DI=1, 7, and non-selective lockout in the same interrogation, where PC=1, and set the TD and 
appropriate TL timers accordingly from that single interrogation.   
l. 
To discuss the elimination of the requirement to reply to a wide P4 interrogation.  This 
resulted in clarifying notes to be added to warn manufacturers that the P4LONG may be 
eliminated in a future version of the Transponder MOPS. 

## E. Details Of The Changes From Rtca Do-181D To Do-181E Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System/Mode Select (Atcrbs/Mode S) Airborne Equipment

. This Appendix prescribes the Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for airborne transponder equipment, modified as described in this Appendix.  The applicable standards basis for those changes requested in this Appendix is RTCA DO-181D, "Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System/Mode Select (ATCRBS/Mode S) Airborne Equipment," issued October 2, 2008. This Appendix was originally prepared as a "Change 1 to DO-181D."  However, during the course of development, both RTCA and EUROCAE made the decision to completely reissue the Transponder MOPS documents in light of the number of significant changes made.  In order to indicate to the reader exactly what changes were made between RTCA DO-181D and RTCA DO-
181E, this Appendix will use change numbers such as (1.1) through (**1.xxx**), to describe specific changes made to create RTCA DO-181E. In the following requested changes, for those items where existing text is requested to change, the new text is underlined and highlighted in blue, and deleted text is presented in strikethrough and red text.  In those changes where a totally new section or text is inserted, all the text is presented in underline and highlighted in blue 

 
(1.1) 
In RTCA DO-181D, in section §1.4.3.1, correct the spelling of the word "prescribed
" in the 
bullet-list lead-in sentence, and replace bullet "b" with the following: 
 
b.    ATCRBS/Mode-S all-call and Mode S-only
 all-call transactions, 
(1.2) 
In RTCA DO-181D, in numerous sections, beginning with §1.4.3.2 a method is described, 
which is referred to as the "Overlay Command Capability," to address a problem identified in both European and US airspace, known as the "BDS Swap Issue," where interrogators have been found to receive the contents of a Register that was not requested.  Proposed changes to the Transponder MOPS documents are based on first receiving a command bit 
from the interrogator to overlay Register information over the 24-bit address/parity in the 
reply to the interrogation.  The parity is established by first performing a Modulo-2 Sum using the most significant 8 bits of the Address ("AA") field with the Register number.  The results are then used to generate a Data Parity (DP) field in the same manner that the AP field is currently generated.  To prevent impact to current interrogators and transponders in the field, the method also provides for the transponder to annunciate capability to support the DP field.  All of the proposed changes are identified in Working Paper SC209-WP14-
05R3.   
(1.3) 
In RTCA DO-181D, in section §1.4.6, in the text of "Example 2," in the third line: 
 
Replace "*125 wats*" **with** "*125 watts*" 
 
 
(1.4) 
In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.1.7, in order to strengthen the Flight ID requirements such 
that the display and crew entry must be simple to access and modify while on the ground or 
during flight, make the following changes to subparagraph "f:" 
 
f. 
If the aircraft uses a flight number for aircraft identification, a means **shall** be provided 
for the variable aircraft identification to be inserted by the pilot while on the ground, or 
during flight.  The means for modifying and displaying aircraft identification **shall** be a 
simple crew action independent of the entry of other flight data.
   
 
 
(1.5) 
In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.1.11.1, in order to clarify that different types of 
modulators could be used to generate the phase reversal and that a diode detector can only 
be used for test purposes as described in Working Paper SC209-WP12-15R2, add the 
following *Note* just after bullet "b" and prior to §2.1.11.2:    
 
Note: The 1030 MHz transmitter can generate phase reversal using different methods.  
This includes hard keying with strong amplitude drop and rapid phase reversal or IQ modulation with little or no amplitude drop, but with a frequency shift of several MHz during the phase reversal. 
(1.6) 
In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.1.11.4.3, in order to clarify that different types of 
modulators could be used to generate the phase reversal and that a diode detector can only 
be used for test purposes as described in Working Paper SC209-WP12-15R2, add the 
following *Note* just after the text of the paragraph and prior to §2.1.11.4.4:   
 
Note: The 1030 MHz transmitter can generate phase reversal using different methods.  
This includes hard keying with strong amplitude drop and rapid phase reversal or IQ modulation with little or no amplitude drop, but with frequency shift during the phase reversal and slow phase reversal (80ns).   

 
(1.7) 
In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.1.11.4.4, in order to correct a value in the spacing section 
for the P5 pulse to sync phase reversal, make the following change: 
 

P5 to sync phase reversal         0.40  +/- 0.1 
0.05 

 
(1.8) 
In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.2.1, in order to clarify that different types of modulators could be used to generate the phase reversal and that a diode detector can only be used for test purposes as described in Working Paper SC209-WP12-15R2, add the following *Notes* just after the text of the paragraph and prior to §2.2.2.2:    
 
1. The 1030 MHz transmitter can generate phase reversal using different methods.  This 
includes hard keying with strong amplitude drop and rapid phase reversal or IQ modulation with little or no amplitude drop, but with frequency shift during the phase reversal and slow phase reversal (80ns). 2. The transponder cannot make any assumption on the type of modulation technology used 
and therefore cannot rely on the specificities of the signal during the phase reversal to 
detect a phase reversal. 
(1.9) 
In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.2.4.f, in order to harmonize with the same requirement 
stated in EUROCAE ED-73C, §3.2.4.f, and to be consistent with the established test 
procedure already in RTCA DO-181D in §2.4.2.1, Step 3, make the following addition to 
sub-bullet "f:"   
 
f. The reply ratio **shall** be at least 90 percent for ATCRBS and ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call 
interrogations between MTL +3 dB
 and -21 dBm.   
 
 
(**1.10**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.3.3, *Note #2* expresses a requirement that is based in 
ICAO Annex 10, Volume 4, §4.3.11.f.  This requirement is stated again in §2.2.22.f.  Since requirements cannot exist inside a *Note*, edit *Note #2* as follows:    
 
2. If the transponder is used in conjunction with TCAS equipment, the RF power in the 
inactive state at 1090 +/- 3 MHz at the terminals of the Mode S transponder antenna 
shall must not exceed -70 dBm in accordance with §2.2.22.f
.     
(**1.11**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.3.4.1, in order to clarify the requirement for reply rate, 
insert a second note at the end of the paragraph as follows: 
 
Notes:  
1. *A 15 pulse reply includes 2 framing pulses, the 12 information pulses, and the SPI pulse.* 
2. The reply rate requirement of 500 replies per second establishes the minimum 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

continuous reply rate capability of the transponder.  As per the altitude and speed criteria above, the 100 or 120 replies in a 100 millisecond interval defines the peak capability of the transponder.  The transponder must be capable of replying to this short term burst rate, but may not be capable of sustaining this rate.  If the transponder is subjected to interrogation rates beyond its reply rate capability, the reply rate limit control of §2.2.7.3.1 acts to gracefully desensitize the transponder in a manner that favors closer interrogators.  Desensitization eliminates weaker interrogation signals.   
 
 
(**1.12**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.4.2.5.b, insert the text as described below: 
 
b. At all RF input levels from MTL to -21 dBm, the first preamble pulse of the reply **shall** 
occur 128 ±0.5 microseconds after the leading edge of the
 P4 pulse of the 
ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation.  At all RF input levels from MTL +3 dB to -21 
dBm, the jitter of the reply delay **shall not** exceed ±0.1 microsecond, peak (99.9 
percentile). 
 
 
(**1.13**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.10.2, replace the contents of the paragraph with the 
following edited text: 
 
A squitter monitor **shall** be provided to verify that the Mode S transponder generates short and Extended Squitters at their nominal rates (see §2.2.18.2.6 and §2.2.23.1).  Event Driven Squitter rates are not required to be monitored to meet this requirement.

  The transponder shall be considered failed when the monitor has detected squitter failure.    

 
 
(**1.14**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.13.1.2, in order to strengthen the Flight ID requirements 
such that the display and crew entry must be simple to access and modify while on the 
ground or during flight, make the following changes to subparagraph "e:" 
 
e. 
 
If the aircraft uses a flight number for aircraft identification, a means **shall** be provided 
for the variable aircraft identification to be inserted by the pilot
 while on the ground, or 
during flight.  The means for modifying and displaying aircraft identification **shall** be 
a simple crew action independent of the entry of other flight data.   
 
 
(**1.15**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.14.4.28, in order to clarify the regular use of nonselective lockout to block mistaken replies to ATCRBS-only All-Call, as identified in Working Paper SC209-WP11-16, make the following changes in the paragraph after the table describing the PC Code definitions. 
 
The PC field values 2 through 7 shall be ignored and the values 0 and 1 **shall** be processed
 
for the processing of surveillance or Comm-A interrogations containing DI=3 (see 
§2.2.19.2.1.1).    

 
 
(**1.16**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.18.2.1.c, in order to correct a bad paragraph reference to 
the function G(x), make the following correction: 
 
Replace "G(x) is defined in 2.2.16.2.1 b." **with** "G(x) is defined in §2.2.18.2.1.b" 

 
(**1.17**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.18.2.2.c, in order to inform the Transponder community 
that there is a possibility that the P4 Long will be eliminated sometime in the future, as 
specified in Working Paper SC209-WP13-09R1, add a *Note* after the text of bullet "c."  
Additionally, in order to harmonize the text of bullet "c" with EUROCAE ED-73(), make 
the following addition of text to the end of bullet "c."   
 
. 
c. ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call - An ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation (1.6 
microseconds P4) shall be accepted unless the TD timer is running or side lobe 
suppression is in effect or when in the "on-the-ground" state (consistent with the CA, VS 
and FS fields)
 
Note: The acceptance of ATCRBS/Mode S All Call interrogations may be disabled in a future version of these MOPS.   

 
 
(**1.18**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.18.2.3, add a line to the table, and delete the last 
sentence in the paragraph as follows:   
 

Interrogations 
ATCRBS Mode A 
Replies 
4096 Codes 
ATCRBS Mode C 
Altitude Codes 
ATCRBS Mode A/Mode S All-Call 
Reply is DF=11 
ATCRBS Mode C/Mode S All-Call 
Reply is DF=11 
Mode S-only All-Call (UF=11) 
Reply is DF=11 

 For all Mode S interrogations the reply format number (DF) shall be the same as the interrogation format number (UF). 

 
(**1.19**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.18.2.4, in order to clarify the regular use of nonselective lockout to block mistaken replies to ATCRBS-only All-Call, as identified in Working Paper SC209-WP11-16, and modified during final comment resolution during Meeting #14, and recorded in ICAO ASP TSG Working Paper TSGWP10-12R1, add the 
following *Note* after the second paragraph and prior to Figure 2-13:    
 
Note: Non-selective All-Call lockout and multisite lockout are not mutually exclusive.  
Interrogators using multisite lockout protocols for interrogator networking coordination may use non-selective lockout commands in the same interrogation. The non-selective lockout may be used to prevent Mode S transponder replies with DF=11 to wrongly detected ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations from ATCRBS- Only All-Call interrogations because of the misinterpretation of the narrow P4 pulse as a wide P4 pulse.   

 
 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

(**1.20**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.18.2.4, in order to clarify the regular use of nonselective lockout to block mistaken replies to ATCRBS-only All-Call, as identified in 
Working Paper SC209-WP11-16, and to make clear that the transponder should interpret 
multisite lockout in an interrogation where DI=1, 7, and non-selective lockout in the same 
interrogation where PC=1, and set the TD and appropriate TL timers accordingly from that 
single interrogation, replace Figure 2-13 with the following:   
(**1.21**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.18.2.5, in order to clarify the regular use of nonselective lockout to block mistaken replies to ATCRBS-only All-Call, as identified in 
Working Paper SC209-WP11-16, and modified during final comment resolution during 
Meeting #14, and recorded in ICAO ASP TSG Working Paper TSGWP10-12R1, prior to 
§2.2.18.2.6, add the following as *Note #3*:    
 
Note 3: Non-selective All-Call lockout and multisite lockout are not mutually exclusive.  
Interrogators using multisite lockout protocols for interrogator networking coordination may use non-selective lockout commands in the same interrogation. The non-selective lockout may be used to prevent Mode S transponder replies with DF=11 to wrongly detected ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations from ATCRBS-Only All-Call interrogations because of the misinterpretation of the narrow P4 pulse as a wide P4 pulse.    

 
 
(**1.22**) In RTCA /DO-181D, in section §2.2.18.2.6, in order to clarify the use of the TCS command 
to control Extended Squitter broadcasts, as identified in Working Paper SC209-WP11-12R1, 
make the following edits to subparagraph "c" as follows:   
 
c. Conditions for Acquisition Squitter Transmission - The following applies to 
transponders transmitting Extended Squitters.  When commanded to report the surface 
position type formats by TCS commands (see §2.2.23.1.7), aircraft without automatic 
means of determining the on-the-ground condition, and aircraft with such means that are 
reporting airborne state, **shall** transmit acquisition squitters in addition to the surface 
position Extended Squitter format
s unless acquisition squitter transmission has been 
inhibited (subparagraph d.). 

Note 1:  
          This action is taken to ensure TCAS acquisition in the event that the ground 
          station inadvertently commands an airborne aircraft to report the surface 
          position type of Extended Squitter formats

.  

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

 
If aircraft are commanded to stop emitting surface position Extended Squitter format
s by 
RCS command equal to 3 or 4 (see §2.2.23.1.7), these aircraft **shall** begin to emit the 
acquisition squitter (if not already doing so). 
(**1.23**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.18.2.7, in bullet "a" just after *Note 1*, add the following 
new requirement: 
 
When the transponder transitions to normal operation (see §2.1.7.c) it **shall** initiate a 
temporary alert for 18 ±1 seconds. 
(**1.24**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.19.1, replace the contents of bullets "a," "b," and "c" 
with the following edited text:  
 
a. 
Process uplink and downlink formats DF=16, UF=DF=16, 20 and 21 (Figure 2-14).  
The formats UF=DF=16 are is
 optional: 
 
Note: DF=16 is available in transponders supporting Crosslink capability (see 
§2.2.14.4.7).  UF=16 is supported by transponders connected to an on-board operational TCAS (see §2.2.22). 

 
b. 
Receive broadcast transmissions from sensors (§2.2.19.1.11). 
 
c. 
Follow the protocols for: 
 
Comm-A (see §2.2.19.1.10). Comm-B (see §2.2.19.1.12). 

Comm-U/V (air-air) (see §2.2.19.1.16) (optional). Multisite message operation (see §2.2.19.2). Report Codes 4 through 7 in the CA field (see §2.2.14.4.6). TCAS crosslink capability (see §2.2.19.1.18). 

 
(**1.25**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.19.1.4, replace the first table with the table below and 
add a new *Note* below the table as follows:

Note: The transponder does not reply when the conditions of §2.2.18.2.3 apply. 

 
(**1.26**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.19.1.6, as identified in Working Paper SC209-WP11-
20R1, replace Figure 2-17 with the following:    
 
(**1.27**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.19.1.11, in the first sentence of the paragraph, in order 
to correct a bad reference: 
 
Change §2.2.18.2.2 to §2.2.19.1.1 

(**1.28**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.19.1.12, as noted in Working Paper SC209-WP12-08R1, to account for DI=3, changes 
were made in Figure 2-20.  Additional changes were made with Working Paper SC209-WP14-05R3 for the BDS Swap issue.  
 

 
(**1.29**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.19.1.12.4, in order to comply with changes to the 
Comm-B protocol made after review of Working Paper SC209-WP12-08R1, and to delete a 
bad reference held over from earlier versions of DO-181, make the following edits to the 
paragraph: 
 
An air-initiated Comm-B sequence **shall** start upon the acceptance of a message intended for delivery to the ground sensor.  After receipt of this message, the transponder **shall** insert codes 1 or 3 in the DR field of a surveillance or Comm-B reply, DF=4, 5, 20, 21.  On receipt of this announcement, the interrogator transmits code 16 with DI≠7 or with DI=7 and RRS=0 in the RR field of a subsequent interrogation.  This includes when DI=4, 5 or 6, which are currently reserved.  Receipt of this code by the transponder **shall** constitute the authorization to transmit the data.  The resulting MB field contains a code identifying the content of the field.  This reply, and others following it, **shall** continue to contain codes 1 or 
3 in the DR field.  After the message has been transmitted at least once in response to an interrogation using non-selective protocols (see §2.2.17.2.3.4) and after closeout is received 
(Code 4 in the PC field) in UF=4, 5, 20, 21, the transaction **shall** be closed out and the DR 
code belonging to this message immediately removed.  Another message waiting to be transmitted can then set the DR code to 1 or 3 so that the reply can contain the announcement of this next message.  If RR=16 with DI≠7, or with DI=7 and RRS=0, is received while no message is waiting to be transmitted, the reply **shall** contain all ZEROs in the MB field.  An interrogation with DI=3 **shall not** affect the state of the Air-Initiated Comm-B protocol.

 
(**1.30**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.19.1.12.5, in order to adjust the requirements to account 
for Comm-B extraction using DI=3, as suggested in Working Paper SC209-WP11-09R1, 
make the following changes in the first paragraph after the *Note*:    
 
A Comm-B broadcast starts, when no air-initiated Comm-B transaction is in effect, with the insertion of DR codes 4, 5, 6 or 7 into downlink transmissions of DFs 4, 5, 20, 21 and with the starting of the B-timer.  On receipt of the above DR codes, interrogators may extract the broadcast message by transmitting RR=16 with DI≠3 or 7, or with DI=3 or
 7 and RRS=0 in subsequent interrogations.  When the B-timer runs out after 18 ±1 seconds, the transponder will reset the DR codes as required, will discard the previous broadcast message and change from 1 to 2 (or vice versa) the broadcast message number. 

 
 
(**1.31**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.19.1.18, in order to correct a bad paragraph reference, 
and also make revisions related to the GICB revisions discussed in Working Paper TSG 
WP08-02R1, revise the paragraph as follows: 
 
In response to a UF=0 with RL=1 (see §2.2.14.4.33) and DS≠0 (see §2.2.14.4.13), the transponder **shall** reply with a DF=16 reply in which the MV field **shall** contain the contents of the ground-initiated Comm-B register designated by the DS value.  If the requested Register is not supported by the aircraft installation, then the transponder **shall** reply with an MV field containing ALL ZEROs.

  In response to a UF=0 with RL=1 and DS=0, the transponder **shall** reply with a DF=16 with an MV field of ALL ZEROs.  Receipt of a UF=0 
with DS≠0, but RL=0 **shall** have no associated TCAS crosslink action, and the transponder shall reply per §2.2.14.4.33.   

 
 
(**1.32**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.19.2.1.1, in order to comply with changes to the Comm-
B protocol contained in Working Paper SC209-WP12-08R1, add subparagraph "g:" 
 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

g. 
 
If DI=4, 5 or 6 then the SD field has no meaning and shall not impact other transaction cycle protocols.  These DI codes remain reserved until future assignment of the SD field.   
 
 
(**1.33**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.21.1.4, as noted in Working Paper SC209-WP12-08R1, to account for DI=3, changes were 
made in Figure 2-25.  Additional changes were made with Working Paper SC209-WP14-05R3 for the BDS Swap issue. 

 
(**1.34**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.22.f there is a requirement that is based in ICAO Annex 
10, Volume 4 §4.3.11.1.f, except that in order to be consistent with §4.3.11.1.f and EUROCAE ED-73C, §3.27.f, the text of the requirement must be edited as follows:   
 
f. RF performance compatibility with own aircraft's TCAS.  Specifically, when the Mode 
S transponder transmitter is in the inactive state, the RF power at 1090 +/- 3
 MHz at the 
terminals of the Mode S transponder antenna **shall not** exceed -70 dBm.    
 
 
(**1.35**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.22.1.2.1.1, in order to adjust the requirements to 
account for Comm-B extraction using DI=3, as suggested in Working Paper SC209-WP11-
09R1, make the following changes in the third paragraph:   
 
Upon receipt of a DF=4, 5, 20, or 21 reply, with DR=2, 3, 6 or 7, a Mode S sensor may request downlink of the RA Report by setting RR=19 and DI≠3 or 7, or RR=19, DI=3 or
 7 
and RRS=0 in a surveillance or Comm-A interrogation (UF=4, 5, 20, or 21) to the TCAS aircraft.  When this request is received by own Mode S transponder, own transponder shall reply with a Comm B reply, DF=20, 21, whose MB field contains an RA Report with information previously provided to the transponder by the TCAS equipment. 
 
 
(**1.36**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.23.1.2, in order to adjust the requirements to account for 
Comm-B extraction using DI=3, as suggested in Working Paper SC209-WP11-09R1, in the 
Notes of bullets "a" and "b" make the following changes:   
 
a. Airborne Position Squitter.
  The airborne position Extended Squitter **shall** use format 
DF=17 with the contents of ground-initiated Comm-B Register 0516 inserted in the ME 
field.  
 
Note: A GICB request (see §2.2.19.1.12.3) containing RR equals 16, DI equals 3 or 
7 
and RRS equals 5 will cause the resulting reply to contain the airborne position report in its MB field. b. Surface Position Squitter.
  The surface position Extended Squitter **shall** use format 
DF=17 with the contents of ground-initiated Comm-B Register 0616 inserted in the ME 
field.  
 
Note: A GICB request (see §2.2.19.1.12.3) containing RR equals 16, DI equals 3 or 
7 
and RRS equals 6 will cause the resulting reply to contain the surface position report in its MB field. 
(**1.37**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.23.1.2, in order to retain consistency with the 
terminology used in the ADS-B MOPS and ICAO SARPs, in existing bullet "c" change 
references to the aircraft identification squitter as follows.  In order to adjust the requirements to account for Comm-B extraction using DI=3 or 7, as suggested in Working 
Paper SC209-WP11-09R1, in the Note of bullets "c" and "b" make the following change.   
 
c. 
 
Aircraft Identification and Category Squitter.  The aircraft identification and category
 
Extended Squitter **shall** use format DF=17 with the contents of ground-initiated 
Comm-B Register 0816 inserted in the ME field.   
 

Note:  
        A GICB request (see §2.2.19.1.12.3) containing RR equals 16, DI equals 3 or 
        7 and RRS equals 8 will cause the resulting reply to contain the aircraft 
        identification and category

 report in its MB field.   

 
 
(**1.38**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.23.1.2, in order to adjust the requirements to account for 
Comm-B extraction using DI=3, as suggested in Working Paper SC209-WP11-09R1, in the 
Note of bullet "d" make the following change:    
 
d. Airborne Velocity Squitter.
  The airborne velocity Extended Squitter **shall** use format 
DF=17 with the contents of GICB Register 0916 inserted in the ME field. 
 
Note: A GICB request (see §2.2.19.1.12.3) containing RR=16, DI=3 or 
7 and RRS 
equals 9 will cause the resulting reply to contain the airborne velocity report in its MB field.   

 
 
(**1.39**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.23.1.2, as identified in Working Paper SC209-WP11-
19, insert new bullets "e" and "f" to define the Target State and Status, and the Aircraft 
Operational Status Messages as Periodic Status Messages and not included any further as "Event-Driven" Messages.  Re-label the old bullet "e" for the Event-driven squitter, to 
become bullet "g."  In order to adjust the requirements to account for Comm-B extraction 
using DI=3 or 7, as suggested in Working Paper SC209-WP11-09R1, in the *Notes* of bullets 
"e," "f" and "g" make the following change.    
 
e. 
Target State and Status.  The airborne Target State and Status Extended Squitter 
shall use format DF=17 with the contents of GICB Register 6216 inserted in the ME 
field.    
 
Note: A GICB request (see §2.2.19.1.12.3) containing RR=22 (e.g., BDS1=6), DI=3 or 7 and RRS=2 (e.g., BDS2=2) will cause the resulting reply to contain the airborne Target State and Status report in its MB field.   

 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

f. 
Aircraft Operational Status.  The airborne or surface Aircraft Operational Status 
Extended Squitter **shall** use format DF=17 with the contents of GICB Register 6516 
inserted in the ME field.    
 
Note: A GICB request (see §2.2.19.1.12.3) containing RR=22 (e.g., BDS1=6), 
DI=3 or 7 and RRS=5 (e.g., BDS2=5) will cause the resulting reply to contain the Aircraft Operational Status report in its MB field. 
  
 
g. 
Event-driven Squitter.
  The event-driven Extended Squitter **shall** use format DF=17 
with the contents of GICB Register 0A16 inserted in the ME field.   
 
Note: A GICB request (see §2.2.19.1.12.3) containing RR=16, DI=3 or 7 and 
RRS=0A will cause the resulting reply to contain the event-driven report in 
its MB field.  
Since multiple Register contents can be multiplexed through 
Register 6116 and 0A16, GICB extractions of these Registers is not 
recommended as the reply could be indeterminate. 
 
 
(**1.40**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.23.1.3, in order to harmonize this section with the 
requirements specified in RTCA DO-181D, §2.2.23.1.3, replace existing bullet "a" with the 
following: 
 
a. Initialization.  At power up initialization, the transponder **shall** commence operation in a 
mode in which it broadcasts only acquisition squitters (see §2.2.18.2.6).  The 
transponder **shall** initiate the broadcast of Extended Squitters for airborne position, 
surface position, airborne velocity, target state and status, aircraft operational status and 
aircraft identification and category when data are inserted into GICB Registers 0516, 0616, 0916, 6216, 6516
 and 0816 respectively.  This determination **shall** be made 
individually for each squitter type.  The insertion of altitude data into Register 0516 by 
the transponder (see §2.2.23.1.8) **shall not** satisfy the minimum requirement for 
broadcast of the airborne position squitter.   
 
Note 1:
 
This suppresses the transmission of Extended Squitters from aircraft that are unable to report position, velocity or identity information.   
 
If input to the register 0516 and 0616
 for a squitter type stops for 60 seconds, broadcast of that Extended Squitter type will be discontinued until data insertion is resumed.  The insertion of altitude by the transponder shall satisfy the minimum requirement for continuing to broadcast the airborne position squitter.  After timeout (see §2.2.23.1.4.2), this squitter type may contain an ME field of ALL ZEROs.  

 
Note 2:
 
Continued transmission for 60 seconds is required so that receiving aircraft will know that the data source for the message has been lost. 
 
When Extended Squitters are broadcast, transmission rates shall be as indicated in the following paragraphs.  Acquisition squitters shall be reported in addition to Extended Squitters as specified in §2.2.18.2.6.c.  Acquisition squitters shall always be reported if no Extended Squitters are reported. 

 
(**1.41**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.23.1.3, as identified in Working Paper SC209-WP11-
19, in order to establish transmission rates for the Periodic Status Messages, insert new bullets "f" and "g" to define the Target State and Status, and the Aircraft Operational Status 
squitters, which are not included any further as "Event-Driven" squitters.  Re-label the old 
bullets "f" and "g" to become bullets "h" (Event-Driven Squitter Rate) and "i" (Delayed 
Transmission)  In existing bullets "b," "c," "d," and "e" at the end of each subparagraph, and 
in the existing paragraph for "Event-Driven Squitter Rate," change the reference for 
subparagraph "g" to subparagraph "i."    
 
f. Airborne Target State and Status Squitter Rate.  Airborne Target State and Status 
squitter **shall** be transmitted at rates as specified in §2.2.3.3.1.4.1 of RTCA DO-260B / 
EUROCAE ED-102A.   
 
Verification of the transmission rates of Airborne Target State and Status Messages **shall** 
be performed in accordance with §2.4.3.3.1.4.1 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED- 102A.   
 
g. 
Aircraft Operational Status Squitter Rate.  The Aircraft Operational Status squitter **shall** 
be transmitted at the rates as specified in §2.2.3.3.1.4.2 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A, with the exceptions as specified in subparagraph "i."  When transmitting the surface formats, the rate depends on whether the high or low squitter rate has been selected (see §2.2.23.1.6).   
 
Verification of the transmission rates of Aircraft Operational Status Messages **shall** be 
performed in accordance with §2.4.3.3.1.4.2 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED- 102A. 
(**1.42**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.23.1.4.2, as partially modified in Working Paper 
SC209-WP11-19, it was proposed therein to replace the entire section with the edited text in the Working Paper.  During Meeting #14 as discussed in the final review and comment resolution, and documented in the comment matrix in Working Paper SC209-WP14-06R1, 
and Working Paper SC209-WP14-08, it was agreed that the entire section would be replaced 
with the following:  
 
2.2.23.1.4.2 
Register Timeout 
and Termination 
 
2.2.23.1.4.2.1 Timeout of Extended Squitter Messages 
a. Timeout of Extended Squitter Messages shall be performed in accordance 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

with §2.2.3.3.2.11 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A.   
b. Verification of Extended Squitter Message timeout functions shall be 
performed in accordance with §2.4.3.3.2.11 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A.   

## 2.2.23.1.4.2.2 Termination Of Extended Squitter Messages

a. Termination of Extended Squitter Messages shall be performed in 
accordance with §2.2.3.3.2.12 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED- 102A.   
b. Verification of Extended Squitter Message termination functions shall be 
performed in accordance with §2.4.3.3.2.12 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A. 
(**1.43**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.23.1.5.1, replace the paragraph with the following: 
 
The criteria for selection of airborne or surface formats are contained in the latest version of §2.2.3.2.1.2 of RTCA/DO-260AB / EUROCAE ED-102A
,     

 
 
(**1.44**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.23.1.5.2, in order to clarify the use of the TCS 
command to control Extended Squitter broadcasts, as identified in Working Paper SC209-
WP11-12R1, make the following edits to the entire section as follows:   
 
formats **shall** revert to the means described above.   
Aircraft without such automatic means **shall** report the airborne type message formats. Aircraft with or without such automatic on-the-ground determination **shall** use position message types report the surface type formats as commanded by control codes in the TCS subfield (see §2.2.23.1.7).  After timeout of the TCS commands, control of airborne/ surface type 

Note 1: Extended squitter ground stations determine aircraft airborne or on-the-ground 
state by monitoring aircraft position, altitude and ground speed.  Aircraft determined to be on-the-ground that are not reporting the surface position 
message type formats may be commanded to report the surface type formats via the 
TCS subfield.  The normal return to the airborne position messages type formats is 
via a ground command to report the airborne type message formats.  To guard 
against loss of communications after takeoff, commands to report the surface position message type formats
 automatically timeout. 
 When commanded to report the surface type format by TCS commands, aircraft without automatic means of determining the on-the-ground condition, and aircraft with such means that are reporting airborne state, shall transmit acquisition squitters as specified in §2.2.18.2.6.a. 

 
Note 2: Transmission of the acquisition squitter will provide for TCAS acquisition in the 
event that an airborne aircraft is commanded to report the surface type formats
.  
In this case, the CA field of the acquisition and Extended Squitters will continue to show that the aircraft is airborne, or is unable to determine its on-the-ground 
state.   
 
 
(**1.45**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.23.1.7, as specified in Working Paper SC209-WP11-
12R1, in order to provide ground control to inhibit ATCRBS and Mode S All-Call replies 
primarily for aircraft without a squat switch, replace the entire section 2.2.23.1.7 as follows: 
 
2.2.23.1.7 
Subfields in SD for Extended Squitter 
 
The SD field contains the following information if the DI code is 2: 
 
 
2.2.23.1.7.1 
Type Control Subfield (TCS) in SD for Extended Squitter 
TCS, the 3-bit (bits 21 - 23) Type Control Subfield in SD **shall** control the position extended squitter airborne and surface format types reported by the transponder, and its response to ATCRBS, ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call and Mode S-Only All-Call interrogations
.  These commands **shall** only affect the format types reported, they **shall not** change the aircraft determination of its on-the-ground condition.  The commands for codes 1 and 2 **shall** be able to refreshed for a new period before timeout of the prior period.   

 
Note 1:
 Thus aircraft without the means to set the on-the-ground condition 
will continue to report code 6 in the CA field, and an aircraft with the means to set the on-the-ground condition that has determined 
that it is in the airborne state will continue to set code 5, independent of the Extended Squitter format that is emitted.  
 
The following TCS codes have been assigned: 

 

| TCS Codes                                         | Description    |

## 2.2.23.1.7.1.1 Tcs Equal To One (1)

(a) 
Broadcast extended squitter surface formats, including the Surface Position Message, the ID and Category Message, the Aircraft 
Operational Status Message and the Aircraft Status Message for the next 15 seconds at the appropriate rates (see Table 2-79 in RTCA DO- 260B / EUROCAE ED-102A). 
(b) 
Inhibiting replies to ATCRBS, ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call and Mode S- only All-Call interrogations for the next 15 seconds. 
(c) 
Broadcast acquisition squitters as per §2.2.18.2.6.c and Table 2-2.   
(d) 
Make no change to the air/ground state reported via the CA, FS and VS fields. 
(e) 
Discontinue broadcast of airborne message formats. 
(f) 
Broadcast the surface formats at the rates according to the TRS subfield unless commanded to transmit at the rates set by the RCS subfield. 

## 2.2.23.1.7.1.2 Tcs Equal To Two (2)

(a) 
Broadcast extended squitter surface formats, including the Surface Position Message, the ID and Category Message, the Aircraft Operational Status Message and the Aircraft Status Message for the next 60 seconds at the appropriate rates (see Table 2-79 in RTCA DO- 260B / EUROCAE ED-102A).   
(b) 
Inhibiting replies to ATCRBS, ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call and Mode S- only All-Call interrogations for the next 60 seconds. 
(c) 
Broadcast acquisition squitters as per §2.2.18.2.6.c and Table 2-2.

(e) 
Discontinue broadcast of airborne message formats. 
(f) 
Broadcast the surface formats at the rates according to the TRS subfield unless commanded to transmit at the rates set by the RCS subfield.   

## 2.2.23.1.7.2 Rate Control Subfield (Rcs) In Sd For Extended Squitter

RCS, the 3-bit (bits 24 - 26) Rate Control Subfield in SD **shall** control the squitter rate of the transponder when it is reporting the Extended Squitter surface type formats.  This subfield **shall** have no effect on the transponder squitter rate when it is reporting the airborne position type formats of Extended Squitter.    

 
Note 2:
 Aircraft without the means of determining on-the-ground state or aircraft with such means that are declaring the airborne state must be commanded to transmit the surface format (via TCS) before they can be controlled by this subfield.  Both of these commands may be sent in the same interrogation. 

 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Note 3: Both TCS and RCS have specific timeout periods.  If the surface 
format command times out first, the aircraft will resume broadcasting the airborne format (unless it is now declaring the onthe-ground state or the surface format is selected in accordance 
with the requirements of §2.2.3.2.1.2 (3) of RTCA DO-260B 
/EUROCAE ED-102A) even if the squitter suppression command 
has not timed out (since the squitter suppression command has no effect on the transmission of the airborne format).  If the squitter suppression command times out first, the aircraft will resume the 
transmission of surface squitters formats
.   
 
The following RCS codes have been assigned:   

 

| RCS Codes    | Description                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 0            | No surface Extended squitter rate command                |
| 1            | Report high surface Extended squitter rate for 60        |
| seconds      |                                                          |
| 2            | Report low surface Extended squitter rate for 60 seconds |
| 3            | Suppress all surface Extended squitters for 60 seconds   |
| 4            | Suppress all surface Extended squitters for 120 seconds  |
| 5 - 7        | Not assigned                                             |

 
Note 4: The definition of high and low squitter rate is given in §2.2.23.1.3 
and applies to the Surface Position, Aircraft Identification and Category, and the Operational Status Messages.
   
 
Note 5:
 As stated in §2.2.18.2.6.b.4, Acquisition squitters are transmitted 
when Surface Extended Squitters are suppressed by using RCS=3 or 4.   
 

## 2.2.23.1.7.3 Surface Antenna Subfield (Sas) In Sd For Extended Squitter

 
SAS, the two bit (bits 27 - 28) Surface Antenna Subfield in SD **shall** control the selection of the diversity antenna that is used for: (1) the Extended Squitter when it is reporting the surface type formats, and (2) the acquisition squitter when the aircraft is reporting the on-the-ground condition.  This subfield **shall** have no effect on the transponder diversity antenna selection when the aircraft is reporting the airborne status type, or if the aircraft does not have diversity antennas.  When reporting the surface type formats, the default **shall** be the top antenna.  The following SAS codes have been assigned:   
 

|   SAS Codes  | Description                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|           0  | No antenna command                                |
|           1  | Alternate top and bottom antennas for 120 seconds |
|           2  | Use bottom antenna for 120 seconds                |
|           3  | Return to the default                             |

 
(**1.46**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.23.1.8 there is an incorrect paragraph reference that 
must be corrected just below the SSS table.  Correct the reference in the first sentence as: 
 
"ACS, the 12-bit (bits 41 - 52) Altitude Code Subfield in ME **shall** (under control of the ATS subfield, §2.2.23.1.9) 

 
(**1.47**) In RTCA DO-181D. in section §2.2.23.2, since the Target State and Status and the Aircraft 
Operational Status Messages have been moved out from under the Event-Drive protocol, 
replace this section with the following: 
 
 defined for the Event-Driven Squitter:    
The Event-Driven Squitter is broadcast each time data is loaded into GICB Register 0A16 as 
specified in §2.2.23.1.3.  The transponder also makes available GICB Registers related to the Extended Squitter Event-Driven Squitter.  The transponder shall provide data to the 
appropriate GICB Registers that are loaded into the Event-Driven GICB Register 0A16.  The 
following GICB Registers are is currently 
Extended Squitter Emergency/Priority Status) 
BDS Code 6,1 Aircraft Status (
BDS Code 6,2 Target State and Status 
.   
BDS Code 6,5 Extended Squitter Aircraft Operational Status Note: Additional information on the data content and transmission of these Extended Squitter Messages can be found in the latest version of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE 
ED-102A

 
(**1.48**) In RTCA DO-181D. in section §2.2.23.4 in order to comply with the changes in 
transmission rates made in DO-260B/ED-102A for Event-Driven Messages, and the 
additional changes requested in Working Paper SC209-WP12-16R1, replace the paragraph 
and the *Note* below with the following: 
 
The maximum total number of Extended Squitters (DF=17, 18 or 19) emitted by any Extended Squitter installation **shall not** exceed 6.2 per second averaged over any 60 second interval, except during an emergency condition
.    

 
Note: For installations capable of emitting DF=19 squitters, transmission rates for lower power DF=19 squitters are limited to a peak of 45 DF=19 squitters per second, and 35 DF=19 squitters per second averaged over 10 seconds, provided that the maximum total squitter power-rate product for the sum of full power DF=17 
squitters,  full power DF=19 squitters, and lower power DF=19 squitters, is maintained at or below a level equivalent to the power sum of 6.2 full power squitters per second averaged over 10 seconds.  This low-power, higher squitter rate capability is intended for limited use by State aircraft in coordination with appropriate regulatory bodies.  
For installations capable of emitting extended squitters other than DF=17, see ICAO Annex 10, Vol IV, §3.1.2.8.9. 

 
(**1.49**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.24.c, the requirement required transponders to support 
TCAS/ACAS with Elementary Surveillance (ELS).  During consideration of Final Review 
and Comment resolution in Meeting #14, it was agreed that the beginning of the paragraph would be changed as follows: 
 
c. 
In addition, Optionally
, the Mode S transponder must be capable of TCAS operation 
in accordance with all requirements defined in §2.2.22.  In particular, the transponder 
reports ACAS capability and version in Register 1016 as well as the RA Report in 
Register 3016. 
(**1.50**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.24.2.1, in order to adjust the requirements to account for 
Comm-B extraction using DI=3, as suggested in Working Paper SC209-WP11-09R1, add 
sub-bullet "m" to the list of references mentioning the use of BDS2 with SI Code.

(**1.51**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.2.24.3.2.2, in order to account for the changes that are 
being made in the ADS-B MOPS (RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A) and subsequent 
equivalent changes in ICAO Doc 9871, Edition 2, the Mode S Subnetwork Version Number will have to change accordingly.  Replace Table 2-4, and the sentence below it with the 
following:

To be consistent with Elementary and Enhance Surveillance requirements (e.g., this version of these MOPS), the Mode S Subnetwork Version Number shall be set to "35" or "higher". 

 
(**1.52**) In RTCA DO-181D, there are numerous occasions where the phrase "Minimum Update 
Interval" has been incorrectly used, and where the phrase "Maximum Update Interval" should have been used instead.  In the requirements description at some of these locations, reference has also been made to the Register Allocation Table in Appendix B, which is incorrectly referenced as Table B-1, and should have been referenced as Table B-2-1.  In 
each of the following paragraph references, **all instances of** "Minimum Update Interval" must be changed to "Maximum Update Interval," and **where references occur** to "Table 
B-1," **they must be changed to** "Table B-2-1."

Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-31.  Interrogate at the standard rate 
and at an input level 10 dB above MTL.  Use an ATCRBS Mode A interrogation followed by a 1.6-microsecond P4 pulse in its nominal position.  Vary the level of 
the P4 pulse between -10 and 0 dB in 1 dB steps with respect to P3.  Verify the changeover from ATCRBS to Mode S replies at the relative P4 levels specified in 
§2.2.6.1.1.a and §2.2.6.1.1.b 
when more than 90% of the replies are Mode S or 
ATCRBS
. 
(**1.65**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.4.2.5, as originally discussed in Working Paper SC209-
WP11-10R1, and as further detailed in Working Paper SC209-WP12-17R1, following a review of EUROCAE ED-73C by EADS, and discussion and agreement by RTCA SC-209 and EUROCAE WG-49, make the following addition to the end of the first paragraph in Step 1:   
 
Step 1 
Pulse Level Tolerances, ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call (§2.2.6.1.1) Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-31.  Interrogate at the standard rate and at an input level 10 dB above MTL.  Use an ATCRBS Mode A interrogation followed by a 1.6-microsecond P4 pulse in its nominal position.  Vary the level of the P4 pulse between -10 and 0 dB in 1 dB steps with respect to P3.  Verify the 
changeover from ATCRBS to Mode S replies at the relative P4 levels specified in 
§2.2.6.1.1.a and §2.2.6.1.1.b when more than 90% of the replies are Mode S or ATCRBS
.   

 
 
(**1.66**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.4.2.6, in order to correct references to "All-Calls" and to 
harmonize between DO-181D and EUROCAE ED-73C, for Step 4 of this test procedure, make the following changes in the title and the third paragraph:   
 
Step 4 
Recovery from a Suppression Pair or ATCRBS-Only All-Calls or Unaccepted ATCRBS/Mode S or ATCRBS-Only All-Calls (§2.2.7.2.2 and §2.2.7.2.4 ) 
 
1st paragraph unchanged 
2nd paragraph unchanged 
 
Lock out transponder to All-Calls (non-selective) and repeat procedure with 
P4-type ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations in place of the suppression pair.  
Set the II field of the Mode S-Only
 All-Call to a value other than ZERO (0) so that 
it will not be affected by the lock-out condition.    
 
 
(**1.67**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.4.2.6, as originally discussed in Working Paper SC209-
WP11-10R1, and as further detailed in Working Paper SC209-WP12-17R1, following a review of EUROCAE ED-73C by EADS, and discussion and agreement by RTCA SC-209 and EUROCAE WG-49 during Meeting #12, make the following changes to the last two (2) 
paragraphs in each of the sub-steps of the test procedures Step 7A through Step 7H: 
 
Turn off the Slave Test Set.  Do not reset the transponder.   
 
Set the Master Test Set to generate a standard (i.e., -60 dBm) UF4, UF5, Mode A and Mode C interrogations and verify that the ATCRBS Mode A code and Altitude/ Mode C information provided in the transponder replies is correct. 
Repeat the entire procedure given in preceding paragraphs this Step
 as needed to verify 
performance of the transponder on both top and bottom channels of diversity transponder. 
(**1.68**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.4.2.6, as originally discussed in Working Paper SC209-
WP11-10R1, and as further detailed in Working Paper SC209-WP12-17R1, following a review of EUROCAE ED-73C by EADS, and discussion and agreement by RTCA SC-209 and EUROCAE WG-49 during Meeting #12, make the following changes to the second (and 
last) subparagraph in Step 7I: 
 
Verify that the delay time is less than or equal to 15 microseconds after the P4 pulse. 
Repeat the procedure with the Master Test Set using Mode A/C/S All-Call interrogations while locking-out the transponder to these All Call interrogations in place of suppression pair. 
Repeat the procedure in the preceding paragraph 
with the Master Test Set using Mode A/C-
only All-Call interrogations in place of suppression pair.    
 
 
(**1.69**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.4.2.7, as indicated in Working Paper SC209-WP11-10R1, 
following a review of EUROCAE ED-73C by EADS, and discussion and agreement by RTCA SC-209 and EUROCAE WG-49, make the following changes to the *Note* immediately following the text of the Step 6 subparagraph: 
 
Note: The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that when the interference pulse combines 
with the P1 pulse of the P1-P2 pair of a Mode S interrogation, that the transponder 
detects the ATCRBS All-Call and does not reply with a ATCRBS reply
. 
(**1.70**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.1, in order to clarify that different types of modulators 
could be used to generate the phase reversal and that a diode detector can only be used for 
test purposes as described in Working Paper SC209-WP12-15R2, make the following 
changes to the "Equipment Required" section: 
 
Test set capable of generating Mode S interrogations at a 0-dBm power level. Equipment Required: DPSK modulation detector (a simple diode detector is adequate for manual determination of the location of phase reversals in a 0-dBm signal).  Use a simple diode detector for manual determination of the location of phase reversals when the Mode S signal test generator is using hard keying with amplitude drop. 

Note: Such a method is only possible for test purposes as some transmitters can generate 
the phase reversal using IQ modulator with little or no amplitude drop.   
 
Wide-band oscilloscope (HP1710B, or equivalent).   
 

## ………………………. Verification Of Test Set Error Protection Circuits

When the Mode S signal generator uses a hard keying method to generate phase reversal resulting in amplitude drop, the following method can be used to verify the Test Set Error Protection circuit.   

 
(**1.71**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.6.2.1, during Meeting #14 as discussed in the final 
review and comment resolution, and documented in the comment matrix in Working Paper 
SC209-WP14-06R1, and Working Paper SC209-WP14-08, it was agreed that the entire 
section would be replaced as follows:

Verify Extended Squitter Message Rate and Timeout functions by demonstrating 
successful completion of all test procedures called out in §2.4.3.3.2.11 of RTCA DO- 260B / EUROCAE ED-102A, as required by §2.2.23.1.4.2.1.     
 
Note: §2.4.3.3.2.11 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A indicates that ADS-B 
Message Timeout performance is tested in §2.4.3.3.2.2 through §2.4.3.3.2.8.2. These same test procedure sections verify the Message Rate in RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A.   

 b. Verify Extended Squitter Message Rate and Termination functions by demonstrating 
successful completion of all test procedures called out in §2.4.3.3.2.12 of RTCA DO- 260B / EUROCAE ED-102A, as required by §2.2.23.1.4.2.2.    
 
Note: §2.4.3.3.2.12 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A indicates that ADS-B

                                                  §2.4.3.3.2.2 
                                                               through 

§2.4.3.3.2.8.2.  These same test procedure sections verify the Message Rate in 
RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A.   

 c. While performing the test procedures specified in subparagraphs "a" and "b" above, 
verify the content of the CA, AA and PI fields in the Extended Squitter Messages. d.
 For diversity transponders, setup the transponder to transmit airborne format Extended 
Squitters.  Verify that each Extended Squitter type identified in §2.2.23.1.2 occur alternately from both channels.  For transponders that are designed for aircraft installations with automatic means of determining on-the-ground condition, set the transponder to on-the-ground status and verify that Extended Squitters occur on the top antenna only at the prescribed rates.

a. Verify that after 2 seconds, all subsequent the Extended Squitter ME fields for 
(GICB Registers 05716, and 0916) are ZERO with the exception of the ACS and surveillance status fields in the airborne position squitter (GICB Register 0516) and the airborne identification squitter (GICB Register 0816).   
b. Verify that after 2 seconds the aircraft identification and category squitter 
(GICB Register 0816) continues to be transmitted. c. Verify that after 2 seconds only the Selected Altitude, Selected Heading or 
Barometric Pressure Setting subfields of the target state and status squitter 
(GICB Register 6216) are set to ZERO.  Verify that the remaining Extended 
Squitter ME subfields are not cleared, as they contain other integrity, mode or 
status information. d. Verify that after 2 seconds the Extended Squitter ME fields of the aircraft 
operational status squitter (GICB Register 6516) are not cleared, as they contain 
various integrity, mode or status information. e. Verify that after 2.6 seconds the Extended Squitter ME fields of the airborne 
velocity squitter (GICB Register 0916) are cleared, and verify that it is not being 
transmitted.
   
 
f. Place the transponder in the ground state and verify that the surface position Extended Squitter ME field (GICB Register 0616) is ZERO.  Repeat the setup as in Step 3 with Extended Squitter updates to the transponder at a one half second rate.  Place the transponder in the airborne state.  Interrogate the transponder with RR=17 and DI=7 and verify that the SCS subfield of the data link capability report is one.  After all updates (except altitude information) have ceased for 10 seconds, interrogate to extract the data link capability report and verify that the SCS subfield is ZERO.  Interrogate the transponder with ground initiated Comm-B requests with RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 7, 8 and 
9 respectively.  Verify that the MB fields are ZERO with the exception of the ACS field in the airborne position squitter (GICB Register 0516) and the airborne identification squitter (GICB Register 0816).  After all updates (except altitude information) have ceased for 60 seconds, verify that airborne identification and category and airborne velocity Extended Squitters are no longer still being transmitted.  Place the transponder in the ground state and verify that the surface position Extended Squitter (GICB Register 0616) is no longer transmitted.  Return the transponder to the airborne state.  Verify that the acquisition squitter and airborne position squitter are broadcast.  Set the ALT switch to the "off" position.  Verify that the ME field of the airborne position squitter is ZERO.  After 60 seconds, verify that the transponder no longer broadcasts airborne position squitters.

Set the ALT switch to the "on" position and provide altitude code input to the 
transponder.  Provide Extended Squitter updates to the transponder at a rate maximum update interval as specified in Appendix B, Table B-2-1.  Include 
updates to GICB Registers 0516, 0616, 0716, 0816 and 0916.  Verify that the ME 
fields of the airborne position, velocity and aircraft identification squitters match the data input.  Stop updates of Extended Squitter data to the transponder for GICB 
Registers 0816 and 0916 only.  After 15 seconds, verify that the ME field of the 
aircraft identification squitter continues to match the data input prior to stopping 
updates to GICB Register 0816.  After 2.6 seconds, verify that the ME field of the 
airborne velocity squitter is ZERO no longer transmitted.  Interrogate with RR=16, 
DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 8 and 9 and verify that the MB fields match the ME fields in 
the corresponding Extended Squitter reply.  Specifically, verify that the MB and 
ME fields for Register 0816 continue to match the data input prior to stopping the 
updates to GICB Register 0816.  After 10 seconds, interrogate to extract the data 
link capability report and verify that SCS is one.  After 60 seconds, verify that 
airborne position and aircraft identification squitters reports are still transmitted 
and that aircraft identification and airborne velocity squitters are not transmitted. Specifically, verify that the ME field of the aircraft identification squitter continues 
to match the data input prior to stopping the updates to GICB Register 0816. 
(**1.80**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.6.2.2, in Step 7, in order to consolidate several 
changes as identified in Working Paper SC209-WP12-05R1, and to be clear about the 
timeout requirements for Register 0816, make the following changes:    
 
Step 7 
Configure the transponder to inhibit Acquisition squitters when Extended Squitters are broadcast.  Prior to providing Extended Squitter updates, verify that Acquisition squitters are broadcast.  Provide Extended Squitter updates at a rate maximum update interval as specified in Appendix B, Table B-2-1 to GICB 
Registers 0516, 0616 and 0816 and provide altitude code input to the transponder.  
Verify that Extended Squitters are broadcast and Acquisition squitters are not broadcast.  Verify that airborne position and aircraft identification squitters are broadcast at the proper rate and alternately on the top and bottom antenna ports as 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
specified for airborne state if antenna diversity is supported.  Additionally provide updates to GICB Register 0916.  Verify the broadcast of airborne position squitters, aircraft identification squitters and airborne velocity squitters at the proper rate and the ME data content matches the data stored in GICB Registers 0516, 0816 and 0916, respectively.  Verify that the transponder does not broadcast Acquisition squitters.   
 the transponder resumes Acquisition squitter broadcast.   
Set the ALT switch to the "off" position and stop update to GICB Registers 0516, 
0616, 0816 and 0916.  After 2 seconds, verify that the ME fields of the airborne position and airborne velocity squitters are ZERO.  After 2.6 seconds, verify that the airborne velocity squitter is no longer transmitted.  Interrogate with UF=4, RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 8 and 9, respectively.  Verify that the MB fields of the replies match the data of the corresponding Extended Squitter reply.  
Specifically, verify that the MB fields of the replies for Register 0816 continue to match the data that was provided prior to stopping the updates to GICB Register 
0816.   After 60 seconds, verify that Extended Squitter airborne position and airborne velocity squitter transmissions stop.  Verify that the aircraft identification Extended Squitter transmissions are continued and that the contents of the ME field matches the data that was provided prior to stopping the updates to GICB Register 
0816.  and Verify that Repeat above sequence except stop update to GICB Registers 0516 and 0616 only.  
After 2 seconds, verify that the ME field of the airborne position report is ZERO. After 60 seconds, verify that the transponder no longer broadcasts airborne position squitters and continues to broadcast airborne velocity and aircraft identification squitters.  Verify that the transponder continues to inhibit the broadcast of Acquisition squitters.    
Repeat above except stop update to GICB Register 0916 only.  After 2.6 seconds, Again, verify that after 2 seconds the ME field of the airborne velocity squitter is ZERO no longer transmitted, and after 60 seconds, both airborne velocity and verify that the Acquisition squitters are not transmitted. 

(**1.81**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.6.2.2, in Step 8, make the following changes: 
 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Step 8 
Provide data to the transponder to trigger data to be loaded into GICB Register 
0A16.  Verify that an Event-Driven Extended Squitter is generated with the proper 
data content.  Repeat for all supported Event-Driven Extended Squitter Message types.  Event-Driven Extended Squitter Messages include BDS 6,1, BDS 6,2 and BDS 6,5: the Extended Squitter Aircraft Status, the Target State and Status, and the Aircraft Operational Status Messages, respectively.  Verify that the data contained 
in the GICB Register corresponding to the Event-Driven Extended Squitter 
Message type matches the data contained in the transmitted Extended Squitter.  
Update GICB Register 0A16 at a rate less than twice every second.  Verify that an 
Event-Driven Extended Squitter is generated subsequent to each update with the proper data content.  Vary the data content provided externally to the transponder and verify that the data content subsequent to update of the Event-Driven report is correct.  Increase the update rate to exceed twice per second.  Verify that the 
Event-Driven Extended Squitter rate does not exceed twice per second, and that the data content reflects the most recent update contents.   

 
For the following steps, for those transponders that support automatic detection of on-the-ground status, change the transponder to on-the-ground status.  Configure the transponder to not inhibit Acquisition squitters when Extended Squitters are broadcast. 

 
(**1.82**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.6.2.2, in Step 9, make the following changes: 
 
. 
Step 9 
Upon power-up initialization of the transponder, verify that the transponder 
broadcasts Acquisition squitters at the proper rate but does not broadcast Extended 
Squitters.  For transponders that support automatic detection of on-the-ground 
status and diversity, verify that Acquisition squitters occur on the top antenna port only.  Interrogate the transponder with GICB requests with RR=16, DI=7 and RRS=5, 6, 8 and 9 respectively.  Verify that the MB field of the corresponding 
replies are ZERO, with the exception of Register 0816 
(**1.83**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.6.2.2, in Step 10, in order to consolidate several 
changes as identified in Working Paper SC209-WP12-05R1, and to be clear about the 
timeout requirements for Register 0816, make the following changes: 
 
Step 10 Provide Extended Squitter updates to the transponder at a rate maximum update 
interval as specified in Appendix B, Table B-2-1.  Include updates to GICB 
Registers 0516, 0616, 0816 , and 0916 , 6216 and 6516
.  Use other than ZERO or all 
ONEs for the surface position report and the aircraft identification report.  Set TRS to ZERO.  For transponders that support automatic on-the-ground detection, 
perform the following: 
 
1. Verify that the transponder broadcasts surface position squitters at the high rate 
and the ME data content matches the data stored in GICB Register 0616. 
2. Verify that the transponder broadcasts aircraft identification squitters and that 
they occur uniformly over the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds as specified in §2.2.23.1.3.d.  Verify that the ME data content matches the data stored in 
GICB Register 0816.   
3. Verify that the transponder broadcasts aircraft operational status squitters at the 
rates as specified in §2.2.3.3.1.4.2 of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A 
and that the data content matches the data stored in GICB Register 6516.  When 
transmitting the surface formats, the rate depends on whether the high or low squitter rate has been selected (see §2.2.23.1.6).   
4. Verify that the transponder does not broadcast the airborne position and the 
airborne velocity squitter. 
5. Verify that the transponder does not broadcast Acquisition squitters. 
6. Stop update of GICB Registers 0516, 0616, 0816, and 0916 and 6516.  After 2 
seconds, verify that the surface position squitter ME field is ZERO.  After 15 
seconds, verify that the ME field of the aircraft identification squitter continues 
to match the data input prior to stopping updates to GICB Register 0816.   
7. After 60 seconds, verify that surface position and surface aircraft operational 
 resume.     
status identification squitters stop.  Verify that the aircraft identification extended squitter transmissions are continued and that the contents of the ME field matches the data that was provided prior to stopping the updates to GICB 
Register 0816.  and Verify that Acquisition squitter transmissions
 
For transponders that do not support automatic on-the-ground detection, verify that airborne position squitters, airborne velocity squitters and aircraft identification squitters are transmitted at the proper rate and data content.  Verify that surface position squitters are not emitted.  Verify that the transponder broadcasts Acquisition squitters at the proper rate.   
 
Repeat except vary the data content of GICB Registers 0616 and 0816 and verify the data content of each Extended Squitter subsequent to each register update.   

 
(**1.84**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.6.3, the test procedure for squitter control verification 
has been modified in order to account for the changes that were agreed to by RTCA SC-209 
and EUROCAE WG-49 for the TCS and RCS commands.  In Working Paper SC209-WP11-
12R1 there were extensive changes made to have the TCS and RCS commands apply to all 
surface type messages and also to inhibit replies to ATCRBS and All-Call interrogations.  
Working Paper SC209-WP12-06R3 completely revises the test procedure in §2.5.4.6.3 to account for the previously agreed changes to TCS and RCS.  These test procedures in §2.5.4.6.3 were revised again during the final comment resolution of Meeting #14 when it was agreed to revise the RCS command and remove the ability to suppress Extended 
Squitters as recorded in ICAO ASP TSG Working Paper TSGWP10-21R1. 
(**1.85**) In RTCA /DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.7, as  agreed to in Working Paper SC209-WP11-
20R1, add the following new test procedures at the end of the current test procedure, and just prior to §2.5.4.8: 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## Alert When Leaving Standby Condition A. Set To The Airborne State And Change The Input Of The Id Function To A Value Other Than

7500, 7600 or 7700. 
b. Wait 19 seconds. c. Set the transponder to STANDBY condition. d. Set the transponder to return to normal condition. e. Verify that the Mode A Code, temporary alert is set (FS field value is 2 and SSS=2 when 
the transponder is ES capable) for 18 ±1 seconds after leaving the STANDBY condition. f. Repeat Steps "a" through "e", except in Step "c" set the transponder to OFF. 

## Change The Input Of The Id Function To 7500 A. Set To The Airborne State And Set The Transponder To Standby Condition And Provide The

transponder with the 7500 code. 
b. Set the transponder to return to normal condition. 
c. Verify that the permanent alert is set (FS field value is 2 and SSS=1 when the 
transponder is ES capable). 
d. Repeat the test with 7600 and 7700. e. Repeats Steps "a" through "d", except in Step "a" set the transponder to OFF. 
(**1.86**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.13, in order to correct references to "All-Calls" and to 
harmonize between DO-181D and EUROCAE ED-73C, make the following change to the 
paragraph below the Principle of Test Procedure:
 line: 
 
-only A large number of Mode S Principle of Test Procedure: 
 All-Call interrogations (UF=11) are made for each of the PR codes.  For each PR code, a specified fraction of the interrogations will result in a reply. One hundred interrogations would provide a valid sample for active PR codes while a lesser number would be adequate for other codes.    

 
 
(**1.87**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.13.a, in order to address the possible failure of the test 
identified in the table for a transponder not locked out to All-Calls, and discussed in 
Working Paper SC209-WP12-07R1, add the following *Note* just after the table: 
 
Note: This test is based on a small sample, and is likely that in some cases of testing, statistical variation may cause a correctly implemented transponder to fail this test. In this case, it is equally likely that if the test is rerun one or more times, it may then be successful.   

 
(**1.88**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.13.b, in order to clarify which specific Timers are 
being referenced, replace the text of the first paragraph with the following: 
 
The transponder can be in 79 different specific lockout states as determined by the running 
of the one TD and the 78 TL
 timers.  The following test sequence must be repeated for each 
of the lockout states: 
(**1.89**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.5.4.18, as a result of changes to the Comm-B Protocol 
flowchart identified in Working Paper SC209-WP11-09R1, there were necessary changes to 
Procedure #18 for the Comm-B Protocol, that were identified in Working Paper SC209-
WP12-08R1.  Therefore, incorporate all of the identified changes in Working Paper SC209- WP12-08R1. 
(**1.90**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.6.2, in order to adjust the requirements to account for 
Comm-B extraction using DI=3, as suggested in Working Paper SC209-WP11-09R1, add 
the following *Note* after sub-bullet "b:" 
 
Note: Extraction of a Register or a Comm-B broadcast using an SI code is performed in 
§2.6.6.1.   

 
 
(**1.91**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.6.3.2.2, in order to account for the changes that were 
made in the ADS-B MOPS (RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A) and subsequent corresponding changes being proposed in ICAO Doc 9871, Edition 2, the definition of the Mode S Subnetwork Version Number in RTCA DO-181E and EUROCAE ED-73E will 
have to change accordingly.  Replace the reference to Subnetwork Version Number in the 
text of the paragraph as follows:   
 
Continue to interrogate the transponder as required in §2.6.3.2.1.  Verify that the transponder replies with a DF=20 reply with bits 49 - 55 ("Mode S Subnetwork Version Number" subfield [bits 17 - 23 of the "MB" field]) encoded with a value of "35" or more.   

 
(**1.92**) In RTCA DO-181D, in several sections in §2.6.6 there are references to ICAO Annex 10, 
Volume III, Part 1, Amendment 71.  With this Change document, these references to specific Amendments will be removed, so as not to require updates in the future.  Remove references to ICAO Annex 10 Amendments in the following locations: 
 
§2.6.6.1.a.(1)  Note 2 inside the Table §2.6.6.1.a.(2)  Note 1 inside the Table §2.6.6.5.a.(1)  Note 2 inside the Table §2.6.6.5.a.(2)  Note 1 inside the Table §2.6.6.6.a.(1)  Note 2 inside the Table §2.6.6.6.a.(2)  Note 1 inside the Table 
(**1.93**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.6.6.1.c, in order to adjust the requirements to account for 
Comm-B extraction using DI=3, as suggested in Working Paper SC209-WP11-09R1, add 
the following at the end of sub-bullet "c" and just prior to the text of sub-bullet "d:"

Via an appropriate input interface, set the rate at which valid Inertial Vertical Rate data is provided to less than once per two 
in 2.6
 seconds. 
 
 
(**1.103**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.7.7.15, add the following *Note* to clarify the use of GPS 
data sources: 
 
Note: GPS Data Sources may not provide data more often than once every 1.2 seconds.  
If GPS Data Sources are used to provide data, ensure that the data is provided at the minimum rate of once every 1.2 seconds.  For Register 6016, this may apply to the Inertial Vertical Rate data. 

 
 
(**1.104**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §2.8.4, in bullets "a" and "b," in order to correct a problem 
with Table references in Appendix B, make the following changes identified below in 
yellow: 
 
a. Verify that the servicing of Register XX16 during the power-on cycle of the 
transponder is properly reported in Registers 1816 through 1C16 as required in 
Appendix B, Table B-3-24 to Table B-3-28. 
b. Verify that the real-time (not just since power-on) servicing of Register XX16 is 
properly reported in Register 1716 (see Appendix B, Table B-3-23) if such reporting is 
required for Register XX16. 
(**1.105**) In RTCA DO-181D, in section §3.3.3, there is a discrepancy with the same paragraph 
§6.4.4.1 in ED-73C.  In order to harmonize DO-181E with ED-73E, make the following 
changes: 
 
Interrogate the installed transponder and verify that the reply frequency of the system is 1090 ±3 1 MHz for aircraft operating below 15,000 feet, or 1090, ±1 MHz for aircraft operating above 15,000 feet.    

 
(**1.106**) In RTCA DO-181D, in Appendix A, section §A.1, add the following acronyms: 
 
QFE - Aviation "Q" Code for "Field Elevation" QNE - Aviation "Q" Code for "Nautical Height" for Enroute 
QNH - Aviation "Q" Code for "Nautical Height" 
(**1.107**) In RTCA DO-181D, in Appendix A, section §A.2, edit and add the following definitions: 
 
Event-Driven - Messages that are broadcast periodically for a duration of the operational condition.  Examples of Event-Driven Messages include the Extended Squitter Aircraft Status Message with the Emergency/Priority Status and TCAS RA Broadcast subtypes, 
Operational Status and Target State and Status Messages (ref. RTCA/DO-260A 
B/EUROCAE ED-102A
).    
 
Periodic Status - Status Messages that are broadcast independently in the same manner as the Airborne Position, Surface Position, Airborne Velocity and Aircraft Identification Messages.  Examples of Periodic Status Messages include the Target State and Status and the Aircraft Operational Status (ref. RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A). QFE  -  Local station barometric pressure setting which provides an altimeter reading of indicated altitude of the airplane above the station, whether airborne or on the ground. QNE  -  The barometric pressure used for the standard altimeter setting (29.92 inches Hg, 1013.25 hectopascals). QNH  -  Local station barometric pressure setting which provides an altimeter reading of indicated altitude of the airplane above mean sea level, whether airborne or on the ground. 
(**1.108**) In RTCA DO-181D, in Appendix B, there are several references to ICAO Doc 9871, 
Edition 1.  There are specific paragraph references to guidance materials in Doc 9871, Edition 1, Appendix C, which will change to Appendix D in Doc 9871, Edition 2.  In the titles of the following subparagraphs in Appendix B, make the specified changes to the 
paragraph reference which will exist in ICAO Doc 9871, Edition 2: 
 
In the title of §B.4.1 **change** §C.2.4.1 to Edition 2, §D.2.4.1  
In the title of §B.4.2 **change** §C.2.4.2 to Edition 2, §D.2.4.2 In the title of §B.4.3 **change** §C.2.4.3 to Edition 2, §D.2.4.3 In the title of §B.4.4 **change** §C.2.4.4 to Edition 2, §D.2.4.4 In the title of §B.4.5 **change** §C.2.4.5 to Edition 2, §D.2.4.5 In the title of §B.4.6 **change** §C.2.4.6 to Edition 2, §D.2.4.6 
 
 
(**1.109**) In RTCA DO-181D, in Appendix B, section §B.2.1 inside Table B-2-1, revise the entry 
for Register 6216 by removing reference to "Reserved for" and setting the Maximum 
Update Interval to 0.5 seconds:

(**1.110**) In RTCA DO-181D, in Appendix B, section §B.2.1, in order to resolve the coordination of 
documents with regard to the issue of timeout issues related to Registers 0816 and 2016 
initially raised by Kevin Wilson of Honeywell and discussed in Working Papers SC209-
WP10-04 and SC209-WP11-04 by Bob Saffell of Rockwell Collins, add the following 
Note #2 after the existing *Note* at the bottom of Table B-2-1:   
 
Note 2: If Extended Squitter is implemented, then Register 0816 is not cleared or ZEROed 
once either Flight Identification or Aircraft Registration data has been loaded 
into the Register during the current power-on cycle.  Register 0816 is not cleared 
since it provides information that is fundamental to track file management in the ADS-B environment.  (See §2.2.5.1.11.c of RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-
102A).  Refer to §B.4.3.3 for implementation guidelines regarding Register 0816 
and 2016.   
 
 
(**1.111**) In RTCA DO-181D, in Appendix B, section §B.3 just prior to Table B-3-7 there is an unnumbered table containing references to "ADS-B Registers."  Because of the changes in 
RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A defining the ADS-B Periodic Status Messages 
and removing them from being broadcast by the Event-Driven protocol, edit the text, the 
un-numbered table and the *Note* just prior to Table B-3-7 as follows:

(**1.122**) In RTCA DO-181D, in Appendix B, after section §B.4.3.2 and just prior to section §B.4.4, 
add a new section to explain implementation considerations for Registers 0816 and 2016.   
 

## B.4.3.3 Register 2016 And 0816 Implementation Considerations

Detailed implementation requirements for Register 2016 are provided in 
§2.2.24.6.  §B.2.1, Table B-2-1, Note 2 provides an introduction to Register 
0816 implementation.  Implementation of Register 0816 should also consider the following:   

 a. If valid Flight Identification data is available, then the data should be used 
to populate the character subfields in Register 0816. 
 
b. After using Flight Identification data to populate the character subfields 
in Register 0816 in a given power-on cycle, if Flight Identification data 
becomes invalid or not available, then the last known valid Flight Identification data should be retained and used to continue population of 
the character subfields in Register 0816 for the duration of the power-on 
cycle. c. If valid Flight Identification data is not available, but valid Aircraft 
Registration data is available in a given power-on cycle, then the valid Aircraft Registration data should be used to populate the character 
subfields in Register 0816 for the duration of the power-on cycle. 
 
d. If Register 0816 has been populated using Aircraft Registration data in a 
given power-on cycle, and valid Flight Identification data becomes available, then the Flight Identification data should be used to populate 
the character subfields in Register 0816 for the remainder of the power-on 
cycle. e. Once valid Flight Identification data has been used to populate Register 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

0816 in a given power-on cycle, Aircraft Registration data should not be 
used to populate the character subfields of Register 0816, even if Flight 
Identification data becomes invalid or not available during the power-on cycle. 
(**1.123**) In RTCA DO-181D, in Appendix B, at the end of section §B.4.4.3, as agreed in Working 
Paper SC209-WP12-04, add a new guidance material section §B.4.4.4 to indicate that 
Reserved bits in Register 4016 should be set to ZERO (0).   
 
B.4.4.4 
Setting of the Reserved Bits (Bits 40 to 47, 52 & 53) 
 

Bits 40 to 47, 52 and 53 of Register 4016 "MB" field should be set to ZERO 
(0).
