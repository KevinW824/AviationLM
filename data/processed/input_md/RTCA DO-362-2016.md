## Foreword

 This document was prepared by Special Committee 228 (SC-228) and reviewed by the RTCA Program Management Committee (PMC) on September 22, 2016 RTCA, Incorporated is a not-for-profit corporation formed to advance the art and science of aviation and aviation electronic systems for the benefit of the public.  The organization functions as a Federal Advisory Committee and develops consensus-based recommendations on contemporary aviation issues. RTCA's objectives include, but are not limited to: 
 
Coalescing aviation system user and provider technical requirements in a manner that helps government and industry meet their mutual objectives and responsibilities; 

 
 
Analyzing and recommending solutions to the system technical issues that aviation faces as it continues to pursue increased safety, system capacity and efficiency; 
 
 
Developing consensus on the application of pertinent technology to fulfill user and provider requirements, including development of Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for electronic systems and equipment that support aviation; and 
 
 
Assisting in developing the appropriate technical material upon which positions for the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and other appropriate international organizations can be based. 
 The recommendations of RTCA are often used as the basis for government and private sector decisions as well as the foundation for many Federal Aviation Administration Technical Standard Orders (TSO). Since RTCA is not an official agency of the United States Government, its recommendations may not be regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the United States Government organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations relate.

## Executive Summary

The RTCA has been developing the minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) needed to support Unmanned Aircraft (UA) flights within the National Airspace System (NAS) and beyond the operational limits placed on small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  In 2013, the RTCA initiated SC-
228 with a narrower scope; namely to develop MOPS needed for (a) a UAS detect and avoid (DAA) system [focus of Working Group (WG) 1] and (b) a UAS Terrestrial Control and Non-Payload Communications (CNPC) Link System (focus of WG 2). CNPC Link Systems are unique to UAS.  The International Telecommunications Union has identified multiple spectrum bands, including L Band and C Band Terrestrial, as candidates for use for these CNPC Data Links.  DO-362 prescribes the MOPS for the UAS CNPC Terrestrial Link System intended to provide data link capabilities supporting the control and communication function of the UAS.  This function provides CNPC link capabilities supporting the UAS information exchanges that allow the pilot to safely control, monitor, and manage the Unmanned Aircraft (UA).  The CNPC Link System also may perform data link services for one or more of the following: Air Traffic Services voice and data relay, detect and avoid, weather radar, and/or video. DO-362 MOPS specifies CNPC Terrestrial Link System characteristics that should be used by designers, manufacturers, installers and users of the system.  This MOPS document supports a wide range of UAS Command and Control architectures, from the simplest point-to-point radio line of sight application to more complex multi-aircraft and networked solutions, however if interoperability between different manufacturers' systems is desired within the more complex architectures, then additional technical standards will need to be developed.

## 1 Purpose And Scope 1.1 Introduction

This document contains Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Control and Non-Payload Communication (CNPC) terrestrial Link System used to support the Command and Control (C2) functions of a UAS.  The word "Control" refers to the information exchanges needed to support the pilot in safely maneuvering the unmanned aircraft (UA) on the ground and in the air.  This would include commands to the UA such as: executing turns, changes in engine operation, changes in radio frequencies, etc., and information from the UA such as: confirmation of receipt of and actions taken in response to commands, as well as detect and avoid information, navigation data, weather radar data, onboard situational awareness data, etc. The words "Non-Payload Communications" includes the potential of the CNPC Link System to support pilot-to/from-ATC voice and data communications.  However, nonpayload communications specifically exclude communications associated with the UA mission payloads which should not contain safety-of-flight information1.  Therefore, nonpayload communications do not require use of aviation safety protected spectrum2, and are thus out of scope for using the CNPC Link System and this MOPS. The main focus of this MOPS is the technical standards describing how CNPC Link Systems can compatibly share the spectrum that has been allocated for their use yet remain waveform agnostic (i.e., unspecified).  Through the flexibility afforded in this MOPS, manufacturers may select either the waveform standards in the Baseline Section of this MOPS (see Section 2.2.2) or their own waveform based on the Manufacturer-Specific section of this MOPS (see Section 2.2.3).  Each UA's CNPC Link System will need access to different amounts of spectrum depending on where it flies, the risk it brings, and the environment in which it is operating, therefore the needed spectrum bandwidth will vary over time and location. This MOPS addresses this key challenge while still efficiently and effectively using the spectrum that has been allocated to UAS operations. This MOPS supports a wide range of UAS Control and Communications architectures, from the simplest point-to-point radio line of sight (RLOS) application to more complex multiaircraft and networked solutions.  However, if interoperability between different manufacturer's systems is desired within the more complex architectures, then additional technical standards will need to be developed. 

These standards specify equipment characteristics that should be used by designers, manufacturers, installers and users of a "terrestrial" (i.e., not satellite based) CNPC Link, hereafter in this document referred to as the CNPC Link System.  Compliance with these standards is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under the conditions specified herein.  Any regulatory application of this document is the sole responsibility of appropriate governmental agencies. The word "equipment," as used in this document, includes all components necessary for the CNPC Link System to properly perform its intended functions.  This MOPS considers a CNPC Link System to consist of the following: 

1. CNPC Link Airborne Radio System (ARS) consisting of 
                                                     
 

a. CNPC Link System Airborne Radio(s) 
b. One or more CNPC Link System airborne antennas c. Associated cables connecting the radio(s) and antennas 
2. CNPC Link Ground Radio System (GRS) - to include fixed, or mobile, i.e., truck 
or boat mounted - consisting of 
a. CNPC Link System Ground Radio(s) b. One or more CNPC Link System ground-based antennas c. Associated cables connecting the radio(s) and antennas 
This MOPS applies to a minimum set of specifically defined functions.  The equipment in a CNPC Link System may provide additional functions beyond those addressed in this MOPS. This CNPC Link System MOPS document is divided into the following sections: Section 1 provides information needed to understand the rationale for the equipment characteristics and requirements in Sections 2 through 4. It describes typical equipment operations and operational goals as envisioned by the members of RTCA Special Committee (SC)-228, and establishes the basis for the standards stated herein.  It also describes how the verification and validation (V&V) of the standards were achieved.  Key definitions and assumptions essential to proper understanding of this document are also provided in this section. Section 2 contains the minimum standards for the CNPC Link System characteristics. These standards specify the required performance under standard environmental conditions.  Also included are recommended bench test procedures necessary to demonstrate compliance with the stated minimum requirements. Section 3 describes the installed performance required of the CNPC Link System.  Flight tests for the CNPC Link System are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. Section 4 describes the operational performance characteristics for CNPC Link System installations and defines conditions that will assure the CNPC Link System user that operations can be conducted safely and reliably in the expected operational environment. Appendix A, Acronyms and Definition of Terms: This appendix includes a list of the acronyms and terms used in this document with definitions as appropriate. Appendix B, Bibliography and References: This appendix lists citation information for documents referenced in this MOPS or that provide other relevant information. Appendix C, L Band and C Band Relationship: This appendix includes three studies associated with the relationship between CNPC Link System usage of the 960–1164 MHz band ("L Band") and its usage of the 5030–5091 MHz band ("C Band"). Those studies deal with (1) evaluating the potential for sharing waveform structure between L Band and C Band solutions to reduce certification [cost/complexity], (2) evaluating the potential/value of simultaneous operation of L Band and C Band to improve system performance, and (3) evaluating the potential/value of physical integration of L Band and C Band into a common radio for size, weight, and power (SWAP) advantages. Appendix D, Security Considerations: This appendix provides an example of how to implement security mechanisms for two reference architectures (1) Direct Access and (2) Networked Access that will meet the security requirements identified in the main body (normative section) of this MOPS. 

Appendix E, Video Considerations in Civil Airspace for Unmanned Aircraft Operations: 
This appendix describes the process used to determine the minimum video data rate required per aircraft to support the transmission to the UAS pilot of the minimum visual cues necessary for safe operation.  This assessment does not imply that every UA will need video if it can be shown that the desired operations can be carried out safely without it. However, if the designer chooses to use video, then the information contained in this Appendix can be used to assist in the design and certification of a CNPC Link employing video. Appendix F, UAS CNPC Link System Operational Capabilities and Implementation Considerations: This appendix (1) describes the system engineering process used to develop these standards and (2) provides some guidance to enable implementation and operation of the CNPC Link System with a single ground-based radio or with multiple ground-based radios. The information is not intended to be a description of the CNPC Link Concept of Operations (CONOPS) or Operational Services and Environment Definition (OSED) but rather offers some material for consideration by potential users of this MOPS. Appendix G, CNPC L Band Interference Environment: This appendix focuses on the 960- 1164 MHz portion of L Band and defines both the radio frequency (RF) environment of the offboard incumbent systems as well as the cosite (onboard) equipment. Appendix H, Frequency Reuse Planning: In this appendix a review is given of the types of spectrum management that will be required for successful operation of the CNPC Link System. Such management will be comprised of both a static component (frequency reuse planning) and a dynamic component (actual assignment of frequencies to specific UA as needs arise). This appendix deals primarily with the static component; Appendix I addresses the dynamic component. Appendix I, Dynamic Spectrum Resource Assignment: This appendix reviews the challenge of developing an assignment scheme to keep the particular frequencies in use by one UAS CNPC Link System clear from interference by transmitters from CNPC Link Systems of other UAS. Since there is only a small amount of RF Spectrum available for CNPC Link Systems compared with the expected number of UA, a dynamic assignment scheme is discussed. As with the assignment and allocation of any scarce, valuable, public resource and because of its safety-critical nature, the proposed assignment scheme needs to be both well-defined and controlled. Appendix J, Data Rates: This appendix reviews how the data rate values used in Section 2.2.2 were developed. Those values address such key issues as: (1) the uplink and downlink telecommand and telemetry information, (2) Navaids data, i.e., the commands to control navigation receivers and the downlink data from the navigation receivers to be used by the pilot, (3) Air Traffic Control (ATC) Voice Relay, i.e., both voice and digital (e.g., Video Data Link (VDL) Mode 2) formats, (4) Air Traffic Services (ATS) Data Relay, i.e., various data services expected to be in place by the 2020s, and (5) Detect and Avoid (DAA) data. Appendix K, UAS CNPC Link System Required Link Performance: This appendix (1) describes the L Band and C Band link performance transaction expiration time, availability, continuity, and integrity parameters and characteristics for the minimum level of automation for the Detect and Avoid (DAA) and command and control functions, (2) describes the performance parameters and characteristics for ATS voice and data relay, weather radar, and video services, and (3) (a) recommends various mitigations to improve the performance parameters and characteristics, and (b) establishes the relationships between performance parameters and the levels of automation of the UAS operation. 

Appendix L, Example CNPC Link Budgets: This appendix provides example link budgets for both L and C frequency bands. Appendix M, MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System: This appendix contains the characteristics of the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System; these include the waveform, transmitter, and receiver characteristics necessary for interoperability among CNPC Link Systems designed to meet the MOPS Baseline requirements. This appendix mostly focuses on single UA operation using a point-to-point communication concept (a single radio on the "ground" and in the aircraft) but multiple UA operation, (a "ground" radio transmitting to multiple UA) are also discussed. 

Appendix N, Bench Test Data for the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System: This appendix includes the bench test data measured using the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System equipment. Appendix O, Flight Test Data for the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System: This appendix includes the flight test data measured using the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System equipment. Appendix P, Determining Minimum Standoff Distances for Prevention of CNPC-to-
TACAN Interference: Appendix P describes procedures for ascertaining the minimum standoff distances that must be maintained between a CNPC Link Airborne or Ground Radio transmitter and a TACAN receiver to prevent interference, as a function of the effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of the CNPC Link Airborne or Ground Radio transmitter. 

Appendix Q, Summary of NASA Air-Ground Channel Measurements and Models: This appendix provides a summary of NASA air-ground channel measurements and models. Appendix R, CNPC Link Undesired-to-Desired Signal Ratios: This appendix describes (1) Undesired-to-Desired (U/D) Signal Ratio dependencies, (2) Undesired (near)-to-Desired (far) signal ratios (U/D) calculations based on assumed link parameters, (3) Relationship between U/D and Emissions Noise floor and Adjacent Channel Rejection, and (4) Spectrum re-use frequency separation criteria vs Ground Radio System separation distance. Appendix S: Validation of the CNPC Link System's Operational Capability with Flight Test Data:  This appendix discusses how the flight test data from Appendix O was used to validate that the normative requirements, associated with the operating range and data rate capabilities of the CNPC Link System and contained in Section 2.0 of this MOPS, meet certain capabilities of the CNPC Link System.  Those capabilities are to support UAS operation at the ranges and altitudes envisaged by SC-228 as being of interest to UAS designers and operators while still supporting the subframe error rates that are anticipated to be adequate to allow for safe and efficient UAS operation.  

## 1.1.1 Structure And Use Of This Mops

The structure of this MOPS is different from other MOPS for several reasons as indicated in the following: 

1. The CNPC Link System addressed in the MOPS includes two radios (a ground radio 
and an airborne radio), their antennas, the cabling between the antennas and the radios, and the propagation path between them, not just individual avionics equipment as addressed by most MOPS. 
2. The CNPC Link System addressed in the MOPS includes a description and the data 
for a "MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System used for MOPS validation or as a baseline for alternative "Manufacturer-Specific" designs. 
3. Section 2.2 of this MOPS includes three types of requirements, not all of which will 
apply to every TSO applicant:  
a. Requirements that are common and apply to all systems (Section 2.2.1), b. Requirements for systems designed against the parameter values used for the 
MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System (Section 2.2.2), and  
c. Requirements for systems designed against parameter values for Manufacturer-
Specific CNPC Link Systems (Section 2.2.3) 
This MOPS approach was adopted because: 

1.  The UAS market and approaches to design and operation of CNPC Link Systems are 
still maturing, 
2. The range of UA levels of automatic operation and the range of UAS operational 
environments require different levels of CNPC Link System performance so one design would not optimally satisfy all applications, and 
3. There is no Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) document to 
which key assumptions in this MOPS could be referenced and justify their viability. 
For these reasons the MOPS first includes a set of common requirements (Section 2.2.1) that all CNPC Link Systems must comply with to ensure compatible operation in their shared frequency spectrum.  The MOPS then includes a set of requirements for a MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System (Section 2.2.2) that can either be used directly by a manufacturer for their CNPC Link System design or as a baseline for alternative manufacturer-specific designs.  Finally, the MOPS includes Section 2.2.3 that provides manufacturers with ranges of acceptable performance comparable to that of the MOPS Baseline System section. This standard was developed as a continuation of the work done by RTCA Special Committee 203 in support of the U.S. position at World Radio Conference 2012. Operational and system constraint assumptions from that work were continued into the current effort.  Starting in late 2015 there have been new concerns raised that the assumed level of permitted L Band output power may cause operationally unacceptable interference with some existing aircraft systems (specifically the Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN)). Due diligence to evaluate these concerns was initiated and there are further studies and tests being conducted as of this writing.  Manufacturers and users are strongly cautioned that solutions implemented in the L Band against the requirements of this standard may not ultimately be found to be operationally acceptable, and therefore not approved for operation.  At present, any potential manufacturer or user should maintain close coordination with frequency and aircraft certification regulatory bodies prior to committing to an implementation path in the L Band.  Future revisions of this standard, or perhaps a new standard, may be forthcoming when the additional due diligence efforts are complete to provide further guidance. The following table describes how the different elements of this MOPS are envisioned to be used both by manufacturers of CNPC Link Systems as applicants for a TSO, and by complete UAS manufacturers (Type Certification (TC)) as they integrate TSO compliant CNPC Link Systems into their UAS designs.

## 1.1.2 Scope Of This Mops

The RTCA has supported the FAA for several years in developing the MOPS needed to support UA flights within the National Airspace System (NAS) and beyond the operational limits3 placed on small UAS.  In 2006-2012 the RTCA Special Committee (SC)-203 sought to develop a MASPS document; although it was not completed, there was sufficient progress to provide much of the needed groundwork for this MOPS.  In 2013 the RTCA initiated SC-228 with a narrower scope; namely to develop MOPS needed for (a) a UAS detect and avoid (DAA) system [focus of Working Group (WG) 1] and (b) a UAS Terrestrial CNPC Link System (focus of WG 2).  This section provides a description of the scope of the UAS Terrestrial (not satellite) CNPC Link System MOPS. Figure 1-1 is from the Terms of Reference (TOR) given to SC-228 and depicts the general operational concept to be addressed in Phase 1 MOPS development and a potential Phase 2 MOPS development.  As shown in that figure, Phase 1 applies to CNPC links connected to ground-based (terrestrial) terminals and represents a general description of the supported operations.  Satellite Communication (SATCOM) links would be considered in the Phase 2 efforts. 



The CNPC Link System components and interfaces for this MOPS are shown in Figure 1-2.  It includes the set of equipment in the list given above: CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radios, corresponding antennas and the cabling between them. 

 
                                                     
 

## Figure 1-2: Cnpc Link System Major Components And External Interfaces

The CNPC Link System, as described by the equipment items and their interconnections shown in Figure 1-2, does not include the many other systems needed for UAS to operate as depicted in Figure 1-1.  Key aspects of those other systems are described in Section 1.4. Simulations and flight tests using the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System have been conducted to confirm the validity of this MOPS.  This MOPS also includes verification methods that can be used to show compliance of proposed CNPC Link System designs based on this MOPS. This MOPS does not include all CNPC Link System design characteristics, for example, support of multiple UA communicating with one CNPC Link Ground Radio System (GRS), or support of one CNPC Link System GRS communicating with CNPC Link System Airborne Radio Systems (ARS) manufactured by different companies.  These capabilities would require some interoperability between the GRS and ARS. The remainder of Section 1 includes the following subsections:

## 1.2 System Overview

As noted in Section 1.1, this CNPC Link System MOPS document addresses only the CNPC Link System, which is part of a larger system that seeks to exchange control information between a UA and its Pilot Station (PS).  There are many systems beyond the scope of this CNPC Link System MOPS that will be needed for successful UAS operations in the NAS.  Figures 1-3 and 1-4 provide a more detailed representation of some of those systems and the interfaces between them (shown in dashed squares and lines) and the key elements within the CNPC Link System (shown in solid lines and squares).  Figure 1-3 shows the basic system while Figure 1-4 shows the basic system integrated with the other related systems. A description is provided with each figure below.  

## 1.2.1 Primary System Focus - Supporting Point-To-Point Ua Operations

Within Figure 1-3, the systems around the CNPC Link System that support point-to-point UA operations include: On the ground side: 

1. A Distribution System to connect the CNPC Link System GRS to the Ground Flight 
and Radio Management System (FRMS), 
2. A FRMS to connect the Distribution System to the correct PS, 3. A link from the PS to and from a Frequency Assignment Manager to get frequency 
assignments needed by the CNPC Link System at various times and locations, and  
4. A link from the PS (either directly and/or relayed through the UA) to ATC so flight 
clearances and related messages can be given and acknowledged. 
On the air side: 

1. The CNPC Link ARS is connected to the aircraft's FRMS and 2. Links to/from the FRMS and the various flight control, avionics, and other appropriate 
systems on the UA. 
(See Appendix F for a more detailed discussion on various use cases where the CNPC Link System could be utilized.) 

## Figure 1-3: Basic Information Transfers And Systems Within And Beyond The Cnpc Link Needed For Safe Uas Operations Within The Nas

The Aircraft FRMS in the UA is a key aircraft system that takes the information from all of the major UA systems (e.g., engine, navigation, DAA, and video) (L1, M1, … Q1) plus status information about the CNPC Link Airborne Radio and decides what and when information (A1) is to be sent to the PS (via the CNPC Link downlink) as well as key operations (B1) of the CNPC Link (e.g., frequency and data rate).  The Aircraft FRMS obtains guidance regarding those decisions from pre-flight instructions and by updates from the pilot (via the CNPC Link uplink) to the CNPC Link System Airborne Radio 
(information transfers A1). On the ground side of the CNPC Link System a Distribution System separates the information being sent from the UA (F1 and G1) and sends the appropriate information and CNPC Link System Ground Radio status data (H1) to the Ground FRMS.  The Ground FRMS then sends that information and data to the PS (I1).  Correspondingly the pilot sends commands to the UA to make needed changes from the PS (I1) to the Ground FRMS and then (H1) to the Distribution System and on to the CNPC Link System Ground Radio (F1 and G1). As noted above, the pilot needs to communicate from the PS through the Ground FRMS to control the UA. The pilot also needs to communicate with a Frequency Assignment Manager (K1) to obtain spectrum usage assignments throughout the flight (those assignments may need to be changed based on what the UA is doing, e.g., during landing and takeoff, and during emergency conditions which may need more spectrum resources than during "normal" in-flight conditions). The pilot also needs to communicate with ATC (J1) directly or optionally relayed via the CNPC Link System through the UA's UHF/VHF radio(s) to ensure the UA follows flight procedures, e.g., IFR flight clearances can be given, acknowledged, and status updates sent.  Communication may also be needed with other airspace users (especially when operating in Class G Airspace); this may be done through other radios on the UA and is outside the scope of this MOPS. Within the CNPC Link System there are four components (shown in solid shapes within Figure 1-3).  The CNPC Link System Airborne Radio takes the information (A1) sent by the Aircraft FRMS and converts it into a RF signal that goes (C1) to the UA's Antenna, which then sends it (downlink) through the air (D1) to the CNPC Link System Ground Antenna.  The Ground Antenna then sends the information (E1) to the CNPC Link System Ground Radio, where it is converted from an RF signal to a form needed by the ground systems and is then sent (F1) to the Distribution System.  Similarly, the UA control information from the pilot is sent from the Ground FRMS to the UA via uplink transfers (F1) to the CNPC Link System Ground Radio, to the Ground Antenna (E1), over the air (D1), to the CNPC Link System Airborne Antenna, from that Antenna (C1) to the CNPC Link System Airborne Radio and then (via A1) to the Aircraft FRMS. 

## 1.2.2 Broader System View

As noted above, Figure 1-3 shows a description of how the CNPC Link could interface with exterior systems to support point-to-point UAS operations.  (See Appendix F for a more detailed discussion on various use cases where the CNPC Link could be utilized in this broader view.)  Figure 1-4 includes two other features the CNPC Link System needs to support (see Section 1.2.4), (1) multiple UA being simultaneously flown from a single GRS, and (2) the ARS being able to change its RF connection from one GRS to another, for example, to facilitate beyond radio line of sight (BRLOS) UA operations. 

 
In the depiction in Figure 1-4, various UA in the area of a GRS would be sending additional RF signals to the CNPC Link System Ground Antenna (D2, D3, …Dx– shown in green and in short dash and dot lines) and in turn that Antenna would be sending/receiving the GRS signals to other UA (UA2, UA3, … UAx via information exchanges E2, E3, … Ex shown in green and in short dash and dot lines).  The GRS then needs to send/receive the appropriate additional information and radio command status data (F2, F3, … Fx; and G2, G3, …Gx) to the Distribution System; and that Distribution System needs to send/receive the right data to the appropriate Ground FRMS (shown in green) and it in turn to/from the correct PS (shown in green). In addition, the UA1 would need to have the feature to disconnect from one GRS and then connect to another GRS as it follows along its flight path.  This is represented within Figure 1-4 by the blue information transfers (also shown in long dash and dot lines) where the CNPC Link Airborne Antenna radiates a signal (D1B) to GRS B and its antenna and radio sub-systems (also shown in blue). Again, it should be noted that this MOPS does not specify the design parameters of a single pilot station (PS) controlling multiple UA as shown in Figure 1-4, nor does it preclude the development of this important capability in the future.  An additional MOPS effort could be needed in the future to develop such standards, if required. 

## 1.3 Cnpc Link Operational Applications

A UAS equipped with a CNPC Link System must be compliant with other requirements not specified directly in this MOPS in order to safely operate within the NAS. These include such requirements as the UA airworthiness is not compromised by the installation of the CNPC Link System, the UAS complies with applicable rules set up to govern the use of the frequency spectrum, and any and all controls needed for operation of the CNPC 
Link System not reduce the reliability of the equipment onboard the aircraft or in the PS. 

## 1.4 Intended Function

The primary intended function of CNPC Link Systems addressed in this MOPS is to provide CNPC Link capabilities supporting UAS information exchanges that allow the pilot to safely control, monitor, and manage the UA (often called the control and communication (C2) function of the UAS).  This primary function includes capabilities and services associated with the CNPC Link System Physical Layer and some services associated with the CNPC Link System Datalink Layer.  Other functions of the CNPC 
Link System that support the primary function are described in the following subsections. 

This MOPS describes the features and characteristics needed by the CNPC Link System to achieve a ground-based point-to-point communication functionality to support UAS operating in the NAS. The CNPC Link System equipment and interfaces will need to provide the following functions, as required by the expected operations of UAS in which they are intended to be installed. 

## 1.4.1 Safe Control Of The Ua

The CNPC Link System will need to allow the pilot to safely control the UA under all expected normal and non-normal operating conditions. 

## 1.4.2 Air Traffic Control Voice And Data Relay

The CNPC Link System will need to allow voice and data information exchanges between the pilot and Air Traffic Control as necessary for safe operations. 

## 1.4.3 Detect And Avoid Data Exchanges

The CNPC Link System will need to provide all data exchanges to allow the pilot and UAS systems to detect and avoid other aircraft, terrain, and obstacles.  This function includes allowing both collision avoidance remain well-clear operations. 

## 1.4.4 Weather Radar Data Exchanges

The CNPC Link System will need to allow the timely delivery of weather radar data from sensors on the UA for the use by the pilot. 

## 1.4.4.1 Video Data Exchanges

The CNPC Link System will need to allow delivery of video data to be effectively used by the pilot for safety critical operations as appropriate. 

## 1.4.5 Cnpc Link Management

The CNPC Link System will need to allow the management of the link and the system including the following activities: system initiation, frequency channel change, lost CNPC Link, handover, termination, and status monitoring and reporting. 

## 1.4.6 Frequency Assignment

The CNPC Link System will need to be able to accept and execute commands to follow the applicable frequency assignment process.  That assignment will be within designated L and C Bands as appropriate. 

Note: Per guidance from the SC-228 TOR, RTCA has sought to identify a portion of the L Band which has the highest possibility of supporting a significant number of smaller sized UA in as large a percentage of the NAS as can be achieved without impacting current users of the spectrum.  During the drafting of this MOPS, the entire 960-1164 MHz band was examined for possible use by smaller sized UA.  
As a result, it was determined that with a maximum L Band transmit power of 32 mW for UA flying at low altitude (less than 3kft AGL) within short range (less than 15NM) of their GRS, the 1040-1080 MHz and 1104-1150 MHz sub-bands had the greatest possibility of being acceptable; an analysis of the use of the 1040-1080 MHz sub-band is given in Appendix H.  This analysis however, is not sufficiently complete to recommend that L Band use is possible in any specific location.  Additional studies (analyses, simulations, and tests) will be required for operation at any geographic location to ensure that the CNPC Link System can adequately protect the currently operational ground and airborne equipment (DME, TACAN, ADS-B, Mode S, TCAS, etc.) from interference. 

The CNPC Link System will need to implement an emission mask to help mitigate interference when multiple CNPC Link equipped UA are flying in the same general area and with other systems already allocated for use of the same frequency bands. 

## 1.4.7 Cnpc Link System Monitoring And Alerting

The CNPC Link System will need to continuously measure uplink and downlink availability performance providing information to allow the pilot to monitor CNPC Link System performance, and information for alerting the pilot to degraded performance (including significant CNPC Link interruption and loss of the CNPC Link). 

1.5 
Operational Goals This MOPS prescribes minimum operational performance standards for CNPC Link Systems using the 960–1164 MHz band (L Band) and the 5030–5091 MHz band (C Band).  Based on analyses conducted by the SC-228, the 1040-1080 MHz and the 1104- 1150 MHz band, which are allocated for both federal and non-federal use, would be subbands where UAS utilization approvals would have the greatest possibility of being accepted given the transmit power and altitude of the UA are limited. (See note in Section 2.2.1.2). A CNPC Link System developed using this MOPS will be able to support individual UA flights within all Airspace Classes when they utilize a terrestrial point-to-point communication scheme as well as some of the key parameters associated with use of the CNPC Link System shown in Figure 1-4, Broader System View. 

## 1.5.1 Point-To-Point Operations

The CNPC Link System standards given in this MOPS will support the key functions needed for a link that could be used in point-to-point operations. This capability is represented by the UA and the PS shown in Figure 1-5. 

 

## 1.5.2 Mops Support For Broader System Operations

The CNPC Link System standards given in this MOPS will support the key functions needed for a link that could be used in expanded operations.  See Figures 1-6 and 1-7.  
 

## 1.6 Assumptions

The design and operational performance requirements and guidelines presented in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this document were developed based on the following assumptions and limitations. 

## 1.6.1 Associated Equipment Assumptions

The UAS is equipped with sensors that can provide appropriate data to the pilot in command (PIC) under normal conditions. There will be a FRMS associated with the CNPC Link System that processes and converts information to be accepted by the CNPC Link System (input) and received from the CNPC Link System (output). 

## 1.6.2 Operational Assumption

The FAA will define and implement new flight plan fields and parameters as needed to accommodate UAS operations that cannot be adequately defined using current flight plan fields and parameters. 

## 1.6.3 Frequency Assignment Assumption

There is a Frequency Assignment Manager organization established to provide to the PIC guidance as to which frequency channels the CNPC Link should utilize.  It is expected those channels may change during the course of the UA flight. 

## 1.6.4 Operational Limits Based On System Design

Although the normative requirements in Section 2.0 provide a robust and efficient solution to delivering the desired operational capabilities, there will need to be certain operational limitations imposed on the use of UAS equipped with CNPC Link Systems to ensure that: 
When Operating in L Band: 

 
UAS equipped with CNPC Link Systems do not cause unacceptable interference into other systems sharing the L Band. 
When Operating in C Band: 

 
UAS equipped with CNPC Link Systems do not cause unacceptable interference into other CNPC Link Systems sharing the C Band. 
Consequently, When Operating in L Band: 

## Grss

 
Must not be operated within a certain standoff distance of any in-band navigation receiver identified in paragraph 2.2.1.8.2, and within a certain standoff distance of any in-band system identified in paragraph 2.2.1.8.3 of this MOPS document. Additional studies will be required for operation at any geographic location to ensure that the CNPC Link System can adequately protect the currently operational in-band ground and airborne equipment in the vicinity from interference. 

## Arss

 
Must not be operated within a certain standoff distance of any in-band navigation receiver identified in paragraph 2.2.1.8.2, and within a certain standoff distance of any in-band system identified in paragraph 2.2.1.8.3 of this MOPS document. Additional studies will be required for operation at any geographic location to ensure that the CNPC Link System can adequately protect the currently operational in-band ground and airborne equipment in the vicinity from interference. 
When Operating in C Band and When at or less than 10NM from any Takeoff and Landing operation: GRSs 

 
Must only be used for Takeoff and Landing operations 
 
Must not be located closer than 500ft to the Takeoff and Landing or Taxiway location. 

## Arss

 
Must use high transmit power mode above 500ft AGL 
 
Must use low transmit power mode below 500ft AGL 
 
Must be flown above 3,000ft AGL if not taking off or landing. 
When more than 10NM from a Takeoff and Landing operation: GRSs 
 
Must only be used for Enroute operations  
ARSs 
 
Must use high transmit power mode above 3000ft AGL 
 
Must use low transmit power mode below 3000ft AGL 
 
Must not be flown below 500ft AGL 
The implication of the above C Band operational limitations is that a UA will require more than one GRS to operate more than 10NM from its takeoff and landing location. 

## 1.7 Test Procedures

The general test procedures specified in this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the performance requirements defined in Section 2.2. Users of this document should not infer performance requirements based on these test procedures. This MOPS document also describes test procedures that were used to test the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System.  These test procedure descriptions are provided to aid the reader to better understand what was accomplished what was accomplished for the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System and as a reference for developing and testing similar systems. The order of tests specified suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design, and design qualification, into operational use.  For example, it is expected that compliance with the requirements of Section 2 have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section 3. 

## 1.7.1 Environmental Tests

Environmental test requirements are specified in Section 2.3. The procedures and their associated limits are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations. Unless otherwise specified, the environmental conditions and test procedures contained in the latest revision of RTCA/DO-160, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment will be used to demonstrate airborne equipment compliance.  

## 1.7.2 Bench Tests

Bench test procedures are specified in Section 2.4. These tests provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Section 2.2. Test data and results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance, for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design.   

## 1.7.3 Installed Equipment Tests

Tests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. The installed equipment test procedures and their associated limits are specified in Section 3.  Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included with the installed equipment tests, their successful completion is a precondition to completion of the installed tests.  In certain instances, however, installed equipment tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from or to other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc. Installed tests are normally performed under two conditions: (1) with the aircraft on the ground, using simulated or operational system inputs, and (2) with the aircraft in flight, using operational system inputs appropriate to the equipment under test. Test data and results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the intended operational environment.  In addition, the procedures may be used as an operational check of equipment performance following corrective maintenance. 

## 1.7.4 Operational Tests

Operational tests are specified in Section 4.  These test procedures and their associated limits are intended to be conducted by operating personnel as one means of ensuring that the equipment is functioning properly and can be reliably used for its intended function(s).  

## 1.8 Validation And Verification

This section summarizes various subsections and appendices which show that (a) the normative requirements have been validated and (b) those requirements can be achieved (i.e., verified) by currently available technology.  

## 1.8.1 Validation

A number of the Appendices in this MOPS are associated with the validation of the normative requirements contained in Section 2.0. As discussed in the earlier parts of this MOPS (see Section 1.1) the main focus of this MOPS are the minimum performance standards describing how CNPC Link Systems can 

 
Compatibly share the spectrum that has been allocated for their use yet 
 
Remain waveform agnostic through the flexibility afforded manufacturers, who can select either: 
 
The waveform standards in the Baseline Section of this MOPS (see Section 2.2.2) or  
 
Their own waveform based on the Manufacturer-Specific Section of this MOPS (see Section 2.2.3) 
This flexibility was necessary because (see Section 1.1.1) 

 
The UAS market and approaches to design and operation of CNPC Link Systems are still maturing; 
 
The range of UA levels of automatic operation and the range of UAS operational environments require different levels of CNPC Link System performance so one design would not optimally satisfy all applications; and 
 
There is no Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) document to which key assumptions in this MOPS could be referenced and justify their viability. 
In order to determine some key CNPC Link System minimum performance parameters, SC-228 identified nine operational capabilities (see Appendix F) that the CNPC Link System should support.  It was SC-228's expectation that these and potentially broader capabilities can be achieved using the normative requirements contained in this MOPS. Validation of the MOPS normative requirements was based on a combination of analysis and test.  Testing was conducted where it was determined that the contributing elements were not adequately understood to allow accurate analyses to be performed. How seven (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9) of the nine system capabilities of the CNPC Link System were validated is summarized below.  The remaining two capabilities (5 and 8) deal with capabilities that were not part of the SC-228 TOR and would need to be addressed by the CNPC Link System developer and/or the UA manufacturer; however, the MOPS contains several normative requirements that are associated with these two capabilities and those were also validated as discussed below. 

1. Supporting exchanges of flight control (aviate) information to/from pilot and UA, 
e.g., actual pilot control or monitoring of the UA's flight control sub-system 
2. Support other key information exchanges with the PIC 
The normative requirements associated with capabilities 1 and 2 were validated through analysis contained in Appendix J. 

3. The CNPC Link System Airborne Antenna(s) need to support effective 
propagation to the GRS during all possible UA maneuver limits. 
The normative requirements associated with this capability were validated through analysis contained in Appendices K, L, O, R and S. 

4. The CNPC Link System supports the information exchanges needed for UA 
flights to meet current FAA rules (currently this includes all IFR requirements) and other requirements that may be established. 
The normative requirements associated with this capability were validated through analysis contained in Appendix J.  It is recognized that additional FAA rules associated with UAS are in development. 

5. The CNPC Link System Airborne Radio, antenna and cabling does not cause cosite interference with other electronic systems on the UA.  Similar restrictions would be for the GRS. 
Although, as noted previously, there are no normative requirements directly associated with these capabilities, normative requirements that relate to these capabilities are continued in this MOPS.  Section 3.0 provides test methods for these capabilities and the normative requirements associated with the conducted limits were validated through analysis contained in Appendix G. 

6. The CNPC Link System does not cause interference with other systems within the 
"radio horizon" of the CNPC Link System antennas. (The use of the L Band spectrum is of primary concern.)   
The normative requirements associated with this capability were validated through analyses that are contained in Appendices G and H and, because of the uncertainty about the actual performance of Non-CNPC Link Systems, through bench testing that is described in Appendix P. 

7. Spectrum utilization needs to be efficient enough to support multiple UA 
operating in the same area at the same time.  
The normative requirements associated with this capability were validated through analyses that are contained in Appendices C, H, I, and J; the results of which compare favorably with the earlier and less mature ITU-R analyses contained in ITU-R Report M.2171 

8. The CNPC Link System needs to meet the reliability requirements set by the 
FAA/ICAO.  This could mean use of duplicative Airborne and Ground CNPC Link Radios and Antennas (using a different frequency channel) to connect between the UA and the pilot.  
Although, as noted previously, there are no normative requirements directly associated with these capabilities, normative requirements associated with the CNPC Link System's key RF parameters related to these capabilities are contained in this MOPS.  Section 3.0 provides test methods for these capabilities and the normative requirements associated with the CNPC Link System.  RF parameters were validated through analysis that is contained in Appendices J, K, L, Q, R, and S and, because of the uncertainty about the actual performance of the propagation path, through flight testing that is described in Appendix O. 

9. The information sent over the CNPC Link System should be encrypted and 
authenticated to provide resistance to potential security threats. 
The normative requirements associated with this capability were validated through analysis that is contained in Appendix D. 

The material within the Appendices cited above comprehensively validates that the normative requirements contained in Section 2.0 of this MOPS meet these seven capabilities.  That material additionally provides discussions on how these requirements can support an even broader range of operational desires than just those that are the focus of this MOPS. 

## 1.8.2 Verification

Section 2.4 of this MOPS contains the verification test methods that can be used to verify that a CNPC Link System achieves the normative requirements contained in Section 2.0. These test methods were used to verify the performance of the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System and were used in some of the validation activities described above.  The results of this testing are contained in Appendix N and show that currently available technology can meet (i.e., verify) those requirements. Those same test methods can be used by any CNPC Link System designer or UAS manufacturer to verify their systems performance against the normative requirements contained in Section 2.0.

In addition, the equipment **shall** comply with the relevant spectrum requirements in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS). 

Note: ICAO RPAS SARPS reference relevant International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU) regulations. 

## 2.1.4 Fire Protection

All materials used for the design of the equipment **shall** be self-extinguishing except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire. 

Note: *One means of showing compliance is contained in AC 23-2A, Flammability Tests.*

mitigate the failure classification appropriate to the contribution of the equipment to the aircraft or ground system level failure in the UAS in which it is to be installed. 
Note 2: The DAL appropriate for a given hazard classification is not the same for all UAS 
and, the contribution of the equipment to an aircraft or ground system level failure may vary depending on the UAS installed equipment. 
 
 
Note: There may be additional classification according to antenna diversity in 
the GRS and/or on the ARS 

## 2.1.10 Physical Layer Security Considerations

The CNPC Link System **shall** be able to detect degraded performance that may be caused by harmful interference on the CNPC Link and enable the FRMS to take remedial actions in the UAS. 

Note: Harmful interference includes deliberate physical attacks such as signal jamming. 
Remedial actions may include reverting to alternate communication paths such as switching from C Band to L Band or switching to satellite communications when alternate paths are available and initiating lost link procedures when alternate paths are not available. 
Given the limited frequency spectrum allocated for initial UAS operations, CNPC Link protection methods such as frequency hopping are not considered at this time. ATC procedural mitigations will be implemented to mitigate physical layer attacks on the CNPC Link System. 

## 2.1.11 Higher Layer Security Considerations

Higher layer security considerations, can either be implemented inside the CNPC Link System or within the remaining UAS System.  The following applies if the CNPC Link System provides information system security controls for "user plane" and "control plane" messages carried over the CNPC Link. Within the context of communication between the UA and the GRS there is a distinction between user plane and control plane traffic. User plane (also called End-to-End or data plane) traffic is user traffic communicated between the UA and the GRS. Control plane traffic is signaling traffic between UA and GRS entities in support of management functions (e.g. network access, radio resource management, handoff, health metrics, etc.). Only user plane traffic would need to be protected in the case where the PS is directly connected to the GRS.  Both control plane and user plane traffic need protection in the case of networked configuration.  Additional information can be found in Appendix D. 

CNPC Link System user plane and control plane security controls **shall** provide: 

a. Mutual peer entity authentication between the Airborne Radio System and the Ground 
Radio System 
b. Access control to authorize the Airborne Radio System access to the Ground Radio 
System 
c. Data origin authentication of user and control plane traffic between the Airborne 
Radio System and the Ground Radio System 
d. Data integrity for user and control plane traffic between the Airborne Radio System 
and the Ground Radio System 
e. Confidentiality when sensitive user and control plane traffic is exchanged between the 
Airborne Radio System and Ground Radio System 
The security controls **shall** additionally be implemented with the following characteristics: 

a. Using cryptographic algorithms with algorithm strength and key length sufficient to 
protect data in transit 
b. Using formally validated cryptographic modules that are actively maintained c. Security events are logged 

## 2.1.12 Cnpc Link System Management

CNPC Link System management (e.g., link initiation, frequency change, lost CNPC link, handover, termination and status monitoring and reporting) **shall** be performed by systems internal or external to the CNPC Link System as initiated by the pilot or other associated systems. If the CNPC Link System and equipment provides internal CNPC Link System management, it **shall** be accomplished by messages sent through the CNPC Link on its assigned frequency as a subset of the other CNPC Link System information exchanges. 

## 2.1.13 Frequency Assignment Process

To minimize the possibility of harmful interference every UAS using CNPC operating in the NAS **shall** use the same frequency assignment process and allow, MOPS initiated, upgrades to their frequency assignment process.  Refer to Appendices H and I for further details. 

## 2.1.14 Cnpc Link System Service Derived Performance Requirements

CNPC Link System performance **shall** be adequate to support the performance requirements of the class of aircraft and PS or GRS in which they are installed or connected and in the environment in which the aircraft, GRS and/or PS operate. 

Compliance with this requirement **shall** be demonstrated by the use of the data captured during the flight tests described in Section 3.3, Test Procedures for Installed Equipment Performance and the expected UAS design installations and operations. The effects of CNPC Link System transaction time, transaction expiration time, availability, continuity, and integrity inherent in having the pilot not collocated with the UA, on UAS command and control function performance during normal, non-normal and emergency conditions **shall** be taken into account.  The UAS command and control function **shall** provide adequate stability and safe control taking into account CNPC Link System performance throughout the UA's expected flight envelope. CNPC Link Systems intended to perform the ATC voice relay function over the CNPC Link or that use a radio that is remote from the UACS to enable the pilot to communicate with ATC **shall** meet FAA NAS level performance requirements specified in NAS-RD-
2012. CNPC Link Systems intended to perform the ATC data relay function over the CNPC Link **shall** be designed to accommodate the appropriate level of Required Communications Technical Performance (RCTP). 

Note: Guidance on appropriate performance parameter values can be found in Appendix K of this MOPS. 

## 2.1.15 Information, Link Monitoring, And Lost Cnpc Link

The CNPC Link System **shall** be designed to allow the transmission of all data that may need to be displayed to enable the pilot to perform the command and control function, and any other functions enabled by the CNPC Link System. 

The CNPC Link System **shall** provide CNPC Link performance information that can be displayed to the pilot for monitoring the status and performance of the uplink and downlink, including a lost CNPC link alert. 

## 2.1.16 Video Derived Requirements

If the CNPC Link System is intended to support downlink-only video transmission as described in Appendix E, then those CNPC Link System video transmissions **shall** comply with all of the requirements of Section 2.2.1 of this MOPS. 

## 2.2 Equipment Performance - Standard Conditions

Except where specifically indicated otherwise, everything in Section 2.2 applies to both L Band and C Band operation.  

## 2.2.1 Common Cnpc Link System Requirements

The requirements in this section apply to all terrestrial CNPC Link System. 

## 2.2.1.1 Command And Status Interface

Every CNPC Link System **shall** support the link/interface functionality described in Section 1. 

Note: Many of the requirements associated with the management of the end-to-end command and status information exchanges between the PIC and the UA will not be allocated to the CNPC Link System, but instead will be allocated to airborne and ground Flight and Radio Management Systems that are not covered in these MOPS.  Consequently, only a small number of requirements need to be placed on the CNPC Link System.  These are specified below. 

## 2.2.1.1.1 Commands

a. Every multiband CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radio **shall** support an 
external command to set its operating band.

h. If antenna selection is performed by a CNPC Link System Radio, then the radio **shall** 
support an external command to set the antenna used for communication. 
i. 
If antenna pointing is performed by a CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground 
Radio, then the radio **shall** support an external command to set the direction in which 
any antenna is pointing. 
j. 
Every CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radio **shall** support an external 
command to report its status. 
k. Every CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radio **shall** be capable of tuning to 
and operating on any of the carrier frequencies at which it is designed to operate, within 100 ms. of receiving a command to tune to that frequency. 

## 2.2.1.1.2 Status Reporting

a. Every CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radio **shall** acknowledge every 
command defined in 2.2.1.1.1 that it receives with a confirmation of the command and associated data, once the command has been successfully executed. 
b. Every CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radio **shall** report the status of its 
transmission and reception frequency control function(s). 
c. Every CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radio **shall** report the status of its

data blocks received with detected errors and the total number of received user data blocks since tuning to the current frequency, or an estimate of signal-to-interferenceplus-noise ratio (SINR), in each received time-division duplex (TDD) subframe. 
Note: The above status reporting will allow not only closed-loop control of the CNPC 
Link System Airborne and Ground Radios, but also in-service monitoring of CNPC link and radio status by the UA pilot. 

## 2.2.1.1.3 Cnpc Link Management

Every CNPC Link System **shall** support CNPC Link System management that is accomplished by messages sent through the CNPC link on its assigned frequency as part of the CNPC Link System information exchanges described in Section 1. 

## 2.2.1.2 Frequency Bands

The following frequency bands, each of which has been allocated by the ITU to the aeronautical mobile (route) service (AM(R)S) among other services, are being considered for use in whole or in part by CNPC Link Systems: 

a. 960–1164 MHz (hereinafter called "L Band"). 
b. 5030–5091 MHz (hereinafter called "C Band"). 
Appendix C ("L Band and C Band Relationships") addresses system-engineering issues associated with the relationship between terrestrial CNPC Link System usages of the two bands. Appendix H ("Frequency Reuse Planning") discusses issues associated with long-term strategic management of L Band and C Band frequency assets. 

Appendix I ("Dynamic Spectrum Resource Management") discusses a framework for dynamic, near-real-time assignment of those assets. 

## 2.2.1.2.1 L Band Tuning Ranges

Every L Band CNPC Link System **shall** inhibit transmission outside of the following frequency ranges: 

a. 1040–1080 MHz b. 1104–1150 MHz 
Note: Per guidance from the SC-228 TOR, RTCA has sought to identify a portion of the 
L Band which has the highest possibility of supporting a significant number of smaller sized UA in as large a percentage of the NAS as can be achieved without impacting current users of the spectrum. 
 
 
During the drafting of this MOPS, the entire 960-1164 MHz band was examined for possible use by smaller sized UA.  As a result, it was determined that with a maximum L Band transmit power of 32 mW for UA flying at low altitude (less than 3kft AGL) within short range (less than 15 NM) of their GRS the 1040-1080 MHz and 1104-1150 MHz sub-bands had the greatest possibility of being acceptable; an analysis of the use of the 1040-1080 MHz sub-band is given in Appendix H.  This analysis however, is not sufficiently complete to recommend that L Band use is possible in a specific location.  Additional studies (analyses, simulations, and tests) will be required for operation at any geographic location to ensure that the CNPC Link System can adequately protect the currently operational ground and airborne equipment (DME, TACAN, ADS-B, Mode S, TCAS, etc.) from interference. 

## 2.2.1.2.2 C Band Tuning Range

Every C Band CNPC Link System **shall** inhibit transmission outside of the frequency range 5030–5091 MHz. 

## 2.2.1.3 Tdd Frame Structure

a. The waveform **shall** use a TDD structure based on TDD frames lasting 50 ms. each, as 
shown in Figure 2-1. 
b. Every TDD frame **shall** be divided into an uplink TDD subframe lasting 24.3 ms. and 
a subsequent downlink TDD subframe lasting 25.7 ms. 
c. The uplink TDD subframe **shall** include 1.3 ms. of guard time to account for 
propagation delays and timing errors. 
d. The downlink TDD subframe **shall** include 2.7 ms. of guard time to account for 
propagation delays and timing errors. 
e. Only CNPC Link System Ground Radios **shall** transmit during uplink TDD 
subframes.   
f. 
Only CNPC Link System Airborne Radios **shall** transmit during downlink TDD 
subframes. 

## 2.2.1.3.1 Timing Accuracy

a. Messages contained in uplink TDD subframes **shall** start at times given by: 
𝑇𝑈𝑃(𝑛) = 50𝑛± 0.001 ms. 
b. Messages contained in downlink TDD subframes **shall** start at times given by: 
𝑇𝐷𝑂𝑊𝑁(𝑛) = 24.3 + 50𝑛± 0.001 ms. 

In these equations, the time is measured with respect to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), n is the TDD frame number (an integer), and every TDD frame whose number is a multiple of 20 begins at an instant when UTC is an integer multiple of one second. 

Note: The start time of a TDD frame is defined as the beginning of the first symbol period of the ramp-up sequence. 

## 2.2.1.4 Frequency Accuracy

The center frequency of a CNPC Link System Airborne or Ground Radio transmitter **shall** 
not vary more than 0.2 part per million (ppm) from the assigned frequency. Unintended variations in the local-oscillator frequency of a CNPC Link System Airborne or Ground Radio receiver **shall** not cause the receiver's center frequency to vary more than 0.2 ppm from the assigned frequency. 

## 2.2.1.5 Channelization

The Airborne or Ground Radio transmitters and receivers of a given CNPC Link System may be assigned to the same RF channel, or to different channels whose widths may or may not be identical. 

## 2.2.1.5.1 Definition Of "Channel"

A channel is a block of spectrum that can be assigned to the CNPC Link System uplink and/or downlink of a given UAS.  It should not be concurrently used in whole or in part by any other, potentially interfering, CNPC Link System link whose transmitter(s) may be within RLOS distance of any of the given UAS's CNPC Link Airborne or Ground Radio System receivers at any time while the channel assignment is in effect. 

## 2.2.1.5.2 Channel Width

Every CNPC Link System Airborne or Ground Radio transmitter or receiver operable in L 
Band or C Band **shall** have a repertoire of one or more channel widths, each of which shall be a positive integer multiple of 5 kHz.  Channel width in kilohertz is represented as C in the spectral-density masks shown in the figures of Section 2.2.1.6.2. 

## 2.2.1.5.3 Channel Placement

The highest and lowest frequencies of any CNPC Link System channel **shall** each be a positive integer multiple of 5 kHz. 

## 2.2.1.5.4 Tunability

Every CNPC Link System Airborne or Ground Radio transmitter or receiver **shall** be capable of being tuned to the center frequency of any channel that may be assigned to it within one or more of the L Band and/or C Band tuning ranges identified in Section 2.2.1.2. 

Note: Each such center frequency will be a multiple of 2.5 kHz and will not coincide with the lowest or highest frequency of the tuning range. 

## 2.2.1.5.5 Video Channels

As described in Appendix E, "Video Considerations in Civil Airspace for Unmanned Aircraft Operations," some UAS may require downlinking of video sent from the UA to the Pilot Station to support emergency and takeoff/landing operations.  All such video transmissions **shall** occur only on the following channels: 

a. One In-Flight Emergency Channel having a width of 500 kHz b. Two Takeoff and Landing Channels, each having a width of 250 kHz. 
The video channels will be used only for the purposes identified herein.  Their spectral placement will be determined on a NAS-wide basis by the Frequency-management Manager. 

All video transmissions **shall** comply with all other RF emission requirements in Section 
2.2.1. 

## 2.2.1.5.6 Non-Video Channels

The width of any channel not carrying video transmissions **shall** be 250N kilohertz or less, where N is the number of CNPC links simultaneously supported by the transmitter. 

Note: An N-slot time-division multiple-access (TDMA) uplink transmitter simultaneously supports N CNPC links. 

## 2.2.1.6 Power And Spectral Density Restrictions

2.2.1.6.1 
Transmitter Output Power 
Note: *The power limits defined below are based on the link budgets in Appendix L.* 

2.2.1.6.1.1 
L Band Airborne and Ground Radio Transmitter Output Power 
The average output power of an L Band airborne or ground CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radio transmitter, measured at the transmitter's RF output port with a 50 
Ohm load attached and averaged over a time interval of 1.0 second, **shall** be 32N mW or less, where N is the number of CNPC links simultaneously supported by the transmitter. 

2.2.1.6.1.2 
C Band Airborne and Ground Radio Transmitter Output Power (High-Power Mode) 
The average output power of a C Band CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radio transmitter, measured at the transmitter's RF output port with a 50 Ohm load attached and averaged over a time interval of 1.0 second, **shall** be 10N Watts or less, where N is the number of CNPC links simultaneously supported by the transmitter. 

2.2.1.6.1.3 
C Band Airborne and Ground Radio Transmitter Output Power (Low-Power Mode) 
The average output power of a C Band CNPC Link System Airborne Radio transmitter in the low-power mode, measured at the transmitter's RF output port with a 50 Ohm load attached and averaged over a time interval of 1.0 second, **shall** be 100 mW or less. In the low-power mode the C Band ARS EIRP spectral density (EIRPSD) mask shown in Section 3.2.1.4.7 **shall** be reduced by 20 dB. 

## 2.2.1.6.2 Power Spectral Density (Psd) 2.2.1.6.2.1 L Band Airborne Radio Transmitter Psd Limits 2.2.1.6.2.1.1 Antenna Gain Minus System Installation Loss 3 Dbi Or Less

## 2.2.1.7 Airborne And Ground Radio Receiver Adjacent-Channel And Spurious-Response Rejection

Every CNPC Link System Airborne or Ground Radio receiver **shall** be able to meet all requirements for adjacent-channel and spurious-response rejection under worst-case conditions of frequency inaccuracy and Doppler shift that could arise from its own operation and platform motion as well as those of the transmitter from which it is receiving the desired signal. 

## Notes:

a. The channel width C of a CNPC Link System Airborne or Ground Radio receiver is 
the same as that of the transmitter from which it is receiving the desired signal. 
b. Adjacent-channel rejection (ACR) refers to the rejection of an undesired interfering 
CNPC signal that has been assigned spectrum immediately adjacent to the spectrum occupied by the desired CNPC signal.  The minimum frequency separation between the center frequencies of the spectrum assigned to the desired and undesired CNPC 
signals is ∆fN = 0.5 (CD + CU), where CD is the channel width of the desired CNPC 
signal (see paragraphs 2.2.1.5 and 2.2.1.6), and CU is the channel width of the undesired interfering CNPC signal. Frequency assignments with the minimum frequency separation may be granted only when the separation distance between the CNPC GRSs associated with the desired and undesired CNPC signals is sufficiently 
great to guarantee that the maximum undesired-to-desired (U/D) signal ratio is less than 19 dB for L Band and C Band CNPC link systems as explained below in Note e. 

c. Non-adjacent-channel rejection refers to the rejection of an undesired interfering 
CNPC signal whose assigned spectrum center frequency is separated from the center frequency of the spectrum assigned to the desired CNPC signal by ∆fW ≥ max (0.5 
(3.5CD + CU), 0.5 (CD + 3.5CU)) for L Band CNPC link systems and ∆fW ≥ max 
(0.5 (2CD + CU), 0.5 (CD + 2CU)) for L Band CNPC systems. Frequency assignments with a minimum frequency separation of ∆fW are required when the CNPC GRSs associated with the desired and undesired CNPC signals are not sufficiently far apart and the undesired-to-desired (U/D) signal ratio is greater than 19 dB but less than 54 dB for L Band CNPC link systems and greater than 19 dB but less than 44 dB for C Band CNPC link systems as explained below in Note d. 
d. In order to keep the U/D ratio down to manageable levels that are consistent with the 
power spectral densities specified in paragraph 3.2.1.4 for the L Band and C Band ARS and GRS systems, exclusion zones that prevent an ARS from getting too close to an undesired GRS will be necessary.  Assuming such exclusion zones (minimum flight 
heights and minimum distances between GRSs and airport runways) are imposed, U/D Link Budgets tabulated in Appendix L show that the maximum U/D ratio that can be tolerated between two UASs occupying non-adjacent L Band spectrum assignments while maintaining 21.5 dB link margin for multipath fading and airframe blockage as well as 6 dB ICAO aviation safety margin is 54 dB.  Similarly, the maximum U/D ratio that can be tolerated between two UASs occupying non-adjacent C Band spectrum assignments while maintaining 23.3 dB link margin for multipath fading and airframe blockage as well as 6 dB ICAO aviation safety margin is 44 dB.  The 10 dB difference in maximum tolerable U/D ratio between L Band and C Band systems is due to the fact that the off-channel power spectral density noise floor specified in paragraphs 2.2.1.6.2.1 and 2.2.1.6.2.2 for L Band Airborne and Ground Radio transmitters, respectively, is -75 dBc relative to a reference on-channel peak power spectral density; on the other hand, the off-channel power spectral density floor specified in paragraphs 2.2.1.6.2.3 and 2.2.1.6.2.4 for C Band Airborne and Ground Radio transmitters, respectively, is -65 dBc relative to reference on-channel peak power spectral density. 
e. Power spectral densities specified in the sub-paragraphs below paragraph 2.2.1.6.2 
for L Band and C Band airborne and ground transmitters at frequency offsets equal to 
0.5C are -40 dBc relative to a reference on-channel peak power spectral density.  
Therefore the tolerable U/D ratio for L Band and C Band adjacent channel operation is 19 dB.  That is, the tolerable L Band U/D ratio for adjacent channel operation is 35 dB smaller than the maximum tolerable L Band U/D ratio for non-adjacent channel operation.  And the C Band tolerable U/D ratio for adjacent channel operation is 25 dB smaller than the maximum tolerable U/D ratio for non-adjacent channel operation. 
f. 
The link budgets of Appendix L presuppose a maximum tolerable received interference level (after filtering) that is equal to the receiver's internal noise level N, thus raising the receiver's interference-plus-noise level and degrading its sensitivity by 10 log ((I + N)/N) = 10 log ((N + N)/N) = 3 dB. 

## 2.2.1.7.1 L Band And C Band Airborne And Ground Radio Receiver First-Adjacent-Channel Rejection

The CNPC link system's received subframe error rate shall be less than 0.1% when a desired CNPC signal that is 3 dB above the receiver sensitivity and a single undesired CNPC signal that has a total power level 19 dB above that of the desired signal for L Band and C Band CNPC link systems, and whose center frequency is separated from the receiver's and the desired signal's center frequency by ∆fN = 0.5 (CD + CU), are both applied at the receiver input. CD and CU are the desired and undesired CNPC signal bandwidths defined in 2.2.1.7, note b. 

## 2.2.1.7.2 L Band Airborne And Ground Radio Receiver Rejection Of Single Non-Adjacent- Channel Interferers

The CNPC Link System's received subframe error rate **shall** be less than 0.1% when a desired L Band CNPC signal that is 3 dB above the L Band receiver sensitivity and a single undesired L Band CNPC signal that has a total power level 54 dB above that of the desired signal, and whose center frequency is separated from the receiver's and the desired signal's center frequency by ∆fW = max (0.5 (3.5CD *+ C*U), 0.5 (CD *+ 3.5C*U)) are both applied at the receiver input. CD*, and C*U are the desired and undesired CNPC signal bandwidths defined in Section 2.2.1.7, notes b and c.  

## 2.2.1.7.3 C Band Airborne And Ground Radio Receiver Rejection Of Single Non-Adjacent- Channel Interferers

The CNPC Link System's received subframe error rate **shall** be less than 0.1% when a desired C Band CNPC signal that is 3 dB above the C Band receiver sensitivity and a single undesired C Band CNPC signal that has a total power level 44 dB above that of the desired signal, and whose center frequency is separated from the receiver's and the desired signal's center frequency by ∆fW = max (0.5 (2CD *+ C*U), 0.5 (CD *+ 2C*U)) are both applied at the receiver input. CD *and C*U are the desired and undesired CNPC signal bandwidths defined in Section 2.2.1.7, notes b and c. 

The CNPC Link System's received subframe error rate **shall** also be less than 0.1% when a single undesired CNPC signal whose level is -38 dBm and a desired CNPC signal that has a total power level that is 44 dB below that of the undesired signal, and whose center frequency is separated from the undesired signal center frequency by ∆fW = max (0.5 (2CD + CU), 0.5 (CD + 2CU*)),* are both applied at the receiver input.

## Notes For Table 2-1:

a. Where multiple limits are given for a particular band and radio (ground or airborne), 
the lowest applicable limit applies.  For example, a CNPC Link System Airborne Radio transmitter would be required to keep its 1087–1093 MHz emissions at or below –75 dBm in any 1 MHz, if co-located with Mode S ES; –65 dBm/MHz, if colocated with TCAS but not with Mode S ES; or –47.2 dBm/MHz if co-located with neither Mode S ES nor TCAS. 
b. CNPC Link System net antenna gains (after subtracting system installation losses) are 
assumed never to exceed the following maximum values when the system operates at full power:  For CNPC Link System Ground Radios, 18 dBi in L Band and 24 dBi in C Band; for CNPC Link System Airborne Radios, 3 dBi in L Band and in C Band. 
c. Where potential victim equipment is co-located with the CNPC Link System Airborne 
and Ground Radio transmitter, the emission limit assumes a minimum of 30 dB of isolation (attenuation) between the CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radio transmitter output and the output of the victim receiving antenna. The 30-dB attenuation includes the CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radio transmitterto-antenna cable/installation losses, plus the loss due to decoupling of the CNPC Link System antenna and the victim receiving antenna. 
d. CNPC Link System Ground Radio vs. AeroMACS receiver:  AeroMACS sensitivity of –
97 dBm (derived from RTCA DO-346 and IEEE 802.16-2009) in 5-MHz channel, minus 6-dB aviation safety margin [Reference 5, para. 9.4.2], minus 6-dB allowance for multiple CNPC Link System emitters, plus free-space loss at 500 feet, minus 24- dBi C Band CNPC Link System net antenna gain, minus AeroMACS ground station's antenna gain of 15 dBi, plus AeroMACS line loss of 2 dB. 
e. CNPC Link System Airborne Radio vs. non-co-located AeroMACS receiver:  
AeroMACS sensitivity of –97 dBm, minus 6-dB aviation safety margin, minus 6-dB allowance for multiple CNPC Link System emitters, plus free-space loss at 500 feet, minus 3-dBi C Band CNPC Link System net antenna gain, minus AeroMACS ground station's antenna gain of 15 dBi, plus AeroMACS line loss of 2 dB. 
f. 
CNPC Link System Airborne Radio vs. co-located AeroMACS receiver:  AeroMACS sensitivity of –97 dBm, minus 6-dB aviation safety margin, minus 6-dB allowance for multiple CNPC Link System emitters, plus assumed 30 dB isolation. 

## 2.2.1.8.3 Airborne And Ground Radio Receiver Out-Of-Band Susceptibility Limits

Every CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radio receiver **shall** be able to operate without more than 3 dB of degradation to its own sensitivity in the presence of an undesired signal having the average power level at the receiver input in each of the bands listed in Table 2-2.

## 2.2.2.3.4 Midambles

Once the Data Segment is assembled, it **shall** be divided into 512 bit segments with known symbols called midambles inserted in between. 

A midamble **shall** be one of the 6 symbol sequences listed in Table 2-19. Each sequence is 
32 symbols long and is used by the receiver for the correction of Doppler Effect.  The midamble **shall** be inserted after every 512 symbols of the Data Segment, unless the remainder after the 512 symbols is less than 97 symbols.  In which case the entire data segment **shall** be sent followed by the postamble.  The midamble patterns **shall** be used sequentially starting with Pattern 0 with every new message.  
The following set of rules **shall** be used for inserting midambles: 
Start: Is the Data Segment > 608 symbols (512 +96)?  

Yes: 
Is this a new message to be processed? 
 
 
Yes: 
a) Insert the first midamble (pattern 0) after the first 512 symbols of the data segment.  


b) Return to Start. 
 
 
No:  
a) Insert the next midamble pattern from Table 2-19, after the next 512 symbols of the remaining data segment.  


b) Return to Start. 
No:  
a) Send the remaining symbols of the data segment with the next midamble pattern appended to the end (aka the postamble). 
 
 
b) STOP - Insertion of midambles is complete. 
As with the preamble sequence, bit 0 is the far right LSB of this pattern.  The sequence bits of the first midamble (Pattern 0, 568752F2) are:  
0100 1111 0100 1010 1110 0001 0110 1010 
2       F       2       5       7        8       6      5 
The number of midambles for the Data Class channel types is listed in Table 2-19.

## 2.2.2.3.5 Postambles

As with the acquisition preamble, with all Data Class transmissions there **shall** be a 32 
symbol postamble following the last fragment of the data segment.  The postamble pattern can be found in the list of midambles in Table 2-20 and **shall** be the next pattern after the last used midamble pattern in the sequence as described in the Midambles section above. 

## 2.2.2.3.5.1 Data Class 1 Or Data Class 3 Transmission

Following the postamble, there **shall** be four and a half symbols containing no information for ramp down of the power amplifier (PA). A four and a half symbol ramp down period shall also be required following the postamble, at the end of each uplink transmission slot that concludes a new Data Class 1 or Data Class 3 channel.  The extra 1/2 symbol delay is added where appropriate to minimize the number of fill bits needed to achieve an integer value of symbols per second within the 23 ms. subframe. 

## 2.2.2.3.5.2 Data Class 2 Or Data Class 4 Transmission

Following the postamble, there **shall** be four symbols containing no information for ramp down of the power amplifier (PA).  A four-symbol ramp down period **shall** also be required following the postamble, at the end of each uplink transmission slot that concludes a new Data Class 2 or Data Class 4 channel. 

## 2.2.2.3.6 Crc Error Detection

A 32-bit CRC **shall** be calculated for each message to be transmitted and appended, in order of most significant bit (MSB) to least significant bit (LSB), to the end of the message prior to encoding of the message bits. 

The CRC **shall** be recalculated for received messages (excluding the last 32 bits of the appended CRC) and compared to the appended CRC to ensure the integrity of the data was maintained during the transmission of the message. 

All messages that fail the CRC check **shall** be discarded internal to the CNPC Link System and **shall** not be forwarded outside of the CNPC Link System. The CRC generator polynomial used **shall** be:  
x32 + x26 + x23 + x22 + x16 + x12 + x11 + x10 + x8 + x7 + x5 + x4 + x2 + x + 1. 

The CRC register **shall** be initialized to all ones for each message. The message **shall** be treated as a single sequence of binary digits: MSB of the first byte to LSB of the first byte followed by MSB of the second byte to the LSB of the second byte and so on. 

## 2.2.2.3.7 Forward Error Correction (Fec)

Turbo coding **shall** be used exclusively for all FEC.  A code rate of approximately 0.62 shall be used with different block sizes for the various Data Classes.  Each of the turbo codes utilizes a Rate 1/3-turbo code at its core with puncturing to achieve the desired turbo code rate.  The Rate 1/3 core and puncturing method are described in the following sections. 

## 2.2.2.3.7.1 Rate 1/3 Turbo Encoder

All data segment bits **shall** be encoded using the Rate 1/3 Turbo Encoder defined in this section. The Turbo Encoder **shall** use the Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Code 
(PCCC) architecture shown in Figure 2-10. The upper and lower constituent encoders shall be functionally equivalent to the circuit shown in the figure. Each constituent encoder contains three shift registers for a total memory depth of 3 (m=3). Message bits enter the upper encoder in their original order. The lower encoder is fed with randomized message bits from the output of the S-random Interleaver. 

 
Each message block is Turbo encoded using the following two phases which are processed sequentially. 

 
Message Bit Phase - Message bits (Xn) enter the Turbo encoder. The Turbo 
encoder produces three output bits per each input message bit: (Xn) the original Message Bit, (Zn) the Upper Encoder Parity Bit, (Z'n) the Lower Encoder Parity Bit. The output bits are clocked out in the following order, (Xn, Zn, Z'n). 
 
Trellis Termination Phase - Once the last message bit has been clocked into the 
constituent encoder inputs, the Message/Tail Control switches are placed in the lower position in preparation for output of the termination bits. All four encoder outputs are saved over three clock cycles creating a total of twelve termination bits.  
Note: The subscript is the number of clock cycles since the first message bit X0. 

Message Bit Phase: All shift registers are initialized to all-zero's prior to clocking in of the first Message bit. When Message bits are clocked into the constituent encoders, the Message/Tail Control switches are placed in the upper position allowing one message bit to enter the constituent encoder for each clock cycle. Each input Message bit (X) is passed through the upper constituent encoder to the (X) output unchanged (a systematic code). The parity bits from the upper encoder (Z) and lower encoder (Z') are appended to the output message bit (X) and output in the following order (Xn, Zn, Z'n). During the Message Bit Phase, the Message and Parity bits exit the encoder in the following order 

$$\mathbf{X}_{0},\mathbf{Z}_{0},\mathbf{Z}^{\prime}{}_{0},\mathbf{X}_{1},\mathbf{Z}_{1},\mathbf{Z}^{\prime}{}_{1},\mathbf{X}_{2},\mathbf{Z}_{2},\mathbf{Z}^{\prime}{}_{2},...,\mathbf{X}_{k},\mathbf{Z}_{k},\mathbf{Z}^{\prime}{}_{k}$$
Note: The interleaved Message bits (X') from the output of the S-Random Interleaver are not used in the Message Bit Phase since they are equivalent to the original message bit sequence and do not contain any additional (new) information. Interleaved Message bits (X') may easily be recreated from the Message Bits. 

Trellis Termination Phase: After the last Message Bit has been clocked into the encoder, the Message/Tail Control switches are moved to the lower position in preparation for creating the trellis termination bits.  
There are four encoder outputs (X, A, X', and A') and three internal shift registers (m=3). Three clock cycles are needed to output the final encoder state and return the initial state of the encoders to all-zeros. The final state of the encoder is fully described by 4 x 3 = 12- termination bits. 

The twelve termination bits are identified in the table below. 'k' is the number of message bits, and the subscript is the number of clock cycles since the first message it X0.

Upper Encoder 
Lower Encoder

Zk+1 
X'k+1 
Z'k+1 
Termination Clock Cycle 3 
Xk+2 
Zk+2 
X'k+2 
Z'k+2 

During the Trellis Termination Phase, the termination bits exit the encoder in the following order 

${\rm X_{k}}$, ${\rm Z_{k}}$, ${\rm X_{k+1}}$, ${\rm Z_{k+1}}$, ${\rm X_{k+2}}$, ${\rm Z_{k+2}}$, ${\rm X^{\prime}}_{\rm k}$, ${\rm Z^{\prime}}_{\rm k}$, ${\rm X^{\prime}}_{\rm k+1}$, ${\rm Z^{\prime}}_{\rm k+1}$, ${\rm X^{\prime}}_{\rm k+2}$, ${\rm Z^{\prime}}_{\rm k+2}$
Note: In the Message Bit phase each clock cycle produces three output bits. During Trellis Termination phase each clock cycle produces four termination bits.  

## S-Random Interleaver

The S-random Interleaver de-correlates the inputs of the upper and lower constituent encoders. The interleaver is designed to reduce the probability a particular weight-2 data sequence will be permuted by the interleaver into another weight-2 data sequence of the same form (avoid short cycle events). Interleaver tables for each of the four data classes are provided below. '1' based indexing is employed. The first entry in each table is the index of the input bit that is the first output from the interleaver. For example, the Data Class 1 Table has an entry of 74 in the first position. So the 74th bit that enters the interleaver, will be the first bit that is output from the interleaver. The tables are read from left to right, so the second bit that is output for Data Class 1 is the 112th input bit.

## 2.2.2.3.7.2 Multi Rate Turbo Encoder

To increase the effective data rate, data puncturing (the selective omission of bits) **shall** be performed on the output of the Turbo encoder to increase the effective code rate with framing bits to approximately R=0.62 with minimal loss of code performance. All four Data Classes **shall** use the same 30-bit puncture pattern defined below. This puncture pattern is repeated until the last Turbo encoded output bit has been processed. The puncture pattern is continued (applied) over the twelve trellis termination bits. Puncturing is not performed over the fill bits. Fill bits are simply appended at the end of the punctured Turbo encoder output. 

Note: Only the parity bits (Z and Z') and Tail bits may be punctured (deleted). The message bits (M) are never punctured (a systematic code). (Termination bits do not contain Message Bits. Termination bits contain Tail Bits and parity bits. All termination bits may be punctured.)  
The 30-bit puncture pattern is: 6454564645 (octal), or 110 100 101 100 101 110 100 110 100 101 (binary). The left-most bit is applied to the first bit in the Turbo encoder output block. This puncture pattern is repeated over the full Turbo encoder output which includes the trellis termination bits.  
Note: Puncturing is not applied to fill bits which are appended to the end

## 2.2.2.3.8 Interleaving

The encoded output data from the FEC **shall** be written directly to an interleaver matrix, which is designed to disperse bursts errors that occur during transmission as evenly as possible throughout the message to give the decoder the best chance of correcting errors in the data once received.  The FEC output data **shall** be written row-wise directly to the interleaver matrix as a single stream of 1-bit symbols starting at the first row (Row 0) and first column (Column 0).  The interleaver output data is then read out column-wise starting at the first column and first row. The size of the data in the interleaver matrix varies based on the Data Class.  Table 2-26 (Interleaver Parameters) lists the total number of bits in the interleaver along with the corresponding rows and columns for each available message type.  The column titled 
"Shortened Columns" is the number of columns that contain one fewer row entries than the value indicated by column title "Interleaver Rows".  This allows all Data Classes to use the same number of interleaver columns with the last row not completely filled. Figure 2-15 (Interleaver Matrix) depicts an example of an interleaver matrix.

## 2.2.2.3.9 Pseudorandom Overlay

A Pseudorandom (PN) Overlay of the interleaved data bits **shall** be applied to optimize modulation and demodulation performance by randomizing the appearance of the transmitted data for both uplinks and downlinks.  The overlay bits **shall** be combined with the interleaved data bits using an Exclusive OR (XOR) process prior to modulation and the original interleaved data is recovered after receiver demodulation using the same PN 
Overlay and XOR process.  The PN Overlay **shall** be generated with a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) shown in Figure 2-16, with a Reset State of 0001001101110010. The PN Overlay is a fixed deterministic sequence defined by the polynomial: x16 + x14 + x13 + x11 + 1.

## 2.2.2.3.10 Message Processing Summary

Figure 2-17 shows the process that transforms the message data into the subframe that will be transmitted over the radio.  This example is for a Data Class 3 channel for both uplink and downlink in single UA operation. 

## 2.2.3 Manufacturer-Specific Cnpc Link System Requirements

The requirements in this section apply to Manufacturer-Specific CNPC Link System Airborne and Ground Radios. 

## 2.2.3.1 Symbol Rate

The CNPC Link System **shall** use symbol rates within the range 5 ks/s to 500 ks/s, times the number of CNPC links simultaneously supported by the transmitter, compared to the 103.5 ks/s used in the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System validation flight tests. 

## 2.2.3.2 Modulation Type

The CNPC Link System **shall** use modulation types supporting one, two, or three bits per symbol compared to the one symbol per bit, GMSK modulation used in the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System validation flight tests. 

## 2.2.3.3 Airborne And Ground Radio Transmitter Output Power L Band

The Airborne or Ground Radio transmitter power delivered to the Airborne or Ground Radio System antenna terminals **shall** be in the range 3.2 mW to 32 mW per carrier compared to the 10 mW for the Airborne and Ground transmitters used in the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System validation flight tests. 

## C Band

The Airborne or Ground Radio transmitter power delivered to the Airborne or Ground Radio System antenna terminals, in high power mode, **shall** be in the range of 0.5 Watts to 
10 Watts per carrier compared to the 10 Watts and 6.0 Watts for the Airborne and Ground Radio transmitters (respectively) used in the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System validation flight tests.

Subframe Error Rate compared to the -117 dBm (L Band) and the -114 dBm (C Band) used in the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System validation flight tests. 

Note: Sensitivity will be symbol rate dependent.  The CNPC Link System manufacturers may select characteristics for such items as pre, mid and post amble, CRC, FEC, Interleaving and Pseudorandom Overlay to suit their CNPC Link System intended function and operating environment.  The effect of these parameters on the CNPC Link System performance will be maintained by adherence to the sensitivity specified in this requirement and by the test requirements described in Section 2.4. 

## 2.2.3.5 Airborne Or Ground Radio Receiver Maximum, In-Band, Input Signal Level

The Airborne or Ground Radio receiver maximum, in-band, signal input level, measured at the Aircraft or Ground radio antenna terminals, **shall** be within the range -30dBm to 
+20dBm compared to the -10dBm used in MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System validation flight tests. 

Note: Manufacturers have been given the flexibility to design receivers with a range of 
maximum input signal levels since not all applications will require high dynamic range. 
Note: During Certification of the UAS, the UAS manufacture will use the Receiver 
Maximum Signal level to demonstrate safe operation at short range or in the 
presence of other CNPC Link Systems or other in-band systems. 
2.2.3.6 
Frequency Capture Range The Frequency Capture Range of the CNPC Link System Airborne Radio receiver **shall** 
be in the range 0 to +/-15 kHz compared to the +/-15 kHz used in the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System validation flight tests. 

2.2.3.7 
Doppler Correction 
The Doppler Correction Range of the CNPC Link System Airborne Radio receiver **shall** 
be in the range 0 to +/-15 kHz compared to the +/-15 kHz used in the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System validation flight tests. 

## 2.3 Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in this section are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the effect of the airborne and ground equipment on the overall performance characteristics of the system under conditions representative of those that may be encountered in actual operations.  The performance of the CNPC Link System Airborne Radio and CNPC Link System Ground Radio **shall** be tested as described in Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3, respectively.   

## 2.3.1 Use Of Special Purpose Software

It is acceptable but not necessary to use FAA-approved production software during the environment tests.  Special purpose test software is acceptable and may be a more appropriate way to ensure that the hardware and interfaces are comprehensively exercised during environmental excursions.  When using this approach, the applicant **shall** show by inspection or analysis that the hardware functions necessary to meet all applicable requirements of Section 2.2 are thoroughly exercised and **shall** establish appropriate pass / 
fail criteria consistent with the performance requirements and test procedures of Section 
2.4.  In addition, configuration of the special purpose software **shall** be controlled. 

## 2.3.2 Cnpc Link System Airborne Radio Performance - Environmental Conditions 2.3.2.1 Required Performance

Unless otherwise specified, the environmental conditions and test procedures contained in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, will be used to demonstrate equipment compliance.  In this document, the requirements in the latest revision of European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) ED-14 corresponding to the specified requirements in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160 also apply. The latest revision of RTCA DO-160 contains equipment categories for each environmental condition with different environmental test limits for each category.  The equipment manufacturer is allowed to choose which environmental category the article is qualified and the manufacturer's certification **shall** specifically state the environmental categories for which the article is qualified.  Components designed for location in different parts of the aircraft may be tested separately using the appropriate categories for each component. 

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in Table 2-27 and Table 
2-28 provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under conditions representative of those which may be encountered in actual operations.  The tables lists all of the environmental conditions and test procedures (hereafter referred to as environmental procedures) that are documented in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160.  Table 2-27 and Table 2-28 identify the sets of performance tests that are specified in detail in this section and which are intended to be run subject to the various environmental procedures in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160.  Follow the performance test procedures of Section 2.4. Some of the environmental tests do not have to be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition.  These tests are identified by the phrase "if required."  If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional environmental conditions, then these "If required" tests **shall** 
be performed. Some of the performance requirements in Section 2.2 are not tested by the test procedures herein.  Moreover, not all tests are required to be done at each of the environmental conditions in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160.  Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Section 2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these environmental conditions. It is the purview of the equipment manufacturer to determine the environment against which it is certifying the Equipment under Test (EUT).  Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160.  This document illustrates the pass/fail criteria for the environmental conditions associated with the latest revision of RTCA DO-160 for reference.

## 2.3.3 Cnpc Link System Ground Radio Performance - Environmental Conditions 2.3.3.1 Required Performance

As no ground (stationary ground, mobile ground, or sea-based) equipment environmental specification exists today, the environmental conditions and test procedures contained in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, MIL-STD-810G, Department of Defense Test Method Standard Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests, and MIL-STD-704F, Department of Defense Interface Standard Aircraft Electric Power Characteristics will be used to demonstrate equipment compliance.  In this document, the requirements in the latest revision of European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) ED- 14 corresponding to the specified requirements in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160 also apply. The latest revision of RTCA DO-160 contains equipment categories for each environmental condition with different environmental test limits for each category.  MIL- STD-810G and MIL-STD-704F contain different procedures for each method of laboratory test.  The equipment manufacturer is allowed to choose which environmental category the article is qualified and the manufacturer's certification must specifically state the environmental categories for which the article is qualified.  Components designed to be located in different parts of the CNPC Ground Radio System may be tested separately using the appropriate categories for each component. The environmental tests and performance requirements described in Table 2-30 and Table 2-31 provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under conditions representative of those which may be encountered in actual operations.  The tables lists all of the environmental conditions and test procedures (hereafter referred to as environmental procedures) that are documented in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160, five of the methods from MIL-STD-810G, and one method from MIL-STD-704F.  The table also includes the three locations that are addressed for Ground Radio Stations in Section 2.3.3.2 of this document and which environment applies to the respective location.  Table 2-30 and Table 2-31 identify the sets of performance tests that are specified in detail in this section and which are intended to be conducted subject to the various environmental procedures contained in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160, MIL-STD-810G, and MIL-STD-704F.  Follow the performance test procedures of Section 2.4. Some of the environmental tests do not have to be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition.  These tests are identified by the phrase "optional."  If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional environmental conditions, then these "optional" tests **shall** 
be performed. While this document does specify which environments are required, it is the applicant's responsibility to specify the category and/or range within that environment. 

Lastly, there are environments that are not addressed in this document, such as, hail, volcanic ash, etc. These environments are not required, but the applicant may want to consider these. Some of the performance requirements in Section 2.2 are not tested by the test procedures herein.  Moreover, not all tests are required to be done at each of the environmental conditions in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160, MIL-STD-810G, or MIL-STD-704F. Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Section 2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these environmental conditions. 

It is the purview of the equipment manufacturer to determine the environment against which it is certifying the equipment under test (EUT).  Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in the latest revision of RTCA DO-160, MIL-STD-810G, and MIL-STD-704F.  This document illustrates the pass/fail criteria for the environmental conditions associated with the latest revision of RTCA DO-160, MIL-STD-810G, and MIL-STD-704F for reference. 

## 2.3.3.2 Ground Radio Systems Locations For The Purpose Of This Document, Three Ground (Stationary Ground, Mobile Ground, And Sea-Based) Locations Are Considered (Table 2-29).

2.3.3.2.1 
Exposed - Class B (B2 or B3), E2, or F2 
The equipment is completely exposed.  This does not mean exposed individual components (PCBs, relays, etc.) but the box the equipment is housed in, is the only protection up on the tower. 
Note: This does not apply to electrical environments. 

2.3.3.2.2 
Partially Protected - Class D2, F3, or F4 
The equipment is housed inside a partially environmentally controlled structure. An example would be a storage building at the base of the tower. 
Note: This does not apply to electrical environments. 

2.3.3.2.3 
Completely Protected - Class A (A1 or A2), D1, or F1 
The equipment is housed inside an environmentally controlled structure that is protected from any outside elements. 
Note: This does not apply to electrical environments. 

## 2.3.3.2.4 Different Ground Radio System Installation Locations

The following defines the 11 environments particular to a Ground Radio System: 
Stationary Class A1 - Temperature controlled locations Class A2 - Control room locations 

Class B2 - Non-weather-protected, extremely cold  
Class B3 - Non-weather-protected, extremely warm and dry 

## Mobile Use - Ground Vehicle/Ship

Class D1 - Protected installation Class D2 - Partly protected installation 
 
Class E1 - Totally weather- protected locations Class E2 - Non-weather-protected locations  
Portable/Non-Stationary 

Class F1 - Temperature controlled locations Class F2 - Partly temperature controlled locations Class F3 - Partly weather and non-weather protected locations

(1) Only required to functionally check unit after exposure (i.e. transportation) and not during operation in the final location for 

stationary installations. 

(2) This particular vibration is region specific and would require custom tailoring of MIL-STD-810G. (3) This environment is considered region specific and thus deemed optional. (4) The fire, flammability test is to ensure the equipment doesn't support flame propagation. There are no performance requirements. (5) Lightning direct effects applies to the externally mounted equipment unit(s). (6) Sand & dust test for sea-based installations is not required. (7) For mobile and sea-based installations, the unit is to be functionally checked during exposure to the operational shock and 
vibration environment.

(1) Only required to functionally check unit after exposure (i.e. transportation) and not during operation in the final location for 
stationary installations. 

(2) This particular vibration is region specific and would require custom tailoring of MIL-STD-810G. (3) This environment is considered region specific and thus deemed optional. (4) The fire, flammability test is to ensure the equipment doesn't support flame propagation. There are no performance requirements. (5) Lightning direct effects applies to the externally mounted equipment unit(s). (6) Equipment performance requirements for this function of the EUT are defined within DO-160. (7) The performance tests are run (D)uring and/or (A)fter each environmental test as specified in the table. (8) Sand & dust test for sea-based installations is not required. (9) For mobile and sea-based installations, the unit is to be functionally checked during exposure to the operational shock and 
vibration environment.

## 2.4.2.1 Standard Test Signals

Standard CNPC Link System L Band Test Signal - The L Band RF carrier input will be encoded and modulated by the manufacturer specified modulation and encoding technique.  The user input data rate(s) and associated encoding and modulation rate(s) are also specified by the manufacturer.  The Standard Test signal **shall** be generated by inputting a block of user data (Test Message) to the L Band CNPC Link System Radio transmitter in accordance with Section 2.4.2.2.  The CNPC Transmitted Test Signal **shall** 
be synchronized to the TDD frame structure specified in Section 2.2.1.3. Standard CNPC Link System C Band Test Signal - The C Band RF carrier input will be encoded and modulated by the manufacturer specified modulation and encoding technique.  The user input data rate(s) and associated encoding and modulation rate(s) are also specified by the manufacturer.  The Standard Test signal **shall** be generated by inputting a block of user data (Test Message) to the C Band CNPC Link System Radio transmitter in accordance with Section 2.4.2.2.  The Transmitted Test Signal **shall** be synchronized to the TDD frame structure specified in Section 2.2.1.3. Minimum Desired CNPC Link System Signal Level - The minimum power of the desired CNPC Link signal applied to the receiver will be Smin where Smin is the manufacturer defined sensitivity level of the receiver.  If the receiver supports multiple user data rates, the manufacturer **shall** specify Smin for each user data rate. 

MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System Waveform - The Baseline Transmitter Waveform (BTW) is a test equipment based RF waveform that is programmed to emulate the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System waveform.  The BTW is created by using a high-level, interpreted programming language to emulate the transmitter functions used as input to a vector signal generator to generate the CNPC Link System transmitted RF waveform.  The BTW emulates the following transmit functions: CRC Error Detection, Forward Error Correction, Interleaving and Pseudorandom Overlay. Creating the code to emulate these transmit functions provide insight and understanding of the transmit functions and allows for testing and analysis. 

Note: It is acceptable to make frequency measurements when the Standard CNPC Link System Test Signal is operating with an unmodulated carrier. 

Data Structure Analyzer (DSA) - Acquires data from multiple sources simultaneously, translates, analyzes and compares the structure attributes of any segment or message sequence.  The attributes function can be used to view all components of a data structure, disassemble and reassemble all message types on demand.  In the configuration predominantly use in this document, both transmit and receive data ports are connected into the DSA Tx and Rx ports to confirm that the specific CNPC Data Class(s) being sent, are received and processed correctly.  If the transmitted data does not translate into what was received, the data transmission test being conducted fails.  All Data Transmission Structure Verification tests are pass-fail based. 

## 2.4.2.2 Test Message Size And User Data Rate

The CNPC Link System Message Generator **shall** generate Message Data Payload containing pseudo-random user message bits which vary for each successive transmitted burst (pulse). The number of bits are equal to the number of user bits per sub-frame specified by the manufacturer for the specific User Data Rate(s) of the CNPC Link System Radio receiver/transmitter under test. The relationship between the Number of User Bits per Sub-Frame and the User Data Rate is defined as follows: 

 
User Data Rate (kbits/sec) = Number of User Bits per Sub-Frame (bits) / 50 ms. 

## 2.4.2.3 Statistical Sample Size And Pass/Fail Criteria

For each and every test condition that involves determining the CNPC Link System Radio receiver sensitivity, the Test TDD Subframe Generator **shall** transmit 10,000 test messages in accordance with Section 2.4.2.2. 

The Pass/Fail criteria for a given test **shall** be as follows: 

a) 
If ten (10) or fewer messages are not received (lost by the CNPC Link System Radio receiver) or are received with errors (do not pass CRC), then the CNPC Link receiver sub-system passes the test.  This is equal to a Message Failure Rate of 0.1% or less. 
b) 
If eleven (11) or more messages are not received (lost by the CNPC Link System Radio receiver) or are received with errors (do not pass CRC), then the CNPC Link System Radio receiver sub-system fails the test.  This is equal to a Message Failure Rate of greater than 0.1%. 

## 2.4.2.4 Standard Output

The output of the CNPC Link System Radio receiver and the data collection computer shall provide the means for computing the Message Failure Rate correctly accounting for messages lost (not delivered) by the CNPC Link System Radio System Receiver and those messages that do not pass the CRC. Additionally, the data collection computer **shall** count the number of user data blocks received with undetected errors and the total number of received user data blocks. 

## 2.4.2.5 Test Frequencies

Table 2-32 provides a systematic approach when verification testing requires testing on multiple frequencies within the transmitting and receiving range of operation. 

Test Frequencies (MHz) 
Lower L Band 
Upper L Band 
C Band 
960.xxx, 968.yyy, 975.zzz 
980.xxx, 1000.yyy, 1019.zzz 
5030.xxx, 5060.yyy, 5090.zzz 

The variables xxx, yyy, and zzz may be chosen so that each of the tests frequencies are at the lowest, mid, and upper channels applicable to each user data rate supported by the CNPC Link System Radio receiver/transmitter subsystem under test in each of the frequency bands supported by the CNPC Link System Radio receiver/transmitter subsystem under test. The pass/fail outcome of all tests at all frequencies applicable to the equipment under test must be used to determine the test disposition.  In order to pass the test, the CNPC Link System Radio receiver/transmitter must pass each individual test.  Failure of one or more test scenarios results in failing this test.

Verification of Status Reporting for Section 2.2.1.1.2a through Section 2.2.1.1.2c are is identified and described in Section 2.4.3.1.1.1a-f. Test Procedures: 

## 2.4.3.1.1.2D - Received Signal Strength (Section 2.2.1.1.2D)

This procedure verifies the reporting of the signal strength entering the receiver input port. 

1. Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-19. 2. Configure the VSG for the proper waveform, output level, and frequency to 
interoperate with the UUT. 
3. Send a command to the UUT to report (status) strength of the received signal 
entering the receiver's input port (verifies (Section 2.2.1.1.2d). 
 
Pass: The UUT reported the strength of the signal entering the receiver input port. 
 
Fail: The UUT did not report the strength of the signal entering the receiver input port. 

## 2.4.3.1.1.2E - Bit Errors/Sinr (Section 2.2.1.1.2E)

This procedure verifies the CNPC Link System Radio's ability to detect bit errors and or estimate the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in each received TDD subframe. 

1. Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-19. 2. Send a command to the UUT to report user data blocks received with undetected 
errors, the total number of received user data blocks or an estimate of SINR.  
3. Configure the VSG for the proper waveform, output level, and frequency to

## 2.4.3.1.1.3 Cnpc Link Management (Section 2.2.1.1.3)

No CNPC Link Management System is defined at this time.  Sections 2.2.1.1.1 and 2.2.1.1.2 list commands and status reporting that could be the beginning of a CNPC Link Management System and the verification of those commands and status reporting requirements are contained in Section 2.4.3.1.1.1 and 2.4.3.1.1.2. 

## 2.4.3.1.2 Frequency Bands (Section 2.2.1.2)

No specific test procedure is required to validate Section 2.2.1.2. 

## 2.4.3.1.2.1 L Band Tuning Ranges (Section 2.2.1.2.1)

This procedure verifies the radio cannot be configured to transmit outside of the allocated CNPC Link System frequency bands. Test Procedure: 

1. Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-21. 
2. Set the transmit center frequency to just inside the band edge less one-half of the 
necessary bandwidth for the selected waveform. The transmit center frequency should be set such that the outside edge of the modulated waveform will fall just outside the band edge. 
3. There are three possible outcomes which satisfactorily verify this requirement 
(verifies Section 2.2.1.2.1): 
a. The radio will prevent the transmitter from being tuned to a frequency that 
would transmit RF energy outside of the allocated band. 
b. The radio will tune to an improper frequency, but the transmitter will not 
be enabled. 
c. The radio is able to tune to an improper frequency, and the transmitter can 
be enabled, but a spectrum analyzer connected to the transmitter output (with appropriate high power attenuation) demonstrates any power outside the allocated frequency band fully meets the emission limits of Section 2.2.1.8.4. 
 
Pass: The CNPC Link System inhibited transmissions outside the L Band /C Band frequency range. 
 
Fail: The CNPC Link System did not inhibit transmissions outside the L Band /C Band frequency range.

## 2.4.3.1.2.2 C Band Tuning Range (Section 2.2.1.2.2)

C Band tuning range can be verified by using the steps identified in Section 2.4.3.1.2.1 executing C Band frequencies. (Verifies Section 2.2.1.2.2). 

## 2.4.3.1.3 Tdd Frame Structure (Section 2.2.1.3)

This test verifies the timing of the transmitted signal to ensure compatibility with other CNPC systems. Since modulation and channel symbol rates are intentionally not specified in Section 2.2.1, timing measurements are made on the RF envelope of the transmitted waveform eliminating the need for specialized test receiver, or receiver configuration. The measurements performed in this subparagraph require a UTC based timing reference with a one pulse-per-second (1PPS) output. The 1PPS signal is used to trigger the sweep of a wideband multichannel oscilloscope. The UUT transmitter RF output power is safely dissipated in the power attenuator which also provides a proper SWR match to the UUT transmitter. The RF Diode Detector is used to measure the instantaneous amplitude of the transmitter RF envelope. The oscilloscope measures the time difference between the 1PPS timing reference and the rising and falling edges of the RF envelope. All radio must follow Test Procedure 1 for each frequency band the radio is capable of operating in. Dual band radio capable of simultaneously operating in L Band and C Band must also complete Test Procedure 2. 

## Test Procedure 1:

1. Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-22. 
2. Verify lock of the UTC timing source. 3. Confirm the oscilloscope trigger is locked to the 1PPS signal. 4. Configure the UUT to transmit and enable the transmitter. 5. Using oscilloscope markers, measure the time difference between the rising edge 
of the one pulse-per-second (1PPS) signal from the UTC Timing Source and the rising edge of the first CNPC transmitted RF burst following the rising edge of the 1PPS reference signal. 
a. For Ground Radio transmitter, confirm the measured difference is 50 ms. 
±0.001 ms. or less. (verifies 2.2.1.3.e transmit during uplink TDD subframes, 2.2.1.3.1.a Timing Accuracy) 
b. For Airborne Radio transmitters, confirm that the measured difference is 
24.3 ms. ±0.001 ms. or less. (verifies 2.2.1.3.f transmit during downlink TDD subframes, 2.2.1.3.1.b Timing Accuracy) 
Note: The measurement is made on the second RF pulse of a super frame (frame 1, n=1) for Ground Radio transmitters and on the first RF pulse of a super frame (frame 0, n=0) for Airborne Radio transmitters. 

6. Using oscilloscope markers, measure the time difference between the rising edge 
and falling edge of the transmitted RF envelope. Confirm the pulse duration is 23 ms. ±0.001 ms. or less. (This measurement along with Step 5 verifies 2.2.1.3b, 2.2.1.3c, 2.2.1.3d.) 
7. Expand the timescale of the oscilloscope to show at least two 1PPS pulses. Count 
the number of transmitted RF pulses between the rising edges of two 1PPS pulses. Verify there are 20 transmitted pulses between the two rising edges of the 1PPS signal. 
8. Configure the oscilloscope to trigger on the RF envelope. Set the oscilloscope 
time base to display a single transmitted burst on the display. Measure the jitter on 
the rising edge and falling edge of the transmitted pulses. (*This test is optional*. 
The earlier measurements made on the first transmitted pulse (Frame 0) in a 
'superframe'. This optional step is a timing check on the remaining 19 bursts in 
the superframe). 
Note: This requirement may already be satisfied in Test Procedure 1. In Test Procedure 
1, both bands must be measured against UTC and fall within a ± 0.001 ms. tolerance. Therefore, the time difference between the two bands can be no greater than 2x the ± 0.001 ms. tolerance. 

The following test procedure applies only to dual band radios capable of simultaneously transmitting in L Band and C Band. The procedure verifies proper timing / alignment between the L Band and C Band transmissions. The measurement set up (Figure 2-19) assumes the radio uses separate RF connectors for L Band and C Band. If the radio uses a single RF output connector a diplexer must be used on the output to separate the signals into individual single band outputs. 

1. Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-23. 2. Adjust the oscilloscope to trigger on one of the inputs. 3. Measure the time between the rising edge of the L Band RF envelope, and the 
rising edge of the C Band RF envelope. Confirm the difference in time is less than 0.001 ms. 
4. Repeat the measurement for the time between the falling edge of the L Band RF 
envelope, and the falling edge of the C Band RF envelope. Confirm the difference in time is less than 0.001 ms. 

## 2.4.3.1.3.1 Timing Accuracy (Section 2.2.1.3.1)

Timing accuracy is verified in Section 2.4.3.1.3. 

## 2.4.3.1.4 Frequency Accuracy (Section 2.2.1.4)

This test verifies the frequency accuracy of the CNPC Link System Radio transmitter. The measurement performed in this subparagraph requires either a frequency counter or a Vector Signal Analyzer (VSA) to measure the carrier or carrier offset frequency.  The VSA is required only if the UUT cannot be placed into an unmodulated carrier mode. The UUT transmitter RF output power is safely dissipated in a high power attenuator which also provides a proper SWR match to the UUT transmitter. 

Note: Alternate procedures and test equipment may be used if the equipment manufacturer can show they provide at least equivalent measured performance. 

Test Procedure 1: 

1. Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-24. 2. For each frequency band listed in Section 2.4.2.5 perform the following steps. 3. Command the UUT to the highest channel of the band under test. 4. Command the UUT to transmit an unmodulated carrier. 5. Using the frequency counter, record the frequency Fmeasured in Hertz. 
6. Command the UUT to disable the transmitter. 
7. Verify frequency accuracy. (Section 2.2.1.4) 
Note: Fchannel is the channel frequency in Hertz. 
 
Pass: | Fmeasured - Fchannel | ≤ .0000002*Fchannel 
 
 Fail: | Fmeasured - Fchannel | > .0000002* Fchannel 
Test Procedure 2: 

1. Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-25. 2. For each frequency band listed in Section 2.4.2.5 and supported by the UUT, 
perform the following steps. 
3. Tune the UUT to the highest channel of the frequency band under test. 4. Command the UUT to enable the transmitter. 5. Configure the VSA to demodulate the transmitted waveform. 6. With the VSA demodulation locked, measure the carrier offset and record as 
Foffset. 
7. Command the UUT to disable the transmitter. 8. Verify frequency accuracy. (Section 2.2.1.4) 
Note: Fchannel is the channel frequency in Hertz. 
 
Pass: | Foffset | <= .0000002* Fchannel. 
 
 Fail: | Foffset | > .0000002* Fchannel.

This procedure verifies that the CNPC Link System transmits and receives the correct channel width within the L and C Band. The channel width should be a positive integer multiple of 5 kHz. 

## Transmitter

The procedure uses a spectrum analyzer to measure the occupied bandwidth (1.0C - which is the total integrated power for the transmitted spectrum and is centered on the assigned channel center frequency (see ITU-R SM.328-11 S 3.2.2). The ITU-R SM.328-11 states that for a GMSK modulation, measurement of the occupied bandwidth (1.0C) that is measured on center of channel is a correct method to measure channel width.

a. Set the center frequency to the transmit frequency set in step 2. b. Select "Occupied Bandwidth". c. Set Resolution Bandwidth to 1 kHz. 
4. Send a command to enable the UUT transmitter. 5. The spectrum analyzer will display the "occupied bandwidth" (1.0C) stating a lower 
frequency and an upper frequency bound. This result should be equal to the channel width. (Verifies Section 2.2.1.5.2). 
6. Send a command to disable the UUT transmitter. 
 
Pass: The spectrum analyzer displays the transmit frequency band and channel width as set in step 2. The channel width has a positive integer multiple of 5 kHz. 
 
Fail:  The spectrum analyzer does not display the correct transmit frequency band and channel width as set in step 2.

## 2.4.3.1.6.2 Power Spectral Density (Psd) (Section 2.2.1.6.2)

This test verifies the transmitter mask to ensure the transmitter's spectral output power will not impact adjacent channels. The masks defined in Sections 2.2.1.6.2.1, 2.2.1.6.2.2, 2.2.1.6.2.3, and 2.2.1.6.2.4 are absolute Power Spectral Density (PSD) measurements and thus losses between the RF output port and the spectrum analyzer will have to be taken into account.  The CNPC Link System Radio transmitter UUT RF output power is safely dissipated in the high power attenuator which also provides a proper SWR match to the transmitter.  The variable attenuator optimizes the spectrum analyzers input level for best measurement accuracy. 

## Test Procedure:

1. Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-31. 2. Adjust the variable attenuator to ensure maximum input level without causing 
signal distortion

a. Set the spectrum analyzer reference level offset to the total path loss from 
the output of the transmitter port to the input of the spectrum analyzer. 
b. Set the span to approximately five times the Channel Bandwidth and set 
the number of points to approximately span/1000.  These settings will ensure a bucket size of 1 kHz and will capture the inband and first two adjacent channels. 
c. Set the detector type to Sample. d. Set the Resolution Bandwidth (RBW) to 1 kHz.  The RBW filter should 
be Gaussian with -3dB points equal to RBW. 
e. Set the Video Bandwidth (VBW) to 1 kHz. f. Set the trace type to Max Hold. 
6. Tune the UUT transmit to the middle channel of the frequency band under test. 7. Set the spectrum analyzer center frequency to the same frequency. 8. Command the message generator to generate time varying data messages 
according to Section 2.4.2.2. 
9. Command the UUT to transmit at maximum output power. 10. Reset the trace measurement. 11. After 10 minutes stop the message generator. 12. Command the UUT transmitter off. 13. Verify transmitter mask requirement.

No specific test procedure is required to validate Section 2.2.2.1. 
2.4.3.2.1.1 
Airborne Radio Transmitter Requirements (Section 2.2.2.1.1) 
No specific test procedure is required to validate Section 2.2.2.1.1. 

## 2.4.3.2.1.1.1 Rf Output Power (Section 2.2.2.1.1.1)

This test procedure verifies the transmit output power measured at the CNPC radio UUT antenna interface port. The test procedure will enable the UUT to transmit messages for a duration of 10 seconds. Measurement of the transmit output power is achieved using a power meter that will measure the average power over the full transmit cycle.

## 2.4.3.2.1.1.2 Rf Power Rise Time (Section 2.2.2.1.1.2)

This test procedure verifies transmitter RF power rise and fall times.  Timing measurements are made on the RF envelope of the transmitted waveform eliminating the need for specialized test receiver, or receiver configuration.  The UUT transmitter RF output power is safely dissipated in the power attenuator which also provides a proper SWR match to the UUT transmitter. The RF Diode Detector is used to measure the instantaneous amplitude of the transmitter RF envelope. The RF Signal Generator is used to calibrate the Diode Detector.  The oscilloscope measures the time of rising and falling edges of the RF envelope. Test Procedure: 

1. Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-39. 2. Configure the UUT to transmit messages at the center frequency of the frequency 
band and enable the transmitter. 
3. Configure the oscilloscope to trigger on the rising edge of the RF envelope. Set 
the oscilloscope time base to display a single transmitted burst. 
4. Using the oscilloscope, measure the average voltage over the active portion of the 
transmitted burst. Record the voltage as V100%. 
5. Set the RF switch to the RF signal generator position. 6. Set the RF signal generator frequency to the center of the UUT transmit 
frequency. 
7. Adjust the output power of the RF signal generator until the voltage measured on 
the oscilloscope is equal to V100% (the value recorded in step 4). Record the signal generator output level as P100%. 
8. Reduce the RF signal generator output level by .92 dB and record the voltage as 
V90%. 
9. Reduce the RF signal generator output level to 20 dB below the P100% level set in 
step 7. Measure the voltage on the oscilloscope. Record the voltage as V10%. 
10. Set the RF switch to the UUT position. 11. Adjust the timescale and trigger level to show the rising edge of the RF envelope. 12. Using oscilloscope markers, measure the time difference between voltage V10% 
and V90% (recorded in steps 8 and 9).  This time difference is the RF power rise time. Verify the RF power rise time.  (verifies Section 2.2.2.1.1.2) 
13. Configure the oscilloscope to trigger on the falling edge. 14. Using oscilloscope markers, measure the time difference between voltage V10% 
and V90% (recorded in steps 8 and 9).  Verify the RF power fall time.  (verifies Section 2.2.2.1.1.3) 
 
Pass: The time difference is greater than or equal to 4 symbol periods for data classes 2 and 4 or greater than or equal to 4.5 symbol periods for data classed 1 and 3. 
 
Fail: The time difference is less than 4 symbol periods for data classes 2 and 4 or less than 4.5 symbol periods for data classes 1 and 3.

2.4.3.2.1.1.4 
Load VSWR Capability (Section 2.2.2.1.1.4) 
This procedure verifies that the transmitter is capable of operating into a maximum VSWR of 2.0:1 without degradation in output power or damage to the transmitter. The output power measured at the antenna port of the transmitter will not vary by more than ±10% for a VSWR of 2.0:1. 

The procedure uses the circuit configuration shown in Figure 2-40. This circuit applies a fixed VSWR of 2.0:1 to the transmitter output with a variable reflected phase angle to expose any transmitter susceptibility to the peak voltage of the standing wave. For a VSWR of 2.0:1 the ratio of the forward power (Watts) divided by the reflected power (Watts) is constant 0.111.  If power is expressed in dB (e.g. dBm or dBW), the return power is 9.54 dB below the forward power for a VSWR of 2.0:1. On the FWD and RTN power meters: 1) verify the transmitter output power does not vary by more than 10% (0.1 dB) for all reflected phase angles, 2) verify reflected power remains a constant 9.54 dB (±1 dB) below the forward power for all phase angles. The FWD and RTN power meters should read constant power for all phase shift values. The phase shifter in the test configuration is used to vary the phase difference between the incident and reflected wave. The phase shifter must be adjustable over a minimum 90- degree range. (The initial phase at the transmitter is unknown. The reflected phase value is doubled by the phase shifter since the signal passes through the device twice. 180-degrees of variation is necessary to shift the standing wave through at least one peak and min). 

## Test Procedure

1. Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-40. 2. From the control computer, command the UUT to transmit messages and enable 
the transmitter. 
3. Verify the forward power is 10 Watts ±10% (±0.1 dB). 4. Verify the reflected power is 9.54 dB lower than the forward power. 5. Vary the phase shifter slowly in 5 degree increments up to a 90-degree phase shift. 6. At each 5-degree increment, verify the forward power does not vary by more than 
0.1 -dB (10%) and the reflected power remains is 9.54 -dB ±1dB below the forward power. 
7. Power cycle the UUT. 8. Repeat test procedure to verify that UUT has not been damaged. 
 
Pass: The transmitter is capable of operation into a VSWR of 2.0:1. 
 
Fail: The transmitter is not capable of operation into a VSWR of 2.0:1.

This procedure verifies the transmitter uses a GMSK modulation waveform as defined in Section 2.2.2.1.1.6.  This procedure also verifies the modulation precoding, rate, and distortion.  A Vector Signal Analyzer (VSA) demodulates the waveform, recovers the channel symbols, and searches for a sync pattern.

## Notes:

a. These settings are specific to the Keysight 89600 Vector Signal Analyzer (VSA) 
and will serve as a guide if other VSA analysis software is used. 
b. The channel symbols recovered by the VSA demodulation does not inherently 
remove the precoding (Section 2.2.2.1.6.1), therefore the sync search pattern is the pre coded acquisition bits (Section 2.2.2.3.2).  The first bit of the sync search 
pattern could either be a one or zero depending on the previous state of the precoder. 

c. Alternate procedures and test equipment may be used if the equipment 
manufacturer can show they provide at least equivalent measured performance.

MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System Data Transmission Structures (Section 2.2.2.3) 
The following Verification Procedures utilizes a Data Structure Analyzer, which possesses the capability of acquiring data from multiple sources, translates, analyzes and compares the structure attributes of any segment or message sequence.  The attributes function can be used to view all components of a data structure, disassemble and reassemble all CNPC message types on demand as well as confirm that the specific CNPC Data Class(s) being sent, are received and processed correctly.  If the received data does not translate into what was transmitted, the data transmission test being conducted fails.  All Data Transmission Structure Verification tests are pass-fail based. The Tx Data Port on the UUT transmitter is packaged and encoded data as per the data sequence being verified.  The Rx Data Port on the UUT receiver is the reassembled data structure that should match to the structure being sent for the purpose of this verification testing.  The UUT transmitter will be actively transmitting during the verification, so an appropriate frequency (968MHz/5060MHz), low level, but reliable signal (i.e. -85dBm) with appropriate attenuation (if any) will be used to protect the UUT receiver (not shown in configuration). The RF carrier input will be encoded and modulated by the manufacturer specified modulation and encoding technique.  The user input data rate(s) and associated encoding and modulation rate(s) are also specified by the manufacturer, but must conform to the structure outlined in the CNPC waveform as tested.

## 2.4.3.2.3.6 Crc Error Detection (Section 2.2.2.3.6)

The analysis contained in this section also pertains to the Forward Error Correction, Interleaving and Pseudorandom Overlay sections (Section 2.2.2.3.6 through Section 2.2.2.3.9) Verification of these individual sections cannot be achieved solely through testing since there are no physical inputs, outputs or test points available to test the operation of each individual function.  Overall testing of the functions is obtained by the use of the BTW as described in Section 2.4.2.1.  During the development of the waveform both error free and error messages are sent to test the function of each section.  From testing an analysis is made based on the confirmed test results of the combined outcome of the individual tests. Analysis Process: See Figure 2-49. Verification of the CRC Error Detection function is accomplished by analyzing the CRC functions described in Section 2.2.2.3.6. These functions are then incorporated into a simulation program that emulates the CRC function to create the BTW discussed in Section 2.4.2.1. Emulation of the CRC function and integration of the waveform into a vector signal generator produces the test waveform.  Both error free and error messages can be sent in the waveform to test the CRC Error Detection function. Successful reception and decoding of the test waveform is an indication of the presence and operation of the CRC Error Detection function in the receiver.

## 3 Installed Equipment Performance

This section addresses the performance of the CNPC Link System when installed in a UA 
and its companion Ground location. Appendix G **shall** be consulted for further information.  The purpose of this section and Appendix G is to provide useful considerations regarding CNPC Link System equipment designed to meet this MOPS document when that equipment is installed and used in a UAS. The requirements in this Section are consistent with the requirements contained in Section 2.2. Some CNPC Link System attributes and performance may be affected by factors resulting from the integration into the UAS.  Such factors could include the antenna characteristics, antenna location, space diversity or sources of insertion loss as well as interference, which could affect the CNPC Link System performance. 

## 3.1 Equipment Installation

CNPC Link System equipment selection and installation characteristics **shall** be appropriate for the UAS and location in which it is installed.

## 3.1.2 Failure Protection

Any probable failure of the equipment **shall not** degrade the normal operation of equipment or systems connected to it.  Likewise, the failure of interfaced equipment or systems shall **not** degrade normal operation of this CNPC Link System equipment. 

## 3.1.3 Interference Effects

The CNPC Link System equipment **shall not** be the source of harmful conducted or radiated interference nor be adversely affected by conducted or radiated interference from other equipment or systems installed in the UAS.  Compatibility with the onboard and offboard predicted RF environment surrounding the UAS **shall** be considered by the CNPC Link System manufacturer prior to platform integration. 

Note: Resolution of electromagnetic compatibility problems observed after installation 
of the CNPC Link System into the UAS is the responsibility of the System Integrator. The System Integrator should work with the CNPC Link System manufacturer through the design process. 

## 3.1.3.1 Mutual Suppression

UAS CNPC Link System designs **shall** consider the inclusion of and implication of interfacing to a Mutual Suppression Bus (MSB) depending on the UAS configuration.

It should be considered, that to minimize cable losses (particularly at C Band), distances between the RF electronics and antennas be kept short. As described in Appendix L, for C and L Band operation a directional GRS antenna **shall** be used. 

## 3.2.1.2 Antenna Cable And Vswr

The RF cable used **shall** have impedance, power handling, and loss characteristics in accordance with the CNPC Link System manufacturer's specifications and distance between the RF electronics and the antenna(s).  The cable loss **shall** be measured and recorded. 

The VSWR, as seen through the RF cable to the antenna **shall** not exceed the CNPC Link System manufacturer's maximum VSWR specification.  In any event the VSWR should be less than 2.0:1 over the operating frequency band used. 

## 3.2.1.3 Antenna Polarization

The CNPC Link System antennas **shall** be polarized to meet the system's best performance.  Consideration should be given to the use of circular polarization.

Intended function 
Typically, a user defined objective applied to the UAS, or any of its subsystems including the aircraft, control 
station, data link, or any of their subsystems or components.  In the context of UAS, intended function refers to the ability to provide under any operating conditions the tasks necessary for safe flight, navigation, and communication.  For components not necessary or not related to safe flight, navigation, or communication, the intended function could simply be noninterference with functions required for reliable and safe flight, navigation and communication.  For example, a camera installed for aerial photography must not interfere with UAV flight control, navigation or communication.  While the FAA 
has no interest in camera's ability take pictures it is 
necessary that the intended function is understood. There are also systems such as laser, some types of radar or lighting that while not required for safe flight may be subject to specific requirements.  These type systems are a concern for both manned and unmanned aircraft and a higher level policy may be necessary to address this issue.

## Appendix C L Band And C Band Relationship C.1 Scope

This Appendix addresses systems-engineering issues associated with the relationship between terrestrial CNPC usage of the 960–1164 MHz band ("L Band") and its usage of the 5030–5091 MHz band ("C Band").  These tasks were defined in the RTCA SC-228 Terms of Reference and reiterated in Section 1 of the SC-228 Command and Control (C2) Data Link White Paper, RTCA Paper No. 075-14/PMC-1201: 

 
Evaluate potential for sharing waveform structure between L Band and C Band solutions to reduce certification [cost/complexity]. 
 
Evaluate potential/value of simultaneous operation of L Band and C Band to improve system performance.   
 
Evaluate potential/value of physical integration of L Band and C Band into a common radio for SWAP advantage.  Or do we have L Band alone, and joint L Band/C Band variant?  Small UAS may need L Band alone, larger UAS will need both and might want a single LRU.   
Section 1 of the White Paper also raised the question of whether a single MOPS document would be preferable to the approach of two separate MOPS for L Band and C Band. However, Section 9.3 of the White Paper appears to have resolved that issue in favor of a single MOPS, and so it will not be considered further in this Appendix.   

## C.2 Frequency Allocations

Recent World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) have granted non-exclusive L Band and C Band allocations in the 960–1164 and 5030–5091 MHz frequency ranges to the aeronautical mobile (route) service (AM(R)S).  That service supports terrestrial (nonsatellite) air/ground radio links. In the United States, although not in Europe, UAS CNPC Link Systems are the only AM(R)S activity now being seriously contemplated for either of those bands.  However, competing non-AM(R)S uses also exist for both bands, as discussed below.  (Further information on the allocations can be found in the Final Acts of the 2007 and 2012 WRCs.) 

## C.3 Band Characteristics

The most important differences between L Band and C Band for air/ground radio communications are: 

 
For any given values of transmitter power and antenna sizes, communication is possible at substantially longer ranges in L Band than in C Band. 
 
C Band is much less spectrally congested and is likely to have considerably more spectrum available for terrestrial CNPC. 

## C.3.1 Propagation Characteristics

The radio-wave propagation characteristics of L Band are more favorable to CNPC Link Systems than those of C Band.  Free-space link budgets show a 14 dB higher loss in C Band, potentially requiring (as demonstrated in the link budgets in RTCA Paper SC203- CC019) the use of steerable directional antennas either on the ground or on the UA to close a C Band CNPC link at ranges longer than a few nautical miles.  (No such requirement appears to exist in L Band.) Also, Doppler shifts are five times greater in C Band. 

 
Fading resulting from multipath propagation is prevalent in both bands and can seriously degrade link availability.  Frequency diversity (sending messages simultaneously in both L Band and C Band) can be a way to ensure that there are two paths with statistically independent fading mechanisms, thereby improving link availability.  Unlike time diversity techniques, this method would not involve an increase in transaction time. 

## C.3.2 Antenna Characteristics

Because wavelengths are five times as large in L Band as in C Band, antennas in L Band generally require linear dimensions about five times as great as those of their C Band counterparts to achieve comparable values of directive gain.  This is an advantage for C Band that in many circumstances significantly compensates for C Band's propagation-loss disadvantage.  

## C.3.3 Spectrum Congestion

The 5030–5091 MHz C Band frequency range is currently empty except for the little-used Microwave Landing System (MLS).  The aeronautical mobile-satellite (route) service (AMS(R)S) also has an allocation in this band; at least one European company has shown interest in using it, but no system has yet been deployed or funded.  UAS CNPC is the only terrestrial or satellite communications activity known to be under consideration in this band. In the U.S. and Europe, the 960–1164 MHz L Band frequency range is already heavily utilized by preexisting radio-frequency (RF) systems.  RTCA Paper SC203-CC021 provides an overview of those systems and analyzes their potential interactions with CNPC.  The systems include Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), secondary surveillance radar (SSR), 1090-MHz Extended Squitter (1090ES), the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), the Universal Access Transceiver (UAT), and the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS). 

## C.4 Sharing Waveform Structure Between L Band And C Band

Waveforms and channelization schemes for L Band and C Band CNPC should be made as consistent as possible to reduce certification cost and also to facilitate simulcasting for frequency diversity, in case that proves to be necessary to meet availability requirements. However, the higher Doppler shifts and oscillator frequency inaccuracies in C Band might be somewhat problematic for narrowband signals in narrow channels, so it might be necessary to have slightly larger channel widths in C-band.  Also, it is possible that future propagation testing could reveal important differences in multipath characteristics between the two bands that would require some differences in modulation types. 

## C.5 Coordinated Use Of L Band And C Band C.5.1 Unrestricted Use Of Bands

Proposals have been advanced in the past for limiting L Band or C Band CNPC to particular airspace domains, UA sizes, or link directions.  Some of those proposals are listed below: 

 
Some have suggested that C Band is best suited for an airport environment, where propagation losses are small, aircraft densities are high, and individual data demands (e.g., video for taxiing) may also be high. 
 

 
Others have proposed that C Band should be used at low altitudes, where radio horizons are relatively close and larger numbers of aircraft might be more easily accommodated through high-frequency-reuse strategies enabled by closer radio horizons. 
 
Still others have advised that C Band be limited to larger UA, whose CNPC links may have higher availability requirements and which, being less SWAP-limited, will be better able to carry the higher-power transmitters and/or directional antennas that may be needed to meet those requirements. 
 
The fact that more spectrum is likely to be usable in C Band has led some to advocate that L Band be used only for the relatively narrowband uplinks and C Band only for the generally more wideband downlinks.  The wide frequency separation between the two bands would facilitate this sort of frequency-division duplexing. 
 
The larger amount of usable spectrum in C Band has also led to suggestions that, even if uplinking and downlinking are both permitted in both bands, video downlinking should be allowed only in C Band in order to conserve the relatively scarce L Band spectrum. 
While all of the foregoing proposals have merit, the following considerations tend to argue against mandating unnecessary restrictions on the use of either band: 

1. The existing terrestrial spectral assets in L Band and C Band constitute a fixed 
resource that is very unlikely to be augmented in the foreseeable future. 
2. The geographical, altitude, and size distributions of future UA populations cannot be 
forecast with any certainty and will undoubtedly change over time. 
3. Relative uplink and downlink traffic loads, and the contribution of video to downlink 
loading, are also difficult to predict and subject to change. 
4. Because of L Band spectral congestion and the uncertain future of AMS(R)S 
(satellite) C Band for CNPC applications, the respective amounts of spectrum in L Band and C Band for terrestrial CNPC links are also apt to change unpredictably over time. 
5. Restricting any part of existing spectrum to a particular part of the UA population, or 
to one link direction, will tend to create spectrum shortages in other subsets of the population or the other link direction. 
6. Usable L Band spectrum is unlikely to be able to carry all the non-airport, higheraltitude, small-UA, or uplink traffic, so C Band must be allowed to share the burden. 
7. Little if any L Band spectrum is likely to be usable by CNPC links in Europe because 
a different AM(R)S application, the L Band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), is under intensive consideration there, so unidirectional CNPC link use of C Band would not meet international harmonization requirements. 
8. Placing artificial restrictions on the use of either L Band or C Band CNPC spectrum 
would unnecessarily limit the flexibility of system designers and users in devising methods for overcoming local and system-wide spectrum shortages. 
9. Many situations are likely to arise in which messages will need to be transmitted 
simultaneously in both bands, in the same directions, to achieve the frequency diversity needed for sufficient link availability. 
Consequently, the use of L Band and C Band for CNPC links in all airspace domains, at all altitudes, in both directions, and for all purposes should be allowed, provided that 
 
adequate frequency-planning criteria are developed and applied.  This will maximize the flexibility of the system (and its designers and users) to adapt to future changes in the spatial and size distributions of future UA populations, the relative traffic loads of CNPC uplinks and downlinks, and the amounts of usable spectrum in L Band and C Band for CNPC link applications.  It will also allow international harmonization and simultaneous L/C Band message transmission. 

## C.5.2 Simultaneous Message Transmission In L Band And C Band

The frequency diversity achievable by simultaneous message transmission is an important means of enhancing link availability.  Since multipath fading typically occurs independently over a given propagation path in L Band and C Band, link availability can be increased if the same message is transmitted simultaneously by a CNPC Link System airborne or ground radio in both bands.  This will be especially important if very high availability numbers become necessary to meet stringent requirements for uplinked control messages and/or downlinked DAA target-track messages. Accordingly, simultaneous message transmission in both bands by individual CNPC Link System airborne or ground radios could be used whenever necessary for higher link availability. 

## C.6 Physical Integration Of L Band And C Band Radios

Combining L Band and C Band CNPC functionality into a single airborne radio has obvious SWAP advantages if both bands are to be used by a given UAS.  On the other hand, some small UA may be unable to carry a radio capable of operating in both bands, and the owners of those UA may not want to incur the additional expense.  Consequently, physical integration of the two bands in a single radio should be allowed but not required. The MOPS may specify separate classes of ground and airborne CNPC Link System radios (L Band, C Band, and dual-band) that can be selected and built as needed for a particular application.   

## C.7 Conclusions

1. Waveforms and channelization schemes for L Band and C Band should be made as 
consistent as possible to facilitate simulcasting for frequency diversity, in case that proves to be necessary to meet availability requirements. 
2. If the nationwide system uses synchronized TDD, the L Band and C Band frames 
should be aligned and synchronized with each other (rather than operating independently) in order to help protect collocated L Band and C Band radios against mutual co-site RFI. 
3. The use of L Band and C Band in all airspace domains, at all altitudes, in both 
directions, and for all purposes should be allowed, provided that adequate frequencyplanning criteria are developed and applied. 
4. Simultaneous transmissions of the same message in L Band and C Band by individual 
CNPC Link System airborne or ground radios could be used whenever necessary to achieve the redundancy needed for adequate link availability. 
 

## Appendix D Security Considerations D.1 Scope And Intent

While security touches every facet of the CNPC Link System (development and integration processes, architecture, maintenance and monitoring), the security requirements of this MOPS appendix specifically target the communications security needed to maintain a resilient air-ground communications infrastructure between an UA and its PS more specifically in the context of this MOPS between the CNPC Airborne Radio System (ARS) and the CNPC Ground Radio System (GRS).  Communications Security is a subset of Information Security targeting the security of the data in transit. Only communications security above the physical protocol layer (RF) is addressed in this appendix as ATC procedures and the Lost CNPC Link protocol will address risks to the physical layer. The RTCA Special Committee 228 (SC-228) security subcommittee was tasked to identify security risks associated with the operation of an example CNPC Link System supporting the operation of an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) in the National Airspace System (NAS) and to provide mitigating controls to reduce the level of impact those risks pose to the NAS. This MOPS appendix lays out the minimal security framework for implementing communication security controls.  Two reference architectures are described: 

1) Direct Access 2) Networked Access 
These architectures differ by the existence or lack of an intermediary network. The 'Direct' communications link architecture involves the PS communicating unassisted with the UA via the GRS and ARS.  The 'Networked' architecture provides a terrestrial and RF access network supporting end-to-end connectivity and mobility of the ARS and UA.  The security of non-CNPC systems that interact directly with the UAS (e.g., ADS-B, GPS, CPDLC, and VHF voice communications between ATC/ATS and the aircraft) are considered outside the scope of this security framework and will need to be addressed in other forums. This Appendix will provide an example of how to implement security mechanisms for both the direct access and networked access architectures that will meet the security requirements identified in normative section of the SC-228 CNPC MOPS. SC-228 is sensitive to maintaining a balance between developing real and meaningful security requirements in light of the fact that the perceived systems to which they pertain (i.e., the Access architecture) do not yet exist.  The goal of this appendix is to provide end system implementers the needed, minimum protocol-related security requirements such that future networks and related technologies are readily able to adopt technologies needed to meet and maintain an acceptable security stance.  In practice, direct and network architectures continuously evolve just as today's GSM and CDMA cellular phone network infrastructures.  Anticipating an evolutionary UAS CNPC communications market and infrastructure, the associated security controls described herein will likewise need to be adopted, adapted and deployed incrementally. 

 

## D.2 Introduction

The UAS CNPC Link System provides bidirectional connectivity between the GRS/PS on the ground and the ARS located on the UA.  The link is designed to provide the PIC the communications necessary to safely and securely operate the UA within the National Airspace System (NAS). The UA differs from manned aircraft safety and security by the fact that the PIC is not located on the aircraft, but is securely operating, sending commands and monitoring the UA's health and mission status remotely from the remote location.  As such, the CNPC 
Link System must provide sufficient trust, availability and quality of service for the ground PIC to maintain the requisite situation awareness and command authority necessary to safely operate the aircraft.  Security is of paramount importance. 

## Communications Security Services

Communications security addresses the protections of such data while in transit.  The generalized security services are:  

 
Peer Entity Authentication - This service provides corroboration that the peer entity is the claimed entity. 
 
Data Origin Authentication - This service provides corroboration that the source of the data is the claimed peer. 
 
Data Integrity - This service provides for the integrity of transmitted data and detects any modification, insertion, deletion or replay of data. 
 
Data Confidentiality - This service provides for the confidentiality of transmitted data. 
 
Access Control - This service provides protection against unauthorized use of resources. 
The body of this MOPS appendix specifies that end-to-end communications between the ARS/UA and GRS/PS whether via direct access or networked access provide: peer entity authentication, data origin authentication, data integrity, and data confidentiality.  As also identified in 2.1.12, networked access, control plane traffic requires additionally to be protected by: peer entity authentication, data origin authentication, data integrity, and access control. 

## D.4 System Description D.4.1 Description Of Reference Architectures

Two reference architectures are developed to establish end-to-end connectivity between PIC on the ground and the UA they control.  Prior to distinguishing the system architectures, the system components common to each are described. 

## D.4.1.1 Common Architectural Components D.4.1.1.1 Cnpc Pilot Station

All traffic - data, commands and status - ingress and egress the CNPC link at the GRS/CE/PS location.  The PIC of the UA is located at the PS and is responsible for command, control and monitoring of the UA.  Using PS resources, the PIC sends commands, receives status and processes data with the UA over the CNPC link via the GRS and ARS. 

 
While the PS may, in practice be mobile or distributed in a non-point-to-point manner, this appendix focuses on the security aspects of a GRS that is in a fixed ground location. In this simplified configuration, the GRS/PS may connect to the ARS on the UA using one of the two following configurations: 

1) Direct Access (simple, direct connectivity between the GRS/PS and ARS/UA) 2) Networked Access (intermediary network facilitating non-locality of the PS and 
mobility of the UA and ARS) 

## D.4.1.1.2 Cnpc Airborne Radio System (Ars)

The ARS on the UA is the 'mobile station' in the reference architectures.  In the simple Direct Access architecture, the aircraft's mobility is confined to a geographic area served by a single ground-based GRS radio.  Otherwise, it is connected by an intermediary CNPC network supporting broader mobility. The UA carries the CNPC Airborne Radio System connecting (directly or indirectly) the aircraft with its associated GRS and Pilot Station (s).  All link and network layer processing may be performed in the ARS, or the ARS may forward network layer data to backend communication systems for processing.  This addendum considers security at the following layers: 

1) Link (MAC Layer) 2) Network (Internet Protocol) 
Security best practices recommend that security protection be implemented at all OSI layers whenever possible. 

 

## D.5 Direct Access D.5.1 Description

The Direct Access architecture provides the UAS operator direct access to the RF 
transmission/reception medium for communications with the UA and allows the operator full control of the end-to-end security.  The security assumptions are: 

1) The UAS operator has direct access to the Ground Radio System (GRS). 2) No intermediary networks are required for access. 3) If the GRS is not co-located with the PS, then it is assumed that there is a secure, 
bi-directional connection or physical infrastructure linking the PS to the GRS. 
This architecture is most applicable to UAS operators performing missions where mobility is confined to smaller, fixed geographic regions where a single GRS suffices.  The GRS is under the control of the UAS operator. The elements of this architecture include: 

 
The GRS 
 
The ARS 

## D.5.2 Example Direct Access Security - Ipsec

Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) [1] may be used to provide end-to-end security in the direct access architecture.  IPsec is a security extension to the Internet Protocol (IP) that provides end-to-end security protection of network layer traffic in a standard fashion.  It allows for mutual authentication of nodes, negotiation of cryptographic algorithms, establishment of keys for a communication session, and periodic update of keys used during an ongoing session.  Mechanisms are available to provide confidentiality, data integrity, data-origin authentication, non-repudiation, and anti-replay capabilities.  IPsec can be used in two different modes: transport, which protects data communications between two hosts, and tunnel which protects communications between two gateways allowing for secure communications between one or more hosts on each side of the tunnel. In addition, IPsec offers transport and tunnel mode with two protocols: Authentication Headers (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP).  For the direct access architecture ESP transport mode is assumed. Alternatives to IPsec for the direct access case include using: 

1) IEEE 802.16/WiMAX [2][3] security with encryption of user plane traffic or 2) Application layer security applied directly to user messages. 

## D.6 Networked Access D.6.1 Description

The second architecture is comprised of an intermediary network called the CNPC Internetwork.  In the Networked Access, the security requirements are discussed relative to the following CNPC Link System segments: 

 
PS to the CNPC Internetwork and subsequently to the GRS in the Access Network 
 
ARS on the UA to CNPC Internetwork (via the CNPC Access Network) 
The PS and UA represent the end-to-end communication points.  The CNPC Internetwork is introduced to support connectivity to a widely distributed set of Ground Radio Systems 
 
instead of a single one - as stated in the direct connect architecture.  While some UAS operators may establish similar complex architectures, this MOPS appendix assumes the CNPC network is a 3rd party system outside of the control of the UAS operator. 

 
The CNPC Internetwork between the PS and the CNPC Access Network may 
consist of various private and public networks (including the Internet) which represent a variety of threat sources. Secure access (either VPN tunneling or dedicated, private leased line) between the PS and CNPC Access Network will protect against external network threats. 
In the CNPC network access, both the PS and ARS must first securely access the GRS on the CNPC Access Network (via leased line, terrestrial or RF gateway) in order to establish a network route between the ground and air.  Once the ARS and its PS authenticate to the CNPC Inter and Access Network, an end-to-end network routing domain is made available to support the CNPC Link for the duration of flight operations. The CNPC Access Network provides the radio access portion of the overall connection. All Ground Radio Systems, base station control, and RF-side gateways are provided from the CNPC Access Network. 

## Reference Architecture

The networked CNPC Control and Communications architecture described in this appendix is a reference implementation comprised of interconnected GRSs that may or may not be owned by a single entity.  A standards-based layer 2 access network (WiMAX) and layer 3 inter-network (IPv6) is utilized to take advantage of the widespread availability of off-the-shelf commercial network devices and general-purpose computers. 

## D.6.3 Layer 2 Access Network

For layer 2 processing mobile WiMAX [3] is selected as the example CNPC Access Network.  Figure D-2 depicts layer 2 handover across base stations in a WiMAX Access Service Network (ASN).  In the WiMAX network architecture there are one or more ASNs operated by one or more Network Access Providers (NAP).  The ASNs are connected to a Connectivity Service Network (CSN) operated by a Network Service Provider (NSP).  The anchor component in the CSN will vary depending on type of layer 3 handover supported.  If Mobile IP is used, a Home Agent (HA) is present.  If Proxy Mobile IP is used, a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) is present.  If layer 3 handover is not supported, WiMAX defines a CSN architecture called "Simple IP" and a Core Router is present in the CSN. 

## D.6.4 Layer 2 Security

When a mobile station initially enters a WiMAX Access Network it performs authentication using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [4].  If EAP is successful, the mobile station is authorized entry into the access network.  The EAP protocol results in a Master Session Key (MSK) which in turn is used to derive an Authorization Key (AK) which in turn is used to derive Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) uplink and downlink keys [1].  Subsequently, control plane messages are data origin authentication and data integrity protected by a CMAC authentication tag. It is important to note that EAP is only performed on initial access network entry.  The security context is maintained across handoffs to base stations in the same ASN and may even be maintained across handoffs to another ASN operated by the same NSP. 

## D.6.5 Layer 3 Inter-Network D.6.5.1 Mobile Ipv6

For layer 3 processing Mobile IPv6 [5] is selected as the example CNPC Internetworking and mobility management technology1.  Figure D-3 depicts the handover process using Mobile IPv6 as the layer 3 mobility management approach to deal with handovers across ASN's belonging to different NSP's. 

 
The Mobile IPv6 design allows the aircraft to maintain network-layer communications between the GRS and the UA's ARS mobile router as the unmanned aircraft transitions between Ground Radio Systems in ASNs belonging to different NSPs. The UA's ARS Mobile Router (MR) starts the network configuration process after the layer 2 connection is established.  Then the Home Agent (HA) that is connected to the PS router sends a Routing Advertisement (RA) via the CNPC Ground Radio to the ARS's MR which, using the RA, creates a Care-of Address (CoA) providing the ARS's MR with a global address that allows communication back to the HA and consequently the PS.  The ARS's MR then sends a Binding Update (BU) that contains the ARS MR's Home Address (HoA) and CoA to the HA, providing the HA with ARS MR's latest point of attachment to the network.  The HoA is a global address from the home network address space and is used by the HA to identify the ARS's MR.  After authenticating the BU, the HA replies with a Binding Acknowledgement (BA) and creates an IPv6 dynamic tunnel between the PS's router and the ARS's MR via the HA. 

 
As an example, when a message is initiated from the Correspondent Node (PS router), it has a destination address in the Avionics Network behind the MR (located aboard the UA).  Due to the HA advertising this address space any traffic intended for an address on or behind the MR will always be routed to the HA first and then be tunneled to the MR.  
The HA's advertising of this address space eliminates the need for and delay of routing table updates from the ground radio system network that are usually needed when a router changes its point of attachment to a network.   

## D.6.5.2 Ipv6-Ipv4 Internetworking

In a deployed production environment, communication between endpoints could utilize IPv6 end-to-end, without the need for any encapsulation of traffic within legacy IPv4 packets for transmission across the Internet.  If end-to-end IPv6 connectivity is not available in early deployments, a combination of IPv6-aware and IPv4-only network service providers could be used to connect PS to the Internetwork. In order to emulate a native end-to-end IPv6 environment, "6in4" (IP Protocol 41) tunnels can be created between the PS and the GRS to allow for utilization of the readily available commercial IPv4 backhaul communications networks.  The network and the Ground Radio Systems can each be protected by a dedicated firewall system that serves as both an IPv6 or IPv4 network firewall as well as a VPN gateway to secure the transmission of data across the Internet. 

## D.6.5.3 Robust Header Compression (Rohc)

Robust Header Compression (ROHC) is a mature specification based on a lengthy history of experiments to reduce the overhead of network protocol headers.  There has been significant interest in compressing headers in situations where communication links have limited capacity and where the ratio of header to payload is large. In the UAS CNPC Link System waveform, reducing this overhead is of critical importance.  The anticipated nature of this communication will be a large number of relatively short messages, each message with an associated set of protocol headers.  There is a degree of real-time sensitivity - the traffic should be moved forward expeditiously. The headers themselves will be large and there will be multiple "nested" headers (i.e., extension headers). The ROHC specification defines a process that will - under ideal circumstances, compress the IPv6 header, including all the extensions that must be used in the architecture, in most of the messages (most of the packets) to one or two bytes.  It does this by removing invariant components in the header and providing ways to enable the de-compressor to anticipate predictable components (fields), obviating the need to pass those fields across the communication link. In the ROHC specification, in addition to the framework specification, there are several protocol specific specifications or profiles.  The objective of each profile is to identify protocol header field's particular to that protocol to optimally compress it.  In an implementation the state of a "session" is maintained between the two pair of ROHC compressor and ROHC de-compressor operating at the two endpoints.  For header fields that are invariant between packets (for instance source and destination addresses), that information need only be communicated once.  All subsequent packets that are part of that "stream" can omit that information.  Similarly, for some other fields that change predictably (for instance counters), the information need only be communicated once.  For fields that change rarely, the compressor need only communicate when that field changes. In this latter case, a single packet will be slightly larger (but still far smaller than an entire uncompressed header packet).  The ROHC profiles try hard to minimize overhead, and for some protocols are elaborate and complex. For the reference architecture to provide secure transmission over the CNPC Control and Communications network while maximizing the capability of ROHC to compress as much of the header stack as possible, IPsec ESP transport mode is utilized to transmit packets between the CN (behind the HA) and the MR or other destination aboard the UA. 

## D.6.6 Layer 3 Security

The end-to-end security example in the networked access architecture is IPsec just as in the direct access architecture.  In addition to protecting user traffic, when Mobile IP is used there is a requirement to protect the binding updates and binding acknowledgements. Although standard Mobile IPv6 requires using IPsec to protect Mobile IP traffic, the 
 
WiMAX forum has selected the "Authentication Protocol for Mobil IPv6" [6] as an alternate method for securing MIPv6 signaling messages between Mobile Nodes and Home Agents.  The alternate method consists of a MIPv6-specific mobility message authentication option that can be added directly to MIPv6 signaling messages. 

## D.7 Cryptographic Overhead

This section contains the layer 2 per-frame security overhead for control-plane traffic associated with the network access architecture, the per-packet/message end-to-end security overhead associated with both the direct and network access architectures, and the layer 3 per-packet control-plane traffic security overhead associated with Mobile IPv6 signaling traffic in the network access architecture. The layer 2 per-frame security overhead for control-plane traffic consists of an authentication tag which is added to each frame associated with protocol management traffic.  User-plane traffic carrying CNPC Link informational messages is not expected to carry a layer 2 authentication tag as it will be protected end-to-end with security at a higher layer.  The authentication tag may be computed using a Keyed- Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) or a Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC). In either case the layer 2 per-frame security overhead for a 64-bit tag is as follows: 

a) Layer 2 Authentication overhead - 8 bytes 
The per-packet end-to-end security overhead may be based on authenticated encryption applied via IPsec at layer 3 or may be applied directly to application messages.  A recommended authenticated encryption algorithm is at least 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) operation with 64-bit authentication tags resulting in the following security overhead: 

b) AES-GCM Message Level overhead - 8 bytes for the Initialization Vector, 0-3 
bytes of Padding, and 8 bytes of Authentication Data for a total of 16-19 bytes 
c) AES-GCM with IPsec ESP Transport Mode Layer 3 overhead - Message Level 
overhead plus 2 bytes of Padding Length/Next Header for a total of 18-21 bytes. 
The layer 3 per-packet control-plane traffic associated with Mobile IPv6 signaling may also be secured using IPsec [10] in which case the security overhead would be the same as c) above. Note that the above per-frame, per-packet, and per-message overheads are in addition to the one-time overheads associated with dynamic session key establishment, e.g., using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for networked access or the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocols for layer 3 sessions.  The overhead associated with these dynamic session key establishment protocols can be quite large since they typically involve the exchange of Public Key Certificates which are on the order of 2-4 kbytes for RSA-based certificates and about 400 bytes for certificates based upon Elliptic Curve cryptography. When employing dynamic session keys, it is also recommended to periodically renegotiate the session key after some elapsed period of time, or number of bytes transferred, in order to thwart adversaries from cracking the key by intercepting and analyzing over-the-air traffic.  Session key re-negotiation typically requires the transmission of much less traffic than is exchanged during the initial session setup and authentication phase.   
The need for dynamic session key establishment will depend on the UA's relationship with the Access Service Network provider, the Connectivity Service Network provider, and/or the Pilot Station itself.  In certain cases, this may be a completely private operation in which case pre-shared keys may be employed and loaded on the UA before flight.

## Appendix E Video Considerations In Civil Airspace For Unmanned Aircraft Operations E.1 Introduction

Pilot's responsiveness to visual cues is a tacit and integral assumption of current manned aircraft operations in civil airspace.  In fact, manned aircraft pilot licensing includes a requirement for color blindness and vision acuity testing (14 CFR 67.103, 67.203). Examples of functions that require the manned aircraft pilot to respond to visual cues include seeing and responding to light signals (14 CFR 91.125) signs and marking aids (AIM 2-3-1) when maneuvering on the ground, seeing and avoiding other aircraft and obstacles during flight (14 CFR 91.113) and, prior to touch down, seeing the runway environment (14 CFR 91.175), above a prescribed altitude, so as to make a decision to continue to landing or abort. For unmanned aircraft it would be technically possible to deliver a similar quality of visual cues to the remote unmanned aircraft pilot; however, this would require very large amounts of data to be transmitted from the aircraft due to the detail required in the images and the high update rate/low latency required in time sensitive situations.  Sending this amount of data would require a correspondingly large amount of RF bandwidth (in the order of 10's of MHz) per aircraft, which is impractical for a number of reasons; in the case of the CNPC Link System it is not practical because of the limited amount of RF spectrum that has been assigned to this UAS safety service. This Appendix describes the process used by SC-228 to determine the minimum data rate required per aircraft to support the transmission, to the remote unmanned pilot, of the minimum visual cues necessary for safe operation.  This assessment does not imply that every UA will need video if it can be shown that the desired operations can be carried out safely without it.  However, if the designer chooses to use video then the information contained in this Appendix can be used to assist in the design and certification of a UAS employing video. RTCA SC-228 chose a four step process to assess the required video and corresponding data rate: 

 
Step 1.  Assess current regulations, policies and manned aircraft piloting practice to identify visual requirements. 
 
Step 2.  Determine if video is the most appropriate technique to satisfy the agreed visual requirements from Step 1. 
 
Step 3.  Perform a safety assessment, as part of the overall safety case, to determine, after applying appropriate mitigation, the criticality of the loss of the function supporting the visual cue responses identified as required in Step 2. 
 
Step 4.  Determine the video performance (resolution and frame rate etc.) and the consequent data rate required to support the video identified as critical for safe operation in step 3. 
The details of the assessments for each step are captured in Table E-1 Video Considerations Assessment at the end of this Appendix.  What follows is an overview.   

## E.2 Step 1 - Identifying Visual Requirements

The FAA UAS ConOps, FAA operations regulations related to flying under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) (e.g., 14 CFR 91.175), the definitions of different IFR approaches and their information requirements, certification regulations describing flight deck equipment required for IFR operations and associated FAA Advisory Circulars and orders and notices were used to identify a total of twenty-five pilot tasks that require the pilot to use or respond to visual cues from outside of the aircraft.  Table E-1 shows these pilot tasks and associated visual information requirements organized against four flight phases: 

 
Navigation on Ground (taxi) 
Ensuring the aircraft stays in appropriate surface areas, follows appropriate signs and indicators, navigates in reference to other aircraft, ground facilities, equipment and personnel and ensuring the aircraft navigates to the correct take of positon. 

 
Takeoff 
Ensuring the aircraft is on the correct runway and it is clear, that the approach and departure airspace is clear, ensuring the aircraft is in the appropriate takeoff position, monitoring the runway and departure airspace during takeoff, remaining well-clear from obstacles and terrain. 

## Enroute

Identifying the presence of ice and onboard emergencies (e.g. fire or smoke) avoiding severe weather, maintaining awareness of aircraft location and state, navigating in reference to other aircraft, ensuring the aircraft maintains a safe separation from other aircraft obstacles and terrain, making a decision to land or ditch, selecting an appropriate off airport emergency landing location. 

 
Approach and Landing 
Making the decision to continue to land or abort the approach, ensuring the aircraft is approaching and appropriately oriented to the correct runway and will land in the correct location on the runway, monitoring the planned approach airspace and runway to ensure they are clear, remaining well-clear from aircraft obstacles and terrain. Common themes emerged from the above analysis; the requirements to maneuver using visual references, to use visual cues to monitor airspace, to use visual cues to ensure separation from obstacles and terrain and to use visual cues in deciding to continue a landing or make an emergency landing and in selecting an emergency landing site. 

## E.3 Step 2 - Is Video The Most Appropriate Technique To Support The Function?

Each of the twenty-five requirements were assessed to see if alternate approaches, other than sending video to the pilot, were appropriate.  The following categorizations were used: 

 
No other (non-video) solution is suitable. 
 
Video is one of the best of the available solutions. 
 
Other (non-video) solutions are adequate. 
Ground-based video cameras were considered as well as ground observers and ASDE-X with Multilateration or other surface detection equipment for ground operation as well as buried cables and RF tags to provide signage and control light inputs to the UA.  For airborne operation, chase planes, Detect and Avoid, TCAS and ADS-B were considered along with conventional aircraft sensors, instrumentation and weather radar.  During approach and landing (in addition to ground observers and cameras) digital maps, CAT III landing systems and UAS automatic landing systems were considered.  Synthetic video was also considered for all of the phases of flight being assessed. Both airport and airspace scenarios were considered; airport attributes and airspace classes were used as contexts.  The airport attributes that were considered included: 

 
Busy - Real-time input directly to the pilot is important on a busy airport to 
maintain safety and efficiency. 
 
Complex - A complex surface environment requires negotiation of taxiways and 
runways and observing signs and markings. 
 
ATC Tower - May not have an impact on need for video.  Presence of a tower 
may correlate with "Busy" airport. 
 
Manned Aircraft Present - Mixing with manned traffic does not allow for 
unique unmanned solutions. 
The airspaces were grouped to reduce the number of combinations that needed to be assessed by associating airspaces with similar visual needs: 

Type 1 - Class A airspace Type 2 - Class B, C and D airspace Type 3 - Class E and G airspace 
In only one case, the rare occasion of landing or ditching at emergency or flight termination sites, the assessment concluded that No other (non-video) solution is suitable. For avoiding obstacles and terrain, video (possibly in combination with other approaches) would be the preferred solution for low altitude Enroute operation; however, the effect on RLOS CNPC Link System availability of low altitude operation should be taken into consideration during design and certification.  Additionally, alternative approaches were not necessarily always available e.g., ASDE-X would not be available at rural airports or ground observers at emergency landing sites.  Using alternates to video may also require additional technology to be installed at airports to support unmanned operations and smaller UA may not be able to accommodate the required technology.  Although ground observers are suitable to meet all requirements in the Navigation on the Ground, Takeoff and Approach and Landing phases they were not felt appropriate for routine use at Busy, Complex airports with Manned Aircraft Present. Unless 14 CFR 91.175 is modified to allow UAS civil airspace integration without video, CAT III systems could provide landing capabilities without video but they would need to be installed at all designated UAS landing sites and the UA would have to carry CAT III ILS/MLS etc. equipage.  It should be noted that UAS unique automatic landing systems were considered to only provide precise landing positon not the additional visual aspects that 14 CFR 91.175 requires. It was determined that the majority of normal Enroute requirements would be better satisfied by using other approaches and not using video but that visual cues would still be necessary during emergency landings. 

## E.4 Step 3 - Safety Assessments

Assessments were performed to determine if the mitigated loss of any one of the twentyfive functions had either the potential to cause minor or no injury or property damage or the potential to cause major or worse injury or property damage.  If a major assessment was determined, then the video would need to be carried in UAS safety spectrum. When the aircraft is travelling at speeds below that required for flight it was determined that simply stopping the aircraft was a safe mitigation.  Although disruptive to efficient operation, doing so was assessed no worse than stopping a manned aircraft that was experiencing operational problems. When airborne it was determined that using visual cues for detecting ice and emergencies was not going to be as effective as using aircraft sensors and instruments so video analysis for this requirement was not performed. During Approach and Landing it was additionally determined that 14 CFR 91.175 requirements were effectively "fail-safe" so that if the pilot could not see the visual references then the landing attempt would be aborted.  However eventually the aircraft must always land, under these circumstances two conditions could exist: 

1) The aircraft had adequate flight performance to land at an airport equipped for 
UAS. 
2) The aircraft did not have adequate flight performance to land at an airport 
equipped for UAS. 
In case (1) it was determined that there would be adequate time for a ground observer and or chase plane to be deployed and that ATC could support airspace clearance to provide adequate mitigation.  In case (2) however it was assessed that there would not be enough time to deploy any mitigation and that without video the UA pilot could not make an assessment of a suitable landing or flight termination site so the loss of the function had the potential to cause major or worse injury or property damage. Additionally, since it is not anticipated that Detect and Avoid will cover the case of remaining well-clear of non-transponder equipped objects (towers, buildings, small aerial objects etc.) and terrain that loss of visual cues particularly during low altitude operation would lead to the potential to cause major or worse injury or property damage.   

## E.5 Step 4 - Required Video Performance And Supporting Data Rate

The ten requirements remaining after the safety assessment step were then reviewed to determine the performance of the video that would be required to support sending the associated visual cues to the pilot. The following four performance parameters were used: 

 
Black and White or Color.  Color requires approximately twice as much data as 
Black and White.  Black and White includes infra-red (e.g., Enhanced Flight Vision System) since both are monochromatic. 
 
Field Of View (FOV).  Wide ±120 degrees azimuth and ±15 degrees elevation 
(equivalent to the cockpit windshield limit) or Narrow ±10 degrees (e.g., 2km baseline at 5km range) 
 
Resolution.  High Resolution 1280 x 720 pixels (approximately 1.5m feature size 
at 5km range with a Narrow FOV) or Low Resolution 352 x 240 pixels (approximately 6m feature size at 5km with a Narrow FOV) 
 
Frame Rate.  Low, 1-3 frames per second or High, greater than 7.5 frames per 
second. 
The above performance points were used in this assessment and represent typical capabilities.  Exact performance requirements will need to be assessed by the designer of a specific system to meet operational and safety needs. The video performance assessment concluded that color was required to differentiate the types of terrain on which to perform an emergency landing or the obstacles and terrain to avoid during low altitude flight and certain runway visual references during a 14 CFR 91.175 compliant landing.  It also concluded that High Frame Rate was only required for low altitude flight to avoid obstacles and terrain.  Although Field Of View does not directly impact data rate it is important to determine the Resolution required in order to see a feature of a particular size.  The assessments determined that High Resolution was required for all visual cues other than the requirement to ensure that the aircraft was approaching the correct runway.  Low Frame Rates were assessed acceptable for all of the requirements except during low altitude Enroute operation. Motion JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group - ISO 10918-1) and H.264 ISO 14496 10 Advanced Video Coding were used as references to determine the data rates required to support the assessed video performance.  Each is capable of compressing a 352 x 240 pixel resolution black and white image into approximately 20 kbits of data (depending on the image content) and decompressing it back to an image that is acceptably free of visually distracting artifacts once every second.  Other data rates were then scaled from this reference based on the resolution and need or otherwise for color. The highest data rate (approximately 1627 kbps) would be required to support obstacle and terrain avoidance during low altitude Enroute operations and the lowest data rate (20kbps) would be required to support the requirement to ensure the aircraft is approaching the correct runway.  The majority of the other requirements were supportable with either 217 kbps (Takeoff, Approach and Landing and Enroute phases) or 435 kbps off-airport emergency landing. An additional Utilization assessment was also performed to determine the amount of time that the various video transmissions would occupy in a typical mission.  In was determined that the video duration for the Takeoff phase would be ten minutes on average and that a similar time would be required for the Approach and Landing phase.  If video is required to support low altitude Enroute operations, then it would need to be transmitted continuously.  If video was only required during climb and descent to and from high altitude Enroute operation, then it would be required for approximately 15 minutes in total (additional to that required for Takeoff and Approach and Landing). Finally, video support during emergency landings could be needed for approximately 10 minutes but this would only be on the very rare occasion that an emergency off-airport landing was required.   

## E.6 Conclusion

Visual inputs to pilots form an integral part of today's manned aircraft operations in civil airspace.  The assessments performed by RTCA SC-228 show that, under certain circumstances, with alternate approaches other than video, visual cues need not be sent to the remote pilot over the CNPC Link System.  The assessments did conclude however that video can provide a valuable contribution to overall safety and efficiency of operation and that its use should not be precluded from the options available to the designer.   
 
If video is chosen by the system designer, then the performance and data rate assessments contained in this Appendix can be used as a guide to help design and certify systems. Based on these assessments it is proposed, on a nationwide basis, that a single (435 kbps) 
video channel is allocated for Enroute operation and that it is set aside for emergency situations.  Additionally, it is also proposed that two (217 kbps) video channels (per runway) are provided at every airport designated for UAS operations allowing two aircraft to be in the vicinity of the runway at the same time.  Since Takeoff and Approach and Landing operations occur at lower altitudes it is reasonable to assume that high geo/altitude frequency reuse factors can be employed with these two video channels. Frequency assignments to support these video channels will be required as part of the overall frequency planning activity discussed in Appendices H and I. Since video transmission is infrequent and may not be necessary with some UAS architectures designers may choose to implement video capabilities with an airborne transmitter separate from the equipment supporting the CNPC Link System. If video is required for Low Altitude Enroute operation then it is recommended that, because of the spectrum required (1627kHz per aircraft, assuming one bit per Hertz), the need for continuous video transmission and the difficulty of delivering adequately available RLOS CNPC links at low altitudes then consideration should be given to alternate means (some of which are identified in this Appendix and Table E-1) to support the delivery of the visual cues to the pilot or that satellite CNPC or other RF links are employed depending on the criticality of the operations. 

## Appendix F Uas Cnpc Link System Operational Capabilities And Implementation Considerations F.1 Introduction

This appendix provides a high-level view of operational scenarios, operational capabilities, implementation considerations, and operational architectures that should be addressed for the CNPC Link System to support anticipated UA operations in the NAS.  In Section F.2 the appendix initially describes a range of UAS operational scenarios.  In Section F.3 the information exchanges needed to support those operational scenarios are described.  This is followed by the resulting key operational capabilities of a CNPC Link System and a set of associated design constraints of that system that support those needed information exchanges.  Section F.4 describes example UAS Control and Communications Architectures and shows how the CNPC Link System integrates within one example architecture.  The above steps follow a basic systems engineering approach to define scenarios, develop requirements and then propose an architecture. Section F.5 concludes with a discussion of three special implementation considerations: spectrum utilization, Lost CNPC Links, and frequency coverage topologies. This information was used in the development of the CNPC Link System MOPS and it is anticipated that it will provide valuable guidance to designers of CNPC Link Systems and UAS Systems, as well as NAS system architects.  The operational descriptions included here complement the FAA's UAS CONOPS "Integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems into the National Airspace System: Concept of Operations" (2012) and draw from such earlier work as RTCA DO-320, "Operational Services and Environmental Definition (OSED) for Unmanned Aircraft Systems" and RTCA DO-344, "Operational and Functional Requirements and Safety Objectives for Unmanned Aircraft System Standards." 

## Uas Operations

This section describes operational environments in which UAS CNPC Link Systems could be operated.  Information provided in this appendix is assumed to be applicable to UAS CNPC Link System operations in all classes of NAS airspace expected to be used by UA. Section F.2.1 summarizes six use cases that are related to scenarios in the FAA UAS CONOPS v2.01 and relevant to this MOPS.  Each of these use cases will require use of CNPC links between the UA and the pilot to meet mission requirements and for flight safety. In Section F.2.2, four scenarios are defined as examples of those within the scope of those six use cases. 

## F.2.1 Selected Use Cases

Table F-1 lists six use cases that include a range of UAS operations that will be used as a foundation for discussions in the subsequent sections.  All are related to scenarios described in the FAA UAS CONOPS document.

## F.2.2 General Considerations Of Use Cases

This section describes some general considerations related to the use cases, including the impact of differences in flight paths, flights through different airspace classes and the impact of the range of complexity of such operations and the needed avionics and ground support systems. There are a nearly infinite number of possible flight paths that could be flown by UA within or among the seven Airspace Classes defined by the FAA.  This MOPS's scope addresses UA flights in all airspace classes.  To help explain the challenges in developing the CNPC Link System MOPS, three example UA flight paths within those Airspace Classes have been identified and are shown in Figure F-1. 

Key aspects of Scenarios Impacting CNPC 
Examples 
Link System Capabilities 
 Launched in Class G airspace near utility 
infrastructure (e.g. power line or oil 
pipeline), or  
 Departs from a Class D airport, passes into 
or continues through Class G airspace until it reaches end of its inspection run;  
 Turns around and comes back.   Lands in Class G at recovery or in Class D 
airport site. 
 Departs a Class C airport not far from the 
northern border 
 Climbs through Class E into Class A 
airspace heading north to the border 
 Follows the border to the east until 
reaching water, including a loiter at 5,000 
feet and an unplanned excursion 
 Return route is the same, without the loiter 
point, back to the Class C airport. 
 Launched from a site that is close to the 
area to be searched 
 Performs a standard search pattern, 
including segments that are BLOS 
 Returns to the same field it was launched 
from for recovery. 7,000 feet above mean sea level (MSL) while remaining on published airways. 
 Transitions across two TRACONs before 
landing at a non-towered airport  
 Departs a Class D airport  Transitions into Class B airspace and enters 
the corridor 
 Returns to land at the airport of origin 
through Class G airspace until it reaches its delivery location 
 It deposits its package; then returns using a 
similar route 
 Lands in Class G airspace; the recovery 
site. 

## F.2.2.1 Use Case Impacts On Ua Avionics And Ground Support System Capabilities

The design of UAS and the UA's avionics and sensor capabilities can vary from simple to very complex.2  The information capacity, "ilities" (e.g., reliability, maintainability, testability, usability) and constraints (e.g., environment, cost) of the airborne and ground based parts of the CNPC Link System required to support the diversity of these designs are highly dependent on the complexity of the flight path and the risks (e.g., type of UA, and where it is flown) associated with that path; see left side of Figure F-2.  Generally, in more complex flight paths and with higher risks, there would be the need to exchange larger types and amounts of information and address more challenging "ilities" and constraints.  Using the resulting information exchange and "ility" and constraint values, (see the right side of Figure F-2) the capabilities of the avionics (blue arrow) and ground support systems (green arrow) can be established.  Within those capabilities is a common set associated with the CNPC Link (the gray arrows); this MOPS defines the standards associated with that common set of capabilities. 


                                                    
 
 
In addition to the flight path and risk, the operational needs regarding how many UA need to be supported, how far they will need to operate from their Ground Radio System (GRS), and other key factors (e.g., interoperability) need to be involved in establishing a broader set of capabilities than those addressed in this MOPS. 

## F.2.2.2 Mops Limits On Supporting Extended Scenarios

As noted above, this MOPS supports flight operations similar to those depicted in the dotted, dashed, and solid lines shown in Figure F-1, i.e., flights of a single UA that communicates with just one GRS.  In this MOPS this set of link communication features is defined as point-to-point RLOS link communications.  Future MOPS will be required to address enabling UA to operate BRLOS.  This topic is discussed in more detail in Section F.4 of this appendix. 

## F.2.3 Expanded Discussion Of Selected Scenarios This Subsection Goes Into More Detail On Four Flight Paths Addressed Within The Use Cases Presented In Table F-1.  Those Four Are:

 
Utility & Infrastructure Inspection (1);  
 
Loiter for Surveillance (2) and Search Pattern (3); 
 
Point-to-Point (4) and Maneuvering in High Density Airspace (5), and 
 
Package Delivery (6).   
These four flight paths are shown in Figures F-3 through F-6.  The first two figures show examples of the dashed flight path depicted Figure F-1, i.e., flights only within Class G Airspace.  The other two are examples of the dotted flight paths (flights in Classes G and E) and the solid line (flights in Classes A, E, and D) from Figure F-1. Figure F-3 is an example of Use Case 1, Utility & Infrastructure Inspection, listed in Table F-1 and shows a scenario that would be a near-term practical use of a smaller UA flying in relatively remote areas (e.g. in uncontrolled airspace - Class G, the dashed line in Figure F-1) for oil pipe line or similar infrastructure surveillance.  The UA could be flying mostly within the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the pilot and beyond VLOS during some portions of the flight. For flight paths addressing a loitering for surveillance and search patterns; (see Use Cases 2 and 3 in Table F-1) and operating within Classes G and E, see Figure F-4.  The key additional operational requirement, beyond that shown in Figure F-3, is to support safe operation when flying in the Class E airspace where many other aircraft could be operating under visual flight rules (VFR) or instrument flight rules (IFR). Another potential operational scenario for smaller UA is Package Delivery (part of Use Case 6 in Table F-1) and is shown in Figure F-5; this shows multiple UA flying in a common area conducting package deliveries, all within an urban area.  The key additional operational requirements, beyond those already described for the pipeline and over watch examples, are to address multiple UA but each communicating with a unique GRS in the same geographic area.  This MOPS enables these operations and provides the compatibility requirements to ensure they can operate without harmful interference. Section F.4 discusses more efficient and interoperable ways to use the CNPC Link Systems described in this use case. 

 
An even more complex operational scenario example involves larger UA taking off and returning to a relatively large airport (located in Class D Airspace) and flying enroute through Class A and E airspace yet still in RLOS of the airport.  This follows the solid line within Figure F-2; a flight path for that scenario is given in Figure F-6.  This encompasses Use Cases 4 (Point-to-Point) and 5 (Maneuvering in High Density Airspace) in Table F-1. Again the key additional operational requirement is to support safe operation when flying in the Class A airspace and when communicating with approach/departure control and airport towers/ground control when within Class D Airspace; all are areas where major commercial aircraft operate. As discussed in Section F.4, operation of the UA beyond the RLOS limit of coverage can be achieved using this MOPS as a basis, but will require additional MOPS to be developed if interoperability is required. 

 
With the first four example scenarios defined, the next step in identifying the needed communication capabilities is to describe the information exchanges that would be needed for safe operations of the UA along those four example flight paths. 

## F.3 Information Exchanges

This section discusses the information exchanges for the four operational scenarios described in Section F.2.3, the relative relationship among those exchanges, and then the key design capabilities and constraints on the resulting CNPC Link System 

## F.3.1 Communication Links For Four Example Flight Paths

The needed communication links to support the four example flight paths are described within this section.  The information to be sent over those links would include the data required to support the aviate (flight maneuver instructions), navigate, communicate and integrate (surveillance and DAA) functions that the remote pilot needs to manage. The needed communication links for the first three of the four scenarios described in the previous subsection are shown within Figures F-7 to F-9.  Each figure includes the communication links providing the needed information exchanges between a GRS and the UA (shown by blue arrows). The Figures F-7 to F-9 also show some of the needed terrestrial communication links (represented by the purple arrows) to support safe operations.  The links shown are between the Pilot Station and a Spectrum Authority and the FAA/ATC.  The connection to the Spectrum Authority is to establish the frequencies that should be used by the CNPC Link System during various portions of the flight.  The connection to the FAA/ATC is to obtain "clearance" to fly per current regulations and to maintain communication with FAA/ATC during the flight.  In Figures F-8 and F-9, portions of that communication could occur through the UA since it would be within RLOS of the FAA radar/towers during at least part of its flight path.  Further descriptions of these ground network connections and their associated information exchanges are discussed in Section F.4. In addition, Figures F-8 to F-10 include representations of the additional "external" communication links that could be needed to/from the UA to support safe operations; these are shown by the green arrows.  They include the UA seeking position information via signals from GPS satellites and the communication with FAA/ATC directly to/from the UA.  Further descriptions of those links are beyond the scope of this MOPS. 

 
For the larger aircraft (a) taking off and landing at the same controlled airport (b) using the GRS by that airport and (c) flying into Class A airspace (see Figure F-7), the communication links would be essentially the same as in the loitering for surveillance scenario shown in Figure F-8. But for a use case with a larger aircraft traversing a greater distance (thus needing connections to multiple GRS and perhaps a satellite system), a representation of the types of links needed throughout such a flight (to include multiple such larger UA flying similar larger distances) would become very complicated.  Section F.4 of this appendix addresses this topic in more detail. 

## F.3.2 Relative Relationship Among Information Exchanges

The next step is to gain a better understanding of how much of each type of information needs to be exchanged during flights.  During normal enroute portions of a flight, the UA pilot may need only periodic updates that the UA is operating nominally and flying along its cleared flight path.  During this time relatively little data would need to be interchanged, requiring minimal bandwidth.  Updates would occur infrequently but on a regular basis.  During those portions of the flights the pilot also might update some of the preset flight path information that was given to the UA prior to takeoff, e.g., those could include changing waypoints, altitudes to be flown, or frequency channels to be utilized.  In such circumstances, there would be additional data uplinked to the UA and corresponding responses downlinked from the UA but these would occur on an irregular basis.  There would be greater numbers and types of exchanges during takeoffs and landings but those would be, in the majority of circumstances, at pre-planned times and locations. During flights in adverse weather conditions, flights near other aircraft (typically requiring DAA actions), and/or in emergency situations, the amount of data to be sent from the UA to the pilot could be larger and additional telecommands may need to be sent from the pilot to the UA.  These "off-nominal" conditions would require greater CNPC Link System bandwidths than that needed for normal operations. Figure F-11 illustrates the potential broad range of data volumes and data exchange periodicities.  Again, in general, with the different types of scenarios, risks, and complexities of the UAS, there could be a separation in the groupings of information sent/received based on the size of the UA. 

## Figure F-10: Range Of Ua Information Amount And Exchange Periodicity

With the information exchanges defined and some representation of how much data and how often they would need to be sent/received, the next step is to translate those needed information exchanges into the capabilities of the CNPC Link System. This is done within the next subsection.  More detailed analysis on the information flows and corresponding data rates is given in Appendix J. 

## Translating Ua Operational Scenarios And Needed Information Exchanges Into Cnpc Link System Capabilities

This section defines the high-level CNPC Link System capabilities needed to support the UA flight paths described in Section F.2 and the range of information exchanges described in Sections F.3.1 and F.3.2.  These capabilities support the aviate, navigate, communicate, and integrate functions that the remote pilot needs to manage and include: 

10. Supporting exchanges of flight control (aviate) information to/from pilot and UA, 
e.g., actual pilot control or monitoring of the UA's flight control sub-system 
11. Support other information exchanges, including: 
a) 
UA navigation information (e.g., latitude, longitude, altitude, and speed) 
b) 
ATC voice and data communications (some of these exchanges could be accomplished using a ground link between the pilot and ATC)  
c) 
Surveillance system (e.g. IFF, Traffic-Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and Detect and Avoid (DAA) data) 
d) 
Video images for takeoff, landing, and emergencies (See Appendix E for additional discussion on this topic) 
e) 
Weather information, e.g. data from a weather radar on the UA 
f) 
Status information (telemetry) from needed "supportive" systems on the UA.  This would include monitoring the effectiveness of various onboard systems (engines, navigation, communications, physical structure, etc.) 
Since the needed type and amount and periodicity of information to be exchanged can vary widely depending on the design of the UAS, the scenario and environment (see Figure F-10), detailed estimates of information exchanges in bits per second (i.e., data rates) for each type of information (like those listed above) cannot be made.  Accordingly, within the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System (See Section 2.2.2) a set of four data classes were established and in the MOPS Manufacturer-Specific CNPC Link System (see Section 2.2.3) various ranges of data rates are allowed.  See Appendices J, K, L, and M for additional discussions on data rates. In addition to the above, there are several required conditional capabilities based on current FAA regulations:  

1. The CNPC Link System Airborne Antenna(s) need to support effective 
propagation to the GRS during all possible UA maneuver limits.  
2. The CNPC Link System supports the information exchanges needed for UA 
flights to meet FAA rules (currently this includes all IFR requirements) and other requirements that may be established. 
3. The CNPC Link System Airborne Radio, antenna and cabling does not cause cosite interference with other electronic systems on the UA.  Similar restrictions would be for the GRS. 
4. The CNPC Link System does not cause interference with other systems within the 
"radio horizon" of the CNPC Link System antennas. (The use of the L Band spectrum is of primary concern.)  This is further discussed in Appendix G 
5. Spectrum utilization needs to be efficient enough to support multiple UA 
operating in the same area at the same time. This is discussed in greater detail in Appendices H and I. 
6. The CNPC Link System needs to meet the reliability requirements set by the 
FAA/ICAO.  This could mean use of duplicative Airborne and Ground CNPC Link Radios and Antennas (each using a different frequency channel) to connect between the UA and the pilot.  Currently those requirements have not been fully defined.  Further information on CNPC Link System performance is included in Appendix K. 
7. The information sent over the CNPC Link System should be encrypted and 
authenticated to provide resistance to potential security threats.  See Appendix D for more details on this subject. 
The scope of the MOPS is focused on development of CNPC Links that are compatible in their use of spectrum yet permit each link to utilize just the needed amount of spectrum bandwidth.  That amount being based on the required information exchanges, which in turn will be different depending when and where the UA flies, the risk it brings, and the environment in which it is operating.  Such compatibility has also been accomplished without restricting the choice of the link waveform, i.e., the MOPS does not prescribe the use of one specific waveform (see Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 of this MOPS). With these capabilities and constraints described, the next step is to describe the architecture that could support those capabilities.  This is done in the next section.  

## F.4 Uas Control And Communications Architectures

As discussed in Section 1 of the main body of this MOPS, the developers of this MOPS were cognizant of the need to provide for future growth of both the use of CNPC Link Systems and their technology, so the set of standards contained in the main body of this MOPS focus on ensuring compatibility between systems while not limiting the potential for future designs and operations.  This section of Appendix F discusses how CNPC Link Systems can be used within overarching UAS Control and Communications architectures. Figure F-11 shows how the CNPC Link System described in this MOPS can be used to support a point-to-point UAS Control and Communications architecture. This configuration could be used to support the simpler scenarios (pipe line or local area over watch, and local package delivery) described in the earlier sections of this appendix. This architecture shows how the basic CNPC Link System (see the solid boxes and lines within that figure - also see Figure 1-2 within the main body of the MOPS) can be connected (see the dashed lines) with other key systems (see the dashed boxes).  Two of those key systems are (1) the Airborne and Ground Flight and Radio Management Systems (FRMS) that are being used to ensure the correct information is received by the aircraft and the pilot in time for effective control of the UA and (2) the Ground Distribution System that ensures the UA is connected to the correct PS.  The terrestrial connections to the Spectrum Authority (K1) and ATC (J1) are the same as described above in Figures F-8 thru F-10.  In some UAS the entire GRS, Distribution System, Ground FRMS, and Pilot Station may reside in one handheld enclosure, in other UAS they may be geographically distributed. This MOPS provides all of the requirements to support this point-to-point RLOS UAS Control and Communications Architecture. This MOPS also supports more complex Control and Communications architectures. However, some of those architectures will require either entirely new MOPS (separate from this MOPS) or additions to this MOPS (these additions to be developed in the future) 
to provide for the levels of interoperability necessary to support these more complex UAS Control and Communications architectures. To enable more efficient use of resources and spectrum it is envisaged that a single GRS 
could simultaneously support multiple aircraft.  This will require that participating UA will need to be interoperable with each other and the single GRS supporting them so as to ensure no harmful interference occurs.  This architecture can be realized within the current MOPS but only for aircraft and GRS from the same manufacturer.  If GRS are required to support UA from multiple manufacturers, then additional MOPS will need to be developed to support the required interoperability. To enable longer aircraft operating ranges than can be supported by a single point-to-point RLOS link, it is envisaged that multiple GRS can be interconnected over a network to support this UA mobility using seamless handover of these point-to-point links from one GRS to the next.  This architecture can be realized within the current MOPS but would be based on proprietary messaging sent over the CNPC Link System to support handover. The interoperability requirements needed to support an industry standard networked interconnection of GRS and aircraft mobility between them will need to be the topic of future MOPS. As has been previously described in this MOPS, pilot/ATC communications can either be relayed through the UA or provided by a direct connection (either a ground based connection or a separate remote VHF radio) from the Pilot Station to the ATC facility. The former approach is covered in this MOPS, the latter will necessitate both additional MOPS and the required infrastructure. It is the expectation of the developers of this MOPS that all of these more complex UAS Control and Communications architectures can be implemented using the core point-topoint RLOS link compatibility requirements contained in this MOPS as their basis. 

## F.5 Additional Cnpc Link System Operational Considerations

There are additional key factors that need to be considered to more fully have the CNPC Link System support the operational scenarios described above. These aspects address spectrum utilization, lost CNPC Links, and frequency coverage topologies.  

## F.5.1 Spectrum Utilization Considerations F.5.1.1 Multiple Link Operations

Multiple CNPC Links may be operated by a single UA for a variety of reasons.  One of the greatest motivations for multiple-link operations is the need for redundancy.  Stringent CNPC Link performance requirements may in many circumstances necessitate simultaneous transmission of CNPC Link signals between a GRS and the UA it is helping to control.  One possible method for doing this is simulcasting in two separate bands (e.g., L Band and C Band) or on two separate frequencies within either of those bands.  Using two different bands would minimize multipath nulls that can occur on one frequency but are very unlikely to happen simultaneously in two different bands or on widely separated frequencies in the same band.  The redundancy provided by simulcasting can greatly improve link availability and continuity, and reduce the time necessary to complete DAA transactions and other safety-critical actions.  (Unlike time-diversity techniques, which are also used to provide redundancy, multi-band or multi-frequency simulcasting does not increase transaction time). Additional discussion on this topic is given within Appendix C. 

## F.5.1.2 Uas Operating In Protected Spectrum

International Telecommunication Union World Radiocommunications Conferences have granted non-exclusive L Band and C Band allocations in the 960–1164 and 5030–5091 
MHz frequency ranges to the aeronautical mobile (route) service (AM(R)S).  AM(R)S is an aeronautical mobile service reserved for communications relating to safety and regularity of flight, primarily along national and international civil air routes. This service supports terrestrial (non-satellite) air/ground radio links.  The principal reason UAS CNPC 
links must use AM(R)S spectrum is that such spectrum's interference environment is carefully managed.  This is accomplished in the following ways. 1)  During the allocation process, within the ITU-R (the ITU Regulatory organization), new services wishing to use such protected service spectrum must show, with a high degree of certainty, that they will neither cause harmful interference to services that currently use that spectrum nor receive harmful interference from those incumbent users. 2)  During operational use of the spectrum, protected services will receive prompt resolution of any harmful interference in the unlikely event that it does occur. In the United States, although not in Europe, UAS CNPC is the only new AM(R)S activity now being seriously contemplated for either of those AM(R)S bands.  However, there are several systems already appropriately using that service as well as competing non- AM(R)S users that also exist for both bands; these challenges are discussed in Appendix C. It is projected that large numbers of both small UAS (type-certificated UA, not under 14 CFR Part 107, IFR operation, below 500 ft. AGL, and BVLOS) and UAS covered by this MOPS plan to operate in the NAS and interact with manned aircraft traffic.  Each of these UAS could compete for use of the same available AM(R)S L Band and C Band resources. The FAA has not issued formal guidance regarding the options of Small UAS using AM(R)S designated spectrum.  

## F.5.1.3 Uas Operating In Non-Protected Spectrum

Small UAS (sUAS) operating under VLOS rules (14 CFR Part 107 small UAS not typecertificated, below 500 ft. AGL) may be designated by the FAA as ineligible to use protected spectrum for their CNPC Links.  Such sUAS currently operate their communication links in non-protected spectrum, such as that used for industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) service or other frequency bands such as those designated for use by cell phones and Wi-Fi systems. In unprotected frequency bands, the operator must accept interference caused by such licensed services. Unlicensed wireless technologies do not require any permission to operate, as long as products and users comply with the rules associated with that unlicensed band (for example, maximum transmission power). But unlicensed wireless technologies are, by nature, vulnerable to interference. 

## F.5.2 Lost Cnpc Link

As with any RF communications link (including those used by manned aircraft), the performance of the UA's CNPC Link System can be impacted by a range of causes. These performance impacts are due to a number of RF related environmental factors and are not associated with variation of the performance of the system's equipment, i.e., they are caused by variations in the attenuation of the signal along the propagation path between the antennas at each end of a CNPC Link System. 

So as the path attenuation varies the signal level may occasionally dip below the minimum required by the CNPC Link System receiver to correctly receive the information from a CNPC Link System transmitter, causing a temporary interruption in information exchanges.  The duration of these interruptions can vary from tens of milliseconds to many tens of seconds.  Some of the factors that could cause longer interruptions include multipath cancelation, terrain based diffraction and airframe obstruction of the RLOS path as the aircraft maneuvers. 

If the UA pilot is unable to intervene in the active management of the flight in a timely manner appropriate to the airspace and operational conditions, a Lost CNPC Link state needs to be declared and the pilot and UA need to follow appropriate procedures that have been previously agreed with ATC.  While the CNPC Link System is in a temporarily interrupted condition but prior to the UAS declaring a Lost CNPC Link the UA is in its least safe condition because neither is the pilot able to actively manage the flight nor is the UA following preprogramed, predictable maneuvers pre-coordinated with ATC.  The amount of time the UAS is in this intermediate Lost CNPC Link Decision state is an important criterion.  If the time is too short, then nuisance Lost CNPC Link declarations will be made (since the path attenuation could soon reduce again and the interruption could cease) increasing the workload for ATC and other airspace users.  If the time is too long, then the UA will be operating in its least safe condition for an unacceptable period of time based on its operating environment.  An interruption of the CNPC Link does not necessarily mean an unsafe situation; such an event needs to be put into perspective with the operational environment and the level of automation, pre-programmability and predictability of the UA flight path. 

The operational environment provides constraints on the entire UAS, therefore also on the CNPC Link System.  Some operationally challenging environments (e.g. takeoff and landing) require more stringent CNPC Link performance than others (e.g. trans-oceanic flight).  This means that in certain conditions, a given length of interruption of the CNPC Link would be acceptable, when in other conditions that same length of interruption would not be acceptable.  Additional discussion on such link interruption and Lost CNPC Link condition is given in Appendix K. 

## F.5.3 Uas Cnpc Link Grs Locations And Coverage Topologies

It is anticipated that future UAS operations will encompass both ad-hoc (e.g. operation in response to a natural disaster, and individual and local organization desires) and regular (e.g. conventional point-to-point commercial flight operations) use cases.  So coverage topologies and frequency reuse planning must accommodate both needs.  Additionally, third party communications service providers will also need to be accommodated whose coverage needs will be defined by the entities providing those CNPC Link System services. It is envisaged that there will need to be a strategic national level coverage plan that can use one of the classic approaches (e.g. grid-style) to planning.  However, because GRS will either be located in an ad-hoc manner or not with regular spacing as is typical with a 
"cellular" approach, then a tactical developmental approach will be required.  This tactical approach will be focused on providing coverage for a region that is a subset of a larger area, actual end user coverage needs, and a gradual implementation process. Consideration of using already existing infrastructure has merit to reduce roll-out costs.  In practice however, it is more likely that, geographic, topography and associated propagation issues will determine cell boundaries.  Since some UA flight altitudes will be much lower than current manned aviation, providing coverage will necessitate more closely separated GRS to ensure adequate CNPC Link System performance. 

Many existing RF planning tools are available to design effective CNPC Link GRS coverage topologies. 

## Appendix G Npc Link System L Band Interference Environment G.1 Background

One of the frequency bands for terrestrial operation of the CNPC Link System is within the L Band, at 960 - 1164 MHz, under the Aeronautical Mobile (En route) Service [AM(R)S] allocation. The 960 - 1215 MHz band is also allocated worldwide to the Aeronautical Radionavigation Service (ARNS) and is heavily utilized for International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standard systems. See Figure G-1. These systems would include the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) and the military Tactical Air Navigation System (TACAN).  Surveillance systems include Secondary Surveillance Radar such as the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS), Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) Mode Select (Mode S) and the military Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system. Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems (ACAS) such as the Traffic-Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) systems such as the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter and the Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) also operate in the band. There are other Multilateration systems operating in the band such as such as the Height Monitoring Unit (HMU), Wide Area Multilateration (WAM), and the Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (A- SMGCS) for ground control.

ARNS system (RSBN)
In some nations, a TDMA military communications identification and navigation system capable of transmitting the Link 16 message standard also operate in the band.  Two such systems are the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) and the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS). In Eastern Europe, the Russian developed system known as the Radionavigatsionnaya Sistema Blitzhney Navigatsii (RSBN) is a short-range navigation system similar to TACAN/DME that is usually used in conjunction with the instrument landing system known as PRMG.  While not an ICAO standardized system, it operates under the ARNS. At the upper end of the frequency band, the 1164 - 1215 MHz band is also allocated to the Radionavigation Satellite Service (RNSS).  Within this allocation, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) L5 are planned for operation in this subband.  There will be other worldwide GNSS constellation signals such as the European Galileo E5a/E5b, the Russian Federation GLONASS L3 and the People's Republic of China BeiDou B2I signal.  There are also satellite-based and ground-based augmentation systems that most likely will operate in that band. As described above, it is proposed that the CNPC Link System would operate under the AM(R)S allocation within the 960-1164 MHz band.  Since the ARNS and RNSS services operating in L Band were established before the AM(R)S service, any new AM(R)S systems will have to integrate with the existing ARNS and RNSS systems and meet the protection requirements necessary to ensure interference free operations among all the L Band systems.  During the drafting of this MOPS, the entire 960-1164 MHz band was examined for possible use by smaller sized UA.  As a result, it was determined that with a maximum L Band transmit power of 32 mW for UA flying at low altitude (less than 3kft AGL) and within short range (less than 15NM) of their GRS, the 1040-1080 MHz and 1104-1150 MHz sub-bands had the greatest possibility of being acceptable; an analysis of the use of the 1040-1080 MHz sub-band is given in Appendix H.  This analysis however, is not sufficiently complete to recommend that L Band use is possible in any specific location. Given that the 1040-1080 MHz and 1104-1150 MHz sub-bands had the greatest possibility of being acceptable, this appendix will define both the RF environment of the offboard incumbent systems as well as the cosite equipment. Figure G-2 provides a diagram showing the TACAN and DME channel assignments. 

## G.2 Rf Environment

The RF environment can be defined as either being offboard or cosite to the UA. Assessing the capability for the CNPC Link System to operate compatibly requires assessing both of these environments as an aggregate. The environments will be initially examined separately but will be considered together when developing the test setup and planning. 

## G.2.1 External Rf Environment

Tables G-1 and G-2, list publicly available RF airborne transmitter and receiver characteristics, respectively. Some of the values shown in the tables may not be specified in system documentation but instead have been reported as having been measured in limited samples of actual transmitters and receivers of the types discussed, they will be used conservatively for test planning. The characteristics of non-ICAO-compliant L Band systems are listed in an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radiocommunication (ITU-R) Sector report.1  Table G-3 provides a list and typical characteristics for fixed in-band and near-band transmitters.

## G.2.2 Cosite Rf Environment

The use of L Band CNPC ARS on UA equipped with UAT, SSR, GPS L5, DME or TACAN pose significant challenges as the signal levels from these systems are high and there would be limited antenna-to-antenna isolation due the potential small size of the aircraft.  Signal levels into the CNPC Link System receiver from that equipment could be potentially higher than its sensitivity.  Conversely, CNPC Link System signal levels into the L Band equipment will also be substantial.  The use of a standard mutual suppression bus as a mitigation technique was explored, but may not be possible due to the ICAO limits of 1% on the amount of total SSR transponder receiver blanking time and the fact that the CNPC Link System uses duty factors on the order of about 50%.  However, integrated CNPC/DME/UAT or CNPC/TACAN/UAT units might be designed to do their own internal blanking and thus not affect the SSR transponder receiver. In such a case, testing would be necessary to determine whether DME and/or TACAN could continue to function properly with their airborne receivers blanked approximately 50% of the time. Filtering may be another option depending on the signal levels. Additionally, military UA equipped with TACAN, IFF, and the Link 16 TDMA waveform could be especially challenging. Tables G-6 and G-7, provide expected cosite signal levels and EMC margin that may be present at CNPC Link System receivers in the UA and other Cosited receivers respectively.

Notes:  Susceptibility level allows for 6 dB aeronautical margin and 6 dB for multiple interfering emitters. Air to ground equipment separation assumed to be 500ft.  No bandwidth correction applied. CNPC emission limit = (susceptibility level) + (free-space loss) - (sum of antenna gains) + (sum of line losses). Calculation of interference to GPS L5 receivers in the adjacent band 1164-1188MHz must be considered using parameters and criteria in RTCA DO- 292

## G.3 Mutual Suppression Bus Investigation

The use of a Mutual Suppression Bus (MSB) is a platform integration design technique that can be used to suppress L Band receivers to avoid interference when other platform collocated L Band equipment is transmitting.  This technique has been considered for the CNPC Link System onboard a UA as strong signal levels can result from the small antenna separation on the platform.  Because there is 1% limit invoked by ICAO in the amount of suppression that is allowed for a SSR transponder, anticipated suppression duty cycles must be investigated.  Table G-11 provides the RF and the estimated MSB receiver suppression and reaction time duty cycle.  It appears that unless there is a method to avoid the requirement for the CNPC Link System to suppress the SSR transponder, the MSB will not be a viable technique.  Concerning the feasibility for use of the MSB to promote compatibility of the other L Band systems, it appears that there is a small excess to the 1% requirement (~1.26%).

## Cnpc Link System As A Source Of Interference - Testing

To ensure that the CNPC Link System does not cause any interference effects to other L Band systems both in cosite and external scenarios, tests4 are required to be performed in accordance with Section 3.3.3 of this MOPS using the matrix indicated in Table G-13 with the CNPC Link System operating at its highest power level and duty cycle and on its most conservative channel.  The test would be performed with CNPC Link System as a source to each of the cosite and external RF environment equipment with a representative external RF environment also injected into the victim receiver.  The cosite and external equipment is to be operated on its most conservative channels with the weakest desired signal levels provided by applicable test equipment. 4 This testing needs to take into account the effects of multiple CNPC Link Systems on such external systems.

## Appendix H Frequency Reuse Planning H.1 Introduction

CNPC link spectrum management will be a major determinant of the number of CNPC links that will be able to operate satisfactorily within available spectrum.  It will comprise a static component (frequency reuse planning) and a dynamic component (actual assignment of frequencies and/or time slots to specific UAS as needs arise).  This appendix deals primarily with the static component.  Appendix I addresses the dynamic component. 

## Spectrum Resources

Two frequency bands have been identified as potentially available for terrestrial CNPC use:  960–1164 MHz (L Band) and 5030–5091 MHz (C Band). 

## H.2.1 L Band Resources

The 960–976 MHz portion of L Band was initially regarded as the most promising segment of L Band for CNPC operation in the NAS, especially in non-coastal areas. However, following additional analyses, it was determined that there would be far more extensive coordination needed with agencies using TACAN in that portion of the band. Following further analyses of alternative portions of the 960-1164 band, the current focus for achieving the greatest possibility of acceptance is the 1040-1080 MHz and 1104-1150 MHz sub-bands.  But that acceptance will be dependent upon the CNPC Link having a transmit power no greater than 32 mW and the UA flying no higher than 3,000 feet AGL and remaining within 15 NM of its GRS.  As noted in Section 2, these analyses are not sufficiently complete to constitute a full recommendation that the use of L Band is possible for any specific location.  Additional studies will be required for operation at any geographic location to ensure that the CNPC Link System can adequately protect the currently operational ground and airborne equipment (DME, TACAN, ADS-B, Mode S, TCAS, etc.) from interference. 

## H.2.2 C Band Resources

C Band is much less congested than L Band.  The FCC in April 2015 issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that will, if approved, allow terrestrial CNPC use of C Band.  
CNPC frequency planning for this band can proceed with considerable confidence that much and perhaps all of the band will be usable in the U.S. for terrestrial CNPC. However, it is possible that at some future time a satellite communications (SATCOM) CNPC system may be developed for use in the same band, which already has an international AMS(R)S allocation coequal to the international AM(R)S allocation that enables terrestrial CNPC use of that band.  In that event, terrestrial CNPC may eventually have to share the band with SATCOM CNPC.  Paragraph H.7 addresses this issue in more detail. 

## H.2.3 Channel-Licensing Procedures

Under the Communications Act of 1934, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have authority to grant frequency licenses to Federal and non-Federal users, respectively. By purview of NTIA, the FAA administers the Aeronautical Assignment Group (AAG), which is responsible for engineering frequencies in specified aviation-related frequency bands and designating which frequency applications should be approved by NTIA and the FCC. Since C Band and part of L Band are under AAG authority, the FAA will be responsible for the engineering review of CNPC license applications. It is anticipated that civil users of terrestrial CNPC will require frequency authorizations from the FCC, with review by the FAA, at least for the ground radio systems. The nature and scope of the licenses will depend upon the proposed technical parameters (including final channelization, frequency reuse, and emissions), the final configuration of any UAS network architecture, and the regulations of NTIA and the FCC. Both of those agencies will determine how air and ground radio system licenses will be issued to UAS operators. 

## H.3 Technical And Operational Considerations

1. All terrestrial CNPC uplinks and downlinks operating in compliance with this MOPS 
will be separated in the time domain by time-division duplexing (TDD), synchronized among all users, as provided in Section 2.2.1.  Synchronized TDD prevents ground-toground RF interference (RFI).  It also precludes air-to-air RFI except when interfering-signal paths are very long (which can happen under conditions of ducting or super refraction, or when very-high-altitude UA are involved). 
2. Every CNPC uplink or downlink compliant with this MOPS must operate within a 
contiguous frequency channel comprising one or more 5-kHz frequency blocks as 
stipulated in Section 2.2.1, and its transmitter's emissions must comply with the 
transmitter emission mask depicted therein.  However, there is no universal requirement to utilize a common set of channel spacings, widths, or placements. Spectrum managers in this band must be prepared to deal with a wide variety of channel widths that may vary drastically from system to system. 
3. Uplink and downlink frequencies may be chosen independently.  That is, a given UAS 
can use one frequency for its uplink and a different frequency for its downlink. 
4. Systems operating in compliance with this MOPS will not depend on the use of a 
common signaling channel. 
5. Frequency planning should strive to provide maximum frequency reuse consistent 
with keeping every CNPC receiver's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) sufficiently high to meet the link-availability requirements of the UAS that it supports. This is achievable through appropriate combinations of over-the-horizon frequency reuse, directional antennas, and adequate separations between links using adjacent channels. 
6. The traditional 4/3 earth radio horizon is not an impenetrable barrier against 
interference.  Ducting and other anomalous propagation phenomena can occasionally carry cochannel interference much farther than expected, especially in warm, humid climates.  In a CNPC system where required availability is high, anomalous propagation could have a significant impact and should be taken into account in frequency reuse planning. 
7. CNPC service for a given UAS can be provided in either of two ways: 
 
A "standalone" CNPC link directly connecting the radios of the UAS ground radio system (GRS) and the UA itself; or 
 
A network capable of simultaneously serving two or more UAS. 

## H.4 Cellular Frequency Planning

If CNPC service is provided to some UAS via one or more networks, it may be advantageous to devise for each network a cellular frequency plan with lists of frequencies allotted to particular volumes of airspace for use as needed by individual UAS.  Figure H- 1 shows an example of such a plan.  The number inside each hexagonal cell does not represent a single frequency, but instead designates a list of frequencies available for assignment by the dynamic resource-assignment process to UAS operating within the cell.  
The entire area covered by the network is divided into cell clusters with repeating patterns of frequency lists.  In the example, the cell-cluster size (K) is 12. That value of K is the smallest for which it is possible to avoid assigning first adjacent channels to immediately adjacent cells—a useful measure for preventing adjacent-channel interference (ACI). Another benefit is that cochannel interference (CCI) between ground and airborne radios is possible only at distances greater than four cell radii.  Under normal propagation conditions, that largely precludes air-to-air CCI unless the altitude of the UA concerned is higher than about 10C2 feet, where C is cell radius in nautical miles. A major drawback of large values of K is that the frequency-reuse factor is inversely proportional to cell-cluster size.  In other words, the fraction of total frequency resources available to users in any given cell is only 1 / K.  If those resources were small to begin with, dividing them by 12 could result in cellular resource lists so small that instances could often arise in which one cell runs out of frequencies while each of its neighbors still has several frequencies available.  Using lower values of K can limit such effects.  The smallest value of K that prevents adjacent cells from using the same frequency is 3. 

## H.4.1 Low-Altitude Coverage

Three-dimensional frequency plans can be constructed in which the value of K (and thus the entire pattern of resource lists) is a function of altitude.  If the horizontal cellular pattern remains constant regardless of altitude, this has the advantage of allowing UA at all altitudes to use the same GRS at the center of a given "stack" of cells—provided that the UA are within sight of the GRS.  However, that is not necessarily the case, as Figure H-2 illustrates.  In that figure, a cell radius of 69 NM is assumed.  The radio horizon distance over a smooth earth with a standard atmosphere is 1.23H nautical miles, where H is altitude in feet.  Even if the surrounding terrain is quite smooth, a 100-foot cell tower at the center of such a cell would be unable to provide coverage down to the ground in more than a small fraction of the total area of the cell.  At the corners of the cell, only UA about 4000 feet above ground level (AGL) or higher could have a line of sight to the cell tower.  Since virtually all UA must take off and eventually land, and many never fly at all above a few hundred feet, local low-altitude coverage must be provided by appropriately placed "gapfiller" GRS as shown in the figure.  The fact that some gapfillers will have to operate near cell edges, to meet the needs of UA operating there, poses a threat of adjacent-channel interference (ACI) in adjacent cells and complicates frequency reuse. 

## H.4.2 Other Issues Affecting Cellular Frequency Planning

 
Cell boundaries must be "soft" in the sense that UA will be allowed to fly, perhaps as 
far as 2 NM, into adjacent cells without changing their frequency assignments.  Soft boundaries are necessary to accommodate UA whose flight paths require frequent crossing of cell boundaries.  In effect, this will enlarge the cells and cause them to overlap.  In some altitude tiers this may require larger K values and thus reduce frequency reuse. 
 
In a system that relies on a predetermined nationwide cellular frequency plan, it is difficult to accommodate temporary deviations from the plan, on relatively short notice, to cope with localized demand surges arising from emergencies or disasters. Each GRS will have been optimized to operate on a particular set of frequencies, and any changes to that set are likely to require time-consuming actions such as retuning of filters. 
 
Cellular frequency planning is very difficult to accomplish without a small and rigidly defined set of channel widths.  If applied to standalone (non-networked) CNPC links, it could greatly reduce the link-design flexibility provided by the variable-channelwidth provisions of Section 2.2.1. 

## H.5 Noncellular Frequency Planning

Although cellular frequency planning would probably be necessary for the design of a large CNPC network, it may be unsuitable for assigning frequencies to standalone CNPC 
links or to links between UA and gapfiller GRS.  The following adverse consequences would be likely to stem from a decision to require standalone and gapfiller links to conform to a cellular frequency plan: 

 
Designer flexibility in tailoring channel widths to the throughput needs of a given 
UAS would be curtailed. 
 
It could prove very difficult to protect adjacent cells against interference emanating from a standalone or gapfiller GRS operating near cell boundaries. 
 
Standalone UA traversing cell boundaries would consume frequency resources in both cells involved, whereas in a noncellular plan a single frequency would often suffice. 
 
Operational flexibility in shifting frequency resources to particular regions to deal with temporary local demand surges would be reduced. 
Consequently, for non-networked standalone and gapfiller CNPC links, a noncellular frequency-reuse planning approach (similar to that used by the FAA for the VHF air/ground ATC radio system, and for navigational aids such as VOR and DME) is recommended. 

## H.6 Interference-Prevention Criteria

Frequency-distance separation rules must be established for each pair of CNPC radio types to establish limits on how closely neighboring CNPC links can be tuned to each other as a function of their physical separation.  Such criteria can be established on the basis of inherent radio parameters, including: 

 
Transmitter output powers, channel widths, and EIRPSD masks 
 
Receiver channel widths and adjacent-channel rejection parameters 
 
Antenna gains, horizontal and vertical beamwidths, polarizations, and orientations. 

## H.7 Terrestrial/Satcom Cnpc Coexistence In C Band

The aeronautical-mobile satellite (route) service (AMS(R)S) has had a spectrum allocation in the 5030–5091 MHz band since 2007.  That allocation allows the creation of a SATCOM CNPC system in that band.  In 2008 a plan was unveiled for providing such a system for UAS in European airspace.  It was envisioned as using the 5030–5050 MHz part of the band for space-to-Earth links and 5071–5091 MHz for Earth-to-space links, leaving 5050–5071 MHz for the remnants of the Microwave Landing System (MLS), which still has an allocation in the band.  However, that SATCOM CNPC system has not yet been deployed or funded. The 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-12) granted an allocation to the AM(R)S throughout the same band.  The only prospective user for that AM(R)S allocation is terrestrial CNPC.  Since the SATCOM and terrestrial allocations exactly coincide in frequency, and the SATCOM system may someday be built, it is important to consider procedures by which they could share the band. If the SATCOM system is built, there are two good reasons for allowing it to use band segments on each end (although not necessarily 20 MHz each as in the 2008 plan): 

 
If the SATCOM system uses frequency-division duplexing, it will need to maximize the frequency separation between its Earth-to-space and space-to-Earth segments, because of filter-design constraints. 
 
International Radio Regulations footnote 5.443C limits AM(R)S EIRP density to –75 dBW/MHz in the adjacent 5010–5030 MHz band, so a significant separation between that band and terrestrial CNPC might be beneficial. 
It is possible, of course, that SATCOM CNPC will never exist in this band, or will exist only in regions outside the U.S.  Band segments should be allocated to SATCOM CNPC only in regions where that service is available.  Where it is not available, the entire band should remain available to terrestrial CNPC. Another band-sharing issue, if SATCOM CNPC becomes a reality, is whether the spectral boundaries between terrestrial and SATCOM CNPC should be static (fixed) or flexible (movable) in frequency.  Static partitions would have two advantages:  first, they would facilitate global harmonization; second, they would enable the development of a common, worldwide filter design for each band segment (SATCOM or terrestrial). On the other hand, flexible partitions would eliminate the need to make a premature, binding decision on terrestrial and SATCOM allocations in the band.  They would allow future adjustments based on observed demand patterns.  They would also allow for the possibility that some regions of the world would use only one of the two types of C Band CNPC link (terrestrial or SATCOM, but not both).  Finally, they would enable the use of a single wideband front-end filter (over the entire 5030–5091 MHz band) that could be used by hybrid terrestrial/SATCOM terminals aboard UA. Consequently, if the 5030–5091 MHz band is ever partitioned into terrestrial and SATCOM CNPC segments, the terrestrial segment should be placed in the middle of the band.  Its boundaries with the SATCOM segments should be flexible rather than static so that they can be shifted in accordance with operational experience, and/or eliminated on a region-by-region basis. 

## Capacity Of C Band Cnpc Spectrum

The capacity of C Band spectrum available for accommodating terrestrial UAS CNPC links in contiguous U.S. (CONUS) airspace has been estimated with the aid of an automated frequency assignment tool.  In this computer simulation, 20,000 hypothetical UAS Ground Radio Systems (GRSs) were placed one by one at random locations within a quasi-rectangular geographical region measuring 1995 nautical miles (NM) from east to west and 1140 NM from north to south.  The approximate area of this region (2,274,000 NM2) is the same as that of CONUS and of the unidentified region considered in the 2008–2009 capacity study described on page 54 of ITU-R Report M.2171. In the simulation, each UA was assumed to fly within a cylindrical service volume (SV) centered on the GRS and fitting entirely within the CONUS-sized region.  A pseudorandom-number generator (PRNG) was used to select each new GRS's location in a manner that gave it a nearly equal probability of being placed at any point satisfying that requirement.  The hypothetical UAS population comprised three classes (small, medium and large) having the characteristics summarized in Table H-1.  The class breakdown (77.1% small, 18.7% medium, and 4.2% large) was the same as in the M.2171 scenario. Each GRS was assumed to have a 10-foot antenna height.

* The "Small" UAS class discussed in this paper is based solely on UA weight and is not limited by the visual-line-of-sight, airspeed, altitude or other non-weight restrictions defined in the Small UAS Rule that the FAA issued in 2016. 

The frequency-assignment methodology used in the simulation was to assign to the CNPC link of each new UAS the lowest available frequency that would not cause RF interference between the new link and the CNPC link of any UAS assigned a frequency earlier in the simulation.  A cellular assignment scheme was not used, for the reasons listed in Section H.5 and also because such schemes had been found counterproductive in previous capacity simulations documented in "Capacity of Spectrum Available for Unmanned-
Aircraft Command and Control Links," F. Box, R. Snow, and L. Globus, ICNS 2016, p. 

8B3-1. The program checked only for cochannel and adjacent-channel interference.  Cosite and intermodulation interference were assumed to be adequately suppressed by measures such as antenna placement and RF filtering rather than by frequency management, and so were not considered in the simulation. Once a frequency assignment was made, it was not changed at any later time.  All assignments were regarded as permanent for the duration of the simulation. The main purpose of the simulation was to determine how many UAS could be accommodated before spectral congestion would make it necessary to deny a frequency to a new UAS.  The total number of UAS that had been given frequency assignments up to that point may be regarded as the "capacity" of the available spectrum. 

## Channel Widths

Different UAS classes will have different channel widths based on their respective data rates and maximum speeds.  Necessary channel width has four components: 

1. The 40-dB bandwidth of the desired signal.  Measured data provided by Rockwell 
Collins in February 2016 (and then used to construct the EIRP spectral density masks in MOPS Section 2.2.1) showed that the 40-dB bandwidth of a GMSK transmitter need not be larger than (230/150) = 1.5333 times the symbol rate.  This yields 40-dB bandwidths of 52.9, 158.7, and 211.6 kHz for small, medium, and large UAS respectively. 
2. An increment equal to the maximum 0.2-ppm frequency inaccuracy allowed in the 
MOPS, multiplied by two (since the inaccuracy could be in either direction), yielding a value of 2 (5.091 x 106) (2 x 10-7) = 2.0364 kHz. 
3. An increment equal to the Doppler shift that could result from UA groundspeed, 
multiplied by two (since the drift could be in either direction), yielding a value of 2 (5.091 x 106) / (2.998 x 108) = 0.03396 kHz, times UA groundspeed in meters per second. 
4. A final increment to round up the channel width to an exact multiple of 5 kHz, as 
required in section 2.2.1. 
For the UAS classes defined above, this process yielded the channel widths shown in Table H-2, which were used in the simulations:

* Wind speed not considered for small and medium UA.  850 knots combined wind and air speed assumed for large UA. ** Medium- and large-UAS channel widths were made slightly larger than necessary, to make them multiples of the small-UAS channel width. 

## Channel Placements

It was assumed that 60 MHz of C Band spectrum (5030.5–5090.5 MHz) is available for terrestrial CNPC links.  The upper and lower 0.5-MHz blocks of the 5030–5091 MHz band were assumed to be reserved for video and/or guardbands.  All UAS types were assumed to have 60-kHz tuning increments.  Assigned frequencies were at channel centers and so had to stay at least 0.5 channel width away from the usable band limits. Small UAS had 1000 frequencies available:  5030.530, 5030.590, …, 5090.470 MHz. Medium UAS had 998 frequencies available:  5030.590, 5030.650, …, 5090.410 MHz. Large UAS had 996 frequencies available:  5030.650, 5030.710,    , 5090.350 MHz. 

## Minimum Allowable Frequency Separation (Mafs) Values

The MAFS between an "undesired" (potentially interfering) transmitter in one CNPC link and a "potential interference victim" receiver in a different CNPC link is a function of: 

 
The undesired transmitter's EIRP, expressed as peu (Watts) or Peu (dBW) 
 
The EIRP, expressed as ped (watts) or Ped (dBW), of the "desired" transmitter from which the receiver is attempting to receive a desired signal 
 
The worst-case (minimum) distance, Du, of the undesired transmitter from the potential victim receiver 
 
The worst-case (maximum) distance, Dd, of the victim receiver from its desired transmitter 
 
The channel widths of the two links. 
The rules used in the simulation were as follows: 

1. If no radio line of sight (RLOS) existed between a transmitter of one link and the 
receiver of another link, cochannel operation was deemed acceptable and no frequency separation was necessary.  (When determining whether a RLOS 
existed, a smooth 4/3 earth was assumed and every UA was assumed to be operating at its SV ceiling.) 

2. If a RLOS did exist but the predicted free-space power flux density of the received 
desired signal (ped /(4Dd2)) equaled or exceeded that of the received undesired 
signal (peu /(4Du2)), then the two links could safely be assigned adjacent 
channels.  The reason is that then the undesired signal within the receiver's 
passband would be attenuated by at least 40 dB, which is deemed sufficient protection against desired-signal fading.  So, in this case, the MAFS between the assigned center frequencies of the two links was the sum of their *half-*channel widths. 
3. If a RLOS existed and the predicted free-space value of the received desired 
signal was *weaker* than that of the received undesired signal, then a larger frequency separation was necessary.  In each such case the two links were required to operate far enough apart that their transmitter masks would have no overlap above their noise floors.  In other words, since the C Band mask in section 2.2.1 of this MOPS shows the noise floor to begin one channel width from the transmitter center frequency, their MAFS was assumed to be the sum of their *full* channel widths.  Additional frequency separation would confer no extra benefit. 
The "dividing line" between cases 2 and 3 is where ped /(4Dd2) = peu /(4Du2).  This corresponds to Du/Dd =  (peu / ped)0.5 = antilog ((Peu - Ped) / 20).  Using this expression, Table H-3 summarizes the MAFS rules for every transmitter/receiver combination susceptible to interference.  These were all ground-to-air or air-to-ground cases. Synchronized TDD protects against CNPC ground-to-ground interference, and also against air-to-air interference except when the UA altitudes are so high that a RLOS can exist even when Du > 437 NM.  In fact, there are such cases in this scenario (for large-tolarge, medium-to-large, and large-to-medium interference), but in each of those cases the free-space value of the received desired signal's power flux density (ground EIRP minus spreading loss) exceeds that of the undesired signal by at least 28 dB, so cochannel operation was still considered acceptable and no MAFS values are shown for those cases in Table H-3. However, in future operational practice, there may be cases in which the desired uplink signals of some high- or medium-altitude UA might not have a sufficient power advantage over undesired downlink signals (arriving from UA more than 437 NM away) to allow cochannel operation.  Any such instances of potential long-distance cochannel air-to-air RFI would have to be taken into account by future CNPC Frequency Assignment Managers on a case-by-case basis.

## Results

The results of the simulation appear in Table H-4.  They show that the 5030.5–5090.5 MHz portion of C Band could accommodate 9,814 mutually non-interfering CNPC links using GMSK radios, and having the characteristics specified earlier, operating in the airspace above a CONUS-sized geographical area.  This value of 9,814 CNPC links may be regarded as the "capacity" of this block of spectrum under the circumstances described earlier.  In the simulation, 7,501 of those links belonged to small UAS, 1,862 to medium UAS, and 451 to large UAS.  These are the numbers of UAS for which CNPC frequencies could be found before any UAS had to be denied a frequency.  Slightly larger numbers of UAS could be accommodated before the tenth and hundredth denials, as indicated in the table.  By the end of the simulation, 20,000 UAS had requested frequencies; 15,212 of those requests had been granted but 4,788 had been denied.

Denial rates rose rapidly in the later stages of the simulation, particularly for medium UAS and even more for large ones.  Of the final 100 frequency requests, only 24 were granted; 22 of those successful requests were from small UAS, two were from medium UAS, and none were from large UAS.  The wide channels, large SVs, and large radio horizons of large UAS make them very hard to shoehorn into a frequency band that has already become congested. Figure H-3 shows an example of spectral occupancy on one assignable frequency (5030.010 MHz) at the end of the simulation.  Thirty-eight UAS (34 small, three medium, and one large) were sharing that frequency within the 1995-by-1140-NM confines of the rectangular region of interest.  In the figure, dots denote GRSs, thick circles represent SV boundaries, and the thinner circles around SVs are radio horizons enclosing areas within RLOS of UA flying at their SV ceilings.  To avoid cochannel interference, every GRS (assumed to have a 10-foot antenna height) had to be at least 1.2310 = 3.9 NM outside the radio horizon of every other UAS, or else the cochannel frequency assignment would not have been made. 

## Observations

As with all simulations, changing the assumptions would change the results.  For example: 

 
Using a different initial seed for the pseudorandom-number generator used in creating the geographical laydown of hypothetical UAS would almost certainly change the results, even if only slightly.  (For example, when the simulation was run a second time, with a different initial seed but with no other changes, a capacity of 9,884 was obtained rather than the 9,814 obtained previously.) 
 
If the assumed statistical geographical distribution of UAS had been nonuniform 
("clumped") rather than uniform as assumed here, it is likely that frequency 
denials would have begun sooner, thus reducing capacity. 
 
Assuming a greater proportion of large UAS, whose SV ceilings are visible over very long distances, would reduce spectral capacity.   
 
Lowering the assumed SV ceiling of one or more UAS classes would shorten interference lines of sight and so would yield higher spectral capacity. 
 
Changing prior frequency assignments when necessary to create spectral "room" 
for new applicants who could not otherwise obtain frequencies might also increase 
capacity.  
 
Making the medium-UAS channel width 165 kHz instead of 180 kHz, and the large-UAS channel width 230 kHz instead of 240 kHz, might increase capacity somewhat while still maintaining compliance with the MOPS.   
 
Using a modulation scheme more spectrally efficient than GMSK would allow even narrower and more numerous channels and thus would certainly increase capacity.   
Such considerations should be kept in mind in the design of future CNPC links and their subsequent deployment within the NAS.  

## Potential L Band Cnpc Operation In Conus In The 1040–1080 Mhz Subband

The aeronautical radionavigation service (ARNS) has a worldwide primary allocation throughout the 960–1215 MHz band, which is heavily utilized by navigational aids (navaids), including distance measuring equipment (DME) and tactical air navigation (TACAN).  An automated frequency-assignment tool was used to assess the feasibility of UAS operation in the 1040–1080 MHz subband and to determine the geographical area where terrestrial UAS CNPC links could potentially be accommodated in the presence of existing navaids.  In these computer simulations, hypothetical UAS ground radio systems (GRSs) were placed one by one at evenly spaced locations within a large portion of CONUS.  Because of time constraints, certain areas of CONUS (e.g., parts of the west coast, southern Texas and Florida, and New England) were not considered. In the simulations, 5,309 cylindrical service volumes (SV) having 10 NM radii and centered on the GRSs were generated for UAS operation.  In order to estimate the capacity of the CNPC system, each of the SVs contained 8 GRSs for a total of 42,472 UAS.  Each GRS within a SV required its own interference-free CNPC frequency.  CNPC operation was allowed on 1,600 frequencies spaced at 25-kHz intervals from 1040.013 to 1079.988 MHz.  Each GRS antenna was assumed to be 10 feet above ground level (AGL).  UA maximum altitudes of 1,000 and 3,000 feet AGL were analyzed in separate simulations. An unclassified March 2012 frequency-assignment database of U.S. and Canadian navaid frequency assignments in the 960–1215 MHz band was used in the simulations.  The database contained the ground-based beacon records with their preexisting transmitter frequencies (which are received by the corresponding airborne interrogators).  The database was modified in order to account also for the paired interrogator transmitter frequencies.  The interrogators were assumed to be operating anywhere within the defined SV of its ground beacon.  Airborne navaid beacons were not considered. The frequency-assignment methodology used in the simulations was to assign to the CNPC link of each new UAS the lowest available frequency that would not cause RF interference between the new link and the existing navaid assignments.  In addition, the program checked for potential interference with the new CNPC link of any UAS assigned a frequency earlier in the simulations. The program checked only for cochannel and adjacent-channel interference.  Cosite and intermodulation interference were assumed to be adequately handled by measures such as RF filtering and antenna placement, and so were not considered in the simulations. 

## Minimum Allowable Frequency Separation (Mafs) Values

The navaid receiver threshold levels and the RF parameters of the UAS were used to determine the required distance separation between the CNPC and airborne navaid receivers operating on the same frequency in cases where UAS was a potential source of interference. 

Pe - Lfs + Gr - Lc + MEF + ASM  T, where Pe is CNPC EIRP (dBm) = 12 dBm (airborne) or 30 dBm (ground) 
Lfs is free-space loss (dB) = 20 log f + 20 log D + 37.8 
f is CNPC frequency in MHz (assumed to be 1060 MHz) D is CNPC-to-TACAN slant range (NM) 
Gr is TACAN receiving-antenna gain (5.4 dBi) 
Lc is cable loss (assumed to be 2.5 dB) 
MEF is 6dB multiple-equipment factor ASM is 6-dB aviation safety margin T is TACAN interference threshold in dBm = –99 dBm It follows that the required minimum standoff distance is 192 NM between a UAS GRS and an airborne navaid receiver, and 24 NM between a UAS ARS and an airborne navaid receiver. This is a theoretical calculation based on an assumption about the maximum undesiredsignal level an airborne TACAN receiver can tolerate.  Appendix P describes a procedure for determining that standoff distance more accurately on the basis of measurements. Nevertheless, since those measurements have not yet been done, the theoretical calculation was used to determine minimum allowable frequency separation (MAFS) rules for use in the simulations.  (Ground-based TACAN receivers are more susceptible than their airborne counterparts to interference and so were given RLOS protection in these simulations, with cochannel CNPC operation prohibited whenever a RLOS existed between the ground-based TACAN and the CNPC transmitter.)  The MAFS rules (and distance thresholds where applicable) are listed below for each case of interest. 

 
CNPC GRS to Airborne Navaid: 
> 192 NM or BRLOS: cochannel operation allowed  192 NM and within RLOS: 2 MHz and 6 MHz required (in separate simulations) 
 
CNPC ARS to Airborne Navaid: 
> 24 NM or BRLOS: cochannel operation allowed  24 NM and within RLOS: 2 MHz and 6 MHz required (in separate 
simulations) 
 
Navaid to CNPC: 

| No RLOS:        |                             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| If RLOS exists: | 1.5 MHz separation required |

 
CNPC (GRS or ARS) to Ground Navaid: 
 
 
No RLOS:  
 
cochannel operation allowed 
 
 
If RLOS exists:  
2 MHz and 6 MHz required (in separate simulations) 
 
CNPC to CNPC:  The MAFS rules for CNPC-to-CNPC cases were based on the undesired-to-desired path distance ratio (Du / Dd) rather than on distance, as shown in the table below.  Only ground-to-air and air-to-ground cases were checked for RFI among CNPC links, since universally synchronized TDD provides adequate protection against RFI between CNPC GRSs and between CNPC ARSs.

## Results

Two different sets of simulations were performed for maximum UA altitudes of 1,000 feet and 3,000 feet AGL, respectively.  For each UA altitude, the program tried to make frequency assignments to UAS according to the rules stated above in such a way that a UA would have either 3 or 11 (in separate simulations) contiguous clear channels.  "N contiguous clear channels" means that the nearest potential navaid source or victim of RFI is P MHz away, where P = (N/2) + 0.5. The results of the simulations appear in Figures H-5 through H-8.  They indicate that a large portion of CONUS, particularly in the middle part of the country, is unavailable for CNPC operation in the 1040–1080 MHz subband under current assumptions.  The main obstacle to making more of CONUS available for UAS operation is the need to protect interrogator receivers that can operate at SV ceilings of up to 60,000 feet AGL.  The potential RFI between CNPC links and ground beacons also limits the geographical area where UAS could have interference-free operation.  The numbers of UA that could be assigned interference-free frequencies in the coverage areas indicated in the four simulations (H-5 through H-8) were 9629, 3517, 4235, and 1016, respectively. The validity of these findings depends heavily on the accuracy of the navaid database (four years old at this writing) that was used in the simulations.  Some of the preexisting assignments could be used on a temporary basis.  It is also possible that the database contains assignments in the 960–1215 MHz band that are not operational but rather "place holders" for paired VOR assignments.  On the other hand, it is also likely that more frequency assignments have been made in this subband since the database was compiled. Further refinement of the database of preexisting navaid assignments would be needed to validate these results.

## Appendix I Dynamic Spectrum Resource Assignment I.1 Overview

An Unmanned Aircraft (UA) must maintain a communications link with the PIC in order for the PIC to have control of the UA.  This link will be for Command and Non-Payload Control (CNPC) Links of the UA.  The FAA will hold or have rights to licenses to various safety critical Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum in the US for PICs to use for these CNPC RF links.  In order for the CNPC RF Links to be able to safely control a UA, an assignment scheme must keep the particular frequencies in use clear from interference by other transmitters and the CNPC Link do not interfere with previously approved spectrum users.  This CNPC Link Assignment Scheme, implemented by a Frequency Assignment Manager, shall assign a particular RF channel bandwidth to a particular UA so that only that UA will be using the assigned RF channel bandwidth for control from Ground Radio System (GRS) sites at any time in any area. There is only a small amount of RF Spectrum available for a CNPC Link compared with the expected number of UA that it will need to support.  Therefore, the CNPC Link Assignment Scheme must be Dynamic in nature.  It must only assign a channel for a short amount of time to any particular UA so that other UAs can use the same channel as soon as it is no longer needed. A CNPC Link assignment will have great value to UAS operators because it is necessary in order to operate.  Discussion on the size of that assignment, i.e., the bandwidth, is given in Appendices E and J. As with the assignment and allocation of any scarce, valuable, public resource and because of its safety-critical nature, the assignment scheme must be well defined and controlled. This appendix provides the framework for a recommended structure to implement a Dynamic CNPC Link Assignment Scheme.  It is anticipated that this scheme would be implemented either by the United States Government or its designated agent or agents with the authority of the FAA; this implementation (as noted above) would be done by a Frequency Assignment Manager.

## I.2.2 General Overview Of Recommended Dynamic Cnpc Assignment Scheme

The recommended Dynamic CNPC Assignment Plan will utilize a central CNPC Assignment Server operated by the FAA or a designated Spectrum Broker on its behalf. UAS PICs will access the server via the internet from wherever they are.  This way it can be accessed from anywhere the PIC may be.  It can be accessed via cellphone or lowbandwidth satellite phone from remote locations or via high-speed broadband connections if available. The CNPC Assignment Server will, using FAA approved algorithms and flight information provided by the PIC (such algorithms and information are discussed in this MOPS but are not fully defined herein), ensure that channel assignments do not result in interference to other CNPC RF Links. The assignments will be for as short a time as possible and will encourage systems that minimize interference with other CNPC links in order to maximize the availability of assignments to as many UAs as possible while maintaining safety. The scheme will include the potential use of L Band and C Band CNPC in all airspace domains, at all altitudes, in both directions, and for all purposes. This will maximize the flexibility of the system to adapt to future changes in the spatial and size distributions of future UA populations, the relative traffic loads of CNPC uplinks and downlinks, and the amounts of usable CNPC Link spectrum in L Band and C Band. It will also allow for better international harmonization and simultaneous L/C Band message transmission. The various protocols described below are representative of those that would ensure a fair and safe allocation of the shared resources. 

## I.3 Details Of Scheme: I.3.1 Detailed Description Of How The Scheme Works

(This section provides a detailed description of exactly how the scheme works) There are two approaches to the operations under discussion.  One uses a distributed computing model, the other takes a centralized approach.  Either way, final safety determination is made by the centralized CNPC Assignment Server. 

## I.3.1.1 Distributed Cnpc Link Assignment Scheme (Das) I.3.1.1.1 Channel Selection

The DAS approach requires that the UAS PIC, using any desired tools (these tools are partly (but not fully) described in this appendix), select a safe frequency channel to use for a flight.  It places the bulk of the burden of finding a usable channel upon the PIC, leaving the CNPC Link Assignment Server to check to see if the selected channel is safe to use in the area and at specific times that the CNPC Link will be used by the Unmanned Aircraft 
 
System (UAS).  The UAS includes the UA and all CNPC Link Access Nodes (transmitters and receivers) that will be used for the flight or portion of the flight covered by the assignment.  Safe implies that its use won't interfere with or be interfered by any other UAS using it or an adjacent channel too close by or any other systems using that frequency. The scheme attempts to minimize the burden on the FAA by only requiring the FAA to maintain a web-based tool that the PIC can access from the Internet to fill in the flight plan information and the desired frequency(ies).  The CNPC Link Assignment Server shall provide the PIC with a database of all assignments, as well as the algorithms in use for accepting or rejecting an assignment.  This will allow the PIC, through use of the tools (referenced above and which will be able to access the CNPC Link Assignment Server), to know what frequencies are available for potential flights. The first-come, first served nature of the scheme and time-limits for requests would help to establish prioritization between UAS users that need to make use of CNPC Link channels. 

## I.3.1.1.2 Approved Channel Types

There are expected to be many different requirements of CNPC links to support different kinds of UAS and UAS missions.  There is also an assumption that CNPC links will improve with efficiency over time, just as manned aircraft have since their inception over a century ago.  Therefore, the requirement for the CNPC link is that any size channel can be requested so that different waveforms and the needed information transfers, during various portions of the flight and during emergency situations, can be supported.  The waveform to be used must be approved and have its key information on record.  The CNPC radio MOPS shall meet the compatibility requirements specified in this document, and include specific RF compatibility information required for Dynamic CNPC Assignment planning including: 

 
Signal bandwidth  
 
Maximum transmitter power 
 
Receiver sensitivity 
 
Antenna patterns for all transmitters and receivers, air and ground 
During the CNPC Link Channel request process, the waveform shall be specified as well as antenna patterns and locations of all transmitters and receivers, both in the air and on the ground.  Locations shall be specified in a 3-dimensional volume including minimum and maximum altitude of UA. 

## I.3.1.1.3 Allotment Of Channels That Can Be Assigned To A Uas

In the scheme, a particular UAS mission (UA, PIC, and set of GRS used) shall hold no more than 2 primary channel assignments at any time.  Notionally, before takeoff, the PIC can obtain 1 primary and 1 backup channel assignments (The up and down links could use difference frequency channels).  Upon takeoff, the PIC can obtain an assignment for a second primary and backup channel.  Assignment of more than 1 or 2 backup channels 
                                                     
 
 
may be permitted in the future if it is shown that they are required for safe flight.  The PIC and UA can use the backup channel at any time to ensure a safe CNPC Link. The first channel assignment is for use where the UA is currently flying, the second is for where it is going next.  The PIC must close out a channel before being eligible to obtain another so that it never has more than 2 sets (primary and backup) of channels open at any time except during times when the UA is transitioning from connecting with one GRS to another.  In that case, each UA would be assigned four channels but only just before and just after establishing connections with a new GRS. A two primary channel assignment scheme would allow the UA to obtain a channel assignment for part of a flight path, even if no single channel is clear all the way from current location to destination.  The second one would allow it to be certain of a new channel to fly into without concern for not getting one when it gets to a new location. Included with the primary channels may be one or more backup channels if necessary for a safety case. Backup channel assignments may be closed and new ones opened independent of primary channel assignments. 

## I.3.1.1.4 Fail Safe Closure Of An Assignment

An assignment is held from the time issued until the PIC closes it.  The PIC shall explicitly close out the assignment under the following conditions: 

1) If the UA is not airborne within 20 minutes of the assignment being approved. 2) Within 1 minute of the UA landing 3) Before the Pilot can obtain another channel once the UA has the maximum 
allotted number of assignments.   
The internet connections between the PIC and the CNPC Assignment Server may be marginally reliable.  This is because the internet system provides a "best-effort" service, not a deterministic connection.  Some PICs may be located in areas with very unreliable connections.  Among the less reliable PIC to CNPC Assignment Server communications links would be cellular and satellite wireless data systems. CNPC assignments do not expire until the CNPC Assignment Server receives an explicit closure of the assignment from the PIC.  This provides a fail-safe guarantee that another UAS won't be accidently be assigned a conflicting CNPC assignment, even if there are unreliable internet connections. Further guaranteeing safety, no UA shall be permitted to fly outside the 3-dimensional volume specified for the CNPC Link Channel Assignment.  If no new assignment is available in a new volume that the UA wants to fly in, the UA shall remain in the assigned volume, landing if necessary.  This does place a constraint on UA flight plans in that there shall always be a suitable landing location within the area of every CNPC assignment. The CNPC Assignment Server shall compute interference upon the first request in the queue based upon the active channel assignments active at the time the request processing begins.  It shall update its database with any closed assignments between processing each new request.  This means that there may be some requests that were valid when they were sent to the CNPC Assignment Server, however, they may be rejected when the CNPC processes the request because there may have been changes to the assignments during the delay between request and processing of the request. 

## I.3.1.1.5 Example Of Flight Assignments I.3.1.1.5.1 Initial Assignment

The PIC can obtain one primary and backup channel assignments prior to takeoff.  Then the PIC can obtain another primary and backup channel assignment once airborne to handle flight later in the mission.   

## I.3.1.1.5.2 Changing Backup Channels As Necessary

As the UA flies around the area of the assignments, the PIC can request different backup channels if measurements indicate that the primary or backup channels have interference on them that could impair the safety of their usage. 

## I.3.1.1.5.3 Moving Out Of Assignment Area

When the UA moves out of an area with its associated set (primary and back-up) of channel assignments, the PIC can close the assignment.  Prior to that close-out, the PIC would have obtained a new set of channel assignments for the next area and ensured that the UA has established a good connection with the GRS for that new area.  This procedure of closing one assignment following opening a new one is critical; it permits the old assignment to be given to another UA and ensures connections to a GRS before, during, and after the transitioning from one area to another 

## I.3.1.1.5.4 Closing Out Assignment

When the UA lands it no longer needs the flight safety critical CNPC assignment, therefore, the PIC must close out the assignment as soon as the UA is safely off the active runway. 

## I.3.1.1.6 Contention Resolution

Contention for multiple UAS requesting interfering channels will be settled by first come, first served based upon when the requests are received at the assignment website.  Since the CNPC Assignment Server only approves or disapproves an assignment, The PIC must then make another request if a request is disapproved.  This encourages the PIC to analyze the current usage and only request a likely channel assignment.  Knowing the algorithms and information in the database used by the CNPC Assignment Server will enable a suitably equipped PIC to only make requests that have a high probability of being approved.  Third party manufactures could develop such tools that could help a PIC make requests that have would have a greater likelihood of being approved. But the responsibility for resolving contention will be with the PIC and the tool manufacturers, not the FAA or spectrum brokers.  The FAA or spectrum broker(s) are only responsible for approving assignments based on safety given existing assignments at the time the request is made.  The first come first served policy in the scheme handles all contention.  PICs and companies are permitted and encouraged to develop technology to improve their chances of obtaining CNPC assignments because such technology will improve the overall efficiency of utilization of the scarce CNPC spectrum.  More efficient utilization of this scarce resource is more beneficial to society as a whole. Fees proportional to the interference footprint that a CNPC Link System causes as part of its channel assignment may be levied.  These fees, if implemented, shall be proportional to the amount of bandwidth requested and the cubic volume of the region the Airborne Radio Systems (ARS) and Ground Radio Systems (GRS) will radiate emissions over. Fees can also be assessed for each channel request by a PIC. 

## I.3.1.1.7 Feedback To Cnpc Assignment Server

The PIC may be rewarded for providing link status information to the CNPC Assignment Server. This link status information will be available to the CNPC servers for use in improving interference algorithms for determining suitability of channel assignments. The PIC shall report all times in which link outages cause the CNPC link to enter a Lost CNPC Link state due to interference. 

## I.3.1.2 Central Assignment Scheme (Cas)

Another approach that has been discussed is to place all responsibility upon the CNPC Assignment Server to provide a CNPC Link channel to a UAS. The CAS, while more traditional will place the burden upon the FAA or Spectrum Broker to determine who flies and who doesn't in situations where there are insufficient spectrum resources to meet the requests. CAS schemes will need to develop approaches for the CNPC Assignment Server to deal with an inability to find a suitable channel to meet a request. Because of many burdens, such as those mentioned above, it is expected that this approach may not be developed. 

## I.3.2 Detailed Description Of How The Scheme Handles The Necessary Features Of An Assignment Scheme

This discussion currently focuses only on the DAS. 

## I.3.2.1 Goal Of Scheme

The goal of the scheme is to provide equal, fair access to the CNPC Link spectrum for any UAS, large or small.  It rewards UAS operators that invest in making more efficient use of the spectrum but still enables low-budget operations to allow UAS to benefit the general public to the maximum extent possible. 

## I.3.2.2 Priority Approach

Priority is based on First Come, First Served approach.  A UAS PIC can only make one CNPC Link channel request at a time and can only make the request within 20 minutes of takeoff.  An assignment goes away and the requester goes to the end of the queue if the request is rejected or the UA has not taken off in 20 minutes. 

## I.3.2.3 Definition Of Resource

The CNPC resource is defined as a frequency and bandwidth for flight within a specified area for an amount of time.  In addition to the frequency assignment, there is an associated frequency interference footprint.  The frequency interference footprint is defined as frequency bandwidth and the geographic surface area and altitude range that is precluded from being used by another UAS mission. Frequency assignments must be obtained for all primary and backup channels that the UA requires to fly safety. 

## I.3.2.4 Duration Of Assignment

The assignment starts when the assignment approval is sent by the Frequency Assignment Manager.  It ends when the PIC closes it out. 

 
The PIC must Close the assignment when: 

a) The UA has landed (it is mandatory that the PIC close out the assignment when 
the UA lands. Another assignment is necessary before the UAS can take off again. 
b) The UA has not taken of within 20 minutes of assignment approval.  
The PIC may Close an assignment when: 

a) The UAS has left the assigned airspace, is using a different assignment, and does 
not plan to re-enter the airspace.   

## I.3.2.5 Cost Function

Mechanisms must be implemented in the scheme to encourage users who allow other users to share the spectrum and discourage those whose usage prevents other users from using the limited resource that they all must share. There is an implied cost function and an optional monetary one with this scheme. The implied cost function is that a PIC requesting a CNPC Link channel that is hard to fit in will have a high chance of it being rejected, hence delays before takeoff.  Conversely, a PIC requesting a CNPC Link channel that is easy to fit in will have a higher chance of it being assigned successfully and being able to fly. In the event that the UAS is already in flight, a difficult request to continue could require the UAS to halt the mission and land if a needed channel is not available.  The PIC has choices to reduce the amount of area to cover, request less bandwidth, or compute optimal times and locations to fly that will have fewer conflicts for the CNPC Link spectrum.  This cost function enables the FAA/Frequency Assignment Manager to avoid having to decide who flies and who doesn't.  It also provides financial value, encouraging UAS operators to invest in methods that promote more efficiently use of the scarce CNPC Link spectrum, giving them a higher probability of flying when they need to instead of sitting on the ground losing money. A monetary cost function is optional where the PIC would be assessed a fee based on the size of the interference footprint of the request as well as the length of time of the requested footprint.  Examples might be that there is a fee of $1/hour per 1,000 square miles of interference area blocked from the ground to mission altitude plus $0.20 per a specified channel width requested. 

## I.3.2.6 Method To Assess Whether Safety Issue Exists For Channel

The PIC must determine what channel it is assigned.  A method shall describe how that decision is reached.  This includes both the technical mechanism that determines that no interference will result from turning on either GRS or ARS as well as how other users will know how to avoid interfering with the CNPC Link by turning on their transmitters. The PIC will log in to a secure public facing internet website with the following features: 

1) Database display of active CNPC Link spectrum assignments and flight plans 2) Detailed specification describing the method in which interference conflicts are 
computed by the Frequency Assignment Manager.  This may change with time but the method is described. 
3) An automated input method for the PIC to enter a flight plan as well as the CNPC 
Link spectrum request 
4) Feedback mechanism to permit UAS PICs to provide real-time and post-flight insitu interference measurement results to the spectrum database in order to improve the interference computational algorithms. 
Interference shall be determined by the schemes established in Section 2.2.1 of the CNPC MOPS. It can notionally follow the following development path. Day 1 - Spectrum will be divided between the FAA UAS test sites so that they won't interfere with each other.  Each test site will be responsible for ensuring that no interference exists. First nationwide scheme - A Cellular frequency plan will be used as discussed in Appendix H.  Note that it will be preferable if requests are not for spectrum that is not permitted in the Cellular frequency plan or the requests will not be approved.  This scheme won't be particularly aggressive about frequency reuse in order to favor safety, simplicity, and timelines over efficiency.  Minimum separation rules for UAS and GRS shall be specified in addition to frequency assignments for this kind of scheme. Future nationwide scheme - A software tool implementing real time computation of interference susceptibility of a new UAS request against all existing CNPC Link assignments will be developed.  This tool will use various modeling and analyses techniques to compute interference by and upon a proposed spectrum assignment with worst-case conditions for all existing assignments.  From the analysis, an approval or disapproval shall be returned to the requester. Follow-on improvements - As comfort and experience with the interference susceptibility scheme matures, safety margins and resolution will be modified in the computational algorithms used to determine interference as needed. Feedback from operational UAS on link quality will be available to assist with the development of these follow-on improvements. 

## I.3.2.7 Role Of Faa And/Or Frequency Assignment Manager

A detailed description of the role and responsibilities of the FAA and any Frequency Assignment Managers that may be involved in the scheme The FAA shall publish the rules for Dynamic CNPC Link System Assignment. The FAA shall make any designations to 3rd parties to act as Frequency Assignment Manager if necessary. The Frequency Assignment Manager shall maintain the public facing internet website and computational engines that determine whether interference exists for new CNPC Link System channel assignments, approves or rejects the requests, and maintains the real-time assignment data base.  The website will also include the assignment algorithms and accept feedback in a standardized format for reporting actual measured signal quality both in real-time and as summary logs from flights. 

## I.3.2.8 Role Of Uas Pic

Note that the bulk of the requirements upon the PIC are anticipated to be handled in an automated manner using an ordinary desktop computer for non-real-time and non-critical functions. The UAS PIC shall: 
 

1) Maintain a communications channel (internet connection) with the Frequency 
Assignment Manager.  The reliability of this link is not critical but it is necessary to make frequency assignments. 
2) Make requests to the Frequency Assignment Manager for a Channel Assignment 
and obtain an approval prior to the ground CNPC Link Access Nodes or air transmitters transmitting on the assigned channel. 
3) Ensure that the UAS under control remains inside the geographical area 4) Ensures that a safe landing area exists within flight range of the UAS at all times 
until the UAS lands 
5) Notify the Frequency Assignment Manager when the UAS takes off, when it 
lands, when the assignment is no longer needed and is ready to be closed.  Note that charges will continue to accrue for the continued use of the channel until the Frequency Assignment Manager receives confirmation that the PIC has closed the channel, making it desirable (but not critical) that the link with the Frequency Assignment Manager be as robust as reasonable. 
6) Notify the Frequency Assignment Manager in the event of any deviations from the 
filed flight plan including loss of link, flight beyond the filed geographic limits, and safety-related equipment failures. 
7) Notify the Frequency Assignment Manager in the event that a handover to a 
different person as PIC has occurred. 
8) Maintain and report to the Frequency Assignment Manager either in real-time or a 
post-flight log of the flight including CNPC Link signal strength with CNPC Link access nodes from both the CNPC Link Access Nodes and airborne receivers, precise position and time intervals, and CNPC Link access node in primary control of UAS. 
The PIC may subscribe to 3rd party agents or purchase software that may provide services to assist in obtaining a CNPC Link channel assignment and carrying out the requirements on the PIC role.  At no time will the responsibility for safe flight operations be transferred from the PIC. Among the possible services might be: 

1) Communications with the Frequency Assignment Manager (e.g. phone services if 
no internet is available) 
2) Determining CNPC Link channels to request 3) Operating ground CNPC Access Nodes or networks of nodes to actually 
communicate with the UAS 

## I.3.2.9 To Whom Assignment Is Made

It is essential to clearly specify to whom or what entity, the assignment is made. The assignment is assigned to a UAS for the duration of a specified flight.  It covers all CNPC Link GRS and ARS and their associated transmitters and receivers necessary for safe operation of the UAS as specified out in the UAS flight plan. GRS do not necessarily need to belong to the UAS PIC, however, the spectrum assignment will still be tied to the UAS flight.  Any 3rd party GRS can broker spectrum and flight plans on behalf of the PIC but the PIC is ultimately responsible and the assignment is for the UAS flight. 

## I.3.2.10 Contingency Plans When All Fails

Since the CNPC Link is a safety-critical system, describe the contingency plans that will go in affect when all other things fail.  Failures should result in a safe but not necessarily convenient state whenever possible. Safety features in the distributed plans are: 

1) Failsafe frequency assignments:  No transmitter shall radiate without a frequency 
assignment confirmation made no more than 20 minutes prior to takeoff. 
2) No new assignments shall be made that interfere with any active assignments. 3) No assignment will be assumed to be closed by the Frequency Assignment 
Manager until it receives positive notification by the PIC. 
 

## Appendix J Data Rates J.1 Introduction

This appendix provides estimates for data rates for a single UA. This estimation analyzed the Control, Navigational Aids (Navaids), ATC Voice Relay, ATS Data Relay, Weather Radar, and Target Data components of the control and non-payload communications (CNPC) data link, as indicated in Section 1 and Appendix F.  The CNPC link considered in this appendix is between a single fully equipped generic unmanned aircraft (UA) operating in non-segregated airspace, and the pilot who will be remotely operating the aircraft from a PS. The throughput calculations are determined by considering the data loading and overhead associated with the Terminal Departure, En Route and Terminal Arrival phases of flight. For each phase of flight, the throughput was calculated for both uplink and downlink communications with the pilot operating an unmanned aircraft (UA) in manual or automatic mode.  Manual mode means the pilot is directly controlling the UA's control surfaces and other operational functions. Automatic operation means the pilot is indirectly controlling the UA control surfaces and operational functions by commanding a processor onboard the UA. Section J.2 of this paper gives an overview of the internal and external non-payload information flows of a generic UAS.  The information in Section J.3 describes the sources of data loading during the three phases of flight for upload and download communications in both manual and automatic mode. In Section J.4 we estimate overhead added by the data link protocol and security constraints and add them to the data-loading numbers to obtain values for total throughput in Bytes per second (B/sec). Section J.5 describes notional service classes based on estimated UA equipage. Section J.6 depicts the results from a series of simulations, which were used to size the data rates based on operations of a realistic link.  Section J.7 uses the data rates from the previous section and builds example data classes, based on a prototype data link implementation. 

## J.2 Information Flows

Figure J-1 illustrates the basic non-payload internal and external information-exchange requirements of a UA system (UAS).  These include: 

 
A pilot at a pilot station (PS) sending and receiving Control data consisting of telecommands and non-payload telemetry 
 
Data uploaded and received from navigational aids (Navaids) receivers 
 
Target data provided by the UAS's detect-and-avoid (DAA) system 
 
Other non-payload surveillance data, including weather radar data and video images 
 
Air traffic control (ATC) voice messages that the UA must relay to and from its pilot 
 
ATS data that the UA must also relay. 
 Figure J-2 depicts the CNPC information flows between the pilot and the UA.  These are the information flows whose throughput requirements are estimated in this appendix. Note, Figure J-2 also shows the direction of information flow between the pilot and UA. 

## J.3 Data Loading Requirements J.3.1 Control Link

Analysis of data loading for the Control Links and Navaids is based on North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 4586 Draft Edition 3, which defines message types, structures, and bit sizes for NATO-interoperable UAS control links. Civil aviation will not be required to conform to STANAG 4586, but the standard does provide a basis for characterizing the data loading and bit rates associated with control and Navaids messages for this report. Control links consists of the uplink telecommands from the pilot operating in either manual or automatic mode.  Telecommands consist of pilot commands sent to the UA to control the UA's control surfaces (ailerons, elevator, rudder or flaps), other controls such as the operation of the communications equipment (radio or transponders) and other functions like extending or retracting landing gear, or turning on or off navigational lights. The control link also consists of the downlink telemetry information from the UA to the pilot operating in either manual or automatic mode.  Telemetry information consists of UA attitude information (airspeed, elevation and direction) communications equipment settings, and status of other operational equipment (gear up/down, navigational lights on/off). A summary of the STANAG control messages and their associated bytes per message for each phase of flight are shown in Addendum A-1. Combining these bytes per message times the Message Group Rate found in the tables in addendum C yields the data rates shown in Addendum C. 

## J.3.2 Navaids

Navaids data includes the pilots uplink commands necessary to control the UA's navigation receivers and the downlink data from the navigation receivers to the pilot's display.  Navaids communications can take place in manual or automatic modes. A summary of the STANAG Navaids messages and their associated bytes per message for each phase of flight are shown in Addendum B-1. Combining these bytes per message times the Message Group Rate found in the tables in addendum C yields the data rates shown in Addendum C. 

## J.3.3 Atc Voice Relay

ATC Voice Relay discussed in assumed ATC communications in 2030 would be in a digital format similar to the design of VDL Mode 3. The VDL Mode 3 produces 4133 bps message appended with 667 bps of overhead to yield a 4800 bps message throughput. The vocoder frames would be packed for transmission over the CNPC link.  Each vocoder frame is 96 bits in length, and represent 20ms of voice.  Five (5) vocoder frames would be packed into single transmissions unit, 5 x 96 = 480 bit (60 byte) frame, which would contain 100 ms. of voice.  With a 10Hz update rate the result would be 4800 bits (600 bytes) of data and 1 second for voice. The tables in Addendum C list ATC Voice Relay data loading for each phase of flight. The 60 bytes indicated represents the data for each frame and when the Message Group Rate of 10 Hz is factored in the resulting data rate is 600 Bytes/sec. 

## J.3.4 Ats Data Relay

A nationwide system providing ATS data services of various kinds is expected to be in place by the 2020s. It seems likely that the messages associated with those services will need to be relayed to and from the pilot via the UA.  The messages contain aircraft addresses, so each UA need relay only messages addressed to it. The analysis of the data-loading requirements for each kind of ATS message is based on the findings of [4].  Our detailed results appear in Tables J-1 and J-2.  Unlike other parts of the analysis, these tables take overhead into account, because overhead is embedded in the results presented in [4].  Table J-1 quantifies the amount of data transmitted in each "instance" of the use of a given ATS data service.  (For example, there are five 190-byte UA-to-CS messages and three 129-byte CS-to-UA messages per D-FLUP instance.) Table J-2 combines that information with the number of instances per UA per operational phase (also given in Table J-1) to quantify the data rate per UA in each phase.  The values presented in Table J-2 are based on the relative phase durations postulated in [5] and listed in the footnotes of Table J-2.  Shorter or longer assumed phase durations for particular phases would yield proportionately higher or lower ATS data rates.

Since ATS data transmission is a method of transmitting digital data to the pilot, in lieu of communicating the same information via voice communication.  This data rate study only considers the case of transmitting the ATS Data in lieu of voice communications during the short transfer time of the ATS Data message, and thus ATS Data are not included in the aggregate data rate calculations.  A majority of the ATS Data messages could be sent within 200 ms., and the largest (4DTRAD) would take 3.2 sec. 

## J.3.5 Target Data

The target data is used to support Detect and Avoid (DAA) functions, specifically the use of a traffic display in the Pilot Station, through the Control and Non-Payload Communication (CNPC) datalink. These target messages would propose an upper bound on the bandwidth used by DAA for sending tracks from an airborne processor to the traffic display. Two summary tables are depicted below.  Table J-3 depicts an example message based on the position of the target relative to the UA.  Table J-4 depicts an example message based on absolute position of the target.

Up to sixty (60) traffic messages will be sent down the CNPC datalink (telemetry link) for the purpose of display on the traffic display. Traffic messages will be updated once per second. Based on the example traffic messages, the traffic message size used for aggregate data calculations in this appendix will use 128 bits per traffic message. 

## J.3.6 Weather Radar

An airborne weather radar data downlink provides meteorological information from the UA to the pilot on the ground. To estimate the data loading requirement, a compression method is used. The compression method breaks the radar scan up into 194 bins of roughly equal area, and the raw ARINC 708 data are aggregated into a 4-bit reflectivity and 4-bit turbulence value for each bin.  The data size for each weather radar data message is therefore 194 bytes, without any margin or overhead. The images in the flight trial were further enhanced, and consisted of 294 Bytes per image that included both reflectivity and turbulence. The minimum requirement for weather radars is two full sweeps in 20 seconds, but a typical airborne weather radar conducts a full sweep every 4 seconds. For our data calculations, we will send one complete image every five seconds.  The image size is rounded up to 300 Bytes for this message.  The image will be broken into five segments of 60 Bytes each and appended with a 5 Byte header (timestamp and a counter).  These messages will be sent once per second.  

## J.4 Overhead And Throughput J.4.1 Control, Navaids, Atc Voice And Target Data J.4.1.1 Internet Protocol And Security Overhead

Figure J-3, below shows how the headers for Control, Navaids, ATC Voice and Target Data from a UA using the Internet Protocol (IP) can be efficiently compressed.  
The headers can be reduced into three components: 

1. The compressed IP network (L3) headers. 2. The transport (L4) headers, encryption overhead (optional L3 Security) and user data. 
(See overhead discussion in Section D.7). 3. The ESP trailer with a 64-bit HMAC used for authentication. 
Compression of the IP headers can be achieved with a protocol such as Robust Header Compression (ROHC), which is able to reduce the multiple IP headers and the ESP extension header to a few bytes in the optimal case. Certain conditions can cause this value to be larger. For example, full headers must be sent initially to establish the framework for the receiver to be able to decompress the headers.  Also as the RF link experiences temporary interruptions, the need to send a larger header to maintain sync with the decompressor increases. Establishing this context can be construed as extending the setup time of a link, where a connection is established and an IP address obtained. Figure J-3, does not show transport headers as being compressed. This is to assume the worst case where encryption is used which would encrypt both the user data and the transport headers, masking them from the header compressor. Should no encryption be used (NULL Encryption) the message would still be authenticated and compression of the transport headers becomes possible. The ESP trailer consists primarily of a 64-bit, 8-byte integrity check value (ICV) derived from truncating a 128-bit AES-GCM ICV as recommended by Leidos. NIST SP800-38D specifies that a minimum 64-bit short tag is sufficient to protect 4+ billion packets of up to 32K bytes of data before a new key must be generated.  This length is presumed to be sufficient to protect a communication session at the CNPC link's low data rates for days. Should data rates significantly increase in the future, a longer tag should be used for the authentication data, for example 96-bits or 128-bits. In addition to the ICV, the ESP trailer also contains 2 bytes of bookkeeping and an additional 0-3 bytes of padding in order to align the ICV on a 4-byte boundary. This brings the total size of the trailer to 10-13 bytes. The overhead calculations are based on using IPSec ESP Transport mode to provide endto-end integrity and optionally confidentiality of the data session between the CS and the UA. The L3 Security header labeled "Encryption (optional)" in Figure 3, will provide data encryption, however, the data will still be authenticated if the L3 Security is not used. Electing to encrypt the data adds additional overhead. For example, when using a 128-bit AES-GCM encryption stream cipher there is an additional 8 bytes of overhead appended to the user data after the ESP header. The extra 8 bytes is a 64-bit (8-byte) initialization vector (IV). Since Leidos recommended encryption for all traffic, L3 Security overhead has been incorporated in all overhead calculations. 

## J.4.1.2 Message Packing For Control And Navaids Stanag Messages

Many of the Control and Navaids STANAG messages being sent are small and must be sent at fixed intervals. Thus, even with header compression in use it is important to combine messages in order to reduce network overhead. The STANAG standard allows for combining messages up to 576 bytes (including packet headers). This guideline is derived from the minimum Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) an IP network must be able to handle. While this guideline is valid for IPv4, IPv6 has a minimum link MTU of 1280 octets. Figure J-4 shows how several message types being sent at different rates could be combined with the goal of producing the largest possible messages while still preserving the timeliness of each message type. In this example, by shifting the two and five hertz messages, an alternative arrangement could have been made where no more than two messages were combined. However, the end result would be less efficient in terms of network overhead. Also, no matter the combination of rates, all message types can be combined for one occurrence and results in the largest message. 



Thus, in the example provided in figure J-4, the 20 Hz message type must be sent 14 times without any other message attached. This reduced value becomes the compressed message group rate, and will be used to calculate the combined total rate of message data. The STANAG message, as defined in NATO STANAG (Edition 3) December 15, 2008, contains a 16 byte header, a 5 byte time stamp, a 1 to 5 byte presence vector, and the aggregate data of the message fields sent.  The 16 byte header can be compressed to 2 bytes, containing only a message type field, reducing each STANAG message by 14 bytes. The frequency of each message type depends on the phase of flight and the mode of operation, either manual or automatic.  Table A-1, located in Addendum A shows STANAG message types and sizes. Tables A-2 thru A-7, shows the recommended downlink message types and fields by phase of flight. Addendum B shows the same for the Navaids messages in the same format. 

## J.4.1.3 Total Data Rates (Control/Navaids, Atc Voice Relay, Target Data)

Data requirements are calculated using the overhead numbers generated from header compression and security overhead calculated above, along with the message-packing scheme presented for the user data.  Utilizing these numbers, the total amount of data generated every second can be estimated for command and control, Navaids, ATC Voice Relay and Target Data in various modes and phases of flight. Since the Terminal (arrival) Phase downlink in manual mode has shown to have the highest data demands, it will be used as the example for explanation in Table J-5 below. The first two lines of Table J-5, show the requirements for Target Data and ATC Voice respectfully. The next four lines represent the different groups of STANAG messages for Control and Navaids. The first column labeled "Message Group Rate" represents the number of times a second the associated group of messages are sent in a given second. Since Target Data and ATC Voice are sent individually their message group rate is equal to the actual rates that were specified in Sections J.3.3 and J.3.5 respectfully. But due to the message-packing scheme, the rates for the STANAG message groups reflects the true number of occurrences of that combination of messages sent every second. For example, the type 4000 message is sent 20 times a second, but can be combined with at least one of the other messages at six different occasions, hence the type 4000 message is only sent independently 14 times a second. Also the "STANAG 4586: Types 4000, NAVAID" line represents the 23-byte NAVAID message sent at 5 Hz combined with the 
27-byte Type 4000 message sent at 20 Hz, produces 50 bytes of data that is transmitted 4 times a second.  
Section J.4.1.1, clarified the overhead components and their sizes for the L3 Headers, L4 Headers, L3 Security and ESP Trailers, the summation of these 4 components result in the message group's total overhead. The L3 Security is optional, if it is used, the total data rate of 3049 bytes/s switches to 3322 bytes/s, roughly an 8%, increase in overhead. The Data Rate is calculated by adding the Total Overhead with the size of the User Data, then multiplying the sum by the Message Group Rate. The Required Data Rate (3314 bytes/s) is then calculated by adding 10% to the summation of all the Data Rates. 

When provisioning network capacity, it is best practice to provide a margin or "over provision" a link. Even with careful planning, a network cannot sustain 100% capacity without negatively impacting queuing delay and degrading performance. A general rule for core routers is to provide a 10% margin. However, this guideline is for links exceeding 1 Gbps. Another study shows us that for links less than 1 Gbps, the level of link utilization that can be sustained cannot be estimated by a simple guideline. The same study supports the 10% figure for links greater than 1Gbps. Since the traffic being generated is not highly variable, we take 10% as a satisfactory starting point for the amount of additional margin needed.

## J.6 Data Rate Simulation Results

This section contains results from a series of simulations, which were used to size the data rates based on operations of a realistic link.  The service classes depicted in each of the tables is based on the notional service classes defined in Section J.5 of this appendix. In each of the following tables (Table J-9 - J-16), twenty (20) simulations were conducted using different random variations between data generation times and the CNPC frames, which produced a range of output values.  In each plot, the solid line represents the average of the 20 values.  The shaded region represents the range between the maximum and minimum values recorded for the simulations.  The upper plots in each table, labeled "Average Delay" on the vertical axis depicts the steady state message latency. The lower plots in each table, labeled "Recovery Time" on the vertical axis depicts the case of a burst of traffic in a high priority message queue being filled to capacity and overflowing.  The recovery time in these plots is defined as the amount of time required once the burst stops until the average delay returns to the value measured before the burst occurred.  The burst results are based on a queue size of five (5) messages. The dotted "black" vertical line is a recommended Message Data Payload size, taking into consideration the average and burst message delays depicted in these plots, aligning on byte boundaries, and signal-bandwidth considerations, described in Section J.7 of this appendix.  This "black" line depicts the Message Data Payload sizes implemented in the prototype system.

## J.7 Notional Data Classes

Message Data Payload sizes from Section J.6 were used to build notional data classes, based on a prototype data link implementation.  The simulation results depicted in Section J.6 were used to determine a consolidated number of Data Classes, without creating a Data Class for each of the Service Classes and their associated Manual/Auto mode and Uplink/Downlink data flow. Table J-17 summarizes the symbol rates for the four data classes and the associated service class(es) covered by the data class symbol rate.  The symbol rates for the uplink modes are also depicted in this table. Tables J-18 thru J-21 indicate the details of the symbols within each of the Data Classes. The Message Data Payload sizes from Section J.6 are broken out as L3 Message, L2 Ohd/Hdr, and CRC, in bits.

## Appendix K Uas Cnpc Link System Required Link Performance Introduction

This appendix discusses the Required Link performance (RLP) of the UAS Control and Non-Payload Communications (CNPC) Link System when used to support the safetycritical functions of the UAS and how that RLP depends on the level of automatic operation of those functions.  Following introductory material in Sections K.2 and the methodology of the approach used to determine the required RLP in Section K.3, Section K4 uses a combination of flight test data captured at altitudes and ranges that are representative of anticipated UAS operations as well as modeling and simulation to develop the temporal path attenuation characteristics that will exist between the antennas of the CNPC Link System.  These characteristics enable the CNPC Link System interruption characteristics (availability and continuity) to be determined.  These link statistics are then combined with an example safety assessment and an example timeline associated with the key activities of the various functions to: 

 
Section K.5.  Assess if the CNPC Link System can safely support DAA Remain- Well-Clear (RWC) Pilot-in-the-Loop (PITL) with informational display (the minimum level of automatic DAA operation); 
 
Section K.6.  Assess if the CNPC Link System can safely support UAS Command and Control; 
 
Section K.7.  Assess if the CNPC Link System can safely support ATS data relay, weather radar, and video services; 
 
Section K.8.  Assess the relationships between CNPC Link System RLP 
parameters and levels of automatic operation of supported functions. 
Since the Required Link Performance is dependent on levels of automatic operation as well as the architecture of the UAS and its operating environment no specific RLP can be provided however the examples in this appendix should help guide UAS designers and regulators in the assessment of specific systems. Section K.9 identifies design and operational mitigations to help minimize the impact of CNPC Link System impairments and Section K.10 provides conclusions and recommendations based on the preceding analysis. 

## Definition

Required Link Performance (RLP).  RLP is a specification of the CNPC Link System, availability, continuity, transaction expiration time, transaction time, and integrity performance necessary for operation within in a defined airspace. RLP Availability (A).  The probability that an operational transaction supported by the CNPC Link System can be initiated when needed.  
RLP Continuity (C).  The probability that an operational transaction supported by the CNPC Link System can be completed within the transaction expiration time given that the CNPC Link System was available at the start of the transaction RLP Transaction Expiration Time.  The safety related maximum time for the completion of the operational transaction supported by the CNPC Link System after which the initiator is required to revert to an alternative procedure. 

RLP Transaction Time.  The nominal time for the completion of the operational transaction supported by the CNPC Link System. 

RLP Integrity (I).  The probability that an operational transaction supported by the CNPC 
Link System is completed with no undetected errors 

Note: While RLP integrity is defined in terms of the "goodness" of the CNPC Link 
System capability, it is specified in terms of the likelihood of occurrence of 
malfunction on a per flight hour basis. 
Note: From a safety perspective the undetected errors associated with integrity are 
much more important than detected errors. 

## Approach

The analyses performed in Sections K.5, K.6 and K.7 uses a four-step approach: 
1)  Timelines are developed to determine how long the CNPC Link System can be interrupted before the UAS safety becomes degraded.  The timelines effectively derive the RLP Transaction Expiration Time. 

2)  Safety analyses are developed to determine how often messages can be missed (availability and continuity) or erroneous (integrity) before the UAS safety becomes degraded.  The safety analysis also provides guidance on how frequently a loss of function, i.e. Lost CNPC Link, can occur. 3)  The link analysis (from Section K.4) determines the frequency and length of the CNPC 
Link System interruptions. 

4)  Using the information obtained from the above three steps the frequency of interruptions (from step 3 above) of a length longer than the Transaction Expiration Time (from step 1 above) can be compared to the safety target determined from step 2 above) to assess if the safety target in the example analysis has been met.  Additionally, a similar analysis can be used to determine if the frequency of Lost CNPC Links is also acceptable based on the Lost CNPC Link Decision Time (see Appendix F, Section F.5) developed from step 1). Modeling, simulation, and safety analysis activities were conducted to assess the CNPC Link System RLP to safely support command and control, DAA, as well as air traffic control data relay, weather radar, and video services, and evaluate the relationships between RLP and the levels of automation of the UAS operations. The RLP parameters of availability, continuity, transaction expiration time, transaction time, and integrity of function capabilities need to be sufficient to perform link services for the command and control function(s), and additional services for one or more of the following functions: detect and avoid, air traffic service data relay, weather radar, and video. 

## Modeling And Simulation Approach

Several propagation modeling and simulation approaches can be used to estimate CNPC link performance.  Possibly the most accurate approach is actual flight testing in a variety of scenarios that vary aircraft altitude, slant range, maneuvering, terrain type, among others.  Use of propagation modeling tools are ways to check the validity of flight testing and provide advanced design inputs while still in the engineering tradeoff phase.  Site Surveys are an important tool for insuring that antennas are pointed clear of nearby obstructions.  

## K.3.1.1 Overview Of Propagation Modeling Approaches

Air-Ground channel modeling and simulation using Spherical-Earth-Model (SEM) and Terrain Integrated Rough Earth Model (TIREM) [6] as well as airframe shadow modeling and simulation were conducted to determine the CNPC Link System RF propagation loss.  
TIREM was used to predict RF propagation loss over variable terrain and sea water for ground-based and airborne transmitters and receivers using digital terrain elevation data (DTED).  In SEM, the terrain profile is represented as the arc of a circle, valid for propagation over a smooth sea or fresh water.  TIREM takes into account the effects of irregular terrain along the propagation path, requiring information regarding terrain elevations of the region of interest.  TIREM and SEM can be used as independent propagation models for rough-earth or smooth applications, respectively.  If a clear lineof-sight exists between two antennas, both models consider the effects of surface-wave propagation (refraction), diffraction, tropospheric-scatter propagation (not useful for CNPC), and atmospheric absorption, as appropriate.  TIREM evaluates the effects of irregular terrain along the great circle path in the calculation of diffraction loss.  If the terrain elevation profile supplied to TIREM has been adjusted by adding the height of known man made obstacles or trees, their effect on diffraction will be included in the predicted path loss.  In the majority of cases, the required terrain information was taken from level 1 DTED generated by the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency (NGA). The DTED level 1 format is a uniform matrix of terrain-elevation values spaced at 3 arcsecond (approximately 100 m) intervals to approximate the vertical resolution of 1:250,000 scale elevation contour maps.  It should be noted that many of the equations internal to TIREM are themselves statistical estimates. 

Each call to TIREM produces two outputs: "TIREM Loss" which accounts for irregular terrain and other factors like atmospheric absorption, and "Free Space Path Loss" which is always the distance squared classical path loss. The availability for L Band and C Band CNPC Link Systems were derived from the airground channel modeling and simulation statistical outputs (e.g., received signal strength statistics) of the TIREM/SEM addressing channel shadowing due to terrain-based obstructions combined with the modeling and simulation of channel shadowing due to the airframe itself. One can take advantage of flight test data, to estimate likely durations of link interruptions (Fade Durations) and the time between consecutive interruptions (Interfade Durations) among other important link quality measures, as follows:   

 
Single link interruption 
- Maximum time period of link interruption (Maximum Fade Duration) - Minimum time period of link interruption (Minimum Fade Duration) - Aggregate link interruption time - Average time period of link interruptions 
 
Two consecutive interruptions 
- Maximum duration between two consecutive interruptions (Maximum 
Interfade Duration)  
- Minimum time between two consecutive interruptions (Minimum 
Interfade Duration) 
- Aggregate duration between two consecutive link interruptions - Average duration between two consecutive link interruptions 
Of the above the two most import parameters are the Maximum time period of the link interruption (Maximum Fade Duration) and the Minimum time period between two consecutive interruptions (Minimum Interfade Duration).  A procedure given below can be used to estimate performance with actual Ground Radio System (GRS) locations and specific UA altitudes.  This procedure works as follows: select the DTED square geographical region specific to the type of terrain for the analysis as the lower left and upper right corners in terms of longitude and latitude.  See Figure K-1 for an example of plotted DTED data, color corresponds to elevation of terrain. Next, pick a location for the GRS, for example at the highest point in the region.  Assume a UA altitude, for example 4,000 feet.  Use a terrain-based model, TIREM or other, to calculate the received signal strength on the forward link (return link is similar) at every point in the geographic region.  A color map (or contour plot, or other) of the result is called a signal strength map, or heat map.  See Figure K-2 for a heat map when the GRS location is chosen at the highest point in this particular geographic sample.  Hence the heat map gives a good estimate of "safe zone" flying contours.  

 
Site Surveys The Site Survey approach to propagation modeling uses terrain and local building information to assess the RLOS path obstruction at various azimuths of interest to determine the lowest altitude that the UA can fly before the RLOS path clearance becomes less than is acceptable for the EPL included in the Link Budget.  Terrain-based propagation models will miss man-made obstructions like buildings.  A 360-degree site survey describes the local horizon elevation angle versus azimuth seen by an antenna as sketched here: 

## Elevation

Figure K-3 shows the geometry for computing the maximum LOS range to a UA from a GRS at a specific elevation angle permitted in the site survey.  Altitudes of UA and antenna height are not drawn to scale.  Negative angles are shown exaggerated at ultimate LOS distance for smooth earth.  Note the difference between local horizontal which means a look angle of zero degrees and local horizon which means looking downward at a negative angle toward a smooth earth.  The local horizon has the longest range of visibility. Figure K-4 shows great circle overland distances versus elevation when the UA is kept within LOS of the transmitting GRS.  In this figure, antenna height is 15 meters, the link to UA is assumed to be via unobstructed LOS, permitted elevation angle negative or positive is determined by a local site survey, and for zero and negative elevation, a smooth earth unobstructed LOS is assumed.  UA altitude is given in feet, range in nautical miles.  
Beam bending due to changes in the refractive index of the atmosphere are negligible except at very long ranges as shown for 4/3-radius corrections.  Figure K-5 is for a GRS with 250-meter height above mean sea level.  This GRS could be sited on a tall building, hill, or mountain top.  The effect of refractive index bending is also small in this figure. 

## K.3.2.1 Overview Of Traffic Modeling Approaches

The industry-standard OPNET toolset was used to develop the communications networks for both sending and receiving nodes and to calculate the CNPC Link System transaction time.  The OPNET Modeler Wireless Suite is a computer program that provides users high-fidelity models, simulations, and analysis tools for wireless networks. The Simulation Model used to analyze CNPC transaction performance is based on two commercial off the shelf software packages: OPNET Modeler and OPNET AppTransaction Xpert®. OPNET Modeler provides a comprehensive development environment supporting the modeling of communication networks and distributed systems.  Both behavior and performance of modeled systems can be analyzed by performing discrete event simulations.  The OPNET Modeler environment incorporates tools for all phases of a study, including model design, simulation, data collection, and data analysis.  We developed a CNPC Link in OPNET Modeler that captures the connectivity of the Ground Radio System and UA. OPNET AppTransaction Xpert® provides capabilities to design applications with its Transaction Whiteboard features.  Transaction Whiteboard includes an Application Programming Interface of Python functions for modeling application behavior based on network, application, and user-specified inputs. Developing the baseline CNPC Link in OPNET Modeler and modeling the behavior of the applications in Transaction Whiteboard provide the basis of our approach to predict the system performance using discrete event simulations of each service class considering every aspect of the traffic activity and link interruption times evaluated using TIREM predicted received signal levels. We established a workflow methodology as a systematic modeling approach consisting of the stages illustrated in the following Figure K-6 defining UAS operational data and topology, generating traffic, performing simulations, and analysis. 

 
UAS Operational Data: The first stage of modeling workflow methodology is to generate an input data file with all end-to-end data paths for the user program in terms of sources (producers), destinations (consumers), and messages exchanged. Subsequently, the messages should be described in terms of sizes and frequencies. These processes should be characterized as distribution patterns of the messages and communication interactions over time. 
 
Topology: The second stage is to construct an appropriate topology to simulate CNPC Link System RLP based on the details of all service classes selected for the study. The topology used for this investigation is illustrated in Figure K-7. 
 
Traffic Generator: The third stage consists in constructing a traffic generator algorithm using the AppTransaction Xpert Whiteboard model based on all the data read from the input data file. The traffic generator algorithm creates all traffic events over time, using the scheduler of the AppTransaction Xpert Whiteboard model, in the order of their occurrence throughout the CNPC Link deployed in OPNET Modeler. Scheduling the messages involves modeling algorithms implemented in Python with respect to: the interaction pattern for each message, availability and continuity events simulated with TIREM, the GRS and UA processing delays, the loads of the GRS and UA nodes, etc. These modeling algorithms are embedded into a Whiteboard transaction model.  
 
Perform Simulations: This modeling approach provides a rich set of capabilities to perform event-driven simulations for particular parametric settings such as data rates for CNPC Link Systems of the topology and system configuration with GRS nodes and UA nodes. The modeler also needs to select metrics and statistics to store the simulation results for the nodes and links of the network topology for meaningful data representation and system performance analysis.  Furthermore, the modeler can potentially develop and implement appropriate algorithms in Python, embedded in AppTransaction Xpert models, to estimate system performance during the simulation with respect to metrics that are not part of OPNET Modeler capabilities.  For example, a hybrid approach of analytical models that might be embedded in AppTransaction Xpert files and event-driven simulation can provide time-efficient solutions. 
 
Analysis: System performance analysis is the last stage of the workflow methodology.  It usually consists in the analysis of the performance simulation results. 

## Safety Analysis Approach

Safety analyses were conducted to determine the acceptable and achievable integrity for the example CNPC Link System to support an example DAA RWC PITL with informational display.  The safety analysis evaluated the impacts that CNPC Link System RLP integrity has on Risk Classes 5 and 6 UAS's operations in the NAS, focusing primarily on DAA operations within class D, E, and G airspace. 

Note: The following Table contains examples of how the inverse energy classification translates into combinations of airspeed and weight for typical UAS, the Risk Classes and the expected Design Assurance Level (DAL) and Probability of likely catastrophic failure conditions analyzed during a system safety analysis.

*Probability of Catastrophic Failure is provided as a design target for average risk in a typical Part 91 operating environment.  The values are not meant as an expectation for specific risk analysis or component reliability.  The intent is similar to values in Figure 2 of FAA AC 23.1309-1E, System Safety Analysis and Assessment for Part 23 Airplanes, for assisting in the Safety Analysis process, reflecting the existing safety continuum for manned aircraft. Catastrophic Failure in this context is defined as the loss of the ability to control or influence the intended flight path of the UAS.  This may or may not result in loss of life in the air or on the ground.  However, just because a failure is defined as Catastrophic, it may be mitigated by operational or geographic limitation instead of relying solely on traditional design assurances. 

This analysis was based on an Operation Safety Assessment (OSA) performed for an example DAA RWC, utilizing Fault-Tree Analysis (FTA) to derive the impacts on safety assuming various CNPC Link System RLP levels and levels of automation for the command and control and DAA.  The OSA methodology and approach follow the guidelines of RTCA DO-264/ EUROCAE ED-78A, Guidelines for Approval of the Provision and Use of Air Traffic Services Supported by Data Communications. The fault trees start with the DAA top level hazard with the acceptable hazard safety objective (SO), which was determined from operational hazard assessment and event tree analyses, of the DAA RWC function.  The fault trees include many hazards that cause the top level hazard to occur.  The hazards for CNPC Link System uplink and downlink failures appear in the fault trees. 

The FTA sensitivity analyses included key CNPC Link System RLP metrics, specifically, Availability and Continuity, as well as Integrity aspects and an assumed recoverability time, R.  Consider a communications link which is either functional or non-functional as illustrated graphically by the binary waveform in the upper part of Figure K-8.  One could empirically measure link availability by observing the link for a long period of time, and calculating the fraction of time that the link is functional.  One could also empirically measure link continuity by gathering statistics on the duration when the system is functional, and finding the likelihood that the link would remain functional for the duration of a communications event (an information exchange) given that the link was functional at the start.  In the lower part of Figure K-8, several information exchanges (IE) are illustrated, each with its own expiration time (ET).  In a classical assessment, the first two events would fail due to lack of availability at the start of the event, and the third would fail due to lack of continuity during the event.  The last two events would succeed.  
However, it is also clear that the second illustrated event (yellow) could potentially be counted as a "success" even though the link is unavailable at the start, since the link becomes available with sufficient time to transmit the message (if a delayed message start time can be accommodated).  Hence, the overall probability of success depends on average availability, the distribution of "functional durations" and "non-functional durations" (defined by continuity), and whether or not "link recovery" is allowed in the analysis.  

Based on the above, Pr{Success} is related to ARCP and CRCP through the formula 

$$\operatorname*{Pr}\{Success\}=\,\operatorname{A}_{\mathrm{RCP}}\operatorname{C}_{\mathrm{RCP}}+(1-\operatorname{A}_{\mathrm{RCP}})R$$
where recoverability, R, is the probability that the link will recover in time to complete the transaction within the expiration time, given that the link is non-functional when initially called upon to deliver service. 

## Modeling And Simulation Assumptions

The Air-Ground channel modeling and OPNET simulation analyses of currently achievable values for the CNPC Link System RLP parameters for minimum level of automation for DAA are based on the following assumptions: 

 
The CNPC Link System parameters identified in Appendix L unless otherwise specified. 
 
Antenna nulls and shadowing by the airframe are not addressed by Air-Ground channel modeling and simulation.  Antenna nulls and shadowing effects are assessed separately in Section.4.4.2 of this Appendix. 
 
UA with a single CNPC Link System antenna located on the bottom of the fuselage. 
 
Propagation due to ducting conditions is not considered. 
 
Pilot response time was not considered. 

## Link Budgets

Appendix L, describes the L Band and C Band, uplink and downlink budgets for example L Band and C Band CNPC Link Systems.  Unless otherwise specified, values of link budget parameters were used in the Air-Ground (AG) channel modeling and simulations. 

## Simulation Models Validation By Flight Test Data

Air-Ground channel modeling and simulations using a TIREM and DTED were conducted to determine the L Band and C Band RLP parameters and characteristics of availability and continuity1. The following is a short description of the assumptions and limitations of TIREM [reference 72].  For purposes of this MOPS document, there are only four propagation modes that need to be considered: 

 
Free space path loss, Single ray 
 
Refraction, Earth radius correction 
 
Diffraction, Knife edges 
 
Two-ray, Reflection off smooth earth 
Details of how TIREM handles transitions between modes are not available in executableonly versions.  The program itself follows the sequence of operations shown in the Figure K-9 below. The main limitation of TIREM is that it does not consider propagation pathways to one side or the other off great circle between the endpoints. AG channel modeling and simulations using TIREM and DTED were validated by comparing their outputs with flight test data.  AG channel modeling using Spherical Earth Model (SEM) was also validated by comparing SEM outputs with flight test data.  NASA flight test measurement data of the CNPC radios reported in Reference [3] were used to validate the AG channel modeling and simulations.  Flight tests and simulations involved one aircraft and one GRS.  Validation results including discussion of aircraft flight paths illustrated in Figures K-10 through K-13 and associated radio performance are summarized in Figures K-14 through K-17, respectively.  The following Table K-1 summarizes flight test information.

Radio Line of sight (RLOS) link performance is driven by UA communications hardware availability and intermittent link outages due to multipath, shadowing, interference and other link impairments.  If interference effects are minimized through careful system design and regulatory control, the dominant time-varying factors affecting LOS link performance are multipath, airframe shadowing and atmospheric losses.  Multipath refers to the tendency of radio signals to arrive at a receiving antenna via multiple paths - a direct path (generally preferred) and one or several reflected paths.  The reflected signals must arrive "later" than the direct signal (they take a longer path), and combine at the antenna with arbitrary phase shifts.  If the aggregate of the reflected signals results in a signal that is roughly equal in amplitude to the direct signal and opposite in phase, complete or nearly-complete cancellation can occur.  This results in a "fade" and if deep enough can cause communication to be temporarily interrupted.  While fading is frequently rapid compared to a time scale of seconds, two factors can cause an effective interruption of communication for a period of seconds.  First, even if each individual fade is short, a long series of deep fades could disrupt communication for a significant period of time.  Second, if relative motion between the transmitter, reflecting surfaces, and receiver is small, a single fade could potentially persist for a long period of time. This could occur, for example, if the reflecting surface is on the aircraft itself (such as a wing or fuselage section), or if it is close to the antenna on the ground. In the general case, multipath on air/ground links between a fixed GRS and a mobile terminal comprises a specular "ground-bounce" component and a diffuse component associated with reflections off rough terrain, man-made obstacles (for example, buildings, water towers), rapidly-changing reflections off the airframe, and density fluctuations in the atmosphere itself (which gives rise to multiple small "echoes" taking slightly longer paths than the direct path).  The combination of the direct path and the specular ground-bounce path, if present, gives rise to a slowly-varying and rapidly-varying fade processes at large and short link distances, respectively, whereas the diffuse reflections give rise to a rapid variation.  An aircraft communicating from long range and low altitude requires greater link margin (to achieve a given level of availability) than an aircraft that is communicating from short range and/or higher altitude.  The penalty at long range and low elevation angle (i.e., associated with low UA altitude) can be significant.  At even lower altitudes the aircraft goes below the radio horizon and signal propagation occurs only by diffraction with an even more severe reduction in link margin.  References [4] and [5] provide detailed discussion on multipath effects. It can be seen in Figure K-14 that the AG channel TIREM and DTED modeling and simulation results indicating multipath fading from 15:00:00 to 16:45:00 are in close agreement with measured data from Flight Test 1 scenario for the flat urban terrain environment in Reference [3]. In Figure K-15, the AG channel TIREM and DTED modeling and simulation results show close agreement multipath fading from 16:10:00 to 17:45:00 with measured data from Flight Test 2 scenario for the flat urban terrain environment in Reference [3]. Figure K-16 shows the AG channel TIREM and DTED modeling and simulation results indicating multipath fading at low altitude and low elevation angle from 14:15:00 to 16:30:00 are in close agreement with measured data from Flight Test 5 for the hilly urban terrain environment in Reference [3]. Figure K-17 shows the AG channel TIREM and DTED modeling and simulation results indicating multipath fading at low altitude and low elevation angle from 13:50:00 to 15:00:00 are in close agreement with measured data from Flight Test 7 for the hilly urban terrain environment in Reference [3]. 

As discussed above, multipath effects on the received signal strengths calculated from the AG channel TIREM and DTED modeling and simulations are very close to the flight test measured received signal strengths with multipath effects, yielding good confidence in the validity of the AG channel modeling and simulations using TIREM and DTED as well as the underlying assumptions used.  These results show that, in accordance with the above discussion, AG channel TIREM and DTED modeling and simulations can accurately calculate the multipath fading on L Band Link for real world terrain environment. Flight test measurements in Reference [3] show antenna nulls and shadowing by the airframe within LOS in Figure K-14 from 15:30:00 to 16:45:00, Figure K-15 from 16:00:00 to 17:45:00, and Figure K-16 from 14:35:00 to 14:45:00.  The Air-Ground channel modeling and simulation using TIREM does not account for antenna nulls and shadowing by the airframe.  Antenna nulls and shadowing effects are evaluated separately and discussed in subsection K.4.4.2. The IF-77 (ITS-FAA 1977) [8] propagation model was also utilized to predict basic transmission losses for NASA Flight Tests 1, 2 and 5 in Table K-1.  For these predictions, terrain profiles between the GRS and the aircraft ground projection were extracted and analyzed to provide site-specific inputs to the IF-77 model.  The terrain profiles were extracted from DTED Level 1 terrain data.  An estimated link budget including transmitted power, antenna gains and system losses for both the UA and GRS terminals was applied to compare these predicted basic transmission losses to the observed/measured received powers.  For aircraft locations that were within the valid input ranges for the model, the results of the comparisons (i.e., the differences between the measured and predicted received powers) were generally comparable to the TIREM/DTED comparisons. 

## Extended Modeling And Simulation Results And Discussion K.4.4.1 Multipath

Once validation was completed showing good comparisons to flight test results, AG channel TIREM, DTED, and SEM modeling and simulations were conducted to determine the L Band and C Band RLP parameters and characteristics of availability and continuity due to multipath. TIREM, DTED, Free Space Model, and SEM modeling and simulations were conducted to gather AG channel data in multiple representative GRS environments, including the following terrain types: 

 
Over sea water (TIREM, SEM) 
 
Mountainous (TIREM, DTED) 
 
Hilly: urban, suburban, rural desert forest (TIREM, DTED) 
 
Flat: urban, suburban, rural desert forest (TIREM, DTED) 
For TIREM simulations, East Coast, Florida, Grand Forks, North Dakota, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Blue Ridge Mountain areas were considered for sea water, flat, hilly, and mountainous terrains, respectively.  Parametric analyses were conducted to assess fading on link availability and continuity at different UA speeds, altitudes, operating ranges, GRS heights, and L Band and C Band radio characteristics.  Table K-2 lists the simulation parameters and conditions. 

## Table K-2: Simulation Parameters And Conditions

 The following Figures K-18 to K-21 summarize modeling and simulation results of the channel propagation loss versus aircraft range and altitude due to terrain-based obstructions.  The trace labeled "Free Space Model" was computed using the standard free-space propagation loss calculation for the slant range distance.  (Note: Free space loss loses its meaning when the flight path goes beyond LOS.) The trace labeled "TIREM" utilizes the Terrain Integrated Rough Earth Model (TIREM) calculation, which adds reflection and diffraction effects to forecast RF propagation loss over the specified actual terrain.  The trace labeled "SEM" utilizes the Spherical Earth Model calculation. 

Subsections K.4.4.1.1 to K.4.4.1.5 describe the link margins necessary to achieve 99.8% link availability - 99.8% Availability maximum range and UA altitude - due to multipath losses. 

## Over Sea Water

Figures K-18 shows with the over-water results, path loss generally follows the free space path loss lines, with no substantial change in link attenuation until one nears the radio line of sight at low altitude (1,000 ft.). 

 
 
Flat Terrain 
 
As indicated in Figures K-18 to K-21, for a given terrain conditions an aircraft communicating from long range and low altitude requires greater margin (to achieve a given level of availability) than an aircraft that is communicating from short range and/or higher altitude due to multipath.   
Figure K-20 shows significant reduction in received power due to multipath at low altitude 
(1,000 ft.) above mountainous terrain.   
As indicated in Figure K-20, for a ground antenna height of 100 feet above mountainous terrain, link ranges between 20 and 70 NM, and UA altitudes between 1,000 feet and 10,000 feet, margin requirements for a single link vary from 0 dB to 50 dB due to multipath at 970 MHz  The process described in subsections K.3.1.2 and K.3.1.3 was followed to derive the link availability and continuity in this region with ranges between 20 and 70 NM and UA altitudes between 1,000 feet and 10,000 feet addressing channel shadowing due to mountainous terrain.  

## Availability Simulation Results

Subsection K.3.1 provides a process to derive link availability due to multipath.  Target availability of 99.8% was used in the simulations to close the link.  Tables K-3 and K-4 show maximum UA ranges at various altitudes for 99.8% availability for L Band and C Band as obtained from simulation considering ground antenna height of 100 feet above terrain.  The availability results are based on the received signal probabilities (right vertical axis) illustrated in Figures K-22, K-23, K-24, and K-25 corresponding to sea water, mountainous, flat, and hilly terrains, respectively. 

 
 
The range values where the 99.8% Availability lines crossing the -117.1 dBm receiver sensitivity in Figures K-22 to K-25 show the maximum UA ranges at various altitudes for 99.8% link availability.  This point indicates the lost link condition.  Figures K-23, K-24, and K-25 also show abrupt and significant reduction in received power due to multipath at low altitude. The abrupt reduction in received power due to multipath indicated that we could reasonably consider the multipath loss at longer range and low altitude independently from the airframe loss at shorter range and higher altitude.  11 dB and 8 dB attenuations were added to the link margin in the TIREM multipath simulation to account for the airframe obstruction allowance in L Band and C Band, respectively.  These margins are the aircraft antenna gain values for the cumulative distribution functions of 0.002, depicted in Figure K-39 and Figure K-40, to ensure 99.8% Link availability. 

Note: For 99.8% availability an installed gain of -10dBi represents a reasonable approximation for the gain to be used in the link budgets at both L- and C Band (see Section K.4.4.2 and Appendix L). 

## Continuity And Simulation Results K.4.4.1.6.1 Rlp Continuity And Link Interruption

The performance of the CNPC Link System fluctuates with time.  These fluctuations are caused by a number of environmental factors and are not associated with variation of the 
 
performance of the equipment itself but the attenuation of the signal on the propagation path between the antennas of the CNPC Link System. The CNPC Link System propagation path attenuation and hence the signal level received is not constant.  Figure K-26 below depicts a typical variation of the signal level at a CNPC Link System receiver.  As the figure shows the signal level may occasionally dip down below the minimum required by the receiver to correctly receive the information from the CNPC Link System transmitter and a temporary (self-repairing) interruption occurs.  The duration of these interruptions can vary from tens of milliseconds to many tens of seconds.  These interruptions are not necessarily associated with operating the CNPC Link System at its maximum range and can occur for example when the UA is close to the runway or has maneuvered to place its wing in the propagation path of the CNPC Link System signal. 


## K.4.4.1.6.2 Flight Test Data Analyses Results

Flight tests using a manned aircraft equipped with single L Band and C Band omnidirectional antennas were performed at various altitudes and ranges over both hilly terrain and water to provide data to support the safety assessments in this Appendix, the Link Budgets in Appendix L, the Undesired to Desired signal level ratios in Appendix R (and consequent transmitter mask and receiver adjacent channel rejection requirements in the normative section of this MOPS document) and to provided Unmanned Aircraft System and CNPC Link System Designer and manufacturer with data on which to base their system's performance that they may use to guide their own flight tests.  These tests were flown over the two most likely terrain types (hilly and water) and at ranges (35 NM to 100 NM) and altitudes (3 kft. to 21 kft.) representative of the anticipated flight use cases that this MOPS will support (see Appendix O, Flight Test Data for the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System).  Higher altitudes were not covered because they are almost completely immune from ground reflection multipath and diffraction effects so path attenuation can be easily calculated.  Additionally, weather and foliage do not impact propagation at the frequencies under consideration. 

 
Although some data and propagation models already exist (e.g. ITU-R P.528 Propagation curves for aeronautical mobile and radionavigation services using the VHF, UHF and SHF bands and IF 77) they do not provide the temporal characteristics of the fading required for the analysis needed to assess the safety of the UAS when the CNPC Link System is experiencing fading. Consequently, the flight tests focused on capturing data such as the time period of single link interruptions (Fade Durations), which relates to the transaction expiration time, and the time period between two consecutive link interruptions (Interfade Durations), which indicates how often fades occur. Although the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System equipment was used to capture the flight test data, post flight analysis extracted just the (equipment and data rate independent) path attenuation between the two antennas (the Measured Path Loss (MPL)) and then subtracted this from the Free Space Path Loss (FSPL) calculated using the slant range from the Ground antenna to the Aircraft antenna to derive the Excess Path Loss (EPL = FSL - MPL).  The EPL is attributed to the multipath and diffraction caused by the terrain below the LOS path.  The aircraft's roll angle and bearing were held constant during the five-minute data capture segments of the flight test to eliminate antenna gain variations as much as possible.  Additionally, as can be seen in Figure K-27, two segments at each altitude and range combination were flown (one clockwise (red) and the other counter clockwise (blue) around the ground antenna) to average out any aircraft antenna installed gain variation from starboard to port azimuths.  The same flight profile was flown over water. 

 

## Figure K-27: Example Flight Profile And Data Capture Segments

As can be seen in Figure K-28, which plots an example from one of the hilly terrain segments, that shows Excess Path Loss against aircraft bearing (from the ground antenna) for three altitudes, the EPL is much larger at lower than higher altitudes.  This is not always the case particularly over water as can be seen in Figure K-29 where the EPL is higher at higher altitudes. 


These characteristics are due to two effects.  In Figure K-28 the lower altitudes are worse because the path clearance above the hills is only just adequate to not obstruct the RLOS path and so multipath and diffraction cause significate signal fading.  Over the water the reflections from the surface are much more coherent than over undulating hilly terrain and will cause significant fading at any altitudes and ranges that provide a reflected versus direct path length difference of 180 degrees.  Clearly over water no terrain clearance issues exist if the UA is above the water level.  This over water fading effect can be very clearly seen in the following Figure K-30 which shows the fading on the signal as the aircraft descends towards the GRS over hilly terrain (upper) and water (lower). Significant fades occur over water at any altitude and range but none appear present over hilly terrain because there is no coherent reflection point. 

To evaluate the temporal characteristics of the Excess Path Loss, data was captured at 50 msec. intervals and the resulting EPL assessed at each time point to see if it was less than or greater than a selected value ranging from 6dB to -42dB.  Analysis was then performed to measure how long the signal level was above or below the selected EPL and how long the gaps were to derive Fade Duration and Interfade Duration times.  The number of Fades and Interfades were then binned into a variety of time slices to present the data in an easy to view histogram.  The counts were extrapolated to one hour durations. 

Figure K-31 is an example (L Band over hilly terrain at 35NM range and 3,500ft altitude) 
of the results of this analysis showing the Measured EPL in the upper part of the figure, the Fade Duration counts per hour versus bin time in the middle of the figure and the Interfade Durations counts per hour versus bin time in the lower part of the figure. In this example the EPL does not vary much over the segment but it is in the order of 15 to 30dB.  Consequently, the Fade Durations are very long > 50 seconds until the EPL is close to 15dB and they rapidly reduce to less than 100msec at an EPL of 18 to 24dB.  With an EPL of 27dB no fades occurred during the segment.  From an Interfade Duration perspective the fades are only separated by less than 1second at an EPL of 15dB but the Interfade Duration rapidly increases to 20 seconds or greater as the EPL drops from 18dB to 24dB.  With and EPL greater than 27dB the Interfade Durations are longer than 100 seconds. 

In contrast Figure K-32 is at the same range and over the same hilly terrain but with the aircraft at 7,500ft altitude (4,000ft higher than in Figure K-31).  Figure K-32 shows that at higher altitude the EPL is much less and only 3dB is required to assure no fades longer than 2 seconds occur with corresponding Interfade Durations of 10 seconds. 

Finally Figure K-33 shows the Fade and Interfade Durations for one of the segments with the highest variation of EPLs, C Band over hilly terrain at 35NM range and 3,500ft altitude. 

 

In this case EPLs of greater than 24dB are required to achieve Fade Durations of less than 2 seconds with corresponding Interfade Durations of approximately 20 seconds.  To achieve no fades an EPL of close to 40dB would be required. This information can be used to allocate a link margin (at the appropriate altitude and range for the desired operation) that can be added to the FSPL in the link budgets in Appendix L to compensate for the EPL and the corresponding temporal fading characteristics can then be assumed. Based on Sections K.5.6.1 and K.6.4.1 it is desired to be able to achieve Fade Durations of less than 2 seconds to support the DAA function or the command and control function. Based on the analysis of all of the flight tests performed this is achievable on the assumption that a link margin adequate to compensate for an EPL of approximately 17- 20dB is accommodated in the CNPC Link System design.  However, at this EPL the Interfade Durations are typically only 10-20 seconds which would not be operationally acceptable as the fades would occur too frequently.  Based on the flight test data increasing the link margin by 3dB reduces the Fade Durations to less than 100 msecs and the corresponding Interfade Durations in excess of 50 seconds. Consequently, it is proposed that an EPL of no less than 20dB is included in the L and C Band Link Budgets in Appendix L and that these EPLs will be controlled by limiting the lowest altitude of operations based on path clearance over the intended terrain. 

## K.4.4.1.6.3 Minimizing The Duration Of Unreliable Signal Predictions

Paragraph K.4.3 of this Appendix showed Flight Test data published by NASA (Reference [3]) showing received signal strength versus time, along with information on altitude, aircraft roll, and slant range for a particular L Band CNPC Link System.  This section describes a methodology for converting recorded test data into estimates of link outage durations. Begin by defining a Prediction Quality Metric (PQM) as, PQM = Actual Received Signal Strength (ARSS) - Predicted Received Signal Strength (PRSS) Both terms on the right are functions of time. The best propagation-based channel modeling techniques can be off by 10s of dB, so one wants to derive PRSS as a combination of propagation modeling augmented by a scalable but non time-varying link margin that keeps PQM positive for long periods of time.  Link margin is expensive so it is desirable to use the flight test information to experimentally find the smallest link margin [coupled with the best obtainable propagation prediction] that "does the job" in the sense of minimizing periods of negative PQM. This Section defines periods of negative PQM as link outages.  Outage, by this definition, is not the same as Lost Link. A new methodology for developing PRSS follows.  Flight test data should first be partitioned to yield the flight environments for which the CNPC Link System under test will ultimately be used.   The partitioning process ["filtering"] can be manual or automatic:   

1. Partition flight test data based on aircraft attitude [pitch, roll, yaw], range, and 
altitude:  These conditions can mean, among other possibilities, an absence of maneuvering: (1) level flight which eliminates changes in elevation, (2) aircraft roll kept less than some value to eliminate excessive airframe blockage, and (3) slant ranges staying within radio line of sight or avoiding flying directly over a GRS.   
2. When flight test data does not meet the conditions above [complementary data], it 
may still be necessary to analyze the predictability of the link.  Takeoff and landing, banking, turning, maneuvering to different elevations, hand-off to one or more GRSs, are all important components of a successful flight, so deserve an accurate way of predicting the signal strength.  
3. **Note:** The PRSS for partition 1 may be different than the PRSS for partition 2.  As 
new flight tests are analyzed, better PRSS algorithms will be developed.  
Results of applying various filtering criteria are illustrated next in Figures K-34 and K-35 which show frequency of occurrence for periods of time [events] when PQM is negative [outage] based on one flight test's worth of data. Figure K-36 summarizes definitions and illustrates two specific ways to find useful PRSS: Method 1:  
terrain PRSS(terrain) = CSE
 - ESL 
where terrain CSE
 is a terrain-based Computed Signal Estimate, ESL [Excess Signal Loss] is the margin adjustment, a non time-varying sliding scale of dB, by which PRSS can be optimized. Method 2:  
 
FSPL
PRSS(FSPL) = CSE
 - ESL 
where FSPL
CSE
 is a LOS-only [distance-squared] Computed Signal Estimate 
 
As before, ESL is the margin adjustment, a non-time-varying sliding scale of dB by which PRSS can be optimized.  
 

Note: In Section K.4.4.1.6.2, EPL [Excess Path Loss] refers to the difference between 
the actual path loss with all signal strength variables like high-power amplifier size, antenna gains, circuit losses, noise temperatures, etc., backed out and the Free Space Loss [distance squared] based on the distance between the ARS and GRS antennas. In Section K.4.4.1.6.2, ESL is time varying. 
The frequency of occurrence histogram shown in Figure K-34 for hand-filtered flight segments with an absence of maneuvering and PRSS as defined in Method 1 [with what the TIREM program calls *TIREM loss*], indicates that for an ESL of 11 dB there is only one occurrence per hour of negative PQM with durations greater than 2.0 seconds and less than 3 seconds.  Since there are 5-1 = 4 poor prediction events that could be as large as 2 seconds, and 1 poor prediction event that could be as large as 3 seconds, there will be a total of 4x2 + 1x3 = 11 seconds in one hour, for a fractional probability of 11/3600 = .003055 when the prediction fails to keep track of the AMSS. Figure K-35 analyzes the same flight test data only with PRSS chosen using Method 2 [based on free-space loss].  It demonstrates that events of poor prediction have much longer duration if free space loss prediction is used versus terrain-based prediction. 


It can be seen, for the FSPL method of computing PQM, that with 15dB of ESL, there are 4 outages that could be as long as 5 seconds and 11 - 4 or 7 outages that can be as long as 3 seconds and 21-11=10 outages that could be as long as 2 seconds, for a one-hour outage fraction of 4x5 + 7x3 + 10x2 = 61/3600 = .01694.  Hence, using FSPL with only 15dB ESL margin is certainly not as good as the TIREM prediction.  Figure K-37 shows that if larger ESLs are used, namely 18, 19, and 20, all periods of negative PQM greater than 1 second disappear.  Hence, using FSPL versus TIREM means that larger ESL margins will be needed to constrain poor prediction events, in particular, ESLs must increase by roughly 7dB. It is clear that whichever prediction criterion is used, TIREM or FSPL, the link performance cannot be made any better than it really was during the flight test.  The tradeoff in terms of modeling and simulation is that more accuracy in prediction leads to lower ESL margin.  In turn, lower ESL margin means the system designer has tighter control over channel variables, mitigating effects of over-design. 

 
In summary, keeping periods of poor prediction capability [negative PQM events] as rare as possible are critical to CNPC Link Systems carrying out their intended role.  More accurate PRSS estimates are possible using terrain-based models than FSPL models.  The indication so far is that there is 7dB difference between TIREM and FSPL PRSS for a given event duration.  Further study with additional flight tests will help to develop PRSS estimation approaches useful for the system designer. 

## K.4.4.2 Installed Antenna Gain

This subsection addresses the link margins necessary to compensate for link availability reduction due to installed antenna airframe related effects. As an example of the effects of the proximity of the airframe (metal or carbon composite) to the antenna the analysis of the installed antenna gains at L Band, 968MHz and C Band, 5060MHz were conducted using a 3D CAD model of the Viking S3 aircraft used in the flight tests reported in Reference [3] and a representative omnidirectional antenna model installed in approximately the same position as the antenna used in the flight tests.  RF 
 
simulations were performed using SAVANT, which is a Computational Electromagnetic simulator using Shooting and Bouncing rays with Geometric Optics extensions to analyze the performance of antennas installed on electrically large physical structures.  It has been independently validated on many occasions and shows good correlation with measured results. Figure K-38 depicts results of simulation of installed L Band antenna.  Figures K-39 and K-40 show the cumulative distribution functions of aircraft antenna gains for the aircraft relative negative elevation angles for L Band and C Band.  Analyses shows maximum 4.98 / 4.96 dBi, minimum -14.70 / -12.94 dBi and average -2.25 / -0.29 dBi gains over a range of azimuths and elevations for L Band and C Band, respectively. 



Detailed analysis will be able to predict exact gain at given azimuths and elevations that can be added to the propagation models to provide an exact path attenuation at any given aircraft altitude and range from the ground radio. To more fully understand the impact of the airframe on the installed gain of omnidirectional antennas SAVANT analysis was performed on generic shaped airframes of different sizes at both L Band and C Band. Figure K-41 shows results of one such simulation.  It clearly shows that the antennas farfield gain is reduced by cancelling reflections from the wings but is not much affected in the fore and aft direction by the fuselage (since the fuselage is typically round, reflections will tend to be propagated sideways and not affect the direct path signal).  The gain is also significantly reduced below the fuselage (for this top mounted antenna).  These effects are frequency and airframe size dependent.  The installed gain of the antenna when operating at lower frequencies with associated longer wavelengths is affected less by smaller rather than larger airframes.  At L Band and with a 3ft wingspan airframe model the installed antenna pattern was virtually unaffected (i.e. it remains 4pi steradian omnidirectional); however, with a 30 ft. wingspan airframe model at C Band there is significant nulling (mostly over the wings) due to airframe reflections cancelling the main signal path at certain elevation angles and significant shadowing below the entire airframe. Directional antennas (with beam widths appropriate to the sizes of antennas that can be realistically carried on UA) were also modelled on the same generic airframes.  Results of these simulations indicate that apparent gain reduction in the pointing direction will occur if that direction is occluded by the airframe. 

 
In the example shown in Figure K-42 the apparent gain of the antenna is reduced by 12dB when the antenna is pointed so that its main lobe is 50% occluded by the wing (in this case the top mounted antenna was pointing at -10degrees elevation in the azimuth direction of the wing). 

It is strongly recommended that any type certification applicant should use their own analysis to predict their installed/apparent antenna gains over the range of elevation and azimuth angles expected based on their UA maneuvering limits and their mission ranges and altitudes.  However, some general rules can be stated. For Omnidirectional Antennas: 
An installed gain of -10dBi represents a reasonable approximation for the gain to be used in the Link budgets at both L and C Band. A reasonable approximation for the nominal antenna gain used for interference assessment is +2dBi. A maximum installed gain of 5dBi is a reasonable assumption. Dual omnidirectional antennas (e.g. one upper and one lower) are assumed in Appendix L Link Budgets but are not be required by this MOPS document. A single antenna may be acceptable depending on the maneuvering envelope of the UA and the required link margin/operating range.  Otherwise multiple antennas will be required to cover the solid angle dictated by the aircraft maneuvering envelope and the mission altitudes and ranges. 

For Directional Antennas: 
Directional antennas should never point below an elevation angle where 50% of projected antenna aperture is obstructed by the airframe because performance in this highly obstructed situation is very unpredictable (i.e. simulations will not be accurate and flight tests will not provide adequate proof of performance). A 10dB reduction in the free space gain of the antenna is a reasonable approximation to the apparent gain reduction when the antenna's main lobe is 50% occluded (this is higher than the theoretical diffraction based 6dB reduction because of the oblique nature of the airframe's relationship to the antenna). Switching between dual directional antennas (e.g. one upper and one lower) can mitigate gain reduction to 0dB but should not be required by this MOPS document. 

## K.4.4.3 Combined Multipath And Antenna Nulls/Shadowing

Although they both add to the basic square law distance versus attenuation of the path there is no direct correlation between installed antenna pattern gain and multipath signal fading so the two effects can be treated independently.  Clearly the altitude and range of the aircraft do have a direct bearing on the phase of the reflected signal from a multipath perspective and the azimuth and elevation of the signal path at the location of the airframe but there is no other connection between the two additional path attenuation factors.  As discussed in subsection K.4.4.2, we considered the multipath loss at longer range and low altitude independently from the airframe loss at shorter range and higher altitude. Section K.9 describes recommended design and operational mitigations to overcome multipath and antenna nulls and shadowing. 

## Cnpc Link System Rlp Parameters And Characteristics For Minimum Level Of Automation For Daa Daa Considerations

The objective of the Remain-Well-Clear (RWC) function of a DAA system is to remain "Well Clear" and facilitate the Pilot in Command (PIC) to be a good user of the airspace. In this Section K.5, a minimum level of automation for DAA means a Pilot-In-The-Loop (PITL) approach to performing many RWC sub-functions using an informational display, and the UA has no maneuver determination algorithm.  Since there are components of the DAA RWC equipment both onboard the UA and hosted in the GRS, the CNPC Link System connecting the two becomes a safety critical system. Within the context of the Remain-Well-Clear function of a DAA system, informational displays at a minimum refer to the display of ownship and traffic information, including positional icons and state information.  DAA informational displays may also contain information about predicted conflict states of other traffic so as to aid pilot decision making.  In the context of a DAA system, PITL generally refers to the PIC's direct, physical engagement with the Pilot Station (PS) command and control interface to perform a DAA maneuver based on information provided to him/her by the DAA system.  The PIC is responsible for determining what maneuver to command and for physically commanding the maneuver through the PS command and control/navigation interface. That command could be in the form of a direct control input movement, or simple mouse click to select a new waypoint, or anything in between. The following section describes each of the Remain-Well-Clear sub-functions shown in Figure K-43 and provides a notional description of how they interact with the CNPC Link System.  The baseline assumption is that the Remain-Well-Clear function is PITL with an informational display (i.e. no maneuver determination algorithm).  Therefore, the PIC is performing the Determine (K.3.1.4) and Command (K.3.1.5) sub-functions.  

## K.5.1.1 Detect

The Detect function is responsible for monitoring the predetermined volume of airspace surrounding the UA, determining the presence of potential airborne hazards (Intruder), and providing sensor data (relative intruder state) for each hazard. This is done for each sensor type. 

 

## K.5.1.2 Track

The Track function performs Data Association, Track Management, and State Estimation based on data received from all of the sensors. These integrated tracks are then sent both to the pilot and to the Track Evaluation function.  
The DAA system evaluates the track volume as function of parameters such as radius of surveying and traffic density.  The tracks will be sent to the PIC display via the CNPC Link System.  The transmission does not need acknowledgment. This un-prioritized track data can be sent as a best effort without acknowledgement and may be repeated at a specified interval.  The DAA system determines the total bandwidth and throughput required to process the un-prioritized tracks and ensures that it does not overload the CNPC Link Systems throughput capacity. 

## K.5.1.3 Evaluate / Declare / Prioritize

The Evaluate, Declare, and Prioritize sub-functions have been grouped into a functioned called Track Evaluation.  The Track Evaluation function is responsible for processing the surveillance track data by assessing the collision risk, prioritizing hazards based on collision risk, and declaring the needed action to mitigate hazard risks. The prioritized tracks sent to the ground via the CNPC Link System must be acknowledged.  If no acknowledgement is received in a pre-determined interval, it will be resent. 

## K.5.1.4 Determine

The Determine function is responsible for providing a recommended separation maneuver. In the PITL RWC concept, this function is performed by the PIC. The primary advantage of the PITL with informational display concept is that pilot may be best positioned to handle the complex factors that must be taken into consideration at the longer time horizons over which RWC operates. In addition to leveraging the potential PITL advantages, using an informational display has the additional benefit of not requiring a maneuver (i.e. Determine sub-function) algorithm. This confers the responsibility for the safety of the aircraft clearly to the PIC and greatly simplifies the DAA system implementation. It is important to note that this concept is most similar to today's ATC operations, which is accepted but requires a significant amount of training in order for the controllers to perform the functions given to them. 

## K.5.1.5 Command

The Command function is responsible for communicating avoidance or other (e.g., stay on course, return to mission, etc.) instruction(s) to the Execute function. When the PIC is commanding a maneuver from the PS, the CNPC Link System uplinks that command to the aircraft for execution.  The commands executed to perform RWC by the PIC must be acknowledged by the UA via the CNPC Link System.  If no acknowledgement is received in a pre-determined interval, it will be resent. 

## K.5.1.6 Execute

This function is responsible for executing the commanded action and will be the responsibility of the aircraft.  

## Daa Timeline And Data Flows

The DAA timeline considered in this Appendix is illustrated as follows in Figure K-44. Multiple RLP's (A/2, B, and B/2) for CNPC Link System are shown in this timeline.  The RLP's denoted here don't include the pilot response time.  The pilot response time is addressed by the Determine and Pilot Input functions function shown in the DAA timeline in Figure K-44. 

 
 
As shown in Figure K-44, the transaction time at the DAA level is comprised of CNPC Link System RLP transaction expiration times, DAA system processing times, human response times (such as pilot reaction time and ATC time), and aircraft maneuver times, etc. 

Note: The Required Communications Performance (RCP) is used to characterize ATC 
communication and transaction expiration time.  The concept of RCP is defined in ICAO Doc. 9869, First Edition 2006, Manual on Required Communication Performance (RCP). 

The DAA PITL with informational display data flows considered in this appendix are illustrated in Figure K-45.  It represents a different look of the DAA timeline in Figure K- 44. 

## Minimum Data Rate Of Target Data For Daa

RTCA/DO-3nn, Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Detect and Avoid (DAA) Systems, describes minimum traffic report information for DAA use of the CNPC Link System.  They are required to provide sufficient "Traffic Reports" to support DAA functions, specifically for the use of a traffic display in the Pilot Station.  The results are summarized in Table K-5. 

| Number of tracks                       |   60  |
|----------------------------------------|-------|
| Number of bits per track               |  130  |
| Number of update per second            |    1  |
| Total downlink data rate (bits/second) | 7800  |
|                                        |       |

These minimum data rate requirements along with other necessary message transfer (see Tables K-6 and K-7) were considered in the OPNET simulation to derive to the CNPC Link transaction time for CNPC A/2 and CNPC B.

The summary of the telecommand messages for the enroute phase of the flight [see Appendix J] are listed in Table K-7. 

| Data Type                            | Message Name                          |   Rate (Hz)  |   Size (bytes)  | Source    | Destination    |

 OPNET was used to calculate the CNPC Link System Transaction time for downlink of DAA tracks (RLP A/2 in Figure K-44) with the tracks updated once per second (see Table K-6).  The total throughput level over time from the OPNET simulation for the message traffic in Tables K-6 and K-7 were used to derive the downlink and uplink transaction times.  These transaction times are illustrated in Figures K-46 and K-47, respectively.  The y-axis in Figures K-46 and K-47 represent the delay in milliseconds for the messages in the top legend.  The x-axis represents the simulation time in seconds. Figure K-46 shows that the L Band antenna-to-antenna transaction time for downlink of DAA tracks, represented by target data messages, is 128 msec. 

 

## Safety Analyses

This appendix describes preliminary safety analysis of an example CNPC Link System supporting an example DAA RWC PITL with informational display safety case. 

## K.5.5.1 Assumptions

The safety analyses of currently achievable values for the example CNPC Link System RLP parameters and characteristics of integrity for minimum level of automation for the example DAA RWC PITL with informational display are based on the following assumptions: 

1.  Only single intruder (1-1) encounters are considered.  
Note: Only single intruder analysis has been performed to date. Additional analysis is 
required to verify the assumption that airspace characterization doesn't drive us to consider multi-intruder performance analysis. 
2.  Any intruder not operating at least one type of the equipment listed below is considered Non-Cooperative:  

a. Transponder Mode 3A/C (TSO-C74 compliant) b. Transponder Mode S (TSO-C112 compliant) c. ADS-B - 1090 out (TSO-C166 compliant) d. ADS-R from an ADS-B - 978 out (TSO-C154 compliant) e. TCAS I (TSO-C118 compliant) f. TCAS II (TSO-C119 compliant)  
3.  All DAA systems include the minimum surveillance equipage listed below:  
a. 1090 Extended Squitter with ADS-B (TSO-C166b, Class A compliant (able to receive ADS-R and TIS-B data)) b. Airborne Radar 
Both functioning sensors are required to meet the operational safety requirements/ Airspace Safety Threshold for the intended DAA airspace (loss of any of these sensors is not captured as part of the safety analysis and should be handled procedurally).  
4.  Intruder ADS-B In data must be validated when used as the sole surveillance source except as described below:  
a. Intruder ADS-B complies with TSO-C154, TSO-C199, Class A or B, TSO-C166 Class A or B, or TSO C-195, and has the following ADS-B minimum performance required for DAA: NACp =8, NACv = 1, NIC = 7, SIL=3, SDA=2.  
i. DAA does not require ADS-B correlation/validation with another surveillance sensor when position reports meet these minimum performance requirements. ii. ADS-B can possibly be used below these performance thresholds with positive correlation/validation with other sensor. b. UAT data received via ADS-R (where available) and is acceptable for use by DAA System, assuming the NIC/NAC/SIL are adequate (i.e. UAT not required). c. TIS-B targets based on ground radar are not used.  

## 5.  Transponder Performance

a. Complies with TSO-C112 Mode S or TSO-C74 Mode 3A/C.  
 
b. DAA system uses Mode 3A/C and Mode S without correlation/validation for DAA 
application. c. Mode A only transponder data can only be used if correlated/validated with another surveillance sensor.  

## 6.  Intra-Source Correlation Performances

a. Assume ASA (DO-317A) type correlation performance (e.g. 95% correlation rate between ADS-B, Mode S Transponder (TCAS), and Radar surveillance sources).  

b. Performance assumptions for UA and intruder avionics.  

## 7.  Display Assumptions

a. Assume that the display is independent of the PS (i.e. can function without the PS equipment). b. Informative display guidance algorithms take into account surveillance track uncertainties when generating guidance. c. Split tracks (un-correlated surveillance tracks from the same intruder) are HMI hazard.  

8.  PS Assumptions  
a. PS equipment complies with equipment environmental qualification requirements. b. PS operator supports one UAS at a time. c. PS has a means to call ATC. d. PS and display are independent systems (see 7.a above). e. PS operator is not independent of PS.  

## 9.  Atc Communications

a. Nominal operation assumes ATC Communications are relayed through the UA so a CNPC Link System is required for ATC communications (CNPC Link System between GRS and UA combined with UHF/VHF between ATC and UA). 

b. Although part of normal operations, ATC communication is not required to perform 
the DAA function (loss communication procedures are followed).  
10.  RLP is sufficient to meet the DAA architecture assumption of RWC Pilot-In-The- Loop (i.e. no automated DAA guidance/execution on the UA):  It is assumed that the RLP is sufficient to support allocation of the Determine and Command functionality solely to the PIC.  This implies that the UAS does not have an automated Remain Well Clear requirement (hence no DAA mitigation under a Lost CNPC Link System condition) and that the CNPC Link System RLP is sufficient to meet the overall safety case without alternative means.   
Note: It is assumed that automated Determine and Command functionality are required for Collision Avoidance (CA) due to CNPC Link System availability, continuity, and response transaction times, however additional investigation is required.   
This assumption reduces the functional requirements allocated to DAA and reduces the level of effort for architecture/DAA development, and simplifies the safety case by allocating most/all of the maneuver determination to PIC.  However, this assumption means under the baseline configuration (i.e. no Collision Avoidance functionality and RWC PITL with informational display) there is no means for the DAA system to mitigate collision risks under a Lost CNPC Link System condition; which will increase the 
 
Development Assurance Level (DAL) and performance required of the CNPC Link System.  Based on the safety analysis results and the anticipated CNPC Link System RLP, it will be shown if this performance is consistent with the DAA safety case assumption. 

## K.5.5.2 Safety Analyses Of Cnpc Link System Supporting Daa Rwc Pitl With Informational Display

Consider the following four identified DAA operational hazards: 

- OH1: Inadequate Maneuver - OH2: Unnecessary Maneuver - OH3: Inappropriate Maneuver - OH4: Detrimental Maneuver 
The preliminary safety analyses of the example CNPC Link System supporting the example DAA RWC PITL with informational display are based on the assumption that annunciated DAA Loss-of-Function is Major. 

Note: If the above assumption of the failure condition of the DAA function is not valid, 
the results of the preliminary safety analysis for the example CNPC Link System supporting the example DAA function summarized in Section K.5.5 are invalid." 
Note: See FAA AC 23.1309-1E for failure condition classification.  
FTA's were performed for the four identified DAA operational hazards to allocate safety requirements down to the systems level.  As indicated in Figure K-48 fault trees for OH1, CNPC Link System safety allocation is covered under the Guidance (downlink) and Command (uplink) functions (based on the pilot-in-the-loop, no automation system being considered herein).  
 

The FTA provides 8x10-5 per flight hour allocation to the UAS system (DAA, CNPC Link System, UA, PS), leaving an allocation for CNPC Link System Loss of Function about 10- 5 per flight hour (based on PITL concept, with no DAA automation on the UA). Figure K-49 shows the FTA addressing failure of Display Function (DAA and COMMS), of which failure would contribute to the UAS system function. Once the safety cases (FTA's) are baselined for the DAA RWC PITL with informational display (with no DAA automation on the UA), the safety structure is utilized to evaluate the impacts of different level of automation.  Main impact was to Guidance and Command functions, likely to impact required CNPC safety allocations. 

## K.5.5.3 Safety Analyses Results And Example Discussion

This subsection summarizes the CNPC Link System safety analysis results following the methodology described in Section K.5.5.2 for L Band and C Band CNPC Link Systems on Risk Classes 5 and 6 large UAS.  

 
The probability of an unannunciated missed, false, misleading or erroneous information transfer failure of the CNPC Link System providing PITL DAA RWC service function should be on the order of 10-6 or less, per flight hour (Hazardous/Major (10-6 < Hazardous / Major < 10-7)).  
 

 
The probability of (detected) loss of function of the CNPC Link System (i.e. the probability of a Lost CNPC Link) providing PITL DAA RWC service function should be on the order of 10-5 or less, per flight hour (Major (10-5 < Major < 10-6)).  
Note: Probabilities of failure are provided for the large UAS (Risk Classes 5 and 6 in Section K.3.2 and operating in Classes D, E, and G (transition to/from Class A) 
airspaces.  Probabilities of failure for the smaller UAS's (Risk Classes 1, 2, 3, and 
4 in Section K.3.2) can be scaled from the probabilities of failure for the large UAS's using the kinetic energy relationship for fixed wing UA as described in Section K.3.2 and.  The probabilities of failure in Section K.3.2 and takes into account the UA system intended use and area of operation. 

The preliminary safety analysis results summarized above in Section K.5.5.3 indicate that failure of the CNPC Link System supporting the DAA RWC function is Hazardous / Major (10-6 < Hazardous / Major < 10-7). 

The functional failure of the CNPC system was further delineated in two paths for manufacturers' designs in the future.  There are two overarching failure conditions identified that significantly impact severity as described below: 

1) An undetected failure of CNPC Link System supporting DAA RWC 2) A detected failure of CNPC supporting DAA RWC  
Below are the CNPC Link System supporting example(s) DAA RWC PITL with informational display: An undetected failure of the CNPC Link System supporting DAA RWC is considered to be the most severe condition when the DAA RWC is used to maintain vigilance by the pilot to remain well-clear while simultaneously expecting the DAA system to mitigate a potential encounter to avoid a collision event. A flight operation with an undetected failure of the CNPC Link System, the DAA system or both could lead directly to a collision event. This scenario is worst-case, but quite realistic as such is the case when external barriers are not available for mitigation. The sole expectation and responsibility of primary CNPC Link System supporting DAA RWC is that, together, they employ a Self-
Separation capability to provide this level of flight safety capability to the pilot, then failing undetected, would be classified as Catastrophic for the manufacturer's CNPC Link System application and intended operation using applied known safety system methodologies (RTCA/DO-264, SAE ARP 4761, Guidelines and Methods for Conducting the Safety Assessment Process on Civil Airborne Systems and Equipment, and ARP 4754A, Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems). 

Note: External Barrier Mitigations: The authorized use of layered approaches that 
incorporate passive or active deterministic safety controls applied though operational, functional or performance capabilities during off-nominal conditions, with the intention to provide assurances to maintain NAS Level of Safety through reliable, repeatable anticipated flight behaviors when CNPC, DAA, or both functions are in a failure or off-nominal conditions. 
However, in considering alternative solutions for undetected functional failures of the relational CNPC / DAA RWC, an applicant could develop a modified "safety expectation" of the CNPC Link System supporting DAA RWC by applying a well-defined set of "external barrier mitigations" intended to provide a layered protection to safely prevent collisions and not pass the safety burden to other NAS users. If the use of agreedupon deterministic external barrier mitigation approaches are available, and to what level 
 
working in conjunction with CNPC Link System supporting DAA RWC, then it may be possible to reduce the level of severity to Hazardous / Major. A detected failure of the CNPC Link System supporting DAA RWC is a known failure condition; one that will have protocols to follow to ensure the resulting consequences will lessen the impact on severity. Declaring an emergency is one such case in the detected failure of CNPC Link System or DAA, and the pilot will no longer be required to "see and avoid," but this declaration will impact the NAS. Even with a known failure condition of the DAA, the impact results in a significant reduction in the level of safety to other NAS users and unduly burden others to mitigate for safety. However, in considering alternative solutions for a detected failure of the CNPC / DAA 
systems, an applicant could develop a modified "safety expectation" of the CNPC Link System supporting DAA RWC by applying a well-defined set of "external barrier mitigations" intended to provide a layered protection to safely prevent collisions and not pass the safety burden to other NAS users. If the use of agreed-upon deterministic external barrier mitigation approaches are available, and to what level working in conjunction with CNPC Link System supporting DAA RWC, then it may be possible to reduce the level of severity to Major. 

## Cnpc Link System Rlp Parameters Supporting Daa Rwc Pitl With Informational Display

This subsection summarizes the RLP parameters supporting DAA RWC PITL with informational display in different terrain conditions.  The link target availability can be degraded due to multipath and airframe losses.  This subsection discusses impact of link availability and continuity (more specifically, the losses in availability and continuity) on feasibility of a CNPC Link System that can satisfy the safety requirements of DAA RWC PITL with informational display.  It describes the link margins necessary to achieve the required link availability - a maximum range and UA altitude - due to multipath losses.  It also discusses how long and how often CNPC Link System interruptions due to multipath can be allowed until the link safety becomes degraded to support the DAA RWC PITL with informational display.  The losses in continuity on feasibility of a CNPC Link System that can satisfy the safety requirements of DAA RWC PITL with informational display is reflected in the time varying characteristics of link fading (e.g., probability of occurrence of the length of time of link interruptions - i.e. the lengths of the time-intervals for which the predicted received signal falls below the receiver sensitivity - and the time between consecutive interruptions). 

K.5.6.1 
DAA Timeline and CNPC Link System Transaction Expiration Time As shown in Section K.5.2, the expiration time for the DAA function with PITL involves the response time of the pilot and possibly ATC.  As a result, the overall expiration time for the DAA function is much longer than that reported in the CNPC Link System transaction expiration time of 2 sec.  The 107-second DAA timeline allocations and the associated timelines are summarized in the Table K-8.  In Table K-8, Traffic Avoidance Well Clear (TrAWC) Boundary is the duration between TrAWC and Near Mid-Air Collision (NMAC).  At Remain-Well-Clear Execution Threshold, the pilot has to take action to perform separation command.  Once the command is initiated, the UA will start maneuvering until it is clear.  If not, the pilot will take additional actions to avoid Near Mid-Air Collision (NMAC).

## K.5.6.2 Cnpc Link System Transaction Performance Assessment - An Example Safety Case Method 1

Following steps 1 to 4 in the process described in paragraph K.3, we determined how often messages can be missed or erroneous before the UAS safety becomes degraded for DAA RWC PITL. 

1. 

  From paragraph K.5.5.3:  The likelihood of an unannunciated missed, false, misleading or erroneous information transaction failure of the CNPC Link System providing DAA RWC PITL with informational display should be on the order of 10-6 or less, per flight hour (Risk Classes 5 and 6 in Section K.3.2). 

2. 

  From historical data for Part 91 operations:  The likelihood that an intruder aircraft will enter an own ship separation assurance (SA) volume on a collision course is 10-4 per flight hour. 

3. 

  To determine how often messages can be missed, false, misleading or erroneous before the UAS safety becomes degraded, in the face of the threat rate of 10-4 / hour, the combination of the SA and CNPC subsystems must be designed to allow no more than 10- 2 / hour. 

4. 

  If this budget is allocated equally to the SA and CNPC subsystems, the CNPC 
subsystem must allow no more than .5 x 10-2 / hour. Following step 3 in the process described in paragraph K.3, we determined the following frequency and length of the CNPC Link System interruptions from the link analysis. 

5. From paragraph K.4.4.1.6.3:  The analysis in paragraph K.4.4.1.6.3 indicated that the fraction of one hour the link experiences 2 second or more outages can be calculated as follows based on using a TIREM-based EPL of 11dB: there are (5-1) = 4 outages that could be as large as 2 seconds, and 1 outage that could be as large as 3 seconds, for a total of 4x2 + 1x3 = 11 seconds in one hour, for a fractional probability of 11/3600 = .003055. For the example case addressed in this Appendix K, since the frequency of interruptions of a length less than the Transaction Expiration Time (from item 5 above) is less than the safety target determined from item 4 above, the safety target has been met. 

## Method 2

For Risk Classes 5 and 6 UAS: 1 x 10-6 mid-air collisions per hour (corresponds to the probability of an unannunciated missed, false, misleading or erroneous information transfer failure of the CNPC Link System providing PITL DAA RWC service function of 10-6 or less, per flight hour - see paragraph K.5.5.3) and 1 x10-4 probability of an intruder entering a collision volume per hour.  So in 1 x 106 hours there are on average 100 potential collisions (1 x10-4/1 x 10-6). Each collision event takes 107 seconds (see paragraph K.5.6.1, Table K-10).  This is a total time of 107 x 100 = 1.07 x 104 seconds.  If we conservatively assume a single 2 second fade can cause a mid-air collision, then the tolerable Interfade Duration for a 2 second fade is 1.07 x 104 seconds or 2.97 hours. However, the analysis above is based on Risk Classes 5 and 6 UAS, which we know from paragraph 5.5.3 (Integrity = 10-6) and from SC-203's analysis will have to use dual links to achieve the level of Availability required. 

 
If we optimistically assume complete decorrelation between the two links, then each link will be allowed to meet a lower performance.  This will allow a 2 second fade on one link to cause a mid-air collision SQRT (1 x 10-6) = 1 x10-3 per flight hour.  So in 1 x 103 hours there are on average 0.1 potential collisions (1 x10-4/1 x 10-3).  This results in an Interfade Duration of 10.7 seconds. The allowable Interfade Duration time is between 10.7 and 107 seconds because we will not get complete decorrelation and the actual critical time for a message to get through is only part of the total time line. For UAS Risk Classes 5 and 6:  

 
Allowable Average Interfade Duration: between 10.7 and 107 seconds. 
 
Allowable Maximum Fade Duration (Transaction Expiration Time): 2 sec.  

## K.5.6.3 Cnpc Link System Rlp Supporting Daa Rwc Pitl With Informational Display

The following discusses RLP A/2 and RLP B, as described in subsection K.5.2.  RLP A/2 is one-way performance used for characterizing track data transmission and telemetry data distribution. RLP B is a two-way performance that requires message acknowledgement such as used for CNPC message transmission.  The acknowledgement time in RLP B is negligible.  It also assumes that the system transaction time for RLP B uplink is the same for the system transaction time for RLP B/2 telemetry downlink. The RLP A/2 shown in Tables K-9 and K-10 are for sea water and hilly terrains and UAS minimum level of automation.  The RLP B for water and hilly terrains and UAS minimum level of automation has the same performance parameters and characteristics shown for RLP A/2.  See referenced paragraphs for link parameters and conditions such as transmitter output power, ground antenna height.  
Note 1: See Section K.4.4.1.5: The maximum UA ranges and altitudes for 99.8% link availability shown in Tables K-3 and K-4 indicates lost link condition due to multipath.  
Note 2: See Section K.4.4.1.6.2 for link parameters and conditions.

conditions described in Section K.5.6.2.1 < Target transaction failure rate (0.005): It is achievable for L Band to support the DAA function. Based on Section K.4.4.1.6.2, it is achievable for L or C Band to support the DAA function with EPL of no less than 20dB. 
Note 4: See Section K.5.4: OPNET was used to calculate the CNPC Link System 
Transaction time.  The CNPC Link System transaction times shown in the following Tables include data link (antenna-to-antenna) transaction time and the ground/airborne processing time.  The CNPC Link System transaction time does 
not address pilot response time.

## Cnpc Link System Rlp Parameters And Characteristics For Uas Command And Control With Minimum Level Of Automation Command And Control Considerations

The UAS command and control functions may include some or all of the following: the onboard control function which provides the basic stability and remote manual control capability for the UA; the autopilot function which provides for automatic flight control of the UA; the flight director which provides visual flight guidance cues to pilot on the ground; the Flight Management function (excluding the data bases and the planning part) which provides the capability to execute pre-programmed automatic flight path and aircraft management; the PS flight controls subsystem which provides the UAS pilot/operator the means to control the UA; and the PS display system.  The removal of the onboard pilot introduces new operational safety risks due to dependence of the UAS command and control on new systems, including the PS, the CNPC Link System, new onboard avionics/automation systems and reduced awareness of the pilot of the UA 
condition and onboard systems status.  The following lists several novel and unique UAS command and control design, functionalities and operations relative to manned aircraft flight control system with an onboard pilot:  

 
Airborne and ground allocation of command and control functions.  UAS 
command and control may encompass: onboard Stability Augmentation Systems (SAS), manual control system, automatic control systems and Navigation/Flight Guidance Systems (NFGS), a pilot station and a CNPC Link System between the UA and the GRS.  Manual and automatic pilot systems provide real time control inputs to control the aircraft flight path through specific commands generated either by the pilot or autopilot.  The automatic control system provides various modes for automatic control of specific aircraft state variables such as vertical speed or flight path angle, altitude, heading or track angle, and airspeed.  The automatic control system may also provide one or more specialized modes that can be used to couple the automatic control system to the navigation/flight guidance system, to automatically control of the aircraft relative to an implicit flight path, or to a flight path defined explicitly by way points.  SAS are used to provide artificial stability to an aircraft with inadequate basic stability and thereby make safe manual control by a pilot possible.  A SAS may also serve as an inner loop subsystem for the automatic control modes.  All of these modes use aircraft flight condition and inertial reference information as feedbacks to perform their mission.  Additional signals, such as control surface position or other monitoring signals are used as required to ensure aircraft performance and safety. 
 
Different levels of automation incorporated.  The diverse variations in the levels of automation and associated architectures of UAS command and control offer many choices in distribution of automation between airborne and ground command and control components, pilot on the loop/in the loop.  
 
Effects of unique pilot and command and control PS interface on command and control performance. 
 
Effects of CNPC Link System transaction time, inherent in having the pilot geographically separated from the UA, on command and control performance during normal, non-normal and emergency conditions.  The UAS command and control must provide adequate stability and safe control taking into account CNPC Link System transaction time throughout the UAS expected flight envelope. 
 
Effects of different unmanned aircraft performance on command and control performance. 
 
Effects of pilot neutral force feel and reduced situation awareness on UAS command and control performance.   
 
Reduced awareness of the pilot of the UA condition and onboard systems status. 
 
Sensors substitute for pilot senses.  If essential, must be linked and displayed (or acted on, if autonomous). 
 
Required command and control performance and behavior to provide automatic collision avoidance (e.g., automatic ACAS Xu) function, if implemented (similar to automatic, coupled TCAS).  Automatic execution of a resolution advisory is needed due to latencies inherent in having the UAS pilot geographically separated from his or her aircraft or to execute the collision avoidance maneuver during lost link. 
 
Figure K-50 provides a conceptual overview of an example UAS command and control functional diagram and depicts the interfaces between the functional elements.  The figure includes depiction of the interface between the UA command and control functions with the CNPC Link System.  In order to show most of the possible components, Figure K-50 
assumes a sophisticated Navigation, Guidance, and Control (NGC) system.  This may include UA Flight Control System, Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) / Future Air Navigation System (FANS) / Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN), UA and Engine Performance Models, and Surveillance System (ADS-B, Mode S Transponder, DAA Radar, DAA Remain-Well-Clear (RWC), Collision Avoidance System (CAS), Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS), and Weather Radar).  It is understood that not all UAS will have all of these NGC components; however, it is depicted here for completeness.  The architecture choice in Figure K-50 allows optimization of the closeloop control (mostly on the UA), while performing the slow extensive computations on the ground (flight path construction).  For military applications, SAE Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP)94910, Aerospace - Vehicle Management Systems - Flight Control Design, Installation and Test of, Military Unmanned Aircraft, Specification Guide 
[7] describes specification of the flight control related functions - for the flight control of remotely controlled, augmented and autonomous UA - of military unmanned aircraft vehicle management systems.  

Different UAS command and control level of automation will have different RLP requirements.  This section describes the RLP requirements for the UAS command and control functions with minimum level of automation.  The following subsection describes command and control functions and provides a notional description of how they interact with the CNPC Link System. In this Section K.6, minimum level of automation for command and control means a Pilot- In-The-Loop approach to performing command and control functions using a display during takeoff, climb, descent, approach, and landing in Classes D, E, and G (transition 
 
to/from Class A) airspaces; and Pilot-On-The-Loop (POTL) approach to performing command and control functions using a display during cruise in Classes D, E, G airspaces. Within the context of a PITL approach to performing command and control functions using a display, the PIC provides flight plan and manually maneuvers the control of the UA. Within the context of a POTL approach to performing command and control functions using a display, the PIC provides command setting of flight path and control targets and monitoring of operations.  In the POTL context, the PIC provides flight plan and manual setting of control targets and operations monitoring in autopilot mode using a display; and the PIC provides pilot monitoring of operation in autopilot pre-programmed flight path execution mode using a display. In this section K.6, manual operation means the pilot is steering and orienting the UA by exercising direct control, via the control link, of the UA's ailerons and other control surfaces during takeoff and landing.  PITL command and control displays refer to the display of UA manual control information [2] and manual navigational aids information [2] to aid pilot decision making.  Automatic operation means the pilot is exercising indirect control by means of waypoints and/or course and altitude commands, which the UA's onboard processor then converts into signals that cause the control surfaces to respond in a manner that achieves the desired result.  POTL command and control displays refer to the display of UA automatic control information [2] and automatic navigational aids information [2] to aid pilot decision making. 

## Rlp Transaction Time Supporting Command And Control Function With Minimum Level Of Automation

OPNET was used to calculate the CNPC Link System transaction times for the transactions of messages for the Service Class 1, Manual [Appendix J, Data Rate Information, in this MOPS document].  The RLP system transaction times are summarized in Tables K-14 and K-15 in subsection K.6.5. 

## Safety Analyses Of Cnpc Link System Supporting Command And Control Function With Minimum Level Of Automation K.6.3.1 Assumptions

Safety analyses were conducted for large UAS's (Risk Classes 5 and 6 in Section K.3.2) 
operating in Classes D, E, and G (transition to/from Class A) airspaces. 

## K.6.3.2 Safety Analyses Results And Discussion

This subsection summarizes the CNPC Link System safety analysis results following the methodology described in Section K.5.5.2 for L Band and C Band CNPC Link Systems on Risk Classes 5 and 6 large UAS's.  

 
The probability of an unannunciated failure of the CNPC Link System providing command and control function with minimum level of automation should be on the order of 10-7 or less, per flight hour.  
 
The probability of the loss of the CNPC Link System providing command and control function with minimum level of automation should be on the order of 10-6 or less, per flight hour.  
Note: Failure here refers to missed, false, misleading or erroneous information transfers by the CNPC Link System.  
 

Note: Probabilities of failure are provided for the large UAS's (Risk Classes 5 and 6 in 
Section K.3.2) operating in Classes D, E, and G (transition to/from Class A) airspaces.  Probabilities of failure for the smaller UAS's (Risk Classes 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Section K.3.2) can be scaled from the probabilities of failure for the large 
UAS's using the kinetic energy relationship for fixed wing UA's as described in Section K.3.2  

## Cnpc Link System Rlp Parameters And Discussion K.6.4.1 Cnpc Link System Transaction Expiration Time Supporting Command And Control Function

If the CNPC Link System is only used to update Flight Plan of the Command and Control, then the CNPC link transaction expiration time to support Command and Control Flight Plan update is about 2 secs. 

Note 1: 2 sec Command and Control Transaction Expiration Time - Time from flight plan update completed to start upload flight plan update to the FMS Guidance/Steering. 

Using the above assumption that CNPC Link System is only used to update flight plan, then there will be a requirement as follows: The assessment of the Command and Control Link transaction expiration time does NOT address the UAS using the CNPC Link System for closed loop control. 

Note 2: Command and Control loops are sensitive to transaction time (< 300 msecs) 
which cannot be guaranteed by the current CNPC Link technology. 

Note 3: Using the CNPC Link System to upload new flight plans or targets is not considered closed loop as it is outside the summation junction of the feedforward and feedback branches. 

The Command and Control architecture described in Section K.6.1 and Figure K-50 promotes this choice, but allows the option to hand fly the UAS and/or send FD modes/references.  The hand-fly option is available to the certification applicants provided that they demonstrate and document the link performance and limitations (given the CNPC Link System transaction expiration time of 2 seconds). 

Note 4: Hand-flying the UAS with CNPC Link System is considered closed-loop and can subject the UAS to pilot induced oscillation. Accordingly, it is subject to Closed-Loop transaction time requirements (~ 300 msecs). But, some applicant might be able to demonstrate performance during RLOS maneuvers or other alternatives. 

The Command and Control flight plan update timeline allocations and the associated timelines are summarized in the Table K-11. 


## K.6.4.2 Summary Of Cnpc Link System Transaction Expiration Time

As discussed in Sections K.5.6.1 and K.6.4.1, the CNPC Link System RLP transaction expiration time is 2 secs to support DAA Remain-Well-Clear PITL with informational display or Command and Control Flight Plan update.  
Note: The assessment of the Command and Control transaction expiration time does not address the UAS using the CNPC Link System for closed loop control. 

## K.6.4.3 Cnpc Link System Rlp Supporting Command And Control Function

This section describes the CNPC Link System RLP parameters and characteristics supporting PITL and POTL command and control function.  The effects of multipath on the link were considered.  Subsection K.4.4.2 addresses the link margins necessary to achieve 99.8% link availability due to airframe losses. The results for RLP parameters shown in Tables K-12 and K-13 are for water and hilly terrains and minimum level of automation for UAS command and control.  See referenced paragraphs for link parameters and conditions such as transmitter output power, ground antenna height.  
Note 1: See Section K.4.4.1.5: The maximum UA ranges and altitudes for 99.8% link availability shown in Tables K-3 and K-4 indicates lost link condition due to multipath.  
Note 2: See Section K.6.4.1: The CNPC Link System RLP transaction expiration time is 2 

secs to support Command and Control Flight Plan update.

## Cnpc Link System Rlp Parameters And Characteristics For Other Service Classes Ats Data Relay, Weather Radar And Video Service Considerations K.7.1.1 Cnpc Link System Rlp Parameters And Discussion

This section describes the CNPC Link System RLP parameters and characteristics supporting ATS Data Relay, Weather Radar and Video Service Classes, Manual [Appendix J, Data Rate Information, in this MOPS document].  The effects of multipath on the link were considered.  Subsection K.4.4.2 addresses the link margins necessary to achieve 99.8% link availability due to airframe losses.  The results for RLP parameters shown in Tables K-14 and K-15 are for water and hilly terrains for UAS ATS data relay, weather radar and video service classes with and command and control minimum level of automation.  See referenced paragraphs for link parameters and conditions such as transmitter output power, ground antenna height.    

Note 1: See Section K.4.4.1.5: The maximum UA ranges and altitudes for 99.8% link 
availability shown in Tables K-3 and K-4 indicates lost link condition due to 
multipath.  
Note 2: See Section K.5.4: OPNET was used to calculate the CNPC Link System 
Transaction time.  The transaction time shown in the following Tables includes data link (antenna-to-antenna) transaction time and the ground/airborne processing time.  The CNPC Link System transaction time does not address pilot response time. (1) Uplink 
 
 
(2) Downlink 
Note 3: Pilot/ATC voice communications will be relayed via the CNPC Link System; at 
least until the FAA voice switching system comes into operation.  Therefore, the CNPC Link System shall provide for voice communication delays less than or equal to 250 msecs in accordance with FAA (2012) NAS Requirement 3.2.2.0-5.0- 1 (250 msecs Transaction Expiration Time for ATS Voice Relay). 
Note 4: See Section K.4.4.1.6.2 for link parameters and conditions.  
 
(1) Average Fade Duration; 3NM range and 3,500 ft. altitude (Water), 7,500 ft. (Hilly).  

 
 
(2)  Average Interfade Duration; 3NM range and 3,500 ft. altitude (Water), 7,500 ft. (Hilly).  
Note 5: The safety analyses used to derive the achievable values for the CNPC Link 
System RLP parameters and characteristics of Integrity, I per flight hour, supporting minimum level of automation for ATS data relay, weather radar and video services are similar to the analyses described in subsection K.5.5, Safety Analyses.  

 
 
(1) The probability of the loss of the CNPC Link System providing ATS data relay, weather radar and video function with minimum level of automation for command and control.  
 
 
(2) The probability of the unannunciated failure of the CNPC Link System 
providing ATS data relay, weather radar and video function with minimum level of automation for command and control.

## Relationships Between Cnpc Link System Rlp Parameters And Levels Of Automation

An applicant seeking certification and operational approval has a variety of functional allocations and risk mitigations which can potentially be brought forward to make a safety case.  The specific performance level required of the CNPC Link System is dependent on these other potential mitigations. This appendix examines a variety of topics related to levels of automation and associated architectures.  This includes topics such as potential automation strategies for DAA and command and control functions, Lost CNPC Link applications and potential choices in distribution of automation between airborne and ground components. The designs and collective performance of the CNPC Link System and DAA and command and control functions are linked.  The resulting DAA and command and control functions and CNPC Link System engineering products are the products of key design and performance tradeoffs between DAA and command and control functions and the CNPC Link System.  For a particular CNPC Link System, DAA and command and control functions, an increase or decrease in the CNPC Link System RLP, levels of automation for DAA and command and control functions may allow a trade-off in design complexity provided that the target level of safety is achieved. Figure K-51 depicts the relationship between CNPC Link System RLP, automation performance and the level of operational acceptability that is associated with the joint performance of the coupled system. 

On the vertical axis, we see a series of possible increasing levels of RLP, from single link architectures through multiple command link/control link architectures to full L Band and C Band diversity.  In developing the CNPC Link System MOPS, we will define a level of link performance (or a series of levels) for the CNPC radio.  Designers can then use these data to determine the RLP of their particular system, which will depend on the characteristics of the message transactions of their system and the level of automation for the operation of their aircraft. On the horizontal axis we see a series of possible increasing levels of automation, in three forms: (1) DAA or command and control function automation, (2) Lost CNPC Link automation and (3) ground and air distribution of automation.  As an example, exclusive pilot in the loop would require a higher level of RLP than would be required with greater DAA automation.  Perhaps not as intuitively, more extensive airborne automation might mitigate air-ground requirements. The blue diagonal line represents the joint level of performance required to provide the applicant with a suitable solution that is operationally acceptable to the certification authorities.  As depicted in Figure K-51, it is entirely possible to define a certifiable CNPC Link System, and a DAA or command and control system, that when combined do not rise to an acceptable level of joint performance to gain certification and operational approval. Acceptable is somewhere in the middle. Underpinning the basic trades of RLP performance versus DAA and command and control performance within the framework of operational acceptability, one must also keep in mind the complexity and associated cost of certification and production of associated solution sets. In making these trades there are a number of considerations to keep in mind: 
 

 
The discussion of the hazard level and development assurance level hinges on several things, to include: (1) the investigation of requirements on loss of the CNPC Link System, (2) traditional mitigations including ATC actions on flight plan, and (3) the traditional navigation backups for the proposed flight which are 
still required.  The entire DAA and command and control architecture may then serve as mitigation of loss of CNPC Link System.    
The more automation on the UA itself, the less the stringency is on the CNPC Link System performance.   

 
Flight management functional allocations, air vs. ground, or split, are another key consideration. Specifically, how much is duplicative or distributed between ground and air?  Where is the master flight plan? 
 
Consideration must be given to requirements for availability and continuity of function.  The integration of exposure time in the discussion is likely to be controversial in terms of lowering certification levels.   
 
From an aircraft certification perspective, the difference between manned and unmanned aviation is the replacement of a physical avionics link (connecting pilot with control surface) with a wireless signal in space that provides that connectivity.  What effect does this have on the traditional hazard class determination?  Should we construct separate arguments for loss of UAS telecommand and telemetry control (command and control) link and loss of pilot/ATC communications link? 
 
From a CNPC Link System perspective, an implication of automation is its relationship with transmission bandwidth and resulting communications rate.  In general terms, the more automated a UAS becomes the lower the transmission bandwidth requirements become while still supporting the required CNPC Link System RLP. 
 
The control link thread transmits and receives control instructions to the aircraft for DAA and command and control.  A lost CNPC Link System condition should not cause an immediate unstable flight situation or any undue work load for ATC. The criticality of the link is commensurate with the aforementioned assertion. Beyond-Visual-Line-of-Sight (BVLOS) UA's must have an ability to maintain predictable flight on a planned heading and altitude if they lose CNPC Link System.  
 
Any safety assessment will address the loss of control thread as loss of pilot and Pilot Station intervention of the aircraft.  Mitigations considered would be automatic onboard DAA and command and control equipment. 
The following lists several considerations for levels of automation of the DAA and command and control functions: 

1. Different levels of automation incorporated.  The diverse variations in the 
levels of automation and associated architectures of UAS command and control system offer many choices in distribution of automation between airborne and ground command and control system components, pilot in the loop, and pilot on the loop.  
2. Generally, the more automation on the UA itself, the less the dependency is 
on the CNPC Link System availability, continuity, transaction expiration time, integrity, and the required mitigations.  
 
3. Relationships between CNPC Link System integrity and levels of automation.  
The more automation on the UA itself, the less the stringency is on the CNPC Link System integrity.  For this MOPS document, safety analyses were conducted for two categories of POTL and display architectural functions: 
Autopilot Modes - PIC provides flight plan, pilot manual setting of control targets and operations monitoring; and Autopilot pre-programmed flight path execution - Pilot monitoring of operation architecture.  Fully Automatic UA onboard decision making and operation (intelligent operation) - Pilot monitoring of automatic UA operation was not considered. 
The following summarizes the CNPC Link System safety analysis results following the methodology described in Section K.5.5.2 for L Band and C Band CNPC Link Systems on Risk Classes 5 and 6 large UAS's.  

 
The probability of an unannunciated failure of the CNPC Link System providing command and control function with display and minimum level of automation should be on the order of 10-7 or less, per flight hour.  (See subsection K.6.3.2) 
 
The probability of the loss of the CNPC Link System providing command and control function with display and minimum level of automation should be on the order of 10-6 or less, per flight hour. (See subsection K.6.3.2) 
 
The probability of an unannunciated failure of the CNPC Link System providing command and control function with display and POTL (higher level of automation) should be on the order of 10-6 or higher, per flight hour.  
 
The probability of the loss of the CNPC Link System providing command and control function with display and POTL (higher level of automation) should be on the order of 10-5 or higher, per flight hour.  
 
The probability of an unannunciated failure of the CNPC Link System providing DAA RWC PITL with informational display function should be on the order of 10-6 or less, per flight hour.  (See subsection K.5.5.3) 
 
The probability of the loss of the CNPC Link System providing DAA RWC PITL with informational display function should be on the order of 10-5 or less, per flight hour.  (See subsection K.5.5.3) 
 
The probability of an unannunciated failure of the CNPC Link System providing DAA RWC POTL with informational display function should be on the order of 10-5 or higher, per flight hour.   
 
The probability of the loss of the CNPC Link System providing DAA RWC POTL with informational display function should be on the order of 10-4 or higher, per flight hour. 
Note: Failure here refers to missed, false, misleading or erroneous information transfers by the CNPC Link System.  
Note: Probabilities of failure are provided for the large UAS's (Risk Classes 5 and 6 in Section K.3.2) operating in Classes D, E, and G (transition to/from Class A) airspaces.  Probabilities of failure for the smaller UAS's (Risk Classes 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Section K.3.2) can be scaled from the probabilities of failure for the large 
 
UAS's using the kinetic energy relationship for fixed wing UA's as described in Section K.3.2.  

## Mitigations

This section describes design and procedures mitigations required in different scenarios, under different flight phases and environmental conditions based on assessment of the CNPC Link System RLP results discussed in sections K.4, K.5, K.6, and K.7.  

Note: This section describes several methods (but not the only methods) to minimize the 
impact of CNPC Link System impairments and lost link to safely support DAA WRC PITL with informational display, Command and Control, and other services with informational display with minimum and increasing levels of automation. 

## Mitigations To Cnpc Link System

1. UAS radio systems should provide CNPC Link System services to a level of RLP 
adequate to support the safety requirements of the class of UAS in which it is installed or connected and in the environment in which the UAS operates. 
Note 1: Compliance with this requirement will be demonstrated by the use of the data 
captured during the flight tests described in this MOPS document, section 3.3, Test Procedures for Installed Equipment Performance, and the UAS design applicant's safety case. 
Note 2: The effects of CNPC Link System availability, continuity, transaction expiration 
time, and integrity on the CNPC Link System service function performance must be taken into account during normal, abnormal and emergency conditions.  
Note 3: While the CNPC Link System is in an interrupted condition but prior to the UAS 
declaring a Lost CNPC Link the UA is in its most safety degraded condition because neither is the pilot able to actively manage the flight nor is the UA following preprogramed, predictable maneuvers pre-coordinated with ATC. Determine unacceptable link interruptions duration for the CNPC Link System design and operating environment similar to the assessment described in this appendix and provide appropriate mitigations.  
2. In the event of loss of all links with the GRS the UA will automatically squawk a 
pre-determined transponder code and execute the pre-programmed lost link 
function; and the pilot/operator will contact ATC and state the contingency trajectory.   
3. There are various ways to improve CNPC Link performance.  Some of them are 
listed below.   
 
Excess Link Margin:  Degradations in availability and continuity can be caused by undesirable propagation effects such as, multipath cancellation. Such effects can cause the received power to be significantly less than the power expected in free space (with omnidirectional antennas).  If the probability of these excess losses versus their magnitude were known, then enough extra power could be transmitted to lower the unavailability to an acceptable value. 
 
Time Diversity:  Transmitting extra power may not always be a practical solution.  If the separate transmissions are degraded by statistically independent processes, sending messages multiple times (or repeating messages if no acknowledgement is received) can be a way to improve performance.  Because such methods will require extra bandwidth and 
 
more time, the benefits of these techniques need to be weighed against their disadvantages.  

 
Spatial Diversity:  To overcome blockage and multipath effects, spatial diversity in the form of multiple antennas can be used.  For example, 
airframe blockage can be mitigated by placing antennas on the fuselage top and bottom or forward and aft (or on the wingtips of fixed-wing aircraft).  In such cases it seems unlikely that both antennas would be blocked simultaneously.  To address ground multipath issues, multiple well-separated ground antennas can be useful.   
 
There is a downside to such methods in terms of cost (beyond just the cost of the antennas themselves).  Typically, each antenna will have its own radio attached.  Also, the receivers could be linked together and different receptions will have to be sorted out via some type of voting algorithm.   
 
Frequency Diversity:  Sending messages simultaneously in both L- and C Band can be a way to ensure that there are two paths with statistically independent fading mechanisms.  This is similar to time diversity techniques, but it would not involve an increase in transaction time.  On the other hand, two types of radios would be needed on the ground and in the air.  This could be a problem for small UA with size, weight and power constraints, especially because C Band communications can have path-loss issues - requiring more power and/or directional antennas.  Such small UA could be included in a category requiring less stringent RLP parameters. 
 
Improving link availability and continuity performance with the UA being able to hand-off its link connection to another GRS, using higher link layer work-arounds, or using variable data rate control, etc. 
 
The use of circular polarization antenna(s) or other configurations, for example, dual linear polarization should be considered to mitigate fading. 
 
Integrity:  Techniques to ensure a specified integrity level include forward error correction codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon, Turbo Code), simple checksums, Fletcher checksums, cyclic redundancy codes (CRCs), context matching and possibly others.  These methods involve adding extra bits to each message.  The integrity level can be improved by increasing the number of extra bits.  The numbers of extra bits required is generally not a significant driver of required throughput.  Link redundancy (active diversity redundancy - separate hardware paths or elements carrying the same data or providing the same function, or standby - backup - path) can also be used to provide link integrity. 
4. Conduct the CNPC Link System operation within the maximum operating range 
and minimum operating altitude defined for the intended operational environment based on the CNPC Link System RLP assessment equivalent to the validated assessment described in this appendix.    
5. Antenna nulling and shadowing is dictated by antennas placement on the airframe 
and the resulting look angles to the ground radio system(s).  Demonstrate the UA antennas installation operating in conjunction with the ground radio system(s) provide adequate coverage for minimum antenna gain to achieve the required link availability with link margin for antenna shadowing/nulling. 
 

6. The pilots have an ability to modify the link continuity performance by mapping 
out areas of terrain blockage as part of flight planning.   
7. Information relating to Site surveys from any given GRS can be stored in memory 
onboard the UA to delineate how a UA, in an emergency, can reestablish a LOS 
link with the GRS, and with minimum fuel or minimum time.   
8. In the event of Lost CNPC Link as indicated by maximum UA ranges and 
minimum safe altitudes for the required link availability, the pilot will notify ATC by alternate means of lost link and expected behavior of the UA until link is reestablished or UA lands or ends its mission.  
9. The UAS tolerance to CNPC Link System availability, continuity, transaction 
expiration time, transaction time, and integrity depends on the levels of automation architecture of command and control loops as shown in Figure K-51. Generally, the more automation on the UA itself, the less the dependency is on the CNPC Link System availability, continuity, transaction expiration time, integrity, and the required mitigations.  For example, a higher level of automation of the UAS could reduce the probability that a CNPC Lost Link event leads to a hazard, and hence allow the CNPC Link System RLP transaction expiration time to be increased.  

## Additional Mitigations To Command And Control

1. Conduct the UAS command and control and CNPC Link System operation within 
the maximum operating range and minimum safe operating altitude defined for the intended operational environment, and within the UA operating envelope with adequate coverage for minimum antenna gain to achieve the required link availability with link margin for antenna shadowing/nulling. 
2. The UAS command and control function should provide adequate stability and 
safe control taking into account CNPC Link System availability, continuity, transaction expiration time, and integrity throughout the UAS expected flight envelope. 
3. The UAS command and control function must provide safe and predictable flight 
guidance and control.  In the event of unacceptable link or lost CNPC Link System, the UAS command and control function should provide continued UA flight control to the last received command references (attitudes, speeds, path, and engine power).  In the case of persistent CNPC Link System unavailability, the UA should provide automatic command and control to execute the preprogrammed lost CNPC Link System function. 

## Additional Mitigations To Daa

1. In the event of safety degraded link interruptions (see note 3 in Section K.9.1), the 
DAA-equipped UA should provide track coasting, message acknowledgement, pilot/DAA operator cautions, warnings or annunciations. 
2. Conduct the DAA RWC PITL with informational display and CNPC Link System 
operation within the maximum operating range and minimum safe operating altitude defined for the intended operational environment, and within the UA operating envelope with adequate coverage for minimum antenna gain to achieve the required link availability with link margin for antenna shadowing/nulling. 
3. In the event of lost link, the DAA-equipped UA may automatically perform 
maneuvers to avoid collisions.  In the case of reported lost link, the pilot will 
 
notify ATC by alternate means of lost link and expected behavior of the UA until link is reestablished or UA lands or ends its mission.  

## Additional Mitigations To Atc Communications

1. Conduct the UAS command and control and CNPC Link System operation within 
the maximum operating range and minimum safe operating altitude defined for the intended operational environment, and within the UA operating envelope with adequate coverage for minimum antenna gain to achieve the required link availability with link margin for antenna shadowing/nulling. 
2. In the case of reported lost link, the pilot will notify ATC by alternate means of 
lost link and expected behavior of the UA until link is reestablished or UA lands or ends its mission.  

## Additional Mitigations To Weather Radar And Video

1. Conduct the UAS command and control and CNPC Link System operation within 
the maximum operating range and minimum safe operating altitude defined for the intended operational environment, and within the UA operating envelope with adequate coverage for minimum antenna gain to achieve the required link availability with link margin for antenna shadowing/nulling. 
2. If downlink only video transmission is required by the UAS design applicant's 
safety case then those video transmissions should comply with pertinent requirements of section 2.2.1 and other subsections in section 2.2 of this MOPS document. 

## Conclusion And Recommendations

This section summarizes a list of recommendations based on assessment of the CNPC Link System RLP results discussed in sections K.4 to K.9. 

 

 
Conduct the CNPC Link System operation within the maximum operating range and minimum operating altitude defined for the intended operational environment based on the CNPC Link System RLP assessment equivalent to the validated assessment described in this appendix. 
 
For a given terrain conditions an aircraft communicating from long range and low altitude requires greater margin (to achieve a given level of availability) than an aircraft that is communicating from short range and/or higher altitude due to multipath. 
 
Demonstrate the UA antennas installation operating in conjunction with the ground radio system(s) provide adequate coverage for minimum antenna gain to achieve the required link availability with link margin for antenna shadowing/nulling. 
 
The anticipated levels of CNPC Link System round trip link Availability (ARLP) and Continuity (CRLP) required for safe operation of command and control and 
DAA RWC with informational display for the various terrain environments can be achieved using the CNPC Link Systems described in this MOPS with attention paid to the link impairments and appropriate mitigations identified in sections K.5, K.6, and K.9 of this appendix. 
 

 
A suitable L Band and C Band CNPC Link System can be designed to achieve the required per-message probability of success, using FEC and diversity, with a UA transmitter in the power range described in Section 2.2.1. 
 
In general, the more automation on the UA itself, the less the dependency is on the 
CNPC Link System availability, continuity, transaction expiration time, integrity, and the required mitigations.  
Note: As discussed in this Appendix K, the CNPC Link System RLP is also dependent on the installed CNPC Link System application and intended operation and environment. 

 
This appendix describes acceptable AG channel modeling and OPNET simulation methods and tools that can be used to determine the CNPC Link System RLP parameters and characteristics of link availability and continuity due to multipath.

## Appendix L Example Cnpc Link System Link Budgets Introduction

This Appendix provides example link budgets for the portions of both the L and C Bands being considered in this MOPS.  The example link budgets are based on a number of assumptions (see below) that have been determined either by the anticipated operational use cases described in Section 1 and Appendix K or by technical requirements from Section 2 and other informative Appendices in this MOPS. These example link budgets were used in the validation of a number of the normative requirements contained in Section 2 of this MOPS such as the transmitter EIRPs and receiver sensitivities etc. This Appendix also includes example link budgets that consider the reception of undesired interference (U) by the victim receiver (ARS or GRS) simultaneously with reception of its desired signal (D).  These U/D example link budgets were used in the validation of the transmitter Power Spectral Density (PSD) masks and receiver Adjacent Channel Rejection (ACR) etc. requirements that are specified in Section 2.2.1. As noted above, without a certain number of basic assumptions, it is not possible to correctly size the CNPC Link System transmitter, receiver and antenna performance.  The following four areas were included in the basic assumptions that are contained in the example link budgets that follow this introduction. 

1) **UA Operating Range.**  To support the anticipated desired operations a nominal range 
of 35NM was considered appropriate for both L and C frequency band equipped UAS using omnidirectional antennas on the UA and Directional (higher gain) antennas on the ground.  Operation at longer ranges (up to approximately 100NM) with directional (higher gain) antennas on the UA will be possible while still complying with the EIRPSDs (see Antenna Gain assumption 3) for further discussion). 
2) **CNPC Link Symbol Rates.**  The analysis in Appendix J was used to set a nominal 
upper limit on Symbol Rate of 138ks/s (lower symbol rates are also allowed but will not present the stressing case on the example link budgets or the U/Ds).  Section 2.2.1.5.5 limits the maximum -40dBc channel bandwidth to 250kHz, which allows for Doppler and Frequency Accuracy additions to the basic modulated envelope spectral width while leaving the designer open to choose an alternate to the Baseline GMSK modulation (used in the example link budgets in this Appendix) if higher bit rates are 
desired. 
3) **Antenna Gains.**  Significant consideration was given to a number of aspects 
associated with antenna gains.  From a UA perspective, size and weight drove the focus on simple omnidirectional antennas; however, airframe shadowing and multipath effects, discussed in more detail in Appendix K led to the need to consider the effects of the installed omni antenna gain variations ranging from a minimum gain of -10dBi to +5 dBi in the example link budgets.  For larger UA that can carry directional antennas there is no significant reduction in the apparent gain due to the airframe (assuming the antenna is not pointed through the airframe); again Appendix K provides more detail on this topic.  For the GRS the required path losses necessitate a higher gain antenna be used.  If this antenna needs to be omnidirectional (as opposed to being pointed at the UA while mounted on an azimuth/elevation gimbal) then consideration of the off-axis EIRP PSD requirements contained in Section 2.2.1 will need to be given to ensure off-axis emissions do not cause more interference than that 
included in the U/D example link budgets in this Appendix. 
 

4) **Path Losses in Excess of Free Space Loss.**  Appendix K provides significant detail 
on this topic.  The path loss between the two CNPC Link System antennas consists not 
only of the "range squared" Free Space Loss (FSL) but also on the loss due to 
multipath and diffraction caused by the terrain below and near to the RLOS path 
between the two CNPC Link System antennas.  This Excess Path Loss (EPL) was quantified through both simulation and flight test and a 20dB EPL is included in all example link budgets.  This value was determined to be adequate to achieve the high levels of availability (99.8% assumed in this Appendix based on considerations of the safety analysis given in Appendix K) and continuity that CNPC Link Systems will be expected to deliver at the anticipated desired UA operating altitudes and ranges.  Type Certification applicants can propose alternate values for EPL but will need to provide 
analysis and possibly flight test data to substantiate them. 
In addition to the above four fundamental assumptions other considerations were also included in the example link budgets and example U/D link budgets. Transmitter powers of 10W at C Band and 32mW at L Band were used, not only to reflect the lower carrying capacity of the UA anticipated to use L Band but also in consideration of the L Band interference environment cited in Section 2 and described in more detail in Appendix G. Airframe related apparent antenna gain reduction, EPL and multipath enhancement of the Undesired signal level at the victim receiver were combined statistically in the example link budgets since it is very unlikely that worst case values for each will occur simultaneously. 

A 6dB "ICAO aeronautical safety margin" was included in the Desired path to ensure that the victim had additional protection even after all of the considerations described in this Appendix are included. Receiver noise figures of 4dB and 6dB were assumed for the L Band and C Band receivers, respectively.  In addition, the link budgets include consideration of antenna cable losses for the aircraft and ground installations.  Modem required Signal-to-Noise ratio in a bandwidth equal to the modulation symbol rate, Es/N0, for the Baseline modem waveform described in Section 2.2.2, which consists of GMSK modulation with a Recursive Turbo Convolutional Code with rate 5/8, was assumed including a 1 dB implementation loss; other designs that employ different modulation and error correction may be better or worse. For the U/D analysis, limitations on how close the Undesired transmitter could approach the Desired CNPC Link System's receiver were also included as a combination of altitude and range limit examples, when the Desired path is 35NM.  Limits on off-axis emissions from directional antennas are included in Section 2 .2.1 of this MOPS to provide protection under the majority of orientation configurations of transmitters and receivers.  It is possible for the interference levels in the example U/D link budgets to be exceeded, which may cause the Lost CNPC Link algorithm of the victim receiver to be initiated, but it is expected that this will be infrequent given the considerations in this Appendix and the validated requirements in the MOPS. 


## C Band Link Budgets C Band Air-To-Ground (Downlink) Link Budgets

The following link budget table provides examples that illustrate various combinations of ARS transmitter output power, modulation symbol rate and antenna gain and GRS antenna gain that provide sufficient link margin at the maximum intended coverage range. The modulation symbol rates correspond to the four downlink data classes defined in the main body of this MOPS. The link margins include margins for random multipath fading and airframe blockage (23.3 dB) as well 4 dB for interference and 6 dB ICAO safety margin.  The 4 dB interference margin includes 3 dB for increase in the average receiver noise plus average on-channel interference noise and 1 dB to allow for random interference enhancement due to multipath propagation and antenna gain due to the random takeoff angle of the interfering signal as the ARS that is the source of the interfering signal is maneuvering. The random RF interference enhancement combination with the random path loss variations of the desired signal are treated statistically as illustrated in the budgets in Section L.2.3. The link budgets also illustrate how the choice of ARS transmitter output power and antenna gain for each modulation symbol rate is in compliance with the downlink EIRP emissions mask specification.  In particular, note that the ARS on-Axis/on-channel EIRP shown for each of the modulation symbol rates is the maximum EIRP that complies with the downlink on-axis/off-channel EIRP emissions power spectral density assuming the transmitter off-channel emissions noise floor is -65 dB below the peak power spectral density of the modulation.

Note 1: 
Pavg = Pt - 10 LOG10 (Rs) 
 
Pavg is a reference transmitter output power density level for determining the transmitter output peak power density Ppeak measured at one modulation symbol rate Rs with a particular output power Pt and using the same reference level to calculate (not measure) the output peak power density with a different transmitter output power and modulation symbol rate (see Note 2). Pavg is a reference power density where the total output power is assumed to be uniformly distributed across a bandwidth equal to the modulation symbol rate.  One could choose to use a different bandwidth, e.g. the -40 dBc bandwidth of the modulated waveform, to determine the reference level but then the conversion factor for calculating the peak power density at different output power and modulation symbol rates would have to be adjusted accordingly.  The resulting value of the peak power density Ppeak would be the same regardless of which bandwidth is used to determine the reference level since the peak power density is a measured value at one modulation symbol rate. 

 

Note 2: 
Ppeak = Pavg +7 
 
Ppeak is a reference transmitter output power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions power density noise floor PN measured at one modulation symbol rate Rs with a particular output power Pt and using the same reference level to calculate (not measure) the peak power density with a different transmitter output power and modulation symbol rate (see Note 3). The 7 dB difference between Ppeak and Pavg has been determined from measurements with a prototype CNPC radio that employs GMSK modulation which serves as the basis for the specification of the off-channel emissions noise floor.  Other modulation types may have different peak power densities relative to a uniform (average) reference level. 

 
Note 3: 
PN = Ppeak - 65 
 
PN is the transmitter off-channel emissions power density noise floor which are assumed to be -65 dB below the transmitter output peak power density Ppeak 

 Note 4: 
This is the nominal ARS antenna gain assumed in the on-axis EIRP calculations Note 5: 
This is the installed ARS antenna gain exceeded for 0.2% of the azimuth angles and elevation angles between -45º and +45º when dual top and bottom quarter-wave monopole antennas are installed.  It includes gain enhancement due to reflections from the aircraft structures. Otherwise, if directional antennas are installed, the maximum gain is assumed to be equal to the nominal gain.  The data from which these gains are derived is presented in Appendix K Note 6: 
This is the installed ARS antenna gain exceeded for 99.8% of the azimuth angles and elevation angles between -45º and +45º assuming dual top and bottom antennas are installed.  For the case of dual quarter-wave omni monopole antennas, it includes the effects of airframe blockage and reflections from the aircraft structures.  For the case of dual directional antennas, it assumes that at least one of the antennas is pointed in 
 
the direction of the GRS and is not blocked by the aircraft structures.  The data from which these gains are derived is presented in Appendix K. 

 Note 7: 
This is the off-axis ARS antenna gain assumed in the off-axis EIRP calculation when 
using a directional antennal; otherwise if the aircraft antenna is an omni quarter-wave monopole type antenna, this gain is assumed to be equal to the mean on-axis gain. Note 8: 
Et = Pt + Gt - Lt Note 9: 
Est = Et - 10 LOG10 (Rs) Note 10: 
Esp = Est + (Gtmax - Gt) +7 
 
Esp is a reference peak effective isotropic radiated power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions effective isotropic radiated power density noise floor EN (see Note 11).  The peak EIRP density includes the difference between the peak and average antenna gain. Note 11: 
EN = Esp - 65 
 
EN is the transmitter off-channel emissions effective isotropic radiated power density noise floor which are assumed to be -65 dB below the transmitter peak effective isotropic radiated power density Esp Note 12: 
Etoff = Et - (Gt - Gtsl) Note 13: 
Estoff = Est - (Gt - Gtsl) Note 14: 
Espoff = Estoff + (Gtmax - Gt) +7 Note 15: 
ENoff = Espoff - 65 Note 16: 
La = Gt - Gtmin Note 17: 
A multipath fade excess path loss of 20 dB not exceeded 99.8% of the time is assumed based on flight test data presented in Appendix K Note 18: 
Mc = (La2 + Lx2)1/2 Note 19: 
M = Ma + Mc + Mi Note 20: 
Priso = Et - Lf - M Note 21: 
This is the nominal/maximum GRS antenna gain Note 22: 
This the maximum off-axis/first sidelobe gain of the GRS antenna Note 23: 
Prmin = Pri + Gr - Lr Note 24: 
Esmin = Prmin - 10 Log10 (Rs) Note 25: 
No = Nt + Fn 
 
Note 26: 
Es/No is the minimum required signal-to-noise ratio to achieve a packet/sub-frame error rate of less than 1 out of 1000 where the noise is measured in a bandwidth equal to the modulation symbol rate. This ratio depends on the type of modulation and forward error correction code employed.  The value of 3.5 dB has been chosen to 
allow for different binary modulations (2-level) such as GMSK, GFSK, BPSK and quaternary modulations (4-levels) such as 4-CPFSK and QPSK and forward error correction coding with different amounts of redundancy ranging from rate 1/3 (nonpunctured) Recursive Convolutional Turbo (RCT) codes to higher rate (punctured) RCT codes, Low Density Parity Codes (LDPC) or concatenated Reed-Solomon Convolutional codes.  The baseline CNPC radio employs GMSK modulation and Recursive Convolutional Turbo Coding with rate 5/8.   In general binary modulations require 3 dB less Es/No than quaternary modulations when operating at the same symbol rate and with the same type of error correction code.  However, quaternary modulation uses up ½ the bandwidth as binary modulations to transmit the same amount of data. Note 27: 
The implementation loss accounts for imperfect (non-ideal) receiver implementations and accounts for losses such as use of detection bandwidths that are not matched to the modulation symbol rate, imperfect correction of the frequency offset between the GRS transmitter and ARS receiver, intersymbol interference introduced by the filters, etc. Note 28: 
Smin = Es/No + No + 10 Log10 (Rs) + IL 
 
The receiver sensitivity Smin is the minimum detectable signal level that produces less than 1 out of 1000 packet/sub-frame errors.  

 Note 29: 
Mx = Prmin - Smin 

## C Band Ground-To-Air (Uplink) Link Budgets

The following link budget table provides complimentary examples to those in the previous section and that illustrate various combinations of GRS transmitter output power, modulation symbol rate and antenna gain and ARS antenna gain that provide sufficient link margin at the maximum intended coverage range. The modulation symbol rates correspond to the three uplink data classes defined in the main body of this MOPS. The link margins are the same as those considered in the downlink link budgets. As in the downlink case, these link budgets also illustrate how the choice of GRS transmitter output power and antenna gain for each modulation symbol rate is in compliance with the uplink on-axis/off-channel EIRP emissions power density mask specification.

This is the nominal ARS antenna gain assumed in the on-axis EIRP calculations Note 20: 
This is the installed ARS antenna gain exceeded for 0.2% of the azimuth angles and elevation angles between -45º and +45º when dual top and bottom quarter-wave monopole antennas are installed.  It includes gain enhancement due to reflections from the aircraft structures. Otherwise, if directional antennas are installed, the maximum gain is assumed to be equal to the nominal gain.  The data from which these gains are derived is presented in Appendix K 
 
Note 21: 
This is the installed ARS antenna gain exceeded for 99.8% of the azimuth angles and 
elevation angles between -45º and +45º assuming dual top and bottom antennas are installed.  For the case of dual quarter-wave omni monopole antennas, it includes the effects of airframe blockage and reflections from the aircraft structures.  For the case of dual directional antennas, it assumes that at least one of the antennas is pointed in the direction of the GRS and is not blocked by the aircraft structures.  The data from which these gains are derived is presented in Appendix K. Note 22: 
This is the off-axis ARS antenna gain assumed in the off-axis EIRP calculation when using a directional antennal; otherwise if the aircraft antenna is an omni quarter-wave monopole type antenna, this gain is assumed to be equal to the mean on-axis gain. Note 23: 
Prmin = Pri + Gr - Lr Note 24: 
Esmin = Prmin - 10 Log10 (Rs) Note 25: 
No = Nt + Fn 
 
 
Note 26: 
Es/No is the minimum required signal-to-noise ratio to achieve a packet/sub-frame error rate of less than 1 out of 1000 where the noise is measured in a bandwidth equal to the modulation symbol rate. This ratio depends on the type of modulation and forward error correction code employed.  The value of 3.5 dB has been chosen to 
allow for different binary modulations (2-level) such as GMSK, GFSK, BPSK and quaternary modulations (4-levels) such as 4-CPFSK and QPSK and forward error correction coding with different amounts of redundancy ranging from rate 1/3 (nonpunctured) Recursive Convolutional Turbo (RCT) codes to higher rate (punctured) RCT codes, Low Density Parity Codes (LDPC) or concatenated Reed-Solomon Convolutional codes.  The baseline CNPC radio employs GMSK modulation and Recursive Convolutional Turbo Coding with rate 5/8. In general binary modulations require 3 dB less Es/No than quaternary modulations when operating at the same symbol rate and with the same type of error correction code.  However, quaternary modulation uses up ½ the bandwidth as binary modulations to transmit the same amount of data. Note 27: 
The implementation loss accounts for imperfect (non-ideal) receiver implementations and accounts for losses such as use of detection bandwidths that are matched to the modulation symbol rate, imperfect correction of the frequency offset between the GRS transmitter and ARS receiver, intersymbol interference introduced by the filters, etc. Note 28: 
Smin = Es/No + No + 10 LOG10 (Rs) + IL 
 
The receiver sensitivity Smin is the minimum detectable signal level that produces less than 1 out of 1000 packet/sub-frame errors. Note 29: 
Mx = Prmin - Smin 

## C Band Air-To-Ground (Downlink) Undesired-To-Desired Ratio Link Budget

The following link budget tables provide complimentary examples to those in Section L.2.1 that illustrate the calculation of the maximum downlink interference that can be tolerated from an undesired ARS that is operating on a non-adjacent channel.  Three different scenarios are illustrated below in this section. Case 1: Desired ARS at maximum range and Desired and Undesired ARSs operating with high output power This scenario is applicable when the desired ARS is operating at its maximum mission range of 35 NM and it is being controlled by a GRS that is not located near an airport where there may be multiple co-located GRSs. The maximum tolerable Undesired-to-Desired (U/D) interference ratio and Signal-to- Noise plus on-channel interference ratio calculations assume that the interfering signal from the undesired ARS is received on the sidelobe of the victim GRS receiving antenna while the desired signal is received on the mainlobe of the GRS antenna.  They also assume that the undesired ARS is located as close as allowed to the victim GRS that is controlling the desired ARS so as not to produce excessive on-channel interference (2750 feet) when the undesired ARS is transmitting with high output power.

Case 2: Desired ARS operating with high and low output power and Undesired ARS operating with low output power This scenario is applicable when the undesired ARS is operating below 3000 feet and it has reduced its output power by 20dB to low output power. 

The desired ARS is assumed to be under the control of a GRS that is not located near an airport where there may be multiple co-located GRSs.  The desired ARS is assumed to be operating at: i) its maximum mission range of 35 NM when operating with high output power ; and ii) its maximum possible mission range of 3.5 NM when operating with a low output power setting that is 20dB lower than its high output power setting. The maximum tolerable Undesired-to-Desired (U/D) interference ratio and Signal-to- Noise plus on-channel interference ratio calculations assume that the interfering signal from the undesired ARS is received on the sidelobe of the victim GRS receiving antenna while the desired signal is received on the mainlobe of the GRS antenna.  They also assume that the undesired ARS is located as close as allowed to the victim GRS that is controlling the desired ARS so as not to produce excessive on-channel interference (275 feet) when the undesired ARS is transmitting with low output power.

## Case 3: Desired Ars And Undesired Ars Operating In Airport Terminal Area

This scenario is applicable when two ARSs are landing or taking-off one behind the other under the control of two co-located GRSs.  
Undesired-to-Desired (U/D) interference ratio and Signal-to-Noise plus on-channel interference ratio are calculated assuming that the desired signal and the undesired interfering signal from the undesired ARS are both received on the mainlobe of the GRS receiving antenna. Two tables with calculations of Undesired-to-Desired (U/D) interference ratio and Signal-to-Noise plus on-channel interference ratio are shown below. In the first table, the desired ARS is assumed to be at an initial approach distance of 9.6 NM from the two col-located GRSs at an altitude of approximately 3000 feet above ground.  The desired ARS is operating with high output power at this stage in the landing procedure.  The undesired ARS is assumed to be landing ahead of the desired ARS following a 3º glide slope at various distances from the co-located GRSs ranging from 6.4 NM to 0.1 NM correspond to altitudes above ground ranging from 2,085 feet to 32 feet. The undesired ARS is assumed to be operating with high output power from the beginning of the approach until it switches to low output power 20dB less than high output power when it reaches a height above ground of about 500 feet at a distance of about 1.6 NM from the two co-located GRSs. In the second table, the undesired ARS is assumed to be at its closest distance from the two co-located GRSs (0.1 NM or 600 feet) and it has already switched to low output power at this stage in the landing procedure.  The desired ARS is assumed to be landing behind the undesired ARS following a 3º glide slope staring at an altitude above ground of 4,070 feet at a 12.8 NM distance from the co-located GRSs.  The ARS is assumed to be operating with high output power from the beginning of the approach until it switches to low output power (20 dB less than high output power) when it reaches a height above ground of about 500 feet at a distance of about 1.6 NM from the two co-located GRSs.

The following notes are applicable to all tables in this section. Note 1: 
Ppeak = Pt - 10 LOG10 (Rs) +7 
 
Ppeak is a reference transmitter output power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions power density noise floor PN measured at one modulation symbol rate Rs with a particular output power Pt and using the same reference level to calculate (not measure) the peak power density with a different transmitter output power and modulation symbol rate (see Note 3). The 7 dB difference between Ppeak and Pavg has been determined from measurements with a prototype CNPC radio that employs GMSK modulation which serves as the basis for the specification of the off-channel emissions noise floor.  Other modulation types may have different peak power densities relative to a uniform (or average) reference level. 

 Note 2:  
Et = Pt + Gt - Lt Note 3: 
Esp = Et - 10 LOG10 (Rs) +(Gtmax - Gt) +7 
 
Esp is a reference peak effective isotropic radiated power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions effective isotropic radiated power density noise floor EN (see Note 11).  The peak EIRP density includes the difference between the peak and average antenna gain. 

Note 4: 
Mg = Gtmax - Gt 
 
Note 5: 
A multipath enhancement of 6 dB exceeded 0.02% of the time is assumed based on flight test data presented in Appendix K Note 6: 
Me = (Mg2 + Mb2)1/2 Note 7: 
La = Gt - Gtmin 
 
Note 8: 
A multipath fade excess path loss of 20 dB not exceeded 99.8% of the time is assumed 
based on flight test data presented in Appendix K Note 9: 
Mc = (La2 + Lx2)1/2 Note 10: 
PISOavg = Et - Lf Note 11: 
PISOmax = PISOavg + Me Note 12: 
PISOmin = PISOavg - Mc Note 13: 
Xsl = Gr - Grsl Note 14: 
Pravg = PISOavg + Gr - Lr - Xsl Note 15: 
Prmax = PISOmax + Gr - Lr - Xsl Note 16: 
Prmin = PISOmin + Gr - Lr - Xsl 
 

 Note 17: 
Erpav = Pravg -10 LOG10 (Rs) +7 Note 18: 
Erpmax = Prmax -10 LOG10 (Rs) +7 Note 19: 
I0avg = [Erpavg]U -65 Note 20: 
I0max = [Erpmax]U -65 Note 21: 
[U/D]max = [Pravg]U - [Pravg]D + {(Pravg - Prmin)D2 + (Prmax - Pravg)U2 }1/2 Note 22: 
[[S/I]min = [Pravg]D - [Ioavg + 10 LOG10 (Rs)] + {(Pravg - Prmin)D2 + (Iomax -Ioavg)2}1/2 Note 23: 
Esmin = Prmin - 10 LOG10 (Rs) Note 24: 
No = Nt + Fn Note 25: 
SNDRreq = Es/No + IL SNDRreq is the minimum required signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio to achieve a packet/sub-frame error rate of less than 1 out of 1000. Note 26: 
Smin = Es/No + No + 10 LOG10 (Rs) + IL 
 
The receiver sensitivity Smin is the minimum detectable signal level that produces less than 1 out of 1000 packet/sub-frame errors when there is no interference present. Note 27: 
Dmin/N = Esmin - N0 Note 28:

## C Band Ground-To-Air (Uplink) Undesired-To-Desired Ratio Link Budget

The following link budget tables provide complimentary examples to those in Section L.2.2 and Section L.2.3 that illustrate the calculation of the maximum uplink interference that can be tolerated from an undesired GRS that is operating on a non-adjacent channel.  
Three different scenarios complimentary to the downlink scenarios in Section L.2.3 are illustrated below in this section. 

## Case 1: Victim Ars Operating At 2750 Feet Above Interfering Grs

This scenario is applicable when the victim ARS is operating at its maximum mission range of 35 NM and it is being controlled by a GRS that is not located near an airport where there may be multiple co-located GRSs. The victim ARS is assumed to be operating at the minimum altitude (2750 feet) where it can transmit with maximum output power (10 Watts) The maximum tolerable uplink Undesired-to-Desired (U/D) interference ratio and Signalto-Noise plus on-channel interference ratio calculations assume that the interfering signal received by the victim ARS is emitted by a sidelobe of the offending GRS transmitting antenna while the desired signal is assumed to be emitted via the mainlobe of the desired GRS antenna.

## Case 2: Victim Ars Operating At 275 Feet Above Interfering Grs

This scenario is applicable when the victim ARS is at the maximum range (3.5 NM) at which it can operate from its controlling GRS while transmitting with minimum output power (10 mW).  The minimum altitude that it can operate at this range without suffering excessive interference from the undesired GRS is calculated to be 275 feet. The maximum tolerable uplink Undesired-to-Desired (U/D) interference ratio and Signalto-Noise plus on-channel interference ratio calculations assume that the interfering signal received by the victim ARS is emitted by a sidelobe of the offending GRS transmitting antenna while the desired signal is assumed to be emitted via the mainlobe of the desired GRS antenna.

Desired Undesired

## Case 3: Victim Ars Operating In Area With Co-Located Grss

This scenario is applicable when the victim ARS is where there are multiple co-located GRSs such as airports.  
Uplink Undesired-to-Desired (U/D) interference ratio and Signal-to-Noise plus on-channel interference ratio are calculated assuming that the victim ARS is in the same azimuth bearing as the ARS that is controlled by the interfering GRS.  Therefore, the desired signal and the undesired interfering signal from the undesired GRS are both transmitted on the mainlobe of the GRS transmitting antennas.

The following notes are applicable to all tables in this section Note 1: 
Ppeak = Pt - 10 LOG10 (Rs) +7 
 
Ppeak is a reference transmitter output power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions power density noise floor PN measured at one modulation symbol rate Rs with a particular output power Pt and using the same reference level to calculate (not measure) the peak power density with a different transmitter output power and modulation symbol rate (see Note 3). The 7 dB difference between Ppeak and Pavg has been determined from measurements with a prototype CNPC radio that employs GMSK modulation which serves as the basis for the specification of the off-channel emissions noise floor.  Other modulation types may have different peak power densities relative to a uniform (or average) reference level. 

 
Note 2:  
Et = Pt + Gt - Lt Note 3: 
Esp = Et - 10 LOG10 (Rs) +(Gtmax - Gt) +7 
 
Esp is a reference peak effective isotropic radiated power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions effective isotropic radiated power density noise floor EN (see Note 11).  The peak EIRP density includes the difference between the peak and average antenna gain.

Note 1: 
Pavg = Pt - 10 LOG10 (Rs) 
 
Pavg is a reference transmitter output power density level for determining the transmitter output peak power density Ppeak measured at one modulation symbol rate Rs with a particular output power Pt and using the same reference level to calculate (not measure) the output peak power density with a different transmitter output power and modulation symbol rate (see Note 2). Pavg is a reference power density where the total output power is assumed to be uniformly distributed across a bandwidth equal to the modulation symbol rate.  One could choose to use a different bandwidth, e.g. the -40 dBc bandwidth of the modulated waveform, to determine the reference level but then the conversion factor for calculating the peak power density at different output power and modulation symbol rates would have to be adjusted accordingly.  The resulting value of the peak power density Ppeak would be the same regardless of which bandwidth is used to determine the reference level since the peak power density is a measured value at one modulation symbol rate. 

 
Note 2: 
Ppeak = Pavg +7 
 
Ppeak is a reference transmitter output power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions power density noise floor PN measured at one modulation symbol rate Rs with a particular output power Pt and using the same reference level to calculate (not measure) the peak power density with a different transmitter output power and modulation symbol rate (see Note 3). The 7 dB difference between Ppeak and Pavg has been determined from measurements with a prototype CNPC radio that employs GMSK modulation which serves as the basis for the specification of the off-channel emissions noise floor.  Other modulation types may have different peak power densities relative to a uniform (or average) reference level. 

 
Note 3: 
PN = Ppeak - 75 
PN is the transmitter off-channel emissions power density noise floor which are 
assumed to be -75 dB below the transmitter output peak power density Ppeak Note 4: 
This is the nominal ARS antenna gain assumed in the on-axis EIRP calculations Note 5: 
This is the installed ARS antenna gain exceeded for 0.2% of the azimuth angles and elevation angles between -45º and +45º when dual top and bottom quarter-wave monopole antennas are installed.  It includes gain enhancement due to reflections from the aircraft structures. The data from which these gains are derived is presented in Appendix K Note 6: 
This is the installed ARS antenna gain exceeded for 99.8% of the azimuth angles and elevation angles between -45º and +45º assuming dual top and bottom quarter-wave monopole antennas are installed.  It includes the effects of airframe blockage and reflections from the aircraft structures.  The data from which these gains are derived is presented in Appendix K. Note 7: 
Et = Pt + Gt - Lt  
 

Note 8: 
Est = Et - 10 LOG10 (Rs) Note 9: 
Esp = Est + (Gtmax - Gt) +7 
Esp is a reference peak effective isotropic radiated power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions effective isotropic radiated power density noise floor EN (see Note 11).  The peak EIRP density includes the difference between the peak and average antenna gain. Note 10: 
EN = Esp - 75 EN is the transmitter off-channel emissions effective isotropic radiated power density noise floor which are assumed to be -75 dB below the transmitter peak effective isotropic radiated power density Esp Note 11: 
La = Gt - Gtmin Note 12: 
A multipath fade excess path loss of 20 dB not exceeded 99.8% of the time is assumed based on flight test data presented in Appendix K Note 13: 
Mc = (La2 + Lx2)1/2 Note 14: 
M = Ma + Mc + Mi Note 15: 
Priso = Et - Lf - M Note 16: 
This is the nominal/maximum GRS antenna gain Note 17: 
This the maximum off-axis/first sidelobe gain of the GRS antenna Note 18: 
Prmin = Pri + Gr - Lr Note 19: 
Esmin = Prmin - 10 Log10 (Rs) Note 20: 
No = Nt + Fn Note 21: 
Es/No is the minimum required signal-to-noise ratio to achieve a packet/sub-frame error rate of less than 1 out of 1000 where the noise is measured in a bandwidth equal to the modulation symbol rate. This ratio depends on the type of modulation and forward error correction code employed.  The value of 3.5 dB has been chosen to allow for different binary modulations (2-level) such as GMSK, GFSK, BPSK and quaternary modulations (4-levels) such as 4-CPFSK and QPSK and forward error correction coding with different amounts of redundancy ranging from rate 1/3 (nonpunctured) Recursive Convolutional Turbo (RCT) codes to higher rate (punctured) RCT codes, Low Density Parity Codes (LDPC) or concatenated Reed-Solomon Convolutional codes.  The baseline CNPC radio employs GMSK modulation and Recursive Convolutional Turbo Coding with rate 5/8.  In general binary modulations require 3 dB less Es/No than quaternary modulations when operating at the same symbol rate and with the same type of error correction code.  However, quaternary modulation uses up ½ the bandwidth as binary modulations to transmit the same amount of data. 
 
Note 22: 
The implementation loss accounts for imperfect (non-ideal) receiver implementations and accounts for losses such as use of detection bandwidths that are matched to the modulation symbol rate, imperfect correction of the frequency offset between the GRS transmitter and ARS receiver, intersymbol interference introduced by the filters, etc. Note 23: 
Smin = Es/No + No + 10 Log10 (Rs) + IL The receiver sensitivity Smin is the minimum detectable signal level that produces less than 1 out of 1000 packet/sub-frame errors. Note 24: 
Mx = Prmin - Smin

Note 1: 
Pavg = Pt - 10 LOG10 (Rs) 
 
Pavg is a reference transmitter output power density level for determining the transmitter output peak power density Ppeak measured at one modulation symbol rate Rs with a particular output power Pt and using the same reference level to calculate (not measure) the output peak power density with a different transmitter output power and modulation symbol rate (see Note 2). Pavg is a reference power density where the total output power is assumed to be uniformly distributed across a bandwidth equal to the modulation symbol rate.  One could choose to use a different bandwidth, e.g. the -40 dBc bandwidth of the modulated waveform, to determine the reference level but then the conversion factor for calculating the peak power density at different output power and modulation symbol rates would have to be adjusted accordingly.  The resulting value of the peak power density Ppeak would be the same regardless of which bandwidth is used to determine the reference level since the peak power density is a measured value at one modulation symbol rate. 

 
Note 2: 
Ppeak = Pavg +7 Ppeak is a reference transmitter output power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions power density noise floor PN measured at one modulation symbol rate Rs with a particular output power Pt and using the same reference level to calculate (not measure) the peak power density with a different transmitter output power and modulation symbol rate (see Note 3). The 7 dB difference between Ppeak and Pavg has been determined from measurements with a prototype CNPC radio that employs GMSK modulation which serves as the basis for the specification of the off-channel emissions noise floor.  Other modulation types may have different peak power densities relative to a uniform (or average) reference level. 

 
Note 3: 
PN = Ppeak - 75 PN is the transmitter off-channel emissions power density noise floor which are assumed to be -75 dB below the transmitter output peak power density Ppeak Note 4: 
This is the nominal/maximum GRS antenna gain Note 5: 
This the maximum off-axis/first sidelobe gain of the GRS antenna Note 6: 
Et = Pt + Gt - Lt Note 7: 
Est = Et - 10 LOG10 (Rs) Note 8: 
Esp = Est + (Gtmax - Gt) +7 Esp is a reference peak effective isotropic radiated power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions effective isotropic radiated power density noise floor EN (see Note 11).  The peak EIRP density includes the difference between the peak and average antenna gain. 
 

Note 9: 
EN = Esp - 75 EN is the transmitter off-channel emissions effective isotropic radiated power density noise floor which are assumed to be -75 dB below the transmitter peak effective 
isotropic radiated power density Esp Note 10: 
La = Gt - Gtmin Note 11: 
A multipath fade excess path loss of 20 dB not exceeded 99.8% of the time is assumed based on flight test data presented in Appendix K Note 12: 
Mc = (La2 + Lx2)1/2 Note 13: 
M = Ma + Mc + Mi Note 14: 
Priso = Et - Lf - M Note 15: 
This is the nominal ARS antenna gain assumed in the on-axis EIRP calculations Note 16: 
This is the installed ARS antenna gain exceeded for 0.2% of the azimuth angles and elevation angles between -45º and +45º when dual top and bottom quarter-wave monopole antennas are installed.  It includes gain enhancement due to reflections from the aircraft structures. The data from which these gains are derived is presented in Appendix K Note 17: 
This is the installed ARS antenna gain exceeded for 99.8% of the azimuth angles and elevation angles between -45º and +45º assuming dual top and bottom quarter-wave monopole antennas are installed.  It includes the effects of airframe blockage and reflections from the aircraft structures.  The data from which these gains are derived is presented in Appendix K. Note 18: 
Prmin = Pri + Gr - Lr Note 19: 
Esmin = Prmin - 10 Log10 (Rs) Note 20: 
No = Nt + Fn 
 Note 21: 
Es/No is the minimum required signal-to-noise ratio to achieve a packet/sub-frame error rate of less than 1 out of 1000 where the noise is measured in a bandwidth equal to the modulation symbol rate. This ratio depends on the type of modulation and forward error correction code employed.  The value of 3.5 dB has been chosen to allow for different binary modulations (2-level) such as GMSK, GFSK, BPSK and quaternary modulations (4-levels) such as 4-CPFSK and QPSK and forward error correction coding with different amounts of redundancy ranging from rate 1/3 (nonpunctured) Recursive Convolutional Turbo (RCT) codes to higher rate (punctured) RCT codes, Low Density Parity Codes (LDPC) or concatenated Reed-Solomon Convolutional codes.  The baseline CNPC radio employs GMSK modulation and Recursive Convolutional Turbo Coding with rate 5/8.  In general binary modulations require 3 dB less Es/No than quaternary modulations when operating at the same symbol rate and with the same type of error correction code.  However, quaternary modulation uses up ½ the bandwidth as binary modulations to transmit the same amount of data. 

 
Note 22: 
The implementation loss accounts for imperfect (non-ideal) receiver implementations and accounts for losses such as use of detection bandwidths that are matched to the modulation symbol rate, imperfect correction of the frequency offset between the GRS transmitter and ARS receiver, intersymbol interference introduced by the filters, etc. Note 23: 
Smin = Es/No + No + 10 Log10 (Rs) + IL The receiver sensitivity Smin is the minimum detectable signal level that produces less than 1 out of 1000 packet/sub-frame errors. Note 24: 
Mx = Prmin - Smin

Note 1: 
Ppeak = Pt - 10 LOG10 (Rs) +7 
 
Ppeak is a reference transmitter output power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions power density noise floor PN measured at one modulation symbol rate Rs with a particular output power Pt and using the same reference level to calculate (not measure) the peak power density with a different transmitter output power and modulation symbol rate (see Note 3). The 7 dB difference between Ppeak and Pavg has been determined from measurements with a prototype CNPC radio that employs GMSK modulation which serves as the basis for the specification of the off-channel emissions noise floor.  Other modulation types may have different peak power densities relative to a uniform (or average) reference level.

Esp = Et - 10 LOG10 (Rs) +(Gtmax - Gt) +7 Esp is a reference peak effective isotropic radiated power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions effective isotropic radiated power density noise floor EN (see Note 11).  The peak EIRP density includes the difference between the peak and average antenna gain.

Ppeak = Pt - 10 LOG10 (Rs) +7 
 
Ppeak is a reference transmitter output power density level for determining the transmitter off-channel emissions power density noise floor PN measured at one modulation symbol rate Rs with a particular output power Pt and using the same reference level to calculate (not measure) the peak power density with a different transmitter output power and modulation symbol rate (see Note 3). The 7 dB difference between Ppeak and Pavg has been determined from measurements with a prototype CNPC radio that employs GMSK modulation which serves as the basis for the specification of the off-channel emissions noise floor.  Other modulation types may have different peak power densities relative to a uniform (or average) reference level.

## Appendix M Mops Baseline Cnpc Link System Baseline Cnpc Link System Requirements

This section contains requirements for a prototype baseline CNPC Link System that was built and tested as an integral component of a "proof of concept" MOPS validation baseline system.  These technical parameters are based on the same requirements written in Section 2.2.2 of this MOPS, and have been provided as a model radio specification to aid future radio manufacturers. Although one radio could be built that incorporates all the requirements, only a subset of the requirements may be necessary to meet the mission of a particular UAS.  Throughout this section, the radio's waveform, transmitter, and receiver characteristics are primarily explained based on a single UA's operation and where applicable, a notional multiple UA operation.  Single UA operation is defined as point-to-point communications using a single radio on the ground and in the aircraft and is referred to as the "Single-Aircraft" mode of operation.  Multiple UA operation, referred to as "Multi-Aircraft" mode of operation is more complex, using the Ground Radio's ability to transmit to multiple UA's in a time division format.  While this MOPS is focused primarily on the Single-Aircraft mode of operation, information on the multi-aircraft mode of operation is provided.  

## Baseline Cnpc Link System Overview

The baseline CNPC Link System uplink and downlink link transmission schemes are not the same. The uplink transmission, from the GRS to the aircraft, uses a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) approach. Information is sent from the GRS to one or multiple aircraft using time slots. The downlink transmission, from the aircraft to the GRS, uses a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) approach. Information is sent from the aircraft to the GRS over a specified frequency. Information transmitted over the uplink and downlink is categorized into Data Classes. A Data Class is an elemental structure carrying Message Data Payload and overhead information. Four data classes exist, each having a different size fixed Message Data Payload and overhead. Downlink transmission - UA to GRS - uses an FDMA scheme that assigns a single frequency to each aircraft. In a Single Aircraft mode, the UA transmits one of the four data classes on its assigned frequency to the GRS.  In the Multi-aircraft mode, multiple UA's transmit one of the four data classes on their individually assigned frequency to the GRS. Unlike the uplink transmission, a downlink transmission can only support one UA even in multimode. This means that even though multiple UAs are supported with one uplink, there always has to be an independent downlink for each UA. Uplink transmission - GRS to UA - uses a TDMA scheme that allows the GRS to transmit to one or multiple UA's.  In the Single-Aircraft mode one time slot is used to transmit one of the four data classes to the UA.  In the multi-aircraft mode the GRS transmits a combination of data classes over multiple time slots to multiple UA's. Multi-aircraft mode packs more information into a transmission frame. When using multi-slot mode, the amount of information that can be transmitted uplink depends on the number of slots that are used and the data class type used. 

## M.1.1.1 Baseline Cnpc Link System Configuration Matrix

The baseline CNPC link system has a flexible build design to support the varying requirements of an unmanned aircraft.  The matrix below is designed to allow different build specifications of a baseline CNPC link system.  The baseline CNPC link system 
 
could be built to operate on one of two different frequency bands, be built to operate as a ground or airborne radio with varying transmit output power, and be configured to transmit to one to twenty four aircraft.  The tables below list the various operational functions of the radio and points to the appropriate requirement section.   
A radio build starts with the selection of the operational frequency band followed by the selection of airborne or ground radio, and concludes with the selection of uplink, and downlink capability. Follow the steps below to build a baseline CNPC link system 

1. Select the frequency band - Table M-1 2. Select an airborne or ground radio - Table M-2 3. Select the transmitter requirements - Table M-2 4. Select the receiver requirements - Table M-2 5. Select the downlink required - Table M-3

## M.1.1.4.4 Data Segments & Parameter Summary

Data Segment refers to the concatenation of the Message, CRC, FEC and Fill Bits that are listed in the following Data Class tables.  The Message Data Payload refers to the concatenation of the Message and the CRC bits.  The size of the Message Data Payload and Data Segment depends on which Data Class is designated.  Fill bits are added to make length of the total number of symbols transmitted at the symbol rate match the 23 ms. TDD Subframe slot duration. For convenience the Data Class figures and tables have been provided below containing the parameters of the Data Classes and illustrating the subframe transmission structure. Single-Aircraft operation uses the same Data Class for both the uplink and downlink.  The following four Data Classes are used for Single-Aircraft (standalone) operation.

Data Classes for Multi-Aircraft mode uplink are the Data Classes 1, 2 & 3 that are specified in Table M-26 (Data Class Service Parameter Summary). 


| Data Class    | Number of Slots    |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Data Class 1  | 1 slot             |
| Data Class 2  | 2 slot             |
| Data Class 3  | 3 slot             |

 
The downlink will implement at least one of the 4 Data Classes defined in the Single-Aircraft mode (Section M.1.1.4.4.1). 
 
The uplink will implement at least one of the Data Classes 1, 2, and/or 3, in Table M-26 (Data Class Service Parameter Summary) 
 
All the uplink Data Classes will be implemented across the appropriate number of contiguous slots required per Table M-26 (Slots per Data Class).

## M.1.1.4.5 Midambles

Once the Data Segment is assembled, it is divided into 512 bit segments with known symbols called midambles inserted in between. A midamble is one of the 6 symbol sequences listed in Table M-30. Each sequence is 32 symbols long and is used by the receiver for the correction of Doppler Effect.  The midamble is inserted after every 512 symbols of the Data Segment, unless the remainder after the 512 symbols is less than 97 symbols.  In which case the entire data segment is sent followed by the postamble.  The midamble patterns are used sequentially starting with Pattern 0 with every new message. The following set of rules are used for inserting midambles: 

Start: Is the Data Segment > 608 symbols (512 +96)?  
Yes: 
Is this a new message to be processed? 
 
 
Yes: 
a) Insert the first midamble (pattern 0) after the first 512 symbols of the data segment.  


b) Return to Start. 



No:  
a) Insert the next midamble pattern from Table M-30, after the next 512 symbols of the remaining data segment.  


b) Return to Start. 
No:  
a) Send the remaining symbols of the data segment with the next midamble 
pattern appended to the end (aka the postamble). 
 
 
b) STOP - Insertion of midambles is complete. 
As with the preamble sequence, bit 0 is the far right LSB of this pattern.  The sequence bits of the first midamble (Pattern 0, 568752F2) are:  
0100 1111 0100 1010 1110 0001 0110 1010 
2       F       2       5       7        8       6      5 
The number of midambles for the Data Class channel types is listed in Table M-27.

## M.1.1.4.6 Postambles

As with the acquisition preamble, with all Data Class transmissions there will be a 32 symbol postamble following the last fragment of the data segment.  The postamble pattern can be found in the list of midambles in Table M-28 and will be the next pattern after the last used midamble pattern in the sequence as described in the Midambles section above. 

## M.1.1.4.7 Ramp Down

The number of ramp down symbols used per data class is described below. 

## M.1.1.4.7.1 Data Class 1 Or Data Class 3 Transmission

Following the postamble, there are four and a half symbols containing no information for ramp down of the power amplifier (PA). A four and a half symbol ramp down period is also be required following the postamble, at the end of each uplink transmission slot that concludes a new Data Class 1 or Data Class 3 channel.  The extra 1/2 symbol delay is added where appropriate to minimize the number of fill bits needed to achieve an integer value of symbols per second within the 23 ms. subframe. 

## M.1.1.4.7.2 Data Class 2 Or Data Class 4 Transmission

Following the postamble, there are four symbols containing no information for ramp down of the power amplifier (PA).  A four-symbol ramp down period is also be required following the postamble, at the end of each uplink transmission slot that concludes a new Data Class 2 or Data Class 4 channel.   

## M.1.1.4.8 Crc Error Detection

A 32-bit CRC is calculated for each message to be transmitted and is appended, in order of most significant bit (MSB) to least significant bit (LSB), to the end of the message prior to encoding of the message bits. The CRC is recalculated for received messages (excluding the last 32 bits of the appended CRC) and compared to the appended CRC to ensure the integrity of the data was maintained during the transmission of the message. All messages that fail the CRC check are discarded internal to the CNPC Link System and are not be forwarded outside of the CNPC Link System. The CRC generator polynomial used is: x32 + x26 + x23 + x22 + x16 + x12 + x11 + x10 + x8 + x7 + x5 + x4 + x2 + x + 1. The CRC register is initialized to all ones for each message. The message is treated as a single sequence of binary digits: MSB of the first byte to LSB of the first byte followed by MSB of the second byte to the LSB of the second byte and so on. 

## M.1.1.4.9 Forward Error Correction (Fec)

Turbo coding is used exclusively for all FEC.  A code rate of approximately 0.62 is used with different block sizes for the various Data Classes.  Each of the turbo codes utilizes a Rate 1/3-turbo code at its core with puncturing to achieve the desired turbo code rate.  The Rate 1/3 core and puncturing method are described in the following sections. 

## M.1.1.4.9.1 Rate 1/3 Turbo Encoder

All data segment bits are encoded using the Rate 1/3 Turbo Encoder defined in this section. The Turbo Encoder uses the Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Code (PCCC) architecture shown in Figure M-8. The upper and lower constituent encoders are functionally equivalent to the circuit shown in the figure. Each constituent encoder contains three shift registers for a total memory depth of 3 (m=3). Message bits enter the upper encoder in their original order. The lower encoder is fed with randomized message bits from the output of the S-random Interleaver. Each message block is Turbo encoded using the following two phases which are processed sequentially. 

 
Message Bit Phase - Message bits (Xn) enter the Turbo encoder. The Turbo 
encoder produces three output bits per each input message bit: (Xn) the original Message Bit, (Zn) the Upper Encoder Parity Bit, (Z'n) the Lower Encoder Parity Bit. The output bits are clocked out in the following order, (Xn, Zn, Z'n). 
 
Trellis Termination Phase - Once the last message bit has been clocked into the 
constituent encoder inputs, the Message/Tail Control switches are placed in the lower position in preparation for output of the termination bits. All four encoder outputs are saved over three clock cycles creating a total of twelve termination bits.  
Note: The subscript is the number of clock cycles since the first message bit X0. 

Message Bit Phase: All shift registers are initialized to all-zeros prior to clocking in of the first Message bit. When Message bits are clocked into the constituent encoders, the Message/Tail Control switches are placed in the upper position allowing one message bit to enter the constituent encoder for each clock cycle. Each input Message bit (X) is passed through the upper constituent encoder to the (X) output unchanged (a systematic code). The parity bits from the upper encoder (Z) and lower encoder (Z') are appended to the output message bit (X) and output in the following order (Xn, Zn, Z'n). During the Message Bit Phase, the Message and Parity bits exit the encoder in the following order 

$$\mathbf{X}_{0},\mathbf{Z}_{0},\mathbf{Z}^{\prime}{}_{0},\mathbf{X}_{1},\mathbf{Z}_{1},\mathbf{Z}^{\prime}{}_{1},\mathbf{X}_{2},\mathbf{Z}_{2},\mathbf{Z}^{\prime}{}_{2},...,\mathbf{X}_{k},\mathbf{Z}_{k},\mathbf{Z}^{\prime}{}_{k}$$
 

Note:  The interleaved Message bits (X') from the output of the S-Random Interleaver 
are not used in the Message Bit Phase since they are equivalent to the original message bit sequence and do not contain any additional (new) information. Interleaved Message bits (X') may easily be recreated from the Message Bits. 
Trellis Termination Phase: After the last Message Bit has been clocked into the encoder, the Message/Tail Control switches are moved to the lower position in preparation for creating the trellis termination bits. There are four encoder outputs (X, A, X', and A') and three internal shift registers (m=3). Three clock cycles are needed to output the final encoder state and return the initial state of the encoders to all-zeros. The final state of the encoder is fully described by 4 x 3 = 12- termination bits. The twelve termination bits are identified in the table below. 'k' is the number of message bits, and the subscript is the number of clock cycles since the first message bit X0.

Termination Clock Cycle 3 
Xk+2 
Zk+2 
X'k+2 
Z'k+2 

 
 
During the Trellis Termination Phase, the termination bits exit the encoder in the following order 

${\rm X_{k}}$, ${\rm Z_{k}}$, ${\rm X_{k+1}}$, ${\rm Z_{k+1}}$, ${\rm X_{k+2}}$, ${\rm Z_{k+2}}$, ${\rm X^{\prime}}_{\rm k}$, ${\rm Z^{\prime}}_{\rm k}$, ${\rm X^{\prime}}_{\rm k+1}$, ${\rm Z^{\prime}}_{\rm k+1}$, ${\rm X^{\prime}}_{\rm k+2}$, ${\rm Z^{\prime}}_{\rm k+2}$
 
Note: In the Message Bit phase each clock cycle produces three output bits. During Trellis Termination phase each clock cycle produces four termination bits.  

 

## S-Random Interleaver

The S-random Interleaver de-correlates the inputs of the upper and lower constituent encoders. The interleaver is designed to reduce the probability a particular weight-2 data sequence will be permuted by the interleaver into another weight-2 data sequence of the same form (avoid short cycle events). Interleaver tables for each of the four data classes are provided below. '1' based indexing is employed. The first entry in each table is the index of the input bit that is the first output from the interleaver. For example, the Data Class 1 Table has an entry of 74 in the first 
 
position. So the 74th bit that enters the interleaver, will be the first bit that is output from the interleaver. The tables are read from left to right, so the second bit that is output for Data Class 1 is the 112th input bit.

## M.1.1.4.9.2 Multi Rate Turbo Encoder

 To increase the effective data rate, data puncturing (the selective omission of bits) is performed on the output of the Turbo encoder to increase the effective code rate with framing bits to approximately R=0.62 with minimal loss of code performance. All four Data Classes use the same 30-bit puncture pattern defined below. This puncture pattern is repeated until the last Turbo encoded output bit has been processed. The puncture pattern is continued (applied) over the twelve trellis termination bits. Puncturing is not performed over the fill bits. Fill bits are simply appended at the end of the punctured Turbo encoder output. 

Note: Only the parity bits (Z and Z') and Tail bits may be punctured (deleted). The message bits (M) are never punctured (a systematic code). (Termination bits do not contain Message Bits. Termination bits contain Tail Bits and parity bits. All termination bits may be punctured.)  
The 30-bit puncture pattern is: 6454564645 (octal), or 110 100 101 100 101 110 100 110 100 101 (binary). The left-most bit is applied to the first bit in the Turbo encoder output block. This puncture pattern is repeated over the full Turbo encoder output which includes the trellis termination bits.  
Note: Puncturing is not applied to fill bits which are appended to the end.

## Figure M-12: Data Class 4 - Turbo Encoding And Puncturing Interleaving

The encoded output data from the FEC is written directly to an interleaver matrix, which is designed to disperse bursts errors that occur during transmission as evenly as possible throughout the message to give the decoder the best chance of correcting errors in the data once received.  The FEC output data are written row-wise directly to the interleaver matrix as a single stream of 1-bit symbols starting at the first row (Row 0) and first column (Column 0).  The interleaver output data are then read out column-wise starting at the first column and first row. The size of the data in the interleaver matrix varies based on the Data Class.  Table M-34 (Interleaver Parameters) lists the total number of bits in the interleaver along with the corresponding rows and columns for each available message type.  The column titled 
"Shortened Columns" is the number of columns that contain one fewer row entries than the value indicated by column title "Interleaver Rows".  This allows all Data Classes to use the same number of interleaver columns with the last row not completely filled. Figure M-34 (Interleaver Matrix) depicts an example of an interleaver matrix.

## Pseudorandom Overlay

A Pseudorandom (PN) Overlay of the interleaved data bits are applied to optimize modulation and demodulation performance by randomizing the appearance of the transmitted data for both uplinks and downlinks.  The overlay bits are combined with the interleaved data bits using an Exclusive OR (XOR) process prior to modulation and the original interleaved data are recovered after receiver demodulation using the same PN Overlay and XOR process.  The PN Overlay is generated with a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) shown in Figure M-14, with a Reset State of 0001001101110010.  The PN Overlay is a fixed deterministic sequence defined by the polynomial: x16 + x14 + x13 + x11 + 1.

## Appendix N Bench Test Data For The Mops Baseline Cnpc Link System Introduction

Appendix N contains the results of the verification testing conducted on the Airborne and Ground Radios of the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System. Verification of a radio's capabilities and operation requires developed test procedures, essential test equipment and in many cases a unique test set that has "hooks" into selected critical test point within the radio system. Test procedures were created in Section 2.4.3 for the radios and most of the test equipment required to verify the procedures was available. But since the radios were a prototype no test set was available to measure the internal test points. Thus the measurements in Table N-1 were chosen based on the availability of test equipment and the radio's data and RF inputs and outputs.

## Rf Output Power

This test procedure verifies the transmit output power measured at the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System antenna interface port. This test procedure is valid for both L Band and C Band, airborne and ground radios. The test procedure configures the radio to transmit messages for a minimum duration of 10 seconds. Measurement of the transmit output power is achieved using a power meter that will measure the average power over the full transmit cycle. Additionally, the radio's transmit duty cycle must be accounted for when calculating a final measurement number. The radio's transmit duty cycle is 23 ms. ON and 27 ms. OFF in a 50 ms. window. This equates to a 46% duty cycle. 

## N.2.1 Procedure/Setup

The test procedure and equipment configuration for the RF Output Power can be found in Section 2.4.3.2.1.1.1. This test used a 50 Watt, 40 dB attenuator to reduce the power input to the Rohde & Schwarz power sensor. Power measurement calculations included total path loss from the RF antenna output connector on the transmitter to the power meter. Data Class 4 was used for all testing. 

## Results And Comments

Both high and low power setting results for each band were captured as shown in Figures N-1 through N-4 below. The Level Offsets used account for the cable and attenuator losses at the frequencies tested. Additionally, the Level Offsets were verified using a ZN- Z151 Rohde & Schwarz network analyzer. 

## L Band Comments

A 32 mW transmitter output in L Band was not obtainable using the controls available on the CNPC radio. Since the 32 mW requisite is a recent requirement a modification to the radios transmit power output could be made to achieve the required power output. A measurement of the transmitter's high power capability was also measured and shown in Figure N-2. 

## C Band Comments

The CNPC radio transmitter in the low power mode yielded 33.2 mW and the high power mode yielded 29.8 Watts. Thus, using the user interface transmit output power controls available in the CNPC radio, 1 Watt and 10 Watts can be achieved.

## Figure N-4: C Band High Pulse Power Result N.3 Signal Modulation Including: Modulation Precoding, Modulation Rate, And Modulation Distortion

This test procedure verifies the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System uses a Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) modulation waveform. This test procedure is valid for both L Band and C Band, airborne and ground radios. This procedure also verifies the modulation precoding, rate, and distortion. A Vector Signal Analyzer (VSA) demodulates the waveform, recovers the channel symbols, and searches for a sync pattern.  The channel symbols are re-modulated within the VSA using a reference GMSK waveform created within the VSA and compared against the input signal to measure vector distortion.  

## Procedure/Setup

The test procedure and equipment configuration for the Signal Modulation tests can be found in Section 2.4.3.2.1.1.6. 

## L Band Data Class 3 Setup:

The pulse output power was measured at 16.44 dBm (44.3 mW).  This was the lowest power setting available.  The total path loss between the RF output port and the input of the Spectrum analyzer, measured by the ZN-Z151 Rohde & Schwarz network analyzer, was 31.32 dB.  The Spectrum Analyzer input signal level was -14.88 dBm. 

## L Band Data Class 4 Setup:

The pulse output power was measured at 16.46 dBm (44.3 mW).  This was the lowest power setting available.  The total path loss between the RF output port and the input of the Spectrum analyzer, measured by the ZN-Z151 Rohde & Schwarz network analyzer, was 31.32 dB.  The Spectrum Analyzer input signal level was -14.86 dBm. 

## Results And Comments

The GMSK modulation waveform as defined in Section 2.2.2.1.1.6 was verified to have a modulation index of .5 and a BT of .2.  The constellation diagrams (Figure N-15 and N- 19) had a constant envelope with well-defined constellation points.  The sync pattern (precoded acquisition bits Figures N-17 and N-21) was found in the symbol table for all sub frames.  Data Class 3 symbol rate was verified to be 103.5 ks/s (Figure N-8). Data Class 4 symbol rate was verified to be 138 ks/s (Figure N-13).

## N.4 L Band And C Band Transmitter Power Spectral Density (Psd)

This test procedure verifies the transmitter mask to ensure the transmitter's spectral output power will not impact adjacent channels.  The procedure is comprehensive in that it applies to both L and C Bands in airborne and ground configurations.  The lowest attainable transmit power (43mW) was used for L Band for Data Class 3 and Data Class 4. 1W and 10W were used in the C Band cases to closer emulate the mask requirements. These measurements only represent PSDs at the output of the transmitter, since line losses or antenna gains are not considered in bench test measurements. 

## Procedure/Setup

The test procedure and equipment configuration for the Transmitter Mask tests can be found in Section 2.4.3.1.6.2.1.1.  The Spectrum Analyzer settings are shown in Figures N- 23 - N-28.  The Ref Offsets are the line losses measured in sweep testing of the frequencies under test verified using a ZN-Z151 Rohde & Schwarz network analyzer.  The span was set to 5 times the channel width to better understand the run-out in each case. The message generator was set to continuously send packets in accordance with the modulation provisions for Modes C and D for 5 minutes at the transmit power levels in the paragraph above and shown in the traces in Figures N-23 - N-28. 

## Results And Comments

The Spectrum Analyzer images in Figures N-23 - N-28 represent the Power Spectral Density (PSD) at the output of the transmitter under the conditions of the frequency, modulation and test parameters.   

## Receiver Sensitivity

This test procedure verifies that the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System receiver demonstrates the ability to successfully receive and process modulated data from a high quality signal source at or below the levels specified by the manufacturer for the 
 
implemented data class under test.  To compensate for the additional noise in an airborne environment, the CNPC Link System radio manufacturer reduced the receiver sensitivity by 1dB (included in Table 2-7) in all cases.  This was not done in our test configuration or reflected in the results.  

## Procedure/Setup

The test procedure and equipment configuration for the Receiver Sensitivity tests can be found in Section 2.4.3.2.1.2.1.  The test configuration consisted of a calibrated and verified cable network between an Agilent Technologies, E8267D Vector Signal Generator (VSG) and the radio receiver.  The VSG was configured to generate the proper modulation scheme for the data class being tested for a period of time commensurate with the transmission of 10,000 messages.  There must be 10 or fewer lost messages during the test period.  If the radio receiver either passed or failed this test, the decision was made to determine the *actual* sensitivity of the radio.  Normally, whether the radio passes or fails the test, no further interrogation would be necessary. 

## Results And Comments

The tables below contain the maximum (not to exceed) receiver sensitivity specifications for L Band and C Band in both airborne and ground configurations.  The 4th columns contain the measured (actual) receiver sensitivity results gathered using iterative methods (varying levels for each run).

## Appendix O Flight Test Data For The Mops Baseline Cnpc Link System Introduction

This Appendix presents data recorded during flight tests of the Airborne and Ground Radios of the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System.  Data collected during the campaign has been used to validate the technical requirements in Section 2.2.2 of this MOPS, and serves as the basis for the analysis in Appendix K, Section K.4.4.1.6.2. The validation flight tests were conducted during the period from February to April, 2016 in the airspace above Ohio, USA.  This Appendix includes a compilation of data from the validation flight tests at various altitudes and ranges, in both hilly, urban, and over-water terrain settings. 

## General Description Of Measurement System

A diagram of the validation test system is presented in Figure O-1.  The primary elements of the system are the test aircraft and ground equipment (as described in Section O.2.2), both of which are monitored and controlled by a centralized test operations center at NASA Glenn Research Center.  One pair of MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System radios (one L Band and one C Band) was installed in both the test aircraft and at the ground sites to establish bi-directional radio connectivity, allowing researchers to simultaneously monitor both air-to-ground and ground-to-air signal propagation characteristics in both frequency bands. In order to capture data in specific terrain settings, a Ground Radio and specific (non- GRS) flight test antenna was placed in one of three unique geographic locations and the aircraft flight pattern shifted accordingly to that location.  For flight tests over hilly terrain, GS2 installed at the Ohio University Gordon K. Bush Airport in Albany, Ohio (airport designation: KUNI) was used.  For flight tests over urban environments and capturing airfield departure/climbout, GS1 at the GRC Lewis Field campus in Cleveland, Ohio was used.  For the over-water tests, a mobile equipment trailer with extendable antenna mast (designated GS3) was temporarily positioned at the extreme western edge of Lake Erie in Sandusky, Ohio.  Each GS was equipped with an Internet connection for remote control, monitoring, programming, and test operations.  A commercial, satellite-based communications link was used to coordinate test operations between the GRC test operations center and the test aircraft. 

## Description Of Airborne Platform Used In Validation Testing

A Lockheed model S–3B Viking aircraft owned by National Aeronautics and Space Administration Glenn Research Center (FAA aircraft registration number N601NA) was used for all of the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System flight tests.  The twin-turbofan jet research aircraft had been used extensively for the channel sounding measurements detailed in Appendix Q, and for numerous developmental CNPC Link System flight tests. The S-3B aircraft possessed multiple features supporting the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System flight validation testing:  

1) A high-mounted cantilever wing provided an unobstructed RLOS path between 
airborne and ground test antennas during level flight and light banking. Wingspan: 68 ft., 8 inches,  
2) A long-range flight (endurance) capability with typical flight periods of 2-4 hours 
duration, 
3) A large, pressurized cabin that can accommodate a crew of four persons, which 
includes a pilot, co-pilot, and (2) research personnel, 
4) Equipped with a commercial satellite communications link for experiment 
coordination with flight test personnel, 
5) In-cabin equipment racks, ample research electrical power, and global positioning 
system test support accommodations were available, 
6) Excellent flight stability and maneuverability; standard rate turns at 20° to 30° 
aircraft banking, maximum 60° bank turns, sustained 10° bank (slip) possible. 
7) Maximum airspeed (true): 360 kn (414 mph, 185 ms.) at 29 kft (8,839 m) 8) Cruise speed: 250 kn (287 mph, 128 ms.) 9) Minimum airspeed: 120 kn (138 mph, 61 ms.) 10) Range: over 1,000 nm 11) Service ceiling: 29,000 ft. (8,839 m)  
The airborne research equipment consisted of one (1) L Band and one (1) C Band MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System Airborne Radio, electrical power supply hardware, Global Positioning System (GPS) and time server equipment, computers, and networking equipment.  These components were mounted in two 19-inch wide equipment racks within the pressurized volume in the rear of the aircraft. Flight-qualified, low-profile, omnidirectional, ¼ -wave monopole antennas were permanently mounted on the underside of the S-3B aircraft.  One antenna serves the L Band transmit/receive function and one antenna serves the C Band transmit/receive function.  Antennas were connected to the radios by customized, aircraft-grade, fullyshielded coaxial cables with low insertion loss, allowing each radio system to be operated without the need for additional signal amplification.  When landing gear is stowed for level flight, both antenna's field-of-view (in the "downward" or nadir direction) is a full hemisphere that is unobstructed by protuberances from the aircraft.  Figure O-2 shows the locations of the CNPC antennas and underside geometry of the S-3B test aircraft.  The antennas are positioned slightly right of the aircraft centerline to reduce coupling to adjacent aircraft antennas.  Aircraft antennas are shown in Figure O-3.

 

## Description Of Ground Equipment Used In Validation Testing

The ground equipment used in the validation testing was prepared and operated by NASA Glenn Research Center.   Each ground site connects to the Internet through either a hardwired host-site network or a 3G/4G cellular network, allowing full control and monitoring from the NASA Glenn test operations center.  A firewall/gateway is responsible for managing the networks provided by the 3G/4G connection and host network at the installation site.  In situations where both exist, the gateway will utilize the cellular network as a backup.  Should the host network experience an outage or other disruption, the gateway will automatically switch to the cellular connection.  The cellular modem is selected to provide data access using one of several cellular service providers, depending on service available at the specific ground site location. An uninterruptable power supply (UPS) delivers 120-volt power to three load circuits, two of which are remotely controllable.  The Load 1 circuit feeds the power supply for the radios and radiation safety indicator.  The Load 2 circuit is connected to the Ethernet switch and the computer, which allows for power cycling (yielding a reboot of the computer) if necessary.  The Load 3 circuit, which is not switchable, provides continuous power to the cellular modem and the firewall.  In the event of a prime power (mains) loss at the ground installation site, the 1350 Watt UPS has battery capacity to provide back-up power to the ground equipment for approximately thirty (30) minutes.  During this time, operators would secure all test data and perform a controlled shut-down of the network and computer.  Figure O-4 illustrates the internal connections and interfaces for the ground equipment. 

 
A Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) antenna feeds the GPS signal to the ground radio, which is used as a time server for the computer and cellular modem.  This allows the ground equipment  to be time-synchronized, as well as synchronized with the aircraft, other ground sites and test equipment at the various test locations.  This synchronization is necessary for measuring data flow latency throughout the network. The computer has an Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) that permits remote monitoring and control of the computer without the use of the operating system.  In the event of a computer failure, the  ground equipment can be powered down, rebooted, and have errors logged via IPMI. Figure O-5 shows the ground equipment in the transport case at a typical installation site. All antenna, power, and network cabling exiting the case to external locations is visible at the lower right.  Figure O-6 shows the L Band and C Band antennas installed at the Ohio University Airport in Athens, Ohio, as configured for the validation flight tests. 

## O.2.2.1 Ground Site Locations

Ground site selection for the validation testing was influenced by many factors, but was primarily driven by local terrain features and the ability to establish the point-to-point CNPC Link System connection between the airborne radio and the ground radio in that particular terrestrial setting.  Unique propagation and dispersive signal propagation conditions were expected in each location. Frequency Authorizations were obtained for the NASA flight test operations in multiple areas across the contiguous United States.  Validation testing occurred in two of those flight zones, indicated by the 190 km radius circles shown in Figure O-8.   Ground sites GS1 and GS2 were at the center of the flight zones.  Ground site GS3 was a mobile terminal that also operated within the authorized CLE flight zone.  Table O-1 lists location details for the ground sites used in the validation testing.

## O.2.2.2 Cnpc Link System Transmission Spectrum

The MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System radios operated using GMSK modulation to produce an output signal spectra similar to that shown in Figure O-13.  The trace shown is for a C Band radio, shown operating at the 5060 MHz center frequency.  L Band radio output is similar.  The ordinate axis is for scale only.

## Validation Test Flight Path General Description

The flight path for each validation test was tailored to account for the terrain setting, weather conditions, Frequency Authorization restrictions, and limitations imposed by FAA and local air traffic control authorities.  For each test flight, the NASA research aircraft was piloted between pairs of preselected waypoints at fixed range from the ground station. Aircraft altitude, attitude, and airspeed were held constant between waypoints to create a one-way flight "segment" of nominally 3.5 minute duration.  After completing a flight segment, the aircraft reversed direction and travelled the same flight path between waypoints, but in the opposite direction. This technique intended to determine the impact of asymmetrical installation of the antenna on the aircraft.  During these flight segments, the aircraft travelled transverse to the direction of radio frequency radiation from the ground station, thereby presenting the port and starboard sides of the aircraft to the ground station antenna. The test aircraft flew the path between each pair of waypoints not only in two directions, but also at multiple altitudes to capture the effects of terrain obstruction, multipath reflections, and signal dispersion. Flight segments were also flown at 35, 65, and 100 NM range from the ground station to achieve various elevation angles from the ground station.

## Validation Flight Test Data Format Description

MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System radio performance data from the validation test campaign is presented in following sub-sections.  Sub-section O.3.2 presents data collected over hilly terrain on February 19, 2016.  Sub-section O.3.3 presents data collected over open fresh water on March 1 and 3, 2016.  Sub-section O.3.4 presents data collected during controlled airport departure and standard ascent/climb-out on March 7, 2016. Each flight segment highlighted in a flight track plot corresponds directly to data plots for both ground-to-air and air-to-ground radio links.  Separate data plots are presented for each direction of aircraft travel between the waypoints, for each test altitude, and for 35, 65, and 100 NM range from the ground station. Signal strength values were measured at the radio receivers, and are plotted along the vertical axis for both the ground-to-air "uplink" and air-to-ground "downlink" path. The signal strength data are measured on each data frame at a rate of 20 times per second, then plotted as an average value every one second to time-correlate with aircraft flight 
 
parameters.  All signal strength traces are for the point-to-point, 90-kHz wide data channel at the 103500 symbol rate. Directly below the signal strength traces are the percentages of data frame loss averaged over one second at the ground and aircraft receivers.  Where the CNPC Link System was transferring all data without error, the data is presented as 0-percent loss and no trace is visible on the grid.  Where errors occurred, the lost frame data created a visible vertical line ranging from 0 to 100 percent, where the latter represents a total loss of the link. Aircraft parameters are plotted in the lowest portion of each figure.  The range plot is the slant range between the ground station and aircraft, calculated by the radios from arrival time of message preamble. Aircraft altitude and roll angle are drawn from aircraft onboard instrumentation.  All data in all traces is time-synchronized with GPS-based timing information.

Figure O-14 presents the flight track of the NASA aircraft over hilly terrain in southern Ohio.  The light blue trace is the complete flight path of the aircraft, including all reversals, ascent/descent maneuvers, and range changes.  Figure O-15 is the same flight track viewed from a low-altitude perspective to show the flight path at various test altitudes. Waypoints are identified with alphabet characters A-E.  The flight segments between waypoints are highlighted in yellow, which precisely represent the locations where RF data was captured for evaluation. C Band validation flight test data over hilly terrain is presented in Figure O-16 through Figure O-36.  Corresponding L Band flight test data is presented in Figure O-37 through Figure O-57. 

## Validation Flight Test Data For Fresh Water Setting, March 1, 2016 And March 3, 2016

Figure O-58 presents the flight track of the NASA aircraft over open, fresh water above Lake Erie along the Ohio coastline and immediately south of the U.S. border.  The orange trace is the complete flight path of the aircraft, including all reversals, ascent/descent maneuvers, and range changes.  Figure O-59 is the same flight track viewed from a lowaltitude perspective to show the flight path at various test altitudes. Waypoints are identified with alphabet characters A-E.  The flight segments between waypoints are highlighted in yellow, which precisely represent the locations where RF data was captured for evaluation. C Band validation flight test data over fresh water is presented in Figure O-60 through Figure O-78.  Corresponding L Band flight test data are presented in Figures O-79 through O-96.

Figure O-97 presents the flight track of the NASA aircraft over northwest Ohio during two ATC-directed standard departures from Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and ascent/climbout to Class A airspace.  The orange trace is the complete flight path of the aircraft, including reversals and airport approach maneuvers.  The two outbound flight segments are highlighted in yellow, which precisely represent the locations where RF data was captured for evaluation. C Band validation flight test data during airfield departure is presented in Figure O-98 and Figure O-99.  Corresponding L Band flight test data are presented in Figure O-100 and Figure O-101. 

## Flight Test Data For Reduced-Power Flight Range Demonstration, April 28, 2016

To demonstrate the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System range at reduced transmitter power level, a separate flight test was performed.  To execute the test, the output RF power level from both airborne and ground station L Band radios were each reduced to deliver only 10mW of RF power at the antenna inputs.  Transmit power reduction was achieved through a combination of radio power control adjustments, exploiting cable losses, and supplemental in-line attenuation. The aircraft was flown on outbound and inbound headings, then through a serpentine pattern, all over the same hilly terrain used in the validation testing.  The aircraft altitude was held at approximately 11,600 feet for all tests.  The complete flight path for the 10 mW demonstration test is shown in Figure O- 102.  Data capture segments are highlighted in yellow in Figure O-103.  No C Band data were collected during this test flight. Flight test data for the L Band, 10 mW, demonstration flight over hilly terrain is presented in Figure O-104 through Figure O-113. 


## Appendix P Determining Minimum Standoff Distances For Prevention Of Cnpc- To-Tacan Interference

This appendix discusses a measurement-based approach for determining minimum standoff distances of the kind that were theoretically calculated in Appendix H.  The objective is to ascertain, on the basis of bench tests, the standoff distance (slant range) that must be maintained between a TACAN receiver and a CNPC Link System transmitter operating at the same frequency and within radio line-of-sight, as a function of the CNPC Link System transmitter's EIRP. Received CNPC interference power in a TACAN operational environment may be quantified as follows: Pr = Pe - Lfs + Gr - Lc + F + M, where Pr is received CNPC power (dBm) at TACAN input Pe is CNPC EIRP (dBm) Lfs is free-space loss (dB) = 20 log f + 20 log D + 37.8 f is CNPC frequency in MHz (assume 1060 MHz) D is CNPC-to-TACAN slant range (NM) = √(Dh2 + (A/6076.1)2 Dh is CNPC-to-TACAN great-circle distance (NM) A is altitude difference (feet) between CNPC and TACAN Gr is TACAN receiving-antenna gain (5.4 dBi) Lc is allowance for cable loss (2.5 dB suggested) F is multiple-equipment factor (6 dB) to allow for additive effects of possible multiple interferers M is aeronautical safety margin (6 dB suggested). Figure P-1 depicts a test setup for ascertaining CNPC-to-TACAN cochannel standoff requirements. 

 
 
In the laboratory, any desired combination of Pe, Dh, and A can be modeled by adjusting the value (Lv) of the variable attenuator. During bench testing, Pr = Pt - Lv where Pr is received CNPC power (dBm) at TACAN input Pt is CNPC transmitter output power (dBm) Lv is variable-attenuator setting (dB). Let Prp be the *maximum* value of received CNPC power (Pt - Lv) at which the TACAN receiver performs satisfactorily during the bench tests. For each postulated CNPC EIRP value of interest, one needs to determine the *minimum* CNPC-to- TACAN slant range (Dp) at which the TACAN receiver would perform satisfactorily in an operational situation.  So, solve the following for Dp: Pe - 20 log 1060 - 20 log Dp - 37.8 + 5.4 - 2.5 + 6 + 6 = Prp = Pt - Lv Dp = 6.76x10–5 antilog ((Pe - (Pt - Lv)) / 20). Once Dp is known for a single value of Pe, other values can be plotted linearly. 

## Appendix Q Summary Of Nasa Air-Ground Channel Measurements And Models

In this appendix, the air-ground (AG) channel measurement and modeling campaign undertaken by NASA Glenn Research Center, as part of their Unmanned Aircraft Systems 
(UAS) in the National Airspace System (NAS) project, is described. The purpose of this project was to gather measured data for multiple channel characteristics, in a variety of ground site (GS) environments, to enable empirical modeling of the AG channel. Since this (>3 year) project involved a large number of people and gathered an enormous amount of data, this appendix cannot provide exhaustive detail on all aspects of the measurements and models. The aim here is to present a *summary* of the main project results. References are cited throughout, and most results are available in a sequence of NASA reports [1]-[8].  A final NASA report is also forthcoming, and several journal papers are also still in review. The measurement results and models should be used for flight ranges and frequency bands within those employed in the flight tests. Similar comments pertain to aircraft and GS altitudes, flight maneuvers, signal bandwidths and corresponding delay resolutions, aircraft antenna locations (e.g., mounted on aircraft bottom), and antenna characteristics. Results that are dependent upon aircraft type (e.g., airframe shadowing) are also only applicable to aircraft of similar type (size, shape, material construction, etc.). The models need to be augmented if the propagation environments include atypical conditions, such as the presence of hydrometeors or ducting (see [6]), or distinct earth surface conditions (e.g., ice). Obstructions by terrain and large buildings are not incorporated into the AG channel models (these effects can also be estimated by established techniques, e.g., [9]). Cochannel interference is also not included. Extrapolation of results is possible in some instances, as noted in the next section regarding frequency ranges, but this should be done with care; the most reliable extrapolations are those that are based upon established principles (e.g., free-space or two-ray attenuations). As additional examples, extending the models to higher—but generally not lower—aircraft altitudes is also possible and narrower bandwidth models can be derived from the wideband models. Also worth noting is that for AG (and satellite and some terrestrial) channels, propagation path loss can usually be computed using established methods, so although propagation path loss data was gathered, and from this data models were developed, the focus of the measurement/modeling here was on other AG characteristics that are not so well known: small scale fading characteristics and stationarity distances, inter-antenna and inter-band correlations, airframe shadowing, and multipath components that enable generation of dynamic wideband models. The remainder of this appendix is organized as follows: in Section Q.1, a description is provided for the measurement equipment, measurement sites, and general characteristics of the flight tests; Section Q.2 provides a brief discussion on the specific AG channel characteristics of interest for communications applications. In Section Q.3 some example measured AG channel characteristics are provided, to illustrate key features of the channels, and to help introduce the AG channel models, which are discussed in Section Q.4. This is followed by a short summary in Section Q.5. A list of key references is provided as Section Q.6. Auxiliary tables of flight test parameters (range, altitude, number of channel responses measured, etc.) are provided following the references. 

## Q.1 Description Of Measurement Equipment, Measurement Sites, And Flight Tests

There are multiple ways to measure any channel, but in all methods, a known test signal is transmitted, and reception of this test signal, followed by post-processing of the measured received data, enables estimation of the channel's characteristics. For UAS, transmission takes place through the lower troposphere, which is very well approximated as a linear medium, hence complete characterization of the AG channel can be obtained via the channel impulse response (CIR), or its frequency domain equivalent, the channel transfer function (CTF) [9]. Although obstacles in the AG channel induce violation of the following properties, the troposphere itself is—for our frequency bands of interest—well modeled as being isotropic, homogeneous, *lossless*, and *non-dispersive* [10]. A brief review of so-called anomalous propagation conditions, in which these properties (particularly the lossless property) can be violated, appears in [6], with additional references to the literature on this topic. Note that anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the troposphere are accounted for in the developed curved-earth path loss models via an estimated atmospheric refractivity profile. Channel measurements can, and should, also be compared with existing theory as much as possible. Applicable theoretical results were employed throughout this project. Such theoretical results can also be used to construct deterministic (or, quasi-deterministic) models of any channel. These models are gaining great popularity in the literature as available computational tools become more available. Specifically, as geographic databases become more accurate and more readily available, and as powerful numerical computers become faster and more economical, these types of models will become more common. Brief comments on such models are provided in the sections on wideband modeling. With a linear channel, the measurements thus aimed to quantify the AG channel's timevarying (or, spatially-varying) CIR. These measurements were made simultaneously in two frequency bands recently allocated for UAS, the L Band, and the C Band, with (center frequencies, bandwidths) approximately (968 MHz, 5 MHz) and (5.06 GHz, 50 MHz), respectively. Worth noting is that the AG channel's characteristics do depend upon frequency, but for frequencies "close" to these L and C Band frequencies, many of the channel's characteristics will be largely identical. This is discussed with more precision subsequently, but since most propagation mechanisms (e.g., reflection, diffraction, scattering) are wavelength dependent, small changes in wavelength (or, frequency)—on the order of say, a factor within the range of ~0.7-1.5 of that of the measured wavelength (frequency)—do not change the basic features of the channel (e.g., the number of multipath components, MPCs). Measuring the CIR can be done by several methods, including transmission of impulsive signals, frequency sweeping, or via pulse compression techniques. The interested reader is referred to [9] for more information on these approaches. In the GRC measurements a direct-sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) pulse compression approach was used; this method has long been used for channel estimation [11].  

## Q.1.1 Measurement Equipment

The measurement equipment itself is termed the channel sounder. The sounder is a dual band DS-SS stepped correlator designed by Berkeley Varitronics Systems, Inc. [12]. The sounder system contains one transmitter (Tx) and two identical receivers (Rxs) in each band, see Figure Q-1 [13]. The complete system transmits and receives on both L Band and C Band simultaneously. Again, center frequencies were 968 MHz in L Band and 5060 MHz in C Band, and signal bandwidths are 5 MHz in L-band and 50 MHz in C Band. This yields delay resolutions of 200 ns in L Band and 20 ns in C Band. The DS-SS signals 
 
employed maximal-length ("m") sequences of length 1023, yielding maximum measurable delay spans of 204.6 μs in L Band and 20.46 μs in C Band [9]. Sounding signals are filtered using root-raised cosine responses (rolloff ~0.3) for spectral containment [3]. The outputs of the receivers are complex baseband CIRs, or equivalently, power delay profiles 
(PDPs) plus MPC phases: the PDP is the "power" equivalent of the CIR, essentially the power output at time t vs. delay , when an impulse is input at time t-. The GS and aircraft also employed GPS receivers, providing position information for all PDPs; hence the PDPs can also be expressed as functions of delay  and spatial coordinates. The Rx update rate was approximately 3000 PDPs per second for each of the four receivers. The transmit power was 10 Watts for both bands. An amplifier at the C Band transmitter (7 dB gain) and low noise amplifiers of gain 30 dB in C Band and 15.5 dB in L Band were also employed at the receivers. Connecting RF cable losses between amplifiers and antennas were approximately 4 dB for L Band, and 7.5 dB for C Band. A detailed description of the measurement system is provided in [14]. Receiver (Rx) antennas were vertically mounted on the bottom of an S-3B Viking aircraft in a rectangular pattern, as shown in Figure Q-2(b) [15], with intra-band antenna separation of 1.82 m and inter-band antenna separation of 1.24 or 1.33 m. The Rx antennas are blade monopoles, which are nearly omnidirectional in the azimuth plane. The maximum gain is 5 dBi. The Tx antennas were elevated 20 m above the ground by a transportable GS tower; see Figure Q-2(a). The GS was mounted on a trailer, which contained a generator and associated electronics for mast elevation, spectral analysis, etc. The sectored GS Tx antennas have gains of 6 dBi in C Band and 5 dBi in L Band, and the elevation/azimuth beamwidth is approximately 35º/180º for C Band and 60º/120º for L Band. Dynamic Tx & Rx antenna gains as functions of flight azimuth angle and elevation angle were employed in the data processing. Antenna patterns were reported in [16]. All antenna polarizations were vertical. In addition to the channel measurement equipment, the S-3B contained a typical set of aircraft equipment including GPS receivers, inertial navigation systems, an Inmarsat satellite communication transceiver, and VHF radios for communication with air traffic control. A spectrum analyzer was also employed to ensure no in-band interference was present during testing. 

## Q.1.2 Measurement Sites

Measurement sites were selected to be representative and as comprehensive as possible, within constraints on resources (time, expenses) and desired flight paths, since coordination with local air traffic control authorities was required. The ground sites were located near sea water, near fresh water, in flat, hilly, forested, desert, and mountainous terrain, and near suburban and urban settings. The list of measurement sites is detailed in Table Q-1 [17]. In total, the measurement campaign collected nearly 316 million PDPs in the seven different GS settings, making this (to the best of the team's knowledge) the most comprehensive AG channel measurement campaign yet undertaken. Additional detail on the measurement sites appears in [6]-[8].

## Q.1.3 Flight Tests

Within limits determined by the FAA and local air traffic control authorities, the flight paths—termed flight tracks (FTs)—flown were selected to be typical for such a mediumsized aircraft. These flights were at nearly constant altitude, and within the main beams of the GS antennas (except for some portions of some FTs in the "backlobe" regions, which yielded interesting and atypical results—see [16]). The primary FT shapes were straight, either directly toward or directly away from the GS, and oval-shaped. The oval-shaped paths were flown to vary the aircraft antenna orientation and attitude with respect to the GS. These oval-shaped paths also included banking turns that allowed quantification of airframe shadowing effects induced by such turns; this shadowing occurs via obstruction of the RLOS signal by the aircraft itself. Figure Q-3 shows two sets of FTs in Google Earth® and Google Maps® views, for the desert/hilly terrain near Palmdale, CA, and the over-ocean flights near Oxnard, CA. In most of the tests, electronic noise from some of the other aircraft systems was observed in the data recorded by the channel measurement system (see [6] for analysis). This noise was found to be approximately Gaussian distributed in dB units (e.g., a lognormally distributed noise voltage) with a mean several dB above that of the internal channel measurement system noise floor. This noise was easily removed using a thresholding algorithm in post-processing, but it did reduce measurement dynamic range by approximately 4 dB. For adequate estimation of the channel impulse response, a minimum SNR of approximately 10 dB is required. This corresponds to a received signal power of approximately -87 dBm for C Band, and approximately -97 dBm for L Band. Due to the aircraft electronic noise, a C Band threshold of -81 dBm was used. For L Band, the sounder itself exhibited some time variation in addition to influence from aircraft electronic noise, so the threshold was variable. This L Band threshold was sometimes as large as -75 dBm, but even this value yielded link ranges at least as large as those in C Band since the L Band path loss is approximately 14 dB less than that at C Band. The false alarm probability (of mistaking a noise "spike" for an MPC) was set to 0.0005, via the algorithm in [19]. Subsequent time-domain processing of PDPs allowed identification and removal of the rare noise spikes that remained after thresholding. Specifically, all recorded PDPs employed a threshold 25 dB down from the largest component, plus the aforementioned absolute power thresholds to remove aircraft electronic noise, plus processing over time to remove any remaining (rare) isolated noise spikes. Example geometric flight path data are shown in Figure Q-4 for an overwater FT near Cleveland, OH [7]. This geometric data was collected for all flight tests, to enable use of known antenna patterns in data processing, and to enable computation of channel statistics as a function of link distance and aircraft attitude. Finally regarding the flight tests, note that for some segments of some FTs, the channel sounder outputs in one or more Rxs were not valid. This invalid data was easily identified in post processing, and discarded (and hence not used for computation of AG channel characteristics). 

## Q.2 Ag Channel Characteristics Q.2.1 Path Loss

As noted, the CIR contains a complete description of the AG channel. For many communications applications and performance calculations, this comprehensive information is not required. One characteristic vital for link design is path loss (PL) or attenuation. This is obtained using known link parameter values in a link equation of the following form:  

$PL=P_{t}+G_{PA}+G_{LNA}+G_{t}+G_{r}-L_{C}-P_{r}$, (_Q.1_)
where Pt is transmit power, GPA the external Tx power amplifier gain, GLNA the Rx LNA gain, Gt and Gr the transmitter and receiver antenna gains, respectively, LC the cable losses, and Pr the received power. Received power is measured, typically as a function of link distance, and all other parameters except PL are known, enabling computation of PL. All quantities in (Q 1) are in dB units. In practice, the gain of the aircraft antennas can only be estimated: measured gain values from the antenna manufacturer were used in the computations, but these do not account for the effect of the aircraft on which the antennas are mounted (Figure Q-2). For all path loss computations, any effects of airframe shadowing or terrain obstruction were first removed. In all flight tests, aside from LOS shadowing or obstruction conditions, a dominant LOS component did exist, hence two common analytical path loss models can be used for comparison with measurements: the free-space path loss, PLFS*=20log(4*R/), where R is the link distance or range, and  is wavelength; and the common "two-ray" model, which includes the presence of a reflection from the earth's surface. For short-range links, the two-ray model assumes a flat earth, but it was found that for the AG links, the curvedearth two-ray (CE2R) model is more accurate. Complete descriptions of these models appear in [2] and [17]. Other established propagation models can also be used to estimate AG channel path loss. Classical rough terrain propagation models such as the Longley-
 
Rice, and Terrain Integrated Rough Earth Model (TIREM) [9] and the model by Okumura, et. al. [20], predict only median attenuations, and cannot estimate the effects of additional multipath components. These models also require a much larger amount of input data than the two-ray models. The model contained within the ITU Recommendation P.528 [21] 
represents a compromise between the simplicity of the two-ray models and the detailed computations of TIREM. The path loss results obtained from the measurements generally agree with those computed via the methods in [21]. 

## Q.2.2 Small-Scale Fading

In addition to the LOS and surface reflection, the AG channel also often contains multipath components (MPCs). These MPCs arrive at the receiver with various amplitudes and phases, due to different path lengths (and reflection coefficients), and cause variation of the received power on spatial scales of the order of /2, and are hence termed smallscale fading. This fading is almost always modeled stochastically—in direct contrast to the essentially deterministic two-ray components. With a dominant LOS component, the small-scale fading is most commonly modeled as having Ricean statistics (other common distributions include the Nakagami and Weibull). The Ricean distribution is characterized by the "Rice factor" or K-factor, where k represents the ratio of the power in the LOS (or, dominant) component to the power in all other components. This is usually specified in dB: *K=10log(k)*. See [22] for a thorough discussion of this well-known distribution. The Ricean K-factor was estimated for all the GS environments. In order to do this, a socalled *stationarity distance* had to be first established. To estimate any statistical channel parameters, it is necessary to determine the region of space over which the channel's statistics can be assumed constant1. This spatial region is quantified by the stationarity distance (SD)2. Estimation of SD is a topic of current research, and this is not discussed extensively here—see [17] and [23]. The SD can be computed via multiple methods. For the wideband (50 MHz C Band) measurements, two methods were selected. The first method [24] can be viewed as a wideband method, in which a temporal correlation coefficient (TPCC) for the time-varying PDP is computed. The second method [25] requires multiple receiving or transmitting antennas, but is a narrowband metric, termed collinearity, which estimates correlation among channel gains. Details are described in [17] and [23]; applying these measures yielded the result that for essentially all of the AG measurements, a median SD of 15 m (~250 at C Band) was obtained. Example contour plots of the TPCC and collinearity for a segment of over-sea data are shown in Figure Q-5 [17]. The channel was declared stationary when the SD metric value was 0.9 or larger (hence this is a conservative estimate, i.e., the channel is very likely stationary for even larger travel distances, corresponding to smaller SD metric values). The quasi-periodicity one can observe in Figure Q-5 is attributable to two-ray "oscillations."3 The value of travel distance x in the example data of Figure Q-5 for which the TPCC>0.9 is approximately 5 m. To determine an SD applicable to all data in all environments, TPCC and collinearity statistics were collected in all settings, and from these statistics the 15 m SD value was obtained. The statistical channel parameters were 

 
computed over this value of SD for all FTs; worth noting is that K-factors do not appreciably change if the assumed SD value ranges from ~5-30 m.  

## Q.2.3 Correlations

Another channel parameter of interest for communications applications is the correlation of channel effects on different antennas. Uncorrelated channel effects enable spatial diversity gains and can also enable use of advanced multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) techniques for improved performance (via diversity) or increased data rates. The correlations of the channel effects across the four Rx antennas were thus quantified. This comprises the spatial correlation between antennas operating in the same band, and the frequency-domain correlation between antennas operating in different frequency bands. The correlation between signal components on the two different antennas in each band, and between components on antennas employing different bands, over the SD, was computed from the measured data. In general, the correlations of interest are those among all received signal components (including MPCs), but in the AG channels, one is primarily interested in the correlations of the LOS components, which contain the vast majority of received power. For the two C Band antennas for example, the amplitude correlation coefficient is computed by 

$$\rho_{\rm A_{C1},A_{C2}}=\frac{\rm E[(A_{C1}-\mu_{\rm A_{C1}})(A_{C2}-\mu_{\rm A_{C2}})]}{\sigma_{\rm A_{C1}}\sigma_{\rm A_{C2}}}$$ ( $$Q.2$$ )
where E denotes expectation, the A's in the numerator are sample amplitude vectors, and the 's are the means of the A vectors. Specifically, AC1=(AC1,1, AC1,2, …A*C1,n*) is the vector of LOS amplitude samples for C Band Rx1, with A*C1,i* the ith amplitude sample, and analogously for C Band Rx2. Both vectors are of lengths that span only the SD, and the 
's are the standard deviations of the respective sample vectors. 

## Q.2.4 Airframe Shadowing

Airframe shadowing occurred during many of the banking turns in the oval-shaped FTs. This large scale channel effect is essentially independent of the small-scale fading, but does of course depend upon the specific aircraft heading and attitude. The shadowing effects also depend upon the aircraft size, so the results obtained pertain to medium-sized aircraft similar in size to the S-3B. The airframe shadowing observed was caused largely by the aircraft wings. This effect can be effectively mitigated with appropriate placement of multiple antennas, e.g., with one antenna on top of the aircraft and one on the bottom. Nonetheless, models for airframe shadowing do not exist in the literature, and the new results enabled creation of such models, which can be useful for link designers. 

## Q.2.5 Wideband Models

All the prior channel characteristics provide a partial description of the AG channel. The time-varying (spatially-varying) CIR is a wideband model that can provide a complete description of the channel. Most often the CIR is separated from large scale path loss and shadowing, and this approach has been used here. The wideband models consist of the deterministic LOS and surface reflection, plus the intermittent MPCs measured throughout the various environments; these MPCs are quantified statistically. For these intermittent MPCs, for each GS environment, the following characteristics were quantified: their probability of occurrence (often as a function of link distance); their durations (spatial or temporal extents); their delays relative to that of the LOS component; and their amplitudes relative to that of the LOS component (intermittent MPC phases were found to be fairly well modeled as uniformly distributed on [0,2)). With the LOS and surface reflection characteristics (amplitude, phase, and delay), plus the intermittent MPC characteristics, tapped-delay line wideband AG channel models were developed. 

## Q.3 Example Results Q.3.1 Path Loss And Excess Path Loss

Path loss was quantified as described in the prior section for all FTs in all environments. Although results were gathered for both straight and oval-shaped FTs, since path loss is usually expressed as a function of link distance, the focus is on straight FT results here (see [6]-[8]). Figure Q-6 shows example path loss in dB vs. link distance in km for L Band, for FTs in both desert (Figure Q-6(a), [18]) and mountainous (Figure Q-6(b), [26]) environments. Plotted results include measured path loss, a linear fit to the logarithm of distance for these measured results (i.e., one of the path loss models), free-space path loss, and the CE2R model path loss. As noted in [6]-[8], path loss is larger than that of free space at shorter link distances due to aircraft antenna effects. In general, the measured path loss follows the free-space loss fairly well, as expected. Significant variations about the free-space lines result from the surface reflection, and from MPCs. The rapid variations, quantified by the Ricean K-factor, are attributable to multiple relatively weak MPCs. For the plots in Figure Q-6, the CE2R model fits the measurements only for a limited range of distances where the geometry is such that a large surface area is exposed to allow a strong surface reflection (see [34]). For the desert terrain of Figure Q-6(a), two-ray effects (path loss peaks) can be observed at distances larger than approximately 20 km; for the mountainous terrain of Figure Q-6(b), the two-ray effects appear only for link distances from approximately 10-20 km. Since the earth's surface in these environments is not perfectly smooth, and since the CE2R model is very sensitive to changes in terminal heights, the CE2R fit is not expected to be perfect (see Figure Q-4(c) for an example of aircraft altitude variation during a typical FT). For the case of smoother surfaces, including water surfaces, the CE2R model fits better. In general, the CE2R model fits better at L Band than at C Band, since the longer L Band wavelength means that a given surface is 
"electrically smoother" at the lower frequency. Note also that the CE2R plots here assume a constant FT altitude; adjusting the aircraft altitude vs. link distance in the CE2R does improve its agreement with measurements. Our CE2R models also incorporate surface roughness effects. Example results for C Band appear in Figure Q-7, for over sea in Figure Q-7(a) [6], and for mountainous terrain in Figure Q-7(b) [26]. Aircraft antenna effects at short link ranges again caused path losses larger than that for free space in the over-sea case. For the mountainous terrain, the C Band results in Figure Q-7(b) show path loss slightly less than that for free space for nearly the entire FT; this is likely attributable to a waveguiding effect of the canyon below the FT. The CE2R path loss model varies very rapidly with distance for these flight geometries. Finally, on these path loss examples, Figure Q-8 shows L Band path loss for a portion of one of the oval-shaped FTs in the over-sea environment. This figure illustrates the better agreement of the CE2R with measurements than the flat-earth two-ray model. For link budget and availability analyses, not only path loss, but *excess* path loss is also of interest. Excess path loss is defined as the channel attenuation in excess of that of some reference attenuation [8]. Two different reference attenuation values were considered: free-space path loss PLFS, and the (single-segment) linear fit to the logarithm of link distance denoted PL*LogR* (see [7] and the path loss models in the next section). Excess path loss is denoted PL, thus 

$\Delta PL_{FS}(R)=PL(R)-PL_{FS}(R)$ (_Q.3_) $\Delta PL_{LogR}(R)=PL(R)-PL_{LogR}(R)$ (_Q.4_)
where *PL(R)* denotes the measured path loss in dB vs. link range R, PLFS(R) denotes the path loss of free space, and PLLogR(R) denotes the path loss estimated by the single segment log-distance path loss model.  
 
Provided here are example cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) for excess path loss for two straight FTs. (Excess path loss for the oval-shaped flight tracks is not significantly different.) Note that PL*LogR* is often (but not always) smaller than PLFS, since the former corresponds to a best linear fit to the measured data. Maximum absolute values of PL*LogR* 
are provided in the section on path loss models. Fits to the excess path loss distributions in dB were also obtained. The best fitting distribution for most of the excess path loss data was the Gaussian; parameters (mean , and standard deviation ) for these Gaussian fits appear in the figures. The Gaussian fits allow easy computation of measured excess path loss for any percentile value, but since the 99.8th percentile value has been declared by SC-228 as a critical number, these values of PL are also specified in the figures. More detailed results appear in [8]. Figure Q-9 shows excess path loss cdfs for the Palmdale (desert) environment for both L Band and C Band [8]. The 99.8th percentile values here are some of the largest among all FTs. 


## (A)                                (B) Q.3.2 Small-Scale Fading: Ricean K-Factor

Example Ricean K-factors vs. link distance are shown in Figure Q-10 for the mountainous terrain in L Band (Figure Q-10(a), [26]) and for the over-sea environment in C Band (Figure Q-10(b), [17]). Although the K-factors are not constant, the variation of the average K-factor with link distance is well approximated by a linear function. A linear fit to K-factor (in dB) vs. range R in km is given by the equation 

$K(R)=K_{0}+n_{K}(R$-$R_{min})+Y$ ($Q.5$)
where K0 is a constant value for the minimum distance Rmin (e.g., 2.2 km for C Band, 1 km for L Band for the over-sea environment), nK is the slope, and Y is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with standard deviation Y. Since the slopes are very small, a good approximation can be obtained using K(R)K0 *+ Y*. The surface reflection is responsible for some of the slower large variations of K for the L Band results. Ricean K-factors were found not to be a strong function of either link distance or environment type, and parameter values for the model in (Q.5) are provided in the section on AG channel models. 

## Q.3.3 Inter-Antenna Correlations

As expected in a channel with a dominant LOS component and moderate spatial separation between antennas, the intra-band spatial correlations were large (near unity). Also as expected, with a frequency ratio of approximately five between the L and C Band channel frequencies, the inter-band (frequency domain) correlations were essentially zero, confirming the fact that small-scale fading is uncorrelated in the two bands. Figure Q-11 shows example results for the C Band intra-band (spatial) correlations [6]. Figure Q-11(a) shows the correlation vs. link distance for three window sizes ("vector lengths"), corresponding to different assumed values of SD (the window length of 500 is closest to the actual 15 m SD). As can be observed, the intra-band correlation is generally above 0.8. Results for L Band intra-band correlation are similar. Figure Q-11(b) shows histograms of the correlation over this FT, illustrating that the majority of the correlation values are large. For the intra-band case, an interesting phenomenon was observed, particularly in the overwater settings, at short range: in the strong two-ray environments, the two-ray interaction causes the intra-band correlation coefficient to oscillate between large values near one and through zero to values near negative one (one such "dip" appears in Figure Q-11(a) at link distance ~ 2 km). Figure Q-12 [17] illustrates this phenomenon for a pure (theoretical) two-ray channel. Additional MPCs tend to destroy the regularity of such oscillations in practice, and the resulting Ricean fading makes the variation essentially impossible to predict. Nonetheless, for channels well approximated by a two-ray model, such spatiallyoscillating correlations will occur; rapidly adaptive receiver processing could in theory take advantage of this. 

## Q.3.4 Multipath Components

The MPCs in the AG channel—aside from the surface reflection—are very dynamic due to the relatively high velocity, which causes the obstacles that generate the MPCs to be "in view" of the terminal antennas for only a short duration. (This would of course not be true for very slow-moving aircraft or hovering rotorcraft.) Thus the models for these MPCs are very different from those used for conventional, e.g., cellular, channels, in which MPCs persist for long durations, and are modeled with certain values of relative power, delay, and small-scale fading characteristics. In the AG channels measured in this project, the duration of MPCs is so short that modeling their small scale fading is difficult. In addition, the AG channel MPC power levels are relatively weak (e.g., 15-25 dB below the LOS component power), so that only when the number of such MPCs is large will they have a strong effect on communication system performance. Nevertheless, for high-reliability AG communication systems, these MPCs must be characterized. 

 
Figure Q-13 shows a sequence of PDPs from C Band over-sea measurements [6]. The strong LOS component is nearly of constant power over this short segment of an FT, and the sea surface reflection is also easily identified. An intermittent ("3rd ray") MPC is also visible for a spatial extent of approximately 10-15 m. The chip index axis in Figure Q-13 
corresponds to delay (one C Band chip is of duration 20 ns). 

 
In Figure Q-14(a) a plot of the root-mean square delay spread (RMS-DS, ) is shown vs. link distance for a mountainous terrain FT in C Band. The RMS-DS is the most common measure of the channel's temporal dispersion [27]. (Worth mention is that the L Band sounder's delay resolution of 200 ns was almost always too poor to discern most of the MPCs, but from a physical perspective, MPCs at the same values of delay, but with different amplitudes and phases, are very likely present in the corresponding L Band channels as well [28].) Figure Q-14(b) shows the PDP sequence corresponding to the RMS-DS "bump" in Figure Q-14(a) at link distance ~ 10 km. Based upon the environment geometry, the sources of the MPC clusters that cause the temporary increase in RMS-DS were estimated to be segments of fairly broad and smooth portions of one of the mountain slopes near the Telluride airport.

$$\sigma_{{}_{\tau}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}\alpha_{k}^{2}\tau_{k}^{2}}{P}}-\mu_{{}_{\tau}}^{2}$$
where αk is the kth MPC amplitude, τk is the kth MPC's delay for a given CIR containing L MPCs, and µ is the mean energy delay, given by

## Q.3.5 Airframe Shadowing

An example airframe shadowing event for an over freshwater FT is shown in Figure Q-15 [31]. This figure shows received power vs. time on all four receivers during a banking turn. To quantify such shadowing, thresholds of received power, roll angle, and aircraft heading angle with respect to the straight line connecting the GS to the aircraft, were established. As this figure shows, such shadowing can reduce received power by 20-30 dB, or more, over durations of tens of seconds. Since such maneuvers may be independent of link distance, shadowing depths of this magnitude can easily sever a communication link. Table Q-3 provides statistics for this example shadowing event. Over 58 total shadowing events, the median shadowing loss was 15.5 dB for C Band and 10.8 dB for L Band. Maximum shadowing loss values for L Band ranged from approximately 18-45 dB. Due to limitations on Rx sensitivity, shadowing depth maxima for C Band are of limited accuracy (this is addressed further in the section on shadowing modeling).

## Q.4 Ag Channel Models

In this section empirical models for the measured AG channels are provided. These are models for the channel characteristics and CIRs previously described. 

## Q.4.1 Path Loss Models

These models are applicable for link budget analyses, and for estimation of the AG 
channel's effect upon narrowband signals. Several models have been developed, so that the interested model user may select the model depending upon accuracy and complexity considerations. All data was divided into large elevation angle (small distance) and small elevation angle (large distance) segments. (Note that when in the large elevation angle segment where link range is small, path loss is actually of lesser interest since received signals are relatively strong.) The aircraft antenna gains vary most at higher elevation angles corresponding to short link ranges. Thus two-segment models were developed, with an elevation angle threshold of five degrees, as this value represented the approximate transition where the aircraft antenna pattern began to deviate from the manufacturer's pattern. Path loss models are provided in three forms, with increasing complexity and accuracy: a single logdistance model for the entire distance range; a two-segment log-distance model; and a two-segment two-ray model that incorporates small-scale fading. Model parameters were obtained from least-squares fits to the measured data. 

Single Log-distance Model 

$$P L(R)=A_{0}+10n_{A}l o g(R/R_{m i n})+X_{A}+\zeta F_{A},\qquad\quad R_{m i n}\leq R\leq R_{m a x}\qquad(Q.8)$$
Two-segment Log-distance Model 

$$PL(R)$$ $$=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}A_{0,S}+10n_{S}log(R/R_{min})+X_{S}+\zeta F_{S},&\theta>\theta_{t}\;(R_{min}\leq R<R_{t})\\ A_{0,L}+10n_{L}log(R/R_{t})+X_{L}+\zeta F_{L},&\theta\leq\theta_{t}\;(R_{t}\leq R\leq R_{max})\end{array}\right.$$
Two-Ray Model 

$$PL(R)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}FE2R(R)-20\log[a(R)]\,,&\psi>\psi_{min}\\ CE2R(R)+B_{L}+\xi F_{C,L}-20\log[a(R)]\,,&\pi/2>\psi>\psi_{min}\end{array}\right.$$ (Q.10)
In these models, R is link range, the A0's are constants at the minimum valid link distances; subscripts A in (Q.8) and S and L in (Q.9) denote all, short, and long distance segments, respectively; the n's are the path loss exponents; threshold elevation angle t is 5 degrees (corresponding to threshold range Rt); variable = -1 for travel toward the GS and +1 for travel away from the GS, and the F's are small (positive) adjustment factors for direction of travel4; the X's are zero-mean Gaussian random variables with standard deviation X; BL is the average difference between the measured path loss and the CE2R model5; grazing angle  is computed in the two-ray model with min(mrad)=(2100/fMHz)1/3 [32], [33, Section 6]; and *a(R)* is the Ricean fading variable. An unfiltered (memoryless) Ricean fading process represents the measured data well; this physically results from the rough surface scattering from the environment surfaces. The abbreviation FE2R denotes the flat-earth 2-ray model and CE2R denotes the curved-earth 2-ray model. Model parameters appear in Table Q-4. In this table, also provided for the log-distance models are values denoted Xmax (dB), which quantify the maximum deviation between the deterministic portions of the log-distance models and the measurement data (analogously, Xmin). These values generally represent the peak two-ray attenuation values, and may be of interest for link budget computations. Finally, note that for the urban and suburban Cleveland, hilly Latrobe, and mountainous settings, the earth surface obstacles were generally dense enough or the surface rough enough to invalidate the CE2R (and FE2R) models, except for some small segments of range (e.g., Figure Q-6(b)), hence for these settings, the log-distance models should be used. The CE2R path loss parameters for these exception cases are shaded in Table Q-4.

## Ricean K-Factor Models

The Ricean K-factor models were described in a previous section. Specifically, equation (Q.5) describes the linear fit of K-factor in dB to distance in km. This linear equation also has a zero-mean Gaussian error term (Y) that describes the variation about this linear fit; values for Y are usually less than 3 dB. As previously noted, depending upon the model user's preference, simplifications to the linear fit with distance can be employed, such as a constant plus the Gaussian variation (K0 *+ Y)*, or even just a constant value, i.e., either K0 or one of the statistics computed for the K-factor. The median K-factors are approximately 28.7 dB in C Band and 13.1 dB in L Band, which pertain to the aggregate data for all straight FTs for all measured GS environments. Table Q-5 presents the parameters of the Ricean K-factor models for the various GS environments, along with measured statistics of the K-factor. The K-factor was estimated using multiple methods [34], the most accurate of which is the maximum-likelihood (ML) method. All results in Table Q-5 are the ML estimates, and all results pertain to the straight FTs. Note that for some environments, K-factor results appear for the same GS location, but for different days. The FTs for these different days are very similar, but not quite identical.

## Q.4.3 Correlation Modeling

For AG channel analyses that require information on correlations among the LOS components received in different bands, one can consider the L and C Band small-scale fading uncorrelated. This should not be dependent on (aircraft) antenna separation or on specific FT parameters. For the case of the spatial correlation between intra-band signals (assuming the exact *same* frequency in either L or C Band), the correlation results show that the LOS component fading is highly correlated. This result is dependent upon the spatial placement and separation of the aircraft antennas. Based upon geometric considerations (and upon the stationarity distance results), one would expect a large value of correlation for intra-band antennas separated by even larger distances (up to and beyond 15 m), as long as the two (or more) antennas had similar "visibility" to the GS. If the frequencies of interest are still "intra-band," but not *identical*, e.g., two C Band signals separated in frequency by f Hz, then the correlation between these signals could be estimated from the measured values of RMS delay spread. A typical—but inexact— estimate of the coherence (or, correlation) bandwidth is Bc~1/(6) [35] for correlation value 0.5, so if f > Bc, the two signals may not be highly correlated. As noted in the discussion of MPCs though, for most of the AG channels, the MPCs are intermittent, and hence  and Bc would intermittently take multiple values. 

## Q.4.4 Wideband Ag Channel Models

The wideband AG channel models can be cast into the form of tapped-delay lines (TDLs) that approximate the CIR; these types of models have been widely used in all other wireless communications applications [22]. The different GS environments have distinct TDL models, all of which are combinations of deterministic components (the LOS and surface reflection) plus stochastic components (additional MPCs). The wideband models are specifically based upon C Band data, and are hence applicable to the C Band AG channels (as noted, L Band MPC delays and durations are likely to be identical to those of C Band, but the L Band MPC relative amplitudes will be different). 

## Over-Water Models

For the over-water settings, the channel is well modeled by the two-ray model plus an intermittent third MPC termed the intermittent 3rd ray [17]. For the over-water (OW) AG channels, the CIR is given by 

$$h_{O W}(\tau,t)=h_{2-r a y}^{(O W)}(\tau,t)+z_{3}(t)\alpha_{3}(t)e^{-j\phi_{3}(t)}\delta(\tau-\tau_{3}(t))\qquad\qquad(Q.11)$$
(𝑂𝑊) (𝜏, 𝑡) is the FE2R or CE2R model CIR, z3(t) is a random process that where ℎ2−𝑟𝑎𝑦
controls the presence/absence of the 3rd ray (hence z3{0,1}), 3 is the intermittent 3rd ray relative amplitude, 3 is its phase, and 3 denotes its delay. Figure Q-16 illustrates the tapped-delay line (TDL) model. Since the 3rd ray is intermittent, the statistical models describe its probability of occurrence, duration D3, relative delay 3 and relative amplitude 
3, where relative here means with respect to the LOS component values. Statistics for 
 
these parameters are easiest to express as functions of distance. Model users can then translate to functions of time as needed by specifying flight paths and velocities. 



In Figure Q-17 [17], the relative "on probability" for the intermittent 3rd ray vs. link range R is shown, for both sea and freshwater. An exponential (least-squares) fit to the data appears in each plot, of the form with parameters a and b given in the figure, and range R in (Q.12) is in km.  
 
The duration of the intermittent ray, D3, as a function of link range, for both water types is shown in Figure Q-18 [17]. Exponential fits of the exact same form as (Q.12) are also provided. Parameters for the on probability and duration fits appear in Table Q-6 [17]. Model users can select parameters for mean, median, or maximum durations.

The intermittent 3rd ray's phase is well modeled as a uniform random value in [0, 2). Over all the over water data, the intermittent 3rd ray's relative amplitude is very well modeled by a Gaussian distribution, with mean value 3 dB below the LOS component amplitude, and standard deviation 3 dB. For the over-sea case, 3=22.6, 3=5.2, and for the over-freshwater case, 3=23.2, 3=3.9. To complete the model, the intermittent 3rd ray excess delays are shown in Figure Q-19. The excess delay values were divided into two sets for the over-sea case: Set 1 is 0.1s  
3 1.1s and Set 2 is 6s  3 7s (not shown in Figure Q-19). The probabilities for the delays lying in these two sets are P(Set 1)=0.9923 and P(Set 2)=0.0077, i.e., the very long delay values are rare. For the over freshwater setting, excess delays lie between 0.1 and 0.9 s. The delays are not easily fit by any standard distributions, but exponential fit 
 
parameters of the form of (Q.12) are provided for the over-sea subset of smallest delay values (Set 1, 0.1s  3 1.1s), also in Table Q-6. For modeling the rare large over sea delay values in Set 2, delay values can be modeled as uniform over the delay range 6s  
3 7s. For the over-freshwater case, also provided is a set of exponential fit parameters of the form of (Q.12) for the delay values. As a simpler alternative for the over-freshwater 3rd ray excess delays an exponential distribution, independent of distance, has also been derived: 

$p(\tau_{3})=\frac{1}{\gamma}\exp[-(\tau_{3}-100)/\gamma]$ (_Q.13_)
with =17 ns.

To implement the model as a function of link distance, the following algorithm is provided: 1. For a given value of link range, implement the FE2R or CE2R model for the first two components of the CIR. 2. From a distribution specified by Figure Q-17 and Table Q-6, generate random variable z3. If z3=0, the 3rd ray is not present, so return to step 1 and increment/change link distance; if z3=1, go to step 3. 3. From a distribution specified by Figure Q-18 and Table Q-6, generate the 3rd ray's duration D3. (As noted, this duration in meters can be converted to time or symbol units as required.) 4. Draw Gaussian random variable with mean 3, standard deviation 3, to set the 3rd ray relative amplitude. Select 3rd ray phase from a uniform distribution on [0, 2). 5. From the distribution specified by Figure Q-19 and parameters in Table Q-6 (or (Q.13) for the simpler distance-independent relative delay 3 in the over-freshwater case), set the 3rd ray relative delay 3. 6. Increment/change distance as desired, update the two-ray model values, and maintain the 3rd ray for duration D3. After D3 reached, go to step 1 and continue. 

## Hilly/Mountainous Terrain Models

The ground reflection from a flat and smooth earth or relatively smooth water is specular. For hilly and mountainous terrain though, the physical process affecting the surface component is not only reflection but also scattering, and the energy that propagates to the receiver is reduced by the ground roughness that causes scattering. The FE2R or CE2R models [17], [34] can be used in hilly/mountainous terrain by employing a ground roughness coefficient Cr as was described in [17], 

$C_{r}=\frac{4\pi s_{g}sin(\psi)}{\lambda}$ (_Q.14_)
where  denotes the grazing angle, λ is the wavelength, and sg denotes the standard deviation of the ground height (typically assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution). The ground reflection is essentially specular when Cr<0.1, and it is negligible when Cr>10. The effect of roughness is incorporated by multiplying the reflection coefficient by 

$r_{F}=exp(-C_{r}^{2}/2)$ (_Q.15_)
[37]. The ground roughness sg should be estimated inside the first Fresnel zone near the "reflection point," which can easily be determined geometrically [34]. The intercepting area of the first Fresnel zone, and hence sg, is a function of link range R, aircraft height hA and GS height hG. Estimating sg precisely requires detailed geographic information for specific GS sites and flight routes. Visually, sg>10 m provided a good approximation for most portions of the mountainous terrain (yielding essentially no appreciable surface component). Developing a more accurate CE2R model also requires addressing other effects such as vegetation coverage and effects of building on the ground. The tapped delay line models for hilly/mountainous terrain quantify the same parameters as in the over-water models (# MPCs, their probability of occurrence, and MPC amplitude, phase, duration, and excess delay, all relative to the LOS component). As noted, the LOS component is almost always present in our AG channels and the ground reflection is denoted the second tap. Other MPCs are classified as intermittent taps since they are only present for a short duration. Tap 3 is defined as the only intermittent tap, or the tap with the smallest excess delay if multiple intermittent taps are present. Tap 4 is the tap with the second smallest excess delay if multiple intermittent taps are present, etc. Our hilly/mountainous AG channel TDL models include up to nine taps, where the limit of nine taps was chosen since the presence or "on probability" of the 9th tap is very small. The structure of the TDL is analogous to that in Figure Q-16. The hilly/mountainous (HM) channel impulse response is given by 

$$\begin{split}h_{H\!H\!M}(\tau,t)&=\alpha_{LOS}(t)\delta\big{(}\tau-\tau_{1}(t)\big{)}+\alpha_{2}(t)e^{-j\phi_{2}(t)}\delta\big{(}\tau-\tau_{2}(t)\big{)}\\ &+\big{\rangle}^{9}_{k=3}\alpha_{k}(t)\alpha_{k}(t)e^{-j\phi_{k}(t)}\delta(\tau-\tau_{k}(t))\end{split}$$ (Q.16)
where again, α, , and  denote amplitude, phase and delay, respectively; z{0,1} denotes the on/off (birth/death) parameter described by the on probability; subscripts LOS, 2 and k denote the LOS component, the ground reflection component, and the kth intermittent MPCs, respectively, with k an integer in {3, 4, …9}. The first two terms in (Q.16) are 

                                                     
 
computed from the CE2R model [17], [34], which as noted, can account for surface roughness. As in the over-water channels, the phases k (k>2) are uniformly randomly distributed between zero and 2. The relative power of the intermittent taps (αk2/αLOS2) follows a Gaussian distribution with (mean, standard deviation) values of (-30.8 dB, 3.9 dB) for the hilly environment of Latrobe, (-26.1 dB, 3.7 dB) for hilly Palmdale, and (-26.4 dB, 3.6 dB) for the mountainous environment of Telluride. All these mean values are relative to that of the LOS component. In many terrestrial channel models, the relative power of intermittent taps typically decreases with tap index (larger tap index means larger excess delay). However, the AG MPCs are intermittent, and their relative power is essentially independent of tap index. The on probability of zk does decrease as the tap index increases. The relative power of these intermittent MPCs largely depends on the characteristics (e.g., reflection coefficient, surface area) of the scatterers or reflectors, which are sparsely located near the flight path, and the duration of a MPC from each reflector is very small relative to the flight path. Parameters zk, k, and tap duration Dk (which can be expressed in either time or distance units, since these are related by flight velocity) are not only functions of the GS local environments, but also exponentially change over link range R. Based on aggregate results of two C Band receivers and multiple FTs in each environment, the values of on probability and statistics (maximum, median and mean) of duration Dk and relative delay 
k were collected for one kilometer link range bins. From this, a linear model was developed to quantify the variation of these parameters, which follows: 

$log_{10}(y)=C_{0}+n_{y}R+Z$ (_Q.17_)
where y denotes either the on probability of the kth tap, delay k, or duration Dk (all for k>2), C0 denotes the intercept at R=0, ny is the slope, and Z is a zero mean Gaussian random variable with standard deviation Z. Example results for on probability, k, and Dk vs. R for tap 3 in the mountainous environment are shown in Figure Q-20 [38]. The 3rd tap's on probability and duration D3 decreased with R. The excess delay 3 did not show any strong trend with respect to R. The number of PDPs that contain intermittent MPCs for each environment are listed in Table Q-7. The parameters C0, ny and Z for on probability, k, and Dk vs. R for the hilly/mountainous environments are provided in Tables Q-8, Q-9 and Q-10, respectively.

With the TDL model described by equations (Q.16) and (Q.17) and Tables Q-8-Q-10, CIRs as a function of link range for the hilly/mountainous AG channels can be generated via simulation. Similar to the algorithm provided for the over-water TDL, the algorithm is extended to the nine tap TDL model via the following algorithm [38]: 1. Initialize Dk=0 for all values of k (3, 4, …, 9). 

2. For a given value of link range R or time t, implement the LOS component (the first term in (Q.16)). Note that the ground reflection (the second term in (Q.16)) is often very weak in the hilly/mountainous terrain. It should be included incorporating ground roughness (and potentially, vegetation coverage) according to the discussion preceding 
(Q.16). 

3. For k=3 to 9 (tap index, integers), if k=3, go to step 4; if k≥4 and zk-1(R)=0, go to step 2 
and increment/change link range R; if k≥4 and zk-1(R)=1, go to step 4. 4. If Dk=0, go to step 5; if Dk>0, go to step 7. 5. From a distribution specified by equation (Q.7) and Table Q-8, generate random variable zk(R). If zk(R)=0, kth ray not present, so go to step 2 and increment/change link range R; if z3(R)=1, go to step 6. 6. From a distribution specified by equation (Q.17) and Table Q-9, generate the kth ray's duration Dk. (If needed, convert duration in meters to time or symbol units.), set Rk=R. 

 
7. Draw Gaussian random variable with mean k, standard deviation k, to set kth ray relative amplitude. Select the kth ray phase from a uniform distribution on [0, 2). 8. From distribution specified by equation (Q.17) and Table Q-10, set the kth ray relative delay k(R). 

9. Check Dk with respect to R to maintain the kth ray for duration Dk, if Dk=R-Rk (reached), set Dk=0 and go to step 10; if Dk<R-Rk (not reached), go to step 10 directly. 10. If k<9, go to step 3; if k=9, end of the loop "for k=3 to 9", go to step 2. 

## Suburban/Near-Urban Models

Our last set of models pertains to the suburban and near-urban environments. The CIR here takes the exact same form as that of the hilly/mountainous terrain, i.e.  

ℎ𝑆𝑈(𝜏, 𝑡) = 𝛼𝐿𝑂𝑆(𝑡)𝛿(𝜏−𝜏1(𝑡)) + 𝛼2(𝑡)𝑒−𝑗𝜙2(𝑡)𝛿(𝜏−𝜏2(𝑡)) (Q.18)  9 + ∑ 𝑧𝑘(𝑡)𝛼𝑘(𝑡)𝑒−𝑗𝜙𝑘(𝑡)𝛿(𝜏−𝜏𝑘(𝑡)) 𝑘=3  
where the definitions of the terms in (Q.18) are again the same. The total of 9 MPCs is coincidentally the same as that for the hilly/mountainous terrain, although the intermittent MPC statistics are of course different (see e.g., example RMS-DS results in the previous section). In the suburban/near-urban settings the multipath environment can be considerably richer. Table Q-11 contains statistics on the relative occurrence probabilities of the intermittent MPCs. Once again, IMPC parameters are specified statistically: the IMPC probability of occurrence, duration Dk (or, IMPC lifetime), and delay k are modeled as functions of link range. Delays are relative to that of the LOS component, computable from link geometry. The IMPC amplitudes are again modeled relative to that of the LOS component. Phases of the IMPCs were found to be well approximated as uniformly random on [0, 2).

Parameters zk, k, and tap duration Dk (expressed in either time or distance units, since related by flight velocity) were found to exponentially change over link range R. Using aggregate results of the two C Band receivers and multiple FTs in each environment, the values of on probability and statistics (maximum, median and mean) of duration Dk and delay k were collected in one kilometer link range bins. The same linear model of as in the hilly/mountainous terrain, (Q.17), was again used to quantify the variation of these parameters, which appear in Tables Q-12-Q-14.

The algorithm to create CIRs with the provided TDL models and parameters was provided in the previous section in text form. Figure Q-22 shows a flowchart of this algorithm. 

 

## Q.4.5 Airframe Shadowing Model

As noted, conditions were established to declare that airframe shadowing was taking place. To have the LOS component obstructed by the wing, not only must the roll angle be large enough, but also the flight direction (heading) cannot be parallel to the LOS between GS and aircraft. This second condition means that the difference between heading and azimuth angle ∠HA must be large enough. 

 
Three criteria are employed to determine the starting and ending positions of an airframe shadowing event [34]: 

(a) roll angle > 5º; 
(b) angle ∠HA > 30º; 
(c) measured received power Pr at least 5 dB smaller than the received power estimated by the log-distance path loss model. Worth noting is that in most of the airframe shadowing events, the distribution of shadowing depths is well approximated by a Gaussian distribution. Figure Q-23(a) [34] shows measured shadowing distributions and Gaussian fits for a shadowing event from FT11 in Palmdale, CA; Figure Q-23(b) shows the corresponding aircraft roll angle vs. time. A linear fit was derived to model the relationship between the median shadowing loss S (in dB) and roll angle R in degrees as follows [34]: 

$S(\alpha_{R})=A_{S,\alpha}+n_{S,\alpha}(\alpha_{R}-\alpha_{R,min})+X_{S,\alpha}$ (_Q.19_)
where AS, (dB) denotes the reference shadowing loss at the minimum roll angle *R,min*, nS, is the linear fit slope, and XS, is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with standard deviation σ*X,S,* dB. The linear fit parameters appear in Tables Q-15. These fits can be interpreted as pertaining to aircraft similar in size to the S-3B, with antennas on the bottom.

 For modeling shadowing in most applications, expressing the shadowing value versus time is most convenient. Conversion from time t to link range R can be done via geometry 

$R=v_{H}tco\,s(\mathcal{L}_{HA})\,cos\theta+v_{V}tsin\theta$ ($Q.20$)
where ∠HA is the angle between aircraft heading and azimuth angles, θ is elevation angle, vH and vV denote the aircraft horizontal and vertical velocity, respectively. All velocities and angles in (Q.20) are of course time dependent, but their time variation is generally slow. For the small values of elevation angle in the measurements (few degrees) and with very small vertical velocity, (Q.20) can be simplified to a two dimensional approximation in the horizontal plane as 

$R\cong vtcos(\mathcal{L}_{HA})$
where v denotes the combined or horizontal velocity. Shadowing can be added (in dB) to path loss. Note that if the two-ray or log-distance path loss models (Q.8)-(Q.10) are used, the terms F, B, X, and *a(R)* should not be used since these pertain to headings straight toward or away from the GS. The remaining terms in those models are valid, and can be augmented with *Rayleigh* small scale fading if desired (i.e., *a(R)* becomes a Rayleigh random process), since it was found that during shadowing, small scale fading was very well modeled as having Rayleigh statistics. To model shadowing, one creates a product process *Sf(t)*, where S denotes the random magnitude of the shadowing loss in dB, and *f(t)* is a shaping function versus time t with maximum value of one. To this is added Rayleigh fading (in dB, 20log10*[a(R)]*). The temporal support of *f(t)* is the shadowing duration DS, which may also be selected randomly, or can be based upon the flight geometry or the measured statistics. Representative results for S and DS are provided in Figures Q-15 and Q-23, and Table Q-3; overall distributions of S and DS appear in Figures Q-24-Q-2610 [34]. As noted, the statistics for the C Band maximum shadowing depths contain some truncated values (hence values in Figure Q-26 can slightly underestimate S). For the shaping function *f(t)* the cubic spline was selected. This function is a least squares third-order polynomial fit that passes through three "control" points (ti, f(ti)){(0,0), (0.5,1), (1,0)}. The cubic spline interpolation is given by [36], 

$$f(t)=a_{i}(t-t_{i})^{3}+b_{i}(t-t_{i})^{2}+c_{i}(t-t_{i})+d_{i}\qquad\qquad(Q.22)$$
where ai, bi, ci and di are coefficients defined by control points (ti, f(ti)). Figure Q-27 shows this function as a percentage of DS. The models here describe combined path loss and shadowing as a function of time. If detailed geometric information for a simulated flight is available, then a modified version of the algorithm must be used, in which shadowing depth S and duration DS both depend 
 
upon roll and heading angles as previously described. The time-based algorithm is also "vector-based," in that complete vectors of the required variables are generated in their entirety within several algorithm steps. For most modern simulation platforms, this will not pose any problem in terms of storage, but if such a problem occurs, the algorithm can be modified to work in a loop wherein the required variables are generated sequentially. Also allowed for are multiple (J) shadowing events per simulation, and it is assumed there are no overlapping shadowing events. The path loss plus shadowing model, for *median* shadowing depths, is implemented as follows [34]: 1. Define time vector t=[t0, t1, t2,…, ti-1, ti, ti+1,…, tN]. Actual values of t are arbitrary, but generally the mth time increment tm=tm-tm-1 between any two time values (any m{1, 2, …N}) is a constant t for all m—this is our assumption here. If desired, values of t can be converted to link range R or symbol units as previously described. For a given flight path, this conversion yields a corresponding range vector R=[R0, R1, R2,…, Ri-1, Ri, Ri+1,…, RN]. 2. Compute *PL(t)* according to the desired model (log-distance or CE2R). This yields the vector PL=[PL0, PL1, PL2,…, PLi-1, PLi, PLi+1,…, PLN]. 3. Select the number of shadowing events J. Then select the J airframe shadowing start times tx,j  [t0, tN), j{1, 2, …, j, …, k, …, J}. These can be drawn according to any desired distribution over the flight duration (if any of these random start times are identical, e.g., tx,j=ty,k for any x≠y, re-draw these repeated random start times tx,j so that all start times are distinct). 4. Select the J shadowing duration random variables DS,j from the appropriate Gaussian distribution of Figure Q-24. If any shadowing events overlap (tx,j ty,k t*x+Dj,j*, for y>x), redraw either the start time or duration random variables to remove overlaps. 5. From a distribution specified by Figure Q-25, generate the median airframe shadowing magnitudes Sj in dB. (Alternatively one can generate a roll angle dependent shadowing loss Sj(R) according to (Q.20), which would require specification of a roll vector vs. time.) 
𝑡𝑖−𝑡𝑥,𝑗
6. For each of the J shadowing events, from shape function *f(t)* specified by Figure Q-27 and (Q.22), and the Sj values generated in step 5, set the instantaneous shadowing loss sample values within the shadowing events as 𝑆
𝑗𝑓(
𝐷𝑆,𝑗). Note that the instantaneous shadowing loss is 5 dB at the start and stop points ti=tx,j and ti=tx,j+DS,j since our measured shadowing loss starts and stops at 5 dB11. 

𝑡𝑖−𝑡𝑥,𝑗
7. Apply small scale Rayleigh fading *a(t)* to all the instantaneous shadowing loss samples 
𝑆
𝑗𝑓(
𝐷𝑆,𝑗) created in step 6. During the shadowing events, shadowing loss in decibels is then, 

$L_{S}(t_{i})=S_{j}f(\frac{t_{i}-t_{x,j}}{D_{S,j}})-20log_{10}[a(t_{i})]$ (_Q.23_)
8. The total path loss 𝐿𝑇(𝑡𝑖) = 𝑃𝐿(𝑡𝑖) + 𝐿𝑆(𝑡𝑖), where path loss 𝑃𝐿(𝑡𝑖) is the first two terms in (Q.8) or (Q.9), or the CE2R or FE2R model path loss. 

## Q.5 Summary

This appendix has described the measurement and modeling campaign conducted by NASA Glenn Research Center for gathering data on the air-ground channel. The campaign itself was described, including a discussion of the measurement sites, measurement equipment, and flight tests. A summary of key air-ground channel characteristics was provided, followed by example channel measurement results. The measurement results were used to develop empirical models for the air-ground channel path loss, airframe shadowing, small-scale fading, correlations among signals on the multiple antennas, and high-fidelity wideband models.

## Appendix R Undesired-To-Desired Signal Ratios Introduction

The purpose of this appendix is to develop the rationale for the specification of the RF Emissions Mask and the specifications of Adjacent Channel and Non-Adjacent Channel Interference Rejection.  Both of these depend on how much noise is emitted by a CNPC Link System radio transmitter into adjacent channels within the allocated frequency band(s) and on the maximum expected ratio of the received interference signal level from an Undesired CNPC Link System transmitter to the level of the signal received from the Desired CNPC Link System transmitter, or U/D ratio.  These relationships are established later on in this appendix. 

## Calculation Of Undesired-To-Desired (U/D) Signal Ratios Assumptions

Appendix L provides detailed link budgets illustrating the calculation of the maximum tolerable Undesired (U)-to-Desired (D) signal ratios, or U/D for short. The assumptions made in the calculation of the maximum tolerable U/D ratio are as follows 

1. The worst case/maximum tolerable downlink (Air-to-Ground) U/D ratio occurs 
when the "Desired UA" is at its maximum operational range from its GRS, while the "Undesired UA" that is the source of the interference is as close to the GRS 
that is controlling the "Desired UA" as allowed or possible while remaining 
within RLOS of its own GRS. 
2. Similarly, the worst case/maximum tolerable uplink (Ground-to-Air) U/D ratio 
occurs when the UAS that is experiencing interference is operating as close to an 
interfering "Undesired GRS" as allowed or possible while remaining within 
RLOS of its "Desired GRS" at its maximum operational range. 
3. Maximum tolerable U/D calculations are presented in appendix L for two cases.  
One case assumes the GRSs that control the 'Desired UA" and "Undesired UA" 
are not co-located and the UA ARS are sufficiently far apart so their GRS directional antenna beams are pointed in different directions. In this case the 
"Undesired downlink" signal is assumed to arrive on a sidelobe the victim GRS 
directional antenna and the "Undesired uplink" is assumed to be emitted by a sidelobe of the interfering GRS directional antenna.  The U/D calculations for this first case assume a "Desired link" with maximum operational range of 35 NM. 

The second case assumes the GRSs are co-located or closely located as they might in an airport terminal area, and that the GRS directional antenna beams are pointed in the same direction when the UA under their control are landing or taking-off one behind the other.  In this case the "Undesired downlink" and 
'desired downlink" signals are assumed to arrive on the main beam of the victim GRS directional antenna and the "Undesired uplink" and "Desired uplink" signals are assumed to be emitted by the main beams of 'Undesired GRS" and 'Desired GRS", respectively.  The U/D calculations for this second case assume the "Desired link" maximum operational range is sufficient to support landing operations from an altitude above ground of up to 3000 feet following a glide path of 3º, i.e. a 10 NM operational range". 

4. The maximum tolerable U/D calculations presented in Appendix L also assume 
that operational restrictions (exclusion zones) need to be imposed on the UA to 
 
prevent them from getting too close to "Undesired GRSs" in order to keep the resulting U/D ratio within tolerable levels.  

5. The U/D link budgets in Appendix L show that the minimum distance between a 
UA and an "Undesired GRS" must be greater than 200 feet for UA equipped with 
L Band CNPC systems and greater than 500 feet for UA equipped with C Band CNPC Link systems. The C Band U/D link budgets show that in order to allow 
operation with 500 feet separation between UA and "Undesired GRS", the ARS 
must have a high output power and low output power mode of operation where the low output power setting is 20 dB lower than the high output power setting and that certain restrictions be applied to the deployment of C Band GRS on or near airports.  The implications of these operational restrictions are discussed in Section R.2.2. 
6. The UAS air-to-ground (downlink) and ground-to-air (uplink) links are assumed 
to operate with the maximum transmitter output power required to operate the link reliably at the maximum operating range, so the link margin1 available is a function of the distance between the GRS and its associated UA. 
7. The required link margin is assumed to be that needed to keep outages of 2 
seconds or more down to less than 1 per hour.   
8. The operating link margin includes margin to cope with the Excess Path Loss due 
to multipath, airframe blockage loss, and RF interference from other UASs operating in the area. 
9. The maximum tolerable U/D ratio calculations in Appendix L assume that no 
more than 1 outage of 2 seconds or less per hour occur.  Outages may occur when 
the "Desired downlink" and "Desired uplink" signals fade randomly below their 
free-space propagation expected value and/or when the "Undesired downlink" and 
"Undesired uplink" signals become stronger than their free space propagation 
expected value. Fades of the desired signal of up to 20 dB excess path loss over free space propagation due to multipath fading at both L Band and C Band are assumed and up to 12 dB of airframe blockage loss at C Band and up to 8 dB airframe blockage loss at L Band are also assumed to occur independently from 
the multipath propagation loss.  On the other hand, the "Undesired downlink" and "Undesired uplink" interfering signals are assumed to experience random signal 
level enhancement due to multipath of up to 6 dB at both L Band C Band and random signal enhancement due to ARS antenna pattern gain variation of up to 3 dB independently of the multipath enhancement also at both L Band and C Band. 
10. The excess path loss due to multipath, the airframe blockage loss and RF 
interference signal enhancement due to multipath and/or aircraft antenna gain dependence on takeoff angle/angle of arrival are assumed to vary randomly as the 
                                                     


geometry of the link changes as the two UASs move and maneuver.  Therefore, the combined losses due to these three effects are treated statistically and are assumed to be uncorrelated.  That is, it is assumed that the deep fading, large airframe blockage and RFI enhancement due to multipath constructive interference and higher antenna gains in certain directions do not all occur at the same time.  

11. Appendix K provides data that relates the excess path loss margin loss required 
for a given desired link availability and terrain/obstacle clearance height (see Figure R-1).   
12. Appendix K also provides predicted antenna gain distributions from which the 
airframe blockage loss can be estimated. 
13. The maximum tolerable U/D calculations in Appendix L assume that there is only 
one "Undesired Interferer" at the minimum allowed distance.  The on-channel interference due to off-channel RF emissions from this "Near Undesired 
Interferer" is allowed to raise the noise floor of the victim receiver by 3 dB.  The 
faded minimum "Desired Signal", Dmin, is assumed to be 10 dB greater than the receiver sensitivity in the absence of interference, Smin, of which 3 dB accounts for the doubling of the mean receiver noise floor by the mean value of the on-channel interference from the single interferer, 1 dB accounts for the sporadic increase of 
the noise floor due to enhancement of the RF interference level above its mean 
value and 6 dB accounts for the ICAO aviation safety margin. 
14. Interference from other UA and GRS within the vicinity is accounted for by 
including the 6 dB ICAO aviation safety margin in the calculation of the minimum "Desired Signal", Dmin. 

## Operational Restrictions/Exclusion Zones

In order to keep the U/D ratios within tolerable values, operational limitations are imposed on the use of CNPC Link Systems to ensure that there is compatible operation when multiple UAS operate in close proximity.  The operational limitations are described in Section 1.6.4 of this MOPS.    

                                                     
 
Figure R-2 provides an illustrated description of the C Band operational restrictions and exclusion zones described in Section 1.6.4 of this MOPS.  The C Band operational restrictions have been determined from the analyses presented in this Appendix and supplemented by the C Band link budgets presented in Appendix L.   
The L Band operational restrictions (maximum range coverage and minimum distance to a GRS) described in Section 1.6.4 of this MOPS are based on the L Band link budgets presented in Appendix L. 

## Air-To-Ground U/D Ratio Calculation

The general expression for the Air-to-Ground U/D ratio is as follows: [U/D]air-to-gnd = {EIRPU(50) + [ηant]U –FS-Loss(dU) - [ηmpath]U + Ggnd(θU)} 
 
i. {EIRPD(50) + [ηant]D - FS-Loss(dD) - [ηmpath]D + Ggnd(θD)}   (R-1) 
 
where  
EIRPU(50) is the EIRP in dBm or on-channel EIRP peak spectral density in dBm/kHz of the undesired interfering ARS transmitter assuming an average/median aircraft antenna gain minus installation/cabling loss [ηant]U is the random variation in ARS antenna gain resulting from antenna pattern gain variations versus the radiation angle of the signal transmitted by the undesired ARS as well as reflections or blockage of the signal by airframe structures.  The antenna gain variations may result in increased or decreased gain depending on the particular radiation angle towards the victim GRS.  The gain variations relative to the average/median gain in dB are assumed to be Gaussian distributed with zero mean. The standard deviation σant of the gain increase above the mean and the gain reduction below the mean are not necessarily equal 
 
FS-Loss(dU) is the free space propagation loss in dB between the undesired ARS and the desired GRS which is a function of the distance dU between the undesired ARS and the desired GRS  
[ηmpath]U is the random variation in the path loss between the undesired ARS and the victim receiving GRS due to multipath reflections from terrain and structures on the ground.  This random variation in path loss due to multipath can result is path loss reduction when the multipath adds constructively or an increase in the path loss when the multipath adds destructively (fading).  The path loss variations about the free space loss are assumed to be Gaussian distributed with zero mean.  The standard deviation σmpath of the excess path loss above free-space loss and the path loss reduction below the free space loss are not equal Ggnd(θU) is the victim GRS antenna gain in dBi in the direction θU of the undesired ARS EIRPD(50) is the EIRP in dBm or on-channel EIRP peak spectral density in dBm/kHz of the desired ARS assuming an average/median aircraft antenna gain minus installation/cabling loss [ηant]D is the random variation in ARS antenna gain resulting from antenna pattern gain variations versus the radiation angle of the signal transmitted by the desired ARS as well as reflections or blockage of the signal by airframe structures.  The antenna gain variations may result in increased or decreased gain depending on the particular radiation angle towards the desired GRS.  The gain variations relative to the average/median gain in dB are assumed to be Gaussian distributed with zero mean. The standard deviation σant of the gain increase above the mean and the gain reduction below the mean are not necessarily equal FS-Loss(dD) is the free space propagation loss in dB between the desired ARS and its GRS which is a function of the distance dD between the desired ARS and its GRS. [ηmpath]D is the random variation in the path loss between the desired ARS and the receiving desired GRS due to multipath reflections from terrain and structures on the ground.  This random variation in path loss due to multipath can result is path loss reduction when the multipath adds constructively or an increase in the path loss when the multipath adds destructively (fading).  The path loss variations about the free space loss are assumed to be Gaussian distributed with zero mean.  The standard deviation σmpath of the excess path loss above free-space loss and the path loss reduction below the free space loss are not equal Ggnd(θD) is the desired GRS antenna gain in dBi in the direction θD of the desired ARS 
As seen from (R-1) the [U/D]air-to-gnd ratio is a random quantity with contributions from several random gain/loss components which are statistically independent/uncorrelated. Hence adding or subtracting their extreme (best or worst case) values is not appropriate as these extreme values do not all happen at the same time.  Instead, the appropriate approach is determining the distribution of the sum (or subtraction) of the various random components.  Since it has been assumed that they are uncorrelated Gaussian random variables with zero mean, the distribution of their sum (or subtraction) is also Gaussian with zero mean and standard deviation equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the standard deviations of the individual random components.   
 
Also, it should be noted that the random U/D ratio increases above its mean value when the random components that contribute to the numerator in the ratio get larger (undesired signal enhancement) and when the random components that contribute to the denominator get smaller (desired signal excess loss).  Therefore, this fact coupled with the convolution of the random signal components results in the following expression for the [U/D]air-to-gnd ratio exceeded p% of the time 

[U/D(p)]air-to-gnd = [U/D(50)]air-to-gnd +  {[f(p) σant-max]U2  + [f(p) σm-enh(p)]U2  + [f(p) σant-min(p)]D2 + [f(p) σEPL(p)]D2}1/2        = {EIRPU(50) - EIRPD(50)} + 20 LOG10 (dD /dU) - {Ggnd(θD) - Ggnd(θU)}       + {[f(p) σant-max]U2 + [f(p) σm-enh(p)]U2 + [f(p) σant-min(p)]D2 + [f(p) σEPL(p)]D2}1/2 (R-2) 
where  
[f(p) σant-max]U is the undesired ARS antenna gain variation above the mean in dB not exceeded p % of the time (assumed to be 3 dB for p = 99.8% at both L Band and C Band) [f(p) σm-enh]U is the undesired RF interference level enhancement due to multipath not exceeded p % of the time (assumed to be 6 dB for p = 99.8% at both L Band and C Band) [f(p) σant-min]D is the desired ARS antenna gain variation below the mean in dB not exceeded p % of the time (assumed to be 8 dB for p = 99.8% at L Band and 12 dB at C Band) [f(p) σEPL]D is the desired signal excess path loss above free-space loss in dB not exceeded p % of the time (assumed to be 20 dB for p = 99.8% at both L Band and C Band) 
The first term in (R-2) is the difference between the EIRPs of the desired and undesired ARS.  A simplification occurs if it is assumed that both aircraft transmit with equal average EIRP or on-channel EIRP peak spectral density which is not unreasonable since they both have to meet the same off-channel EIRP spectral density mask.  In this case the contribution from the difference in EIRPs is zero. The second term in (R-2) is the difference of the free space propagation losses of the desired and undesired signals which depends on the distances from the desired ARS and undesired ARS to the victim/desired GRS.  The worst case U/D ratio occurs when the desired ARS is at its maximum operational distance from its desired GRS and the undesired ARS is as close to the victim GRS as allowed by the operational restrictions. The third term is the difference in GRS antenna gain in the direction of the desired signal and the direction of the undesired signal.  Since the GRS will typically need to employ directional antennas to be able to provide coverage to ranges of 35 NM or longer, the antenna will be pointed in the direction of the desired signal.  When the desired ARS is at 
 
 
its maximum range of 35 NM the antenna will be pointing low towards the horizon while the undesired GRS which will be restricted from flying below a minimum height above ground to prevent excessive interference to other GRSs.  In this case, the victim GRS directional antenna should be able to provide some rejection of the undesired interfering signal.  The U/D link budgets in Appendix L and the more detailed analysis presented in this appendix assume that for the case in which the GRSs that control the 'Desired UA" 
and "Undesired UA" are not co-located and the UA ARS are sufficiently far apart so their GRS directional antenna beams are pointed in different directions, the rejection provided by the victim GRS is at least equal to the difference in gain between the main lobe and the gain of the first sidelobe of the GRS antenna, or about 17 dB. The fourth term in brackets can be thought of as the link margin that is needed to cope with airframe blockage, excess path loss due to multipath of the desired signal and enhancement of the interfering signal also due to undesired ARS antenna gain and multipath.  Note that this margin is not all of the link margin that is needed to maintain communications.  There needs to be additional margin to allow for the raising of the noise floor due to the nearest interferer as well as the aggregate interference that may occur from other ARSs that may be farther away. Note that except for size/beamwidth of the ground antennas and the airframe blockage loss, all of the other terms in the U/D ratio are the same for both L Band and C Band. Hence the remainder of the discussions in this Appendix will be focused on C Band operation. 

## Ground-To-Air U/D Ratio Calculation

The general expression for the Ground-to-Air U/D ratio is similar.  Hence it is given by: 

[U/D] gnd-to-air = {EIRPU(θU) - FS-Loss(dU) - [ηmpath]U + Gair(50) + [ηant]U} 
- {EIRPD(θD)  - FS-Loss(dD) - [ηmpath]D + Gair(50) + [ηant]D}     (R-3) 
 
where  
EIRPU(θU) is the EIRP in dBm or EIRP peak spectral density in dBm/kHz of the undesired interfering GRS transmitter in the direction θU of the ARS that is the victim of its interference FS-Loss(dU) is the free space propagation loss in dB between the undesired GRS and the victim ARS which is a function of the distance dU between the undesired GRS and the victim ARS [ηmpath]U is the random variation in the path loss between the victim ARS and the undesired GRS due to multipath reflections from terrain and structures on the ground.  This random variation in path loss due to multipath can result is path loss reduction when the multipath adds constructively or an increase in the path loss when the multipath adds destructively (fading).  The path loss variations about the free space loss are assumed to be Gaussian distributed with zero mean.  The standard deviation σmpath of the excess path loss above free-space loss and the path loss reduction below the free space loss are not equal Gair(50) is the average/median desired ARS antenna gain in dBi [ηant]U is the random variation in the victim ARS antenna gain resulting from antenna pattern gain variations versus the radiation angle of the signal arriving 
 
from the undesired ARS as well as reflections or blockage of the signal by airframe structures.  The antenna gain variations may result in increased or decreased gain depending on the particular radiation angle towards the undesired GRS.  The gain variations relative to the average/median gain in dB are assumed to be Gaussian distributed with zero mean. The standard deviation σant of the gain increase above the mean and the gain reduction below the mean are not necessarily equal EIRPD(θD) is the EIRP in dBm or EIRP peak spectral density in dBm/kHz of the desired GRS transmitter in the direction θD of the desired ARS FS-Loss(dD) is the free space propagation loss in dB between the desired GRS and its desired ARS which is a function of the distance dD between the desired ARS and desired GRS [ηmpath]D is the random variation in the path loss between the desired ARS and the transmitting desired GRS due to multipath reflections from terrain and structures on the ground.  This random variation in path loss due to multipath can result is path loss reduction when the multipath adds constructively or an increase in the path loss when the multipath adds destructively (fading).  The path loss variations about the free space loss are assumed to be Gaussian distributed with zero mean. The standard deviation σmpath of the excess path loss above free-space loss and the path loss reduction below the free space loss are not equal [ηant]D is the random variation in ARS antenna gain resulting from antenna pattern gain variations versus the radiation angle towards the desired GRS as well as reflections or blockage of the signal by airframe structures.  The antenna gain variations may result in increased or decreased gain depending on the particular radiation angle towards the desired GRS.  The gain variations relative to the average/median gain in dB are assumed to be Gaussian distributed with zero mean. The standard deviation σant of the gain increase above the mean and the gain reduction below the mean are not necessarily equal As in the case of the [U/D]air-to-gnd ratio, the [U/D]gnd-to-air ratio is also a random quantity that depends on the same random quantities.  Therefore, following the same arguments it can be shown that the [U/D]gnd-to-air ratio exceeded p% of the time is given by 

 [U/D(p)] gnd-to-air = [U/D(50)]gnd-to-air +   {[f(p) σant-max]U2  + [f(p) σm-enh(p)]U2     + [f(p) σant-min(p)]D2 + [f(p) σEPL(p)]D2}1/2  = {EIRPU(θU) - EIRPD(θD)} + 20 LOG10 (dD /dU)      + {[f(p) σant-max]U2 + [f(p) σm-enh(p)]U2 + [f(p) σant-min(p)]D2 + [f(p) σEPL(p)]D2}1/2 (R-4) 
where all terms have been previously defined. The first term in (R-4) is the difference between the EIRPs of the desired and undesired GRS.  If as in the case of the air-to-ground case, it is assumed that GRS transmit with equal EIRP or on-channel EIRP peak spectral density in the direction of maximum EIRP, which is not unreasonable since they both have to meet the same off-channel EIRP spectral density mask, then this term reduces to the difference in GRS antenna gain in the direction of the undesired/victim ARS and that in the direction of maximum gain which 
 
corresponds to the antenna gain in the direction of the desired ARS.  That is, this term becomes equal to the third term in (R-2). The second term in (R-4) is the difference of the free space propagation losses of the desired and undesired signals which depends on the distances from the desired GRS and undesired GRS to the victim/desired ARS. The third term in brackets can be thought of as the link margin that is needed to cope with airframe blockage, excess path loss due to multipath of the desired signal and enhancement of the interfering signal also due to undesired ARS antenna gain and multipath.     

## Near-Far U/D Interference Calculation For Various Scenarios R.2.5.1 Desired And Undesired Co-Located Ground Radio Systems

Figure R-3 illustrates the interference scenario when two Ground Radio Systems are colocated one next to each other or on the same tower as would be the case in a networked solution where the two CNPC links use different frequency allocations.  This scenario is applicable to operations in UA airports where two or more UAs are conducting taxi, takeoff and landing operations.  The worst case U/D occurs when one UA is initiating a landing operation starting from an altitude and range which are assumed to be at the maximum operational range from its desired GRS, assumed to be 3500 feet and 11 NM respectively, while the other UA is completing its landing and it is at the nearest allowed operational range from its GRS and the co-located GRS that is controlling the other UA, assumed to be 500 feet.  And assuming the two UA are landing on the same runway, the two GRSs have their antenna beams pointed in the same direction, so the "Desired" and 
"Undesired" downlink and uplink signals are received / transmitted on the GRS antenna main beams. 

## Ground-To-Air U/D Calculation:

In this case both aircraft are at equal distances from both their desired and undesired Ground Radio Systems, that is dU = dD regardless of which link is considered. Assuming that both the short 500 ft. link 1 and the long 11 NM link 2 experience the same range of multipath loss/enhancement variations and ARS antenna/airframe blockage loss/enhancement variations, using the expression in (R-4) results in the following U/D ratio for link 1 (and link 2) [U/D(99.8)] gnd-to-air= 0 +20 LOG10 (500 /500) + {(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2 +(20)2}1/2 = 24.3 dB [U/D(99.8)] gnd-to-air = 0 +20 LOG10 (11/11) + {(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2  (20)2}1/2 = 24.3 dB 

## Air-To-Ground U/D Calculation:

In this case, link 2 where the aircraft is farthest away from its GRS at 11 NM while the other aircraft is at only 500 ft. from its desired and undesired GRS results in the worst case U/D, while link 1 experiences negligible U/D.  Using the expression in (R-2), the air-toground U/D for link 2 assuming both aircraft are transmitting with equal EIRP is given by [U/D(99.8)] air-to-gnd = 0 + 20 Log10 (11/0.082) - 0 + {(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2  (20)2}1/2 =  66.9 dB 
 
where dU = 500 ft. = 0.082 NM. Comparing the uplink U/D ratio with the downlink U/D ratio it can be seen that the latter is 42.6 dB greater than the former and it fact it is too large.  In order to reduce the 
 
downlink U/D to a more manageable value of less than 50 dB, the UA ARS need to support a high output power and low output power mode where the high output power is used when ARS is operating above 500 feet during takeoff and landing operations and a low output power mode which is 20 dB lower than the high output power is used when operating at or below 500 feet as illustrated in Figure R-4. 

 
Using the expression in (R-2), the air-to-ground U/D for link 2 now becomes [U/D(99.8)] air-to-gnd = -20 +20 Log10 (11/0.082) - 0 +{(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2  (20)2}1/2 =  46.9 dB To ensure that the downlink U/D ratio remains below 50 dB throughout all ranges of high output power and low output power modes of operation, it is necessary to consider the worst case scenarios where both UA 1 and UA 2 are both operating in high output power mode (see Figure R-5) and both are operating in low output power mode (see Figure R-6). Using the expression in (R-2), the air-to-ground U/D for Figure R-5 link 2, which assumes both aircraft are transmitting with high output power and UA 1 is at an altitude of 550 ft. at a range of 1.73 NM from GRS 1 and GRS 2, and UA 2 is at a range of 11 NM from GRS 1 and GRS 2, is given by [U/D(99.8)] air-to-gnd = 0 +20 Log10 (11/1.73) - 0 +{(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2  (20)2}1/2 =  40.4 dB Similarly, the air-to-ground U/D for Figure R-6 link 2, which assumes both aircraft are transmitting with low output power and UA 1 is at the minimum range of 500 ft. from GRS 1 and GRS 2, and UA 2 is at an altitude of 500 ft. at a range of 1.572 NM from GRS 1 and GRS 2, is given by [U/D(99.8)] air-to-gnd = 0+20 Log10 (1.572/0.082) –0 +{(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2  (20)2}1/2 = 50 dB 

## R.2.5.2 Ground Radio Systems Separated By Some Distance But Within Line-Of-Sight Of Each Other

We now consider the cases where the GRSs are not co-located and at least one of the UA is conducting its mission at its maximum operational range. Figure R-7 illustrates a scenario where two GRSs that control two different UA are deployed within visible range of each so the aircraft controlled by each GRS can get arbitrarily close to the undesired GRS and interfere with its air-to-ground link or have its ground-to-air link be interfered with. The range of separation distances between GRSs that results in this scenario depends on the height of the GRS antenna towers and the terrain between them.  If the terrain is relatively flat with little variation and the antenna tower heights are less than 60 feet, then the maximum visible range from one GRS to the other is less than 8 NM.  However, if one of the GRS antenna towers is deployed on top of a very tall building or mountain overlooking a lower plateau, the visible range could extend for the entire maximum operating range of their UA.  For example, if one of the GRS towers is on a mountain top at a height of 1800 feet above the terrain below the mountain, the maximum visible range is 45 NM.  To avoid mutual interference, the ARSs must be restricted from operating near the undesired GRS. 

## Ground-To-Air U/D Calculation:

Let us assume the separation distance between the two GRSs is 35 NM with one of the GRS on top of a mountain at a height of 1800 and its associated aircraft is at the minimum height of 2750 feet above the undesired GRS.  And assume the other aircraft is at the maximum operating distance of 35 NM from its desired GRS and sufficiently far away from the undesired GRS so the interference to/from that GRS is not as severe as that resulting from the UA hovering at 2750 feet from the undesired GRS.  Using the expression in (R-4), we get the following U/D ratio for this link [U/D(99.8)] gnd-to-air = - 17.6 +20 Log10 (35/0.453) +{(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2  (20)2}1/2 =  44.4 dB where dU = 2750 ft. = 0.453 NM and where it has been assumed that the GRS antennas have a difference of 17.6 dB in antenna gain in the direction of their desired ARS and undesired ARS. 

## Air-To-Ground U/D Calculation:

Using the expression in (R-2), the air-to-ground U/D for the link with the worst case U/D, we get [U/D(99.8)] air-to-gnd = 0+20 Log10 (35/0.453) –17.6+{(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2  (20)2}1/2 =  44.4 dB where dU = 2750 ft. = 0.453 NM. 

## R.2.5.3 Ground Radio Systems Deployed Beyond Line-Of-Sight Of Each Other

Figure R-8 illustrates a scenario where two Ground Radio Systems are deployed beyond visual range of each other so the aircraft controlled by each GRS can no longer get arbitrarily close to the undesired GRS as they must fly at an altitude that is high enough to remain within RLOS of their desired GRS. This scenario would occur when the terrain is relatively flat with little variation and the antenna tower heights of the GRS are low enough so that the horizon distances from the towers are much less than the maximum operational range of their UASs and the separation distance between GRSs is also less than the maximum operational range. 


## Ground-To-Air U/D Calculation:

Assuming the separation distance between the two GRS is again 35 NM but this time both UA are at normal altitudes with one UA directly above an undesired GRS and 35 NM away but within RLOS of its desired GRS.  It is assumed that the clearance height above the terrain is such that a 1.25º above the horizon will result in a clear LOS.  Then the altitude of this UA above the undesired GRS right below it is 5,274 feet (0.868 NM).  The other UA is at the maximum operating distance of 35 NM from its desired GRS and sufficiently far away from the undesired GRS so the interference to/from that GRS is not as severe as that resulting from the UA hovering at 5,274 feet from the undesired GRS. Using the expression in (R-4), we get the following U/D ratio for this link [U/D(99.8)] gnd-to-air = - 17.6 +20 Log10 (35/0.868) +{(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2  (20)2}1/2 =  38.8 dB where dU = 5274 ft. = 0.868 NM.   
 

## Air-To-Ground U/D Calculation With No Power Control:

Using the expression in (R-2), the air-to-ground U/D for the link with the worst case U/D, we get 
[U/D(99.8)] air-to-gnd = 0+20 Log10 (35/0.868) –17.6+{(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2  (20)2}1/2 =  38.8 dB 

## R.2.5.4 Ground Radio Systems Far Beyond Line-Of-Sight Of Each Other

Figure R-9 illustrates a scenario where two Ground Radio Systems are deployed beyond the operational range of their UA and beyond visual range of each other so the UA controlled by each GRS cannot get arbitrarily close to the undesired GRS as they must fly at an altitude that is high enough to remain within RLOS of its desired GRS.   
 
 
The UA must be within RLOS of both the desired and undesired GRS in order to interfere. This is a function of the maximum operating altitude of the UA.  If the maximum altitude of the UA is such that it is not within RLOS of the undesired GRS, then there is no interference and the two GRS could operate using the same spectrum assignment. 

## Ground-To-Air U/D Calculation:

Let us assume the separation distance between the two GRS is 140 NM and that one UA is at the maximum operating range of 35 NM from its GRS while the other GRS has strayed 
 
as far away as its maximum operating altitude allows it to fly away from its GRS and has gotten as close as possible to the undesired GRS.  When the maximum operating altitude is 12,800 feet, the aircraft can fly as far away as 70 NM from its desired GRS and it can also be 70 NM from the undesired GRS, that is, this GRS is half-way between the great circle path separating both GRSs.  The aircraft that has strayed 70 NM away from its desired GRS experiences 6 dB more free space loss than planned and therefore it can only remain under the control of its GRS if it is experiencing 6 dB less fading excess path loss or interference.  Using the expression in (R-4) with an additional term that accounts for the 6 dB reduction in link excess path loss, we get the following U/D ratio 
 
[U/D(99.8)] gnd-to-air = - 17.6 +20 Log10 (70/70) +{(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2  (20)2}1/2 -6 =  0.7 dB 

## Air-To-Ground U/D Calculation:

Using the expression in (R-2) for the link with the worst case U/D ratio, we get [U/D(99.8)] air-to-gnd = 0 +20 Log10 (35/70) - 17.6 + {(3)2 +(6)2 +(12)2  (20)2}1/2 =  0.7 dB  

## Summary Of U/D Ratios Vs Ground Radio System Separation Distance

Figure R-10 plots the calculated Ground-to-Air U/D ratio (solid blue) and Air-to-Ground U/D ratio (solid red) as a function of the separation distance between a pair of Ground Radio Systems.  The U/D calculations assume a maximum operational range of 35 NM for CNPC links and two maximum operating altitudes of 12,000 feet and 30,000 assuming a minimum operational height of 2750 feet. These U/D plots apply to GRSs that control UAS operations beyond 10 NM and which are not controlling takeoff and landing operations with other co-located GRSs. The plots show that both the Ground-to-Air U/D ratio and Air-to-Ground U/D ratio are in the 19 to 44 dB range for GRS separation distances up to 100-175 NM depending on the maximum operating altitude of the UA (12,000 to 30,000 feet).  The U/D ratios remain above -15 dB for GRS separation distances up to 250-350 NM again depending on the maximum operating altitude of the UA.  This behavior of the U/D ratio as a function of GRS separation distance illustrates potential criteria that may be used to define minimum frequency assignment separation criteria as discussed in Section R.3 and the requirement for adjacent and non-adjacent channel rejection requirements as discussed in Section R.4. The plots also show that frequency assignments can be reused by Ground Radio Systems that are separated by more than 250 NM if their UA maximum operational altitude is less than 12,000 feet.  If their UA operational altitude is less than 30,000 feet then frequency assignments can be reused by Ground Radio Systems that are separated by more than 350 NM. 

 

## U/D Ratio Relationship To Transmitter Emissions Mask And Frequency Assignments

The emissions mask of a C Band CNPC Link System radio transmitter defined in Section 2.2.1.6.2.1.2 is illustrated in Figure R-11.  These emissions levels are related to the U/D ratios calculated in Section R.2.3 as explained below. 

## Emissions Noise Floor Versus U/D Ratio

The emissions noise floor power density of a CNPC Link System radio transmitter must not degrade the receiver sensitivity of a CNPC Link System radio receiver that has been assigned a channel that is more than 2C kHz away from the emitter's channel by more than 3 dB when the offending CNPC Link System radio transmitter is operating close enough to the victim CNPC Link System radio receiver to result in worst case interference.  A formal definition of the worst case interference that can be supported when the emissions noise floor of the transmitters satisfies the emissions mask in Section 2.2.1.6.2 is given below If the emissions of a transmitter within its assigned channel have a peak power density of E dBm/kHz, then its off-channel emissions noise floor must be -65 dBc to comply with the emissions mask.  This also implies that in order to not degrade the sensitivity of a nearby victim receiver by more than 3 dB, the received off-channel emissions from the worst case interference at the input to the victim receiver must not raise the noise floor of the victim receiver by more than 3 dB, i.e. the desired signal-to-noise plus on-channel interference I must satisfy  

[D/(N + I)]${}_{\rm min}$ = [D/2N] = [D/2I]${}_{\rm min}$ = [D/I]${}_{\rm min}$ - 3 dB $\geq$ [E/N${}_{\rm o}$]${}_{\rm req}$ + 6 dB (R-5)
where 
[D/I]min is the minimum tolerable desired signal-to-on-channel interference produced by the of-channel emissions from the near undesired UAS interference [Es/No]req = [STs/No]req = [S/NoRs]req is the minimum energy per modulation symbol-tonoise density ratio, or equivalently the signal-to-noise ratio, S/N, measured in a bandwidth equal to the modulation symbol rate, Rs, that is required to achieve  errorfree demodulation and decoding of the required number of the received CNPC subframe bursts and the 6 dB factor in (R-5) is the ICAO aviation safety margin. The U/D link budgets in Appendix L assume, [Es/No]req = 4.5 dB including a 1 dB implementation loss margin.  Therefore, the minimum tolerable desired signal-to-onchannel interference ratio, [D/I/]min, must satisfy the following minimum protection factor: 

[D/I]${}_{\rm min}\geq$ [E${}_{\rm s}$/N${}_{\rm o}$]${}_{\rm req}+9$ dB = 13.5 dB (R-6)
The minimum tolerable [D/I]min ratio are related to the maximum tolerable [U/D]max ratio as follows below. Firstly, note that the on-channel interference, I, resulting from the undesired interferer's off-channel emissions are noise-like and have mean power spectral density, Io. Therefore, the on-channel interference power measured in a bandwidth equal to the victim receiver's modulation symbol rate, Rs, is I = IoRs, or in dBm by 

I in dBm = I${}_{\rm o}$ + 10 LOG${}_{10}$ (R${}_{\rm s}$)
where Io is in dBm/kHz and Rs is in kilo-symbols per second. Secondly, the received on-channel interference power spectral density, Io, is related to the received off-channel undesired interferer peak power spectral density, Erpeak, by the following relationship imposed by the emissions spectral mask defined in Section 2.2.1.6.2 and illustrated in Figure R-6 for the C Band case 

$\rm I_{o}$ in dBm/kHz = $\rm E_{peak}-65$
 
Thirdly, the received off-channel undesired peak power spectral density, Erpeak, is related to the received off-channel undesired signal power, U, by 

E${}_{\rm peak}$ in dBm/kHz = U - 10 LOG${}_{10}$ (R${}_{\rm s}$) + 7 (R-9)
where the factor of 7 dB is a modulation-dependent factor that relates the peak power spectral density of the interfering waveform to an equivalent waveform that spreads its total power U uniformly over a bandwidth equal to the modulation symbol rate of the victim receiver.  For the case in which the interferer employs GMSK modulation, the ratio of peak power spectral density to an equivalent uniform power spectral density has been determined to be 7 dB. Combining the relationships in (R-7), (R-8) and (R-9) we get the following relationship between on-channel interference power, I, in dBm and off-channel undesired interference power, U, also in dBm 

I = U + 7 - 65 = U - 58 (R-10)
where the two 10 LOG10(Rs) factors in (R-7) and (R-9) cancel each other. Substitution of (R-10) into (R-6) provides the required relationship between the minimum tolerable [D/I]min ratio and the maximum tolerable [U/D]max ratio, i.e. 

[D/I]${}_{\rm min}$ = -[U/D]${}_{\rm max}$ + 58 dB $\geq$ [E/N${}_{\rm o}$]${}_{\rm req}$ + 9 dB = 13.5 dB (R-11)
which implies that the maximum tolerable U/D ratio at C Band is 

|           | [U/D]   |
|-----------|---------|
| max       |         |
| < 44.5 dB | (R-12)  |

At L Band the emissions power spectral density floor is -75 dBc relative to the peak power spectral density.  Therefore, following the same arguments/analysis, it can be shown that the maximum tolerable U/D ratio at L Band is 

[U/D]${}_{\rm max}<54.5$ dB

## Adjacent Channel Emissions Versus U/D Ratio

The assigned channel bandwidth of C kHz defines the minimum spacing that two CNPC links can be assigned as illustrated below in Figure R-12 below. In order for two CNPC links to be assigned adjacent spectrum, their emissions into adjacent channels and the geographical separation between the two UAS links must result in low enough undesiredto-desired signal-ratios, [U/D]adj-chan.  This is explained more formally below. 

 
 
If the emissions of a CNPC Link System radio transmitter within its assigned channel have peak power spectral density of E dBm/kHz, then its adjacent-channel emissions must be - 40 dBc to comply with the emissions mask. Additionally, the adjacent channel U/D ratio, [U/D]adj-chan,  at the input to the victim receiver must not raise the noise floor of the victim receiver by more than 3 dB and allow for a 6 dB ICAO aviation safety margin. Remembering that the C Band emissions power spectral density floor relative to the peak power spectral density, E, are -65 dBc, we get the following relationship for maximum adjacent channel U/D ratio at C Band 

[U/D]adj-chan = [U/D]max - [65 -40] dB < 44.5 -25 = 19.5 dB 
(R-14) 

Similarly, since the L Band emissions peak power spectral density floor relative to the peak power spectral density, E, are -75 dBc, we get 

[U/D]adj-chan = [U/D]max - [75 -40] dB < 54.5 -35 = 19.5 dB 
(R-15) 

## Frequency Assignment Minimum Spacing Versus U/D Ratio And Grs Separation Distance

Table R-1 below defines the terms and groups UAS CNPC links into three categories depending on the separation distance between their GRSs and their maximum operating altitude. Closely Located UAS CNPC links are those links where their GRSs are too close to each other so that adjacent channel assignments are not possible.  The minimum spacing for frequency assignments is shown on the last column. Far Apart UAS CNPC links are those links where their GRSs are far enough apart to result is low enough mutual interference so they can be assigned adjacent channels. And Very Far Apart UAS CNPC links are those links where their GRSs are far enough apart to allow reuse of the same frequency assignments.

## Frequency Assignment Algorithm

An illustration of how a search for a suitable spectrum assignment might work is shown in Figure R-13. The idea is to place the location of the new GRS (tower with red background) on a map that also shows the locations of other GRS. Then two different circles centered on the location of the new GRS may be drawn.  The radius of the inner (purple) circle would identify all those GRS whose frequency assignments must satisfy the criteria for minimum spacing between closely located GRSs while the outer (light colored) doughnut would identify all those GRS whose frequency assignments are candidates for an adjacent channel assignment for the new UAS link. 

## Relationship Between U/D Ratios, Receiver Sensitivity And Off-Channel Interference Rejection

When interference from an undesired CNPC link signal is present at the input to a CNPC Link System radio receiver, the performance of the receiver will be affected by two different mechanisms: one source of performance degradation is the due to the presence of a very strong undesired signal while the victim receiver is receiving a weak signal from its desired transmitter and the other is due to off-channel emissions from the undesired interfering transmitter which fall within the operating channel that the victim receiver is tuned to.  The level of the undesired off-channel emissions is proportional and relative to the strength of the undesired signal while the level of the maximum tolerable (or worst case) undesired signal relative to the desired signal depends on the spacing between the operating/assigned channels to the desired and undesired signals.  Therefore, two different cases need to be considered: one case is when the channels assigned to the undesired and desired are not adjacent to each other and the other is when the two signals occupy adjacent channels. 

## Non-Adjacent Channel Interference Rejection

The case of non-adjacent channel interference at C Band is illustrated in Figure R-14 where a strong undesired (red) CNPC link signal is received on a channel that is not adjacent to the channel assigned to the desired (blue) CNPC link signal with a frequency spacing equal to the smallest non-adjacent channel assignment possible (see Table R-1 in Section R.3.3). 


Also because the channels include guard bands for Doppler and transmitter frequency tolerance, it is assumed that the desired and undesired carrier (or center) frequencies are shifted towards the edge of the assigned channels so as to leave no guard band.  And it is assumed that the signal strength of the desired signal relative to that of the undesired signal is equal to the maximum expected U/D ratio for non-adjacent channel assignments (see Table R-1 in Section R.3.3). This therefore represents the worst case non-adjacent channel interference condition. The worst case non-adjacent channel interference Umax should not degrade the receiver sensitivity, Smin, by more than 3 dB and allow for an additional 6 dB of ICAO safety margin.  In other words when the worst case interference Umax is present at the input to the receiver, the minimum detectable desired signal Dmin should be no greater than twice the minimum detectable signal, Smin, when interference is not present plus 6 dB for ICAO safety margin.  This occurs when the off-channel emissions from the undesired signal that fall within the passband (green receiver selectivity filter) of the desired signal receiver have a level that is equal to the noise generated internally within the receiver as illustrated in Figure R-9. Therefore the amount of non-adjacent channel rejection (NACR) that the receiver selectivity filter should provide at a frequency offset from its center frequency that is equal 
 
to the minimum frequency spacing between non-adjacent channels should knock the interference down to a level that is lower than the receiver noise floor as illustrated in Figure R-14, i.e. 

 

NACR dB $>$ [U/D]${}_{\rm max}$ + [2S${}_{\rm min}$ / N] + 6 dB = [U/D]${}_{\rm max}$ dB + [E${}_{\rm s}$ /N${}_{\rm o}$]${}_{\rm req}$+ 9 dB = [NACR dB $>$ 44.5 + 4.5 + 9 dB = 58 dB (R-16)

## Adjacent Channel Interference Rejection

Similarly, Figure R-15 illustrates the case where the undesired (red) interfering CNPC link signal occupies a channel that is adjacent to the channel occupied by the desired (blue) CNPC link signal. 

 
U/D ratio, [U/D]adj-chan, when the GRSs of UAS links that are assigned adjacent channels are far enough apart (see Sec R.3.2). U/D ratio, [U/D]adj-chan, when the GRSs of UAS links that are assigned adjacent channels are far enough apart (see Sec R.3.2). The worst case adjacent channel interference Uadj-chan should also not degrade the receiver sensitivity, Smin, by more than 3 dB and allow for an additional 6 dB of ICAO aviation safety margin.  Therefore using the same argument as for NACR, the amount of adjacent channel rejection (ACR) that the receiver selectivity filter should provide at a frequency offset from its center frequency that is equal to the minimum frequency spacing between 
 
adjacent channels should knock the interference down to a level that is lower than the receiver noise floor as illustrated in Figure R-15, i.e. 

ACR dB > [U/D]adj-chan + [2Smin / N] + 6 dB =  [U/D]adj-chan dB + [Es /No]req + 9 dB 
 
ACR dB > 19.5 + 4.5 + 9 dB = 33 dB      (R-17) 

## Adjacent Channel Interference Rejection Versus Transmitter Off-Channel Emissions

In summary, from the illustrations in Figure R-14 and Figure R-15, it should be clear that CNPC Link System radio receiver NACR and ACR specifications are tightly coupled to the transmitter mask specifications for the off-channel emissions and should exceed them by an amount such that the receiver performance is ultimately limited only (mostly) by the on-channel noise emitted by the interferer. 

                                                     
 

## Appendix S Validation Of The Cnpc Link System'S Operational Capability With Flight Test Data Introduction

This Appendix takes the flight test data from Appendix O and uses it to provide a validation that the normative requirements, i.e., those contained in Section 2.0 of this MOPS and that are associated with the operating range and data rate capabilities of the CNPC Link System, can support UA operation at the ranges and altitudes which were envisaged by SC-228 as being of interest to UAS designers and operators while at the same time also supporting Subframe Error Rates that are anticipated to be adequate to allow for safe and efficient UAS operation. Although certain ranges, altitudes and data rates are described in this MOPS, it was SC- 228's expectation that other broader operational capabilities can also be supported using the normative requirements contained in this MOPS. The flight tests described in Appendix O have been used  in Appendix K to assess the temporal characteristics of the fading (Fade Duration and Interfade Duration) and were also used in Appendix K to assess the capability of the CNPC Link System to safely support the DAA, Command and Control, ATC/Pilot communication's functions etc. 

In this Appendix the focus is on the CNPC Link System's ability to meet the Subframe Error Rate (1 x 10^-3) requirement that is identified for both the Baseline and Manufacturer-Specific CNPC Link System receiver sensitivities contained in the normative requirements of Section 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 respectively.  This while operating at ranges, data rates and altitudes Appendices K, L, and R envisaged by SC-228 as being of interest to UAS designers and operators. 

## Validation Methodology

The flight tests described in Appendix O were performed with equipment that was verified using the test methods described in Section 2.4 however, due to scheduling constraints, the equipment had to be designed and constructed long before the requirements in this MOPS were fully defined.  As such, there were variances between what was used in the flight tests and what is described in the normative requirements contained in Section 2.0 of this MOPS.  The equipment variances were taken into account when the flight test data was reviewed in the context of this validation.  Since the data rates and propagation path are symmetrical, only the Uplink was considered.  Downlink performance is expected to be very similar, which was confirmed by their being very little difference between the Uplink (blue) and Downlink (red) Signal Strengths on all of the plots in this Appendix as well as within the plots in Appendix O. 

## Equipment Variances

The following two tables show that, from an equipment perspective, the links flown in the flight tests were able to support 22.4dB for L Band and 10.9dB for C Band less overall link attenuation than was used in the development of the relevant normative requirements contained in Section 2.0 of this MOPS. 

Note 1: Table O-2 in Appendix O shows that there are minor (less than +/- 0.4 dB) 
variations in the GRS Tx Power and cable losses used at the different ground test sight locations.  These variations were averaged in Tables S-1 and S-2 as they are minor compared to the much wider variations in the path attenuation (see Appendix L, which includes a total of 21.5dB and 23.3dB of a path attenuation 
 
variability for L Band and C Band respectively) and so do not materially affect the observations.

## Propagation Path Variances

There are certain elements associated with the propagation path, between the ARS and GRS that are included in the Link Budgets in Appendix L, on which the normative link performance determining requirements were based that were not exercised in the flight tests. Although the flight test procedures that are described in Section 3.0 of this MOPS were followed during the flight tests, the 10dB of attenuation, that is prescribed to be added into the GRS antenna cable to account for the ICAO Aviation Safety Margin (6dB) and multiinterferer noise floor increase (4dB), was not fitted so that the Received Signal Strengths and ranges would be closer to those actual experienced by a MOPS compliant CNPC Link System (i.e. one without the equipment variances described above).  Additionally, because the flight tests were predominantly aimed at assessing an appropriate Multipath Fade Margin (for use in the Link Budgets in Appendix L) the test aircraft was deliberately flown in such a way as to minimize any variation in its antenna gain.  However, Appendix L's link budgets allocate a 12dB reduction in installed antenna gain to allow for Airframe Obstruction and Multipath Reflections when the airframe is at certain roll, pitch and yaw angles.  In the Link Budgets, the Airframe Obstruction is root-sum-squared statistically with the Excess Path Loss, so the obstruction and multipath reflection aspects only impacts the analysis by 3.3dB (removing the Airframe Obstruction reduces the 23.3dB combined contribution to 20.0db from the Multipath Fading alone).  Consequently, from a flight test perspective, the link experienced a total of (10dB + 3.3dB) 13.3dB less overall link attenuation than was used in the development of the relevant normative requirements contained in Section 2.0. 

## Accommodating Flight Test Variances In The Validation Of The Relevant Normative Requirements

Overall when the equipment variances are combined with the flight test variances.  The actual equipment flown was able to support: 

 
At L Band -22.4dB + 13.3 dB = -9.1dB i.e. 9.1dB less 
 
At C Band -10.9 dB + 13.3 dB = +2.4dB i.e. 2.4dB more 
link attenuation than was used in the development of the relevant normative requirements contained in Section 2.0 of this MOPS The flight test data in Appendix O contains information on Received Signal Strength and Subframe Error Rate for the various terrain types, altitudes and ranges flown.  All flight tests used Data Class 3 (103.5 kss). To validate that the normative requirements contained in Section 2.0, which are associated with the operating range and data rates of the CNPC Link System, meet the capability of supporting operation at the ranges and altitudes envisaged by SC-228 as being of interest to UAS designers and operators, the flight test data was first adjusted for the variances discussed in the previous section of this Appendix.  Then the objective evidence in the graphs was analyzed to see if it does show that the required Subframe Error Rate was achieved at the ranges and altitudes used during the development of the normative requirements themselves.  If it does, these normative requirements would have been validated as achieving the operational capability. Supporting the various functions identified in Section 1, earlier in this Appendix and in Appendix F (DAA, Command and Control etc.) is expected to require a high level of CNPC Link System availability and continuity (the exact values will depend on many factors, see Appendix K for further discussion).  So if there is any period of greater than 2 seconds (See Appendix K for a derivation of this time) where the Subframe Error Rate is less than that specified in the normative requirements (1 x 10^-3, see Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3), the link will not be operating as required and the normative requirements are not validated as achieving the operational capability. To explore the effects of terrain clearance on the propagation path between the ARS an GRS, flight tests were flown at altitudes where path clearances along the LOS path were both greater than and less than zero.  This means that certain portions of the flight test data were outside the operational envelope that the normative requirements in section 2.0 were intended to support.  Consequently, those portions of the flight tests, where path clearances were less than those envisaged by SC-228, were excluded from the validation assessment. 

## C Band Assessment

Figure S-1 (copied from the C Band Hilly Terrain sequences in Appendix O) shows the Received Signal Strength and Subframe Error Rate as measured during the flight sequence.  It is noted that the Subframe Error Rate is significantly less than the normative requirement of 1 x 10^-3 until the Signal Strength drops to a Receiver Sensitivity level of approximately -117dB (adjusted to account for cable loss).  It also indicates that even when the Signal Strength is reduced by 2.4dB, to account for the combined variances discussed above, there is still adequate signal strength to achieve the required Subframe Error Rate unless the path is obstructed by terrain. 

The left side of the figure is for a 35NM range and a 3,500ft aircraft AGL altitude. Terrain obstruction of the LOS path occurs early in the sequence and for a brief period halfway through the sequence.  The right side of the figure is for 100NM range and a 13,500ft aircraft AGL altitude.  Here terrain obstruction of the LOS path occurs in the third quarter of the sequence. Figure S-2 (copied from the C Band Fresh Water sequences in Appendix O) shows that even when the Signal Strength is reduced by 2.4dB to account for the combined variances discussed above, there is still adequate signal strength to achieve the required 1 x 10^-3 Subframe Error Rate.  In this case there is no obstruction of the LOS path over water due to terrain and the altitudes flown were consequently much lower than those flown for the Hilly Terrain sequences. 

Assessment of all of the other C Band data in Appendix O shows similar characteristics at all ranges flown (35NM, 65NM and 100NM).  After the variances were taken into account, as long as terrain obstruction did not occur, then the required Subframe Error Rate could be met at all ranges and altitudes that were used as the basis for the relevant normative requirements in Section 2.0.  Consequently, for C Band, the flight tests show that the normative requirements were validated 
 
L Band Assessment Figure S-3 (copied from the Low Power L Band Hilly Terrain sequences in Appendix O) shows, on the left side, a flight sequence where the aircraft flew directly away from the location of the GRS at a constant altitude of approximately 11,000ft AGL and on the right side a sequence where the aircraft flew broadside to the GRS at a range of 20NM and an altitude of 11,000ft AGL. Based on the left side plots, when the Signal Strength is increased by 9.1dB to account for the combined variances discussed above, there should be no periods of significant Subframe Error Rate until at least 25NM range.  This is confirmed by the right side plots which show that with a 9.1dB increase in the Signal Strength, to account for the variances, it is unlikely that any Subframe Errors would have occurred. The left side plot also indicates that at ranges greater than 25NM the Signal Strength rises again.  This fade at 25 NM range is almost certainly due to a ground reflection multipath null occurring at this specific frequency and altitude. Review of all of the other Low Power L Band data in Appendix O confirms the above assessment at all ranges flown (0-56NM) specifically, that, after the variances were taken into account, as long as terrain obstruction did not occur, then the required Subframe Error Rate could be met at all ranges and altitudes that were used as the basis for the relevant normative requirements in Section 2.0.  Consequently, for L Band, the flight tests show that those normative requirements were validated.
