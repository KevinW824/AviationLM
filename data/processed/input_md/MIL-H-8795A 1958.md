  5.3 Packing. Insofar as possible each ship­
ping container shall contain unit packages of 
hose assemblies of the same length and size. 
Where the unit pack does not fill the shipping 
container, it is permissible to pack different 
sizes and lengths in the same shipping container, 
provided each unit pack is properly identified 
and segregated within the container. 
                                   The gross 
weight of the shipping container, when packed 
for shipment, shall not exceed 200 pounds. 
  5.3.1 Level A. The hose assemblies, bun­
dled or coiled to meet the requirements of 
5.2.1, 5.2.1.1, or 5.2.1.2, shall be packed in 
overseas-type shipping containers conforming 
to 
    Specification 
                  PPP-B-585, 
                                 PPP-B-601, 
PPP-B-621, MIL-B-138, or PPP-B-636, class 
2, V3c or V3s. Plywood, when used, shall be 
type I or II, class 2, of Specification NN-P-
515. Strapping and closures shall be in ac- . 
cordance with the appendix to the applicable · 
container specification. 
                        Containers conform­
ing to Specification PPP-B-585 or PPP-B-
621 shall be provided with a case liner of barrier 
material conforming to Specification MIL-B-
13239 fabricated and sealed in accordance with 
Specification MIL-L-10547. 
  5.3.2 Level B. The hose assemblies, bun­
dled or coiled to meet the requirements of 5.2.1, 
5.2.1.1 or 5.2.1.2, shall be packed in domestic­
type shipping containers conforming to Specifi­
cation PPP-B-636, class 2, V3c or V3s, PPP­
B-585, PPP-B-591, PPP-B-601, PPP-B-621, 
or MIL-B-10377. Closures shall be in ac­

transportation at the lowest rate, to the point of 
delivery. Containers shall meet the require­
ments of Uniform Freight Classification Rules 
or regulations of other common caniers as 
applicable to the mode of transportation. 

  6.3 Age. Inasmuch as the hose is dated 
by quartel's of the year, it is necessary to judge 
hose age in terms of time after the quarter and 
year of hose manufacture. For example, hose 
dated the first quarter of 1957 could be shipped 
by a hose coupler and could be received by 
Government agencies and contractors through 
and including the third quarter of 1958 which 
ends 30 September 1958. This is acceptable 
because hose made during the first quarter of 
1957 is not 1 quarter (3 months) old until the 
end of the second quarter of 1957. Carrying 
out this progression makes the end of the third 
quarter of 1958 (30 September 1958) the 
terminal date for hose_6_quarters_or_l8_months 
old. 

  5.4 Marking of shipments. Interior pack­
ages and exterior shipping containers shall be 
marked in accordance with Standard MIL­
STD-129. The identification shall include the 
following information listed in the order shown :
