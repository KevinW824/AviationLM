## Change No. 2 To Do-210D

1.
Section 2.1.9 of DO-210D and Figure 2 were added via Change No. 1 to RTCA/DO-210D. Replace
that former Section 2.1.9 and Figure 2 with the following text for Section 2.1.9 and Figure 2:

## 2.1.9 Interference Susceptibility

A receiver meeting the requirements of this document will operate satisfactorily in the presence of interference at RF levels at the receiver's input port not exceeding the following tabulated levels. The RF levels in the frequency ranges near the SATCOM
receive band are also illustrated in Figure 2.

Frequency Range
Maximum Interference Level
470 to 1450 MHz
+3 dBm
1450 to 1529 MHz
Decreases linearly in decibels 
from +3 dBm at 1450 MHz to –72 dBm at 1529 MHz
1529 to 1560 MHz
-163.2 dBm (CW interference)
1529 to 1560 MHz
-184.9 dBm/Hz
(broad-band interference density)
1560 to 1626.5 MHz
Increases linearly in decibels
from –72 dBm at 1560 MHz to +3 dBm at 1626.5 MHz
1626.5 to 1660.5 MHz
+47.8 dBm
1660.5 to 18000 MHz
+3dBm
