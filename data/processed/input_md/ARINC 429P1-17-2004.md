FOREWORD 
 
Aeronautical Radio, Inc., the AEEC, and ARINC Standards 
 
Aeronautical Radio, Inc. (ARINC) was incorporated in 1929 by four fledgling airlines in the United States as a privately-owned company dedicated to serving the communications needs of the air transport industry.  Today, the major U.S. airlines remain the Company's principal shareholders.  Other shareholders include a number of non-U.S. airlines and other aircraft operators. ARINC sponsors aviation industry committees and participates in related industry activities that benefit aviation at large by providing technical leadership and guidance and frequency management. These activities directly support airline goals: promote safety, efficiency, regularity, and cost-effectiveness in aircraft operations. The Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) is an international body of airline technical professionals that leads the development of technical standards for airborne electronic equipmentincluding avionics and in-flight entertainment equipment-used in commercial, military, and business aviation. The AEEC establishes consensus-based, voluntary form, fit, function, and interface standards that are published by ARINC and are known as ARINC Standards. The use of ARINC Standards results in substantial benefits to airlines by allowing avionics interchangeability and commonality and reducing avionics cost by promoting competition. There are three classes of ARINC Standards: 

a) ARINC Characteristics - Define the form, fit, function, and interfaces of avionics and other 
airline electronic equipment. ARINC Characteristics indicate to prospective manufacturers of airline electronic equipment the considered and coordinated opinion of the airline technical community concerning the requisites of new equipment including standardized physical and electrical characteristics to foster interchangeability and competition.   
b) ARINC Specifications - Are principally used to define either the physical packaging or 
mounting of avionics equipment, data communication standards, or a high-level computer language.  
c) ARINC Reports - Provide guidelines or general information found by the airlines to be good 
practices, often related to avionics maintenance and support.  
The release of an ARINC Standard does not obligate any airline or ARINC to purchase equipment so described, nor does it establish or indicate recognition or the existence of an operational requirement for such equipment, nor does it constitute endorsement of any manufacturer's product designed or built to meet the ARINC Standard. In order to facilitate the continuous product improvement of this ARINC Standard, two items are included in the back of this volume: 

a) An Errata Report solicits any corrections to the text or diagrams in this ARINC Standard. b) An ARINC IA Project Initiation/Modification (APIM) form solicits any recommendations for 
addition of substantive material to this volume which would be the subject of a new Supplement.

1.4  "Mark 33 Digital Information Transfer System" 
        - Basic Philosophy This "Mark 33 Digital Information Transfer System (DITS)" specification describes a system in which an avionics system element having information to transmit does so from a designated output port over a single twisted and shielded pair of wires to all other system elements having need of that information.  Bi-directional data flow on a given twisted and shielded pair of wires is not permitted. 

1.4.1  Numeric Data Transfer The Mark 
33 
DITS 
numeric data transmission characteristics have been developed from those of successful predecessor air transport industry digital information transfer systems.  Data for transmission, encoded in either twos complement fractional binary notation or binary coded decimal notation, is supplied from source systems at rates sufficiently high to ensure small incremental value changes between updates.  Transmission is made "open loop", i.e., sinks are not required to inform sources that information has been received.  A parity bit is transmitted as part of each data word to permit simple error checks to be performed by the sinks.  These, together with data reasonableness checks which may also be performed by the sinks, may be used to prevent the display or other utilization of a erroneous or suspect word.  The inherently high integrity of the twisted and shielded wire transmission medium ensures that such drop-outs are few.  The low rates of change of the data ensure that when one does occur, it is of no consequence. 

1.4.2  ISO Alphabet No. 5 Data Transfer In addition to the transfer of BNR and BCD numeric data as just described, the Mark 33 DITS handles alpha and numeric data encoded per ISO Alphabet No. 5.  The same "broadcast" transmission philosophy is used, although the "housekeeping" aspects of system operation differ in order to accommodate particular needs associated with this type of data.  These differences will be addressed individually in this document as they arise. 

1.4.3  Graphic Data Transfer A third type of data which may eventually be handled by the Mark 33 DITS is graphic data, i.e., the lines, circles, randomly positioned alpha/numeric text and other symbols used on CRT map and similar displays.  The technique employed for this purpose can be basically similar to that used for ISO Alphabet No. 5 alpha/numeric data transfer. However, because a need for graphic data handling capability has not yet emerged, the air transport industry has decided not to be specific concerning this technique for the moment.  When the need for graphic data handling is established, appropriate specification material will be developed. 



1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1  Purpose of this Document This document defines the air transport industry's standards for the transfer of digital data between avionics systems elements.  Adherence to these standards is desired for all inter-systems communications in which the system line replaceable units are defined as unit interchangeable in the relevant ARINC characteristics.  Their use for intra-system communications in systems in which the line replaceable units are defined in the ARINC characteristics as system interchangeable is not essential, although it may be convenient. 

1.2  Organization of ARINC Specification 429 ARINC Specification 429 was originally published in a single volume through version 14 (429-14).  The size of the document and the need for improved organization dictated the division of the document into three parts.  Those three parts include: Part 1 Functional Description, Electrical Interface, Label Assignments and Word Formats Part 2 Discrete Word Data Formats Part 3 File Data Transfer Techniques Part 1 provides the basic description of the functions and the supporting physical and electrical interfaces for the data transfer system.  Data word formats, standard label and address assignments, and application examples are defined. Part 2 lists discrete word bit assignments in label order. Part 3 describes protocols and message definitions for data transferred in large blocks and/or file format.  For convenience of the user, the section and attachment numbering has been retained for the material moved from the original Specification to Part 3. Updates to each part of future releases of ARINC 429 will be independent of the other parts to accommodate timely revisions as industry needs dictate.  The dash numbers for each Part will NOT be synchronized with the other Parts as time passes.  Users of ARINC Specification 429 should ensure that the latest version of each Part is used when designing or procuring equipment. 

1.3  Relationship to ARINC Specification 419 ARINC 
Specification 
419, 
"Digital Data System Compendium", is a catalog of the elements of the several digital data transmission systems that have found application during the "emergent" period of digital avionics technology.  The maturing of this technology, now evident in the scope of its planned use on aircraft of the 1980s and beyond, has shown the need for a generally applicable digital information transfer system having capabilities not provided by any combination of the elements presently defined in Specification 419.  In defining such a system, this document draws on the experience gained in the preparation of Specification 419 but is otherwise separate and distinct from it.  Addition of the element specifications of the system defined herein to the Specification 419 catalog is not anticipated. 

## 2.0 Digital Information Transfer System Standards

characters towards the MSB by two bit positions.  It is possible, however, that future latitude and longitude displays will not be the simple, dedicated read-out type for which BCD data is intended.  More likely is the use of some form of multiple-message display, such as a CRT, which will be backed by its own data processor and prefer inputs of BNR data.  If this proves to be the case, these special provisions for BCD-encoding will not be required. 

 
2.1.3  Information Identifier The type of information contained in a word is identified by a six-character label.  The first three characters are octal characters coded in binary in the first eight bits of the word. The eight bits will: 
a. 

identify the information contained within BNR and BCD numeric data words (e.g., DME distance, static air temperature, etc.) and b. identify the word application for Discrete, Maintenance and AIM data. The last three characters of the six-character label are hexadecimal characters used to provide for identification of ARINC 429 bus sources.  Each triplet of hexadecimal characters identifies a "black box" with one or more DITS ports.  Each three character code (and black box) may have up to 255 eight bit labels assigned to it.  The code is used administratively to retain distinction between unlike parameters having like labels assignments. 

COMMENTARY 
Some users have expressed a desire to have means for identifying label sets and buses associated with a particular equipment ID code.  Octal label 377 has been assigned for this purpose. (The code appears in the 3 LSDs of the BCD Word format).  The transmission of the equipment identifier word on a bus will permit receivers attached to the bus to recognize the source of the DITS information.  Since the transmission of the equipment identifier word is optional, receivers should not depend on that word for correct operation. 

Label code assignments are set forth in Attachment 1-1 to this document. 

 
Special Note: In some ARINC 429 DITS applications, a bus will be dedicated to delivering a single information element from a source to one or more identical sink devices.  In such circumstances, the sink device designer might be tempted to assume that decoding the word label is not necessary. Experience has shown, however, that system developments frequently occur that result in the need for additional information elements to appear on the bus.  If a sink device designed for service prior to such a development cannot decode the original word label, it cannot differentiate between this word and the new data in the new situation. The message for sink designers should therefore be quite clear - provide label decoding from the outset, no matter how strong the temptation to omit it might be. 

 
2.1  Message Related Elements This section describes the digital data transfer system elements considered to be principally related to the message 
itself or the manner in which it is handled. 
 
2.1.1  Direction of Information Flow The information output of an avionics system element should be transmitted from a designated port (or ports) to which the receiving ports of other system elements in need of that information are connected.  In no case does information flow into a port designated for transmission. 
COMMENTARY 
A separate data bus (twisted and shielded pair of wires 
per Section 2.2.1) for each direction is used when data is required to flow both ways between two avionics systems elements. 
 
2.1.2  Information Element The basic information element is a digital word containing 32 bits.  There are five application groups for such words, BNR data, BCD data, Discrete data, Maintenance data (general) and Acknowledgement, ISO Alphabet Number 5 and Maintenance (ISO Alphabet Number 5) data (AIM). Word formats for these different applications are depicted in Attachment 6 while the relevant data handling rules are set forth in Section 2.3.1.  When less than the full data field is needed to accommodate the information conveyed in a word  in the desired manner, the unused bit positions should be filled with binary zeros or, in the case of BNR/BCD numeric data, valid data bits.  If valid data bits are used, the resolution possible for the information may exceed that called for in this Specification.  The Commentary following Section 2.1.6 of this document refers. 
COMMENTARY 
To permit the use of identical error-checking hardware 
elements in the handling of BNR and BCD numeric data words, the format for the Mark 33 DITS BCD 
word differs from that used formerly for this type of data.  Bit Number 32 is assigned to parity, Bit Numbers 31 and 30 to the sign/status matrix, Bit Number 29 is the most significant bit of the data field, and the maximum decimal value of the most significant character is 7. Previously, the BCD word contained no parity bit, the sign/status matrix occupied 
Bit Numbers 32 and 31, Bit Number 30 was the most significant data bit and the maximum decimal value of the most significant character was 3. This format made the word 8-bit byte oriented with respect to the data. This characteristic is not retained in the Mark 33 system. 
 
Also, latitude and longitude can only be encoded in the Mark 33 DITS word with the formerly specified resolution of 0.1 minute of arc if Bit Numbers 9 and 10 are used for data rather than the SDI function described in Section 2.1.4 of this document, and the word is structured differently from the standard shown in Attachment 6.  Restructuring the word involves limiting the maximum value of the most significant character to 1 and moving the remaining BCD

code "00" is available as an "installation Number 4" identifier. When the SDI function is not used, binary zeros or valid data should be transmitted in Bit Numbers 9 and 10. 

 
COMMENTARY 
This document does not address the practical question of how the SDI bits will be set in those multiinstallation systems in which the source/destination function is desired.  One way would be to use program pins on the individual installation black boxes which would be wired to set up the appropriate code.  The ARINC Characteristics devoted to the individual systems will define the method actually to be used. 

 
2.1.5  Sign/Status Matrix This section describes the coding of the Sign/Status Matrix (SSM) field.  In all cases the SSM field uses Bits 30 and 31. For BNR data words, the SSM field also includes Bit 29. The SSM field may be used to report hardware equipment condition (fault/normal), operational mode (functional test), or validity of data word content (verified/no computed data). The following definitions apply in this Specification: 
Invalid Data - is defined as any data generated by a source system whose fundamental characteristic is the inability to convey reliable information for the proper performance of a user system.  There are two categories of invalid data, namely, "No Computed Data" and "Failure Warning." 
No Computed Data - is a particular case of data invalidity where the source system is unable to compute reliable data for reasons other than system failure.  This inability to compute reliable data is caused exclusively by a definite set of events or conditions whose boundaries are uniquely defined in the system characteristic. 

Failure Warning - is a particular case of data invalidity where the system monitors have detected one or more failures. These failures are uniquely characterized by boundaries defined in the system characteristic. The system indicators should always be flagged during a "Failure Warning" condition. When a "No Computed Data" condition exists, the source system should annunciate its outputs to be invalid by setting the sign/status matrix of the affected words to the "No Computed Data" code, as defined in the subsections which follow. The system indicators may or may not be flagged, depending on system requirements. While the unit is in the functional test mode, all output data words generated within the unit (i.e., pass through words are excluded) should be coded for "Functional Test."  Pass through data words are those words received by the unit and retransmitted without alteration. When the SSM code is used to transmit status and more than one reportable condition exists, the condition with the highest priority should be encoded in Bit Numbers 30 and 31. The order of condition priorities to be used is shown in the table below. Note:  In certain specialized applications of the SDI 
function the all-call capability may be forfeited so that

2.1.5.2  BNR Numeric Data Words The status of the transmitter hardware should be encoded in the Status Matrix field (Bit Numbers 30 and 31) of BNR Numeric Data words as shown in the table below. A source system should annunciate any detected failure that causes one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable by setting Bit Numbers 30 and 31 in the affected word(s) to the "Failure Warning" code defined in the table below. Words containing this code should continue to be supplied to the data bus during the failure condition. The "No Computed Data" code should be annunciated in the affected BNR Numeric Data word(s) when a source system is unable to compute reliable data for reasons other than system failure. When it appears as a system output, the "Functional Test" code should be interpreted as advice that the data in the word results from the execution of a functional test. A functional test should produce indications of 1/8 of positive full-scale values unless indicated otherwise in an ARINC equipment characteristic. If, during the execution of a functional test, a source system detects a failure which causes one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable, it should immediately change the states of Bit Numbers 30 and 31 in the affected words such that the "Functional Test" 
annunciation is replaced with 
"Failure Warning" 
annunciation.

 The sign (plus, minus, north, south, etc.) of BNR Numeric Data words should be encoded in the Sign Matrix field (Bit Number 29) as shown in the table below. Bit Number 29 should be "zero" when no sign is needed. Each data word type has its own unique utilization of the SSM field. These various formats are described in the following subsections. 

2.1.5.1  BCD Numeric When a failure is detected within a system which would cause one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable, the system should stop transmitting the affected word or words on the data bus. Some avionic systems are capable of detecting a fault condition which results in less than normal accuracy. In these systems, when a fault of this nature (for instance, partial sensor loss) which results in degraded accuracy is detected, each unreliable BCD digit should be encoded "1111" when transmitted on the data bus. For equipments having a display, the "1111" code should, when received, be recognized as representing an inaccurate digit and a "dash" or equivalent symbol should be displayed in place of the inaccurate digit. Parameters for which such a degraded mode of operation is possible are identified in the Note column of the tables in Attachment 2. The sign (plus/minus, north/south, etc.) of BCD Numeric Data should be encoded in bit numbers 30 and 31 of the word as shown in the table below. Bit Numbers 30 and 31 of BCD Numeric Data words should be "zero" where no sign is needed. The "No Computed Data" code should be annunciated in the affected BCD Numeric Data word(s) when a source system is unable to compute reliable data for reasons other than system failure. When the "Functional Test" code appears in Bits 30 and 31 
of an instruction input data word, it should be interpreted as a command to perform a functional test. 

COMMENTARY 
A typical instruction input to a radio, for example, would be a channel change command word. When this command word is received with the "Functional Test" coding in the SSM field, the radio should exercise its functional test. When the "Functional Test" code appears as a system output, it should be interpreted as advice that the data in the BCD Numeric Data word contents are the result of the execution of a functional test. A functional test should produce indications of 1/8 of positive full-scale values unless indicated otherwise in the associated ARINC Equipment Characteristic.

 Some avionic systems are capable of detecting a fault condition which results in less than normal accuracy. In these systems, when a fault of this nature (for instance, partial sensor loss) which results in degraded accuracy is detected, the equipment should continue to report "Normal" for the sign status matrix while indicating the degraded performance by coding bit 11 as follows: 
ACCURACY STATUS 
 
Bit Number 

11 
Meaning 
0 1 
Nominal Accuracy Degraded Accuracy 
c-12 c-15 c-12
c-15 c-12

 This implies that degraded accuracy can be coded only in BNR words not exceeding 17 bits of data. Parameters for which such a degraded mode of operation is possible are identified in the notes column of the tables in Attachment 2. 

2.1.5.3  Discrete Data Words A source system should annunciate any detected failure that could cause one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable.  Three methods are defined. The first method is to set Bit Numbers 30 and 31 in the affected word(s) to the "Failure Warning" code defined in the table below.  Words containing the "Failure Warning" code should continue to be supplied to the data bus during the failure condition.  When using the second method, the equipment may stop transmitting the affected word or words on the data bus.  Designers should use this method when the display or use of the discrete data by a system is undesirable.  The third method applies to data words which are defined such that they contain failure information within the data field.  For these applications, refer to the associated ARINC equipment characteristic to determine proper SSM reporting.  Designers should preclude mixing operational and BITE data in the same word. The "No Computed Data" code should be annunciated in the affected Discrete Data word(s) when a source system is unable to compute reliable data for reasons other than system failure. When the "Functional Test" code appears as a system output, it should be interpreted as advice that the data in the Discrete Data word contents are the result of the execution of a functional test.

2.1.6  Data Standards The units, ranges, resolutions, refresh rates, number of significant bits, pad bits, etc. for the items of information to be transferred by the Mark 33 DITS are tabulated in 
Attachment 2 to this document. 
COMMENTARY 
Note that Section 2.3.1.1 of this document calls for numeric data to be encoded in BCD and binary, the latter using twos complement fractional notation.  In this notation, the most significant bit of the data field represents one half of the maximum value chosen for the parameter being defined.  Successive bits represent the increments of a binary fraction series.  Negative numbers are encoded as the twos complements of positive value and the negative sign is annunciated in the sign/status matrix. 
In establishing a given parameter's binary data 
standards for inclusion in Attachment 2, the units maximum value and resolution are first determined in that order.  The least significant bit of the word is then given a value equal to the resolution increment, and the number of significant bits is chosen such that the maximum value of the fractional binary series just exceeds the maximum value of the parameter, i.e., equals the next whole binary number greater than the maximum parameter value less one least significant bit value.  For example, if the Mark 33 DITS is required to transfer altitude in units of feet over a range of zero to 100,000 feet with a resolution of one foot, the number of significant bits is 17 and the maximum value of the fractional binary series is 131,071 (i.e., 131,072 - 1). 
Note that because accuracy is a quality of the 
measurement process and not the data transfer process, it plays no part in the selection of word characteristics. Obviously, the resolution provided in the DITS word should equal or exceed the accuracy in order not to degrade it. 
 
 
For the binary representation of angular data, the Mark 
33 DITS employs "degrees divided by 180o" as the 
unit of data transfer and ±1 (semicircle) as the range for twos complement fractional notation encoding (ignoring, for the moment, the subtraction of the least significant bit value).  Thus the angular range 0 through 359.XXX degrees is encoded as 0 through 
±179.XXX degrees, the value of the most significant bit is one half semicircle and there are no discontinuities in the code. 
This may be illustrated as follows.  Consider encoding 
the angular range 0o to 360o in 1o increments.  Per the 
general encoding rules above, the positive semicircle 
will cover the range 0o to 179o (one least significant bit 
less than full range).  All the bits of the code will be 
"zeros" for 0o and "ones" for 179o, and the sign/status 
matrix will indicate the positive sign.  The negative 
semicircle will cover the range 180o to 359o.  All the 
bits will be "zeros" for 180o.  The codes for angles 
between 181o to 359o will be determined by taking the 
twos complements of the  fractional  binary  series  for  

## 2.0 Digital Information Transfer System Standards

Prior to the selection of the voltage and impedance 
parameters set forth in this section of this document, the pulse distortion likely to be encountered in systems built around them in existing size commercial aircraft 
was evaluated and judged to be acceptable for a welldesigned receiver.  No restriction is placed by this specification, therefore, on the number or length of stubs for installations on aircraft no larger than those existing, e.g., B 747.  See Appendix A to this document for a report of this investigation. 
Tests have shown that some receivers continue decoding data properly when one side of the transmission line is open or shorted to ground.  When this condition exists noise immunity decreases and intermittent operation may occur.  Users desire protection against non-annunciated system operation in this mode.  This protection may consist of additional circuitry to detect and annunciate the fault, or to increase the receiver threshold to above 5.5 volts, which is the maximum signal level under this one-wire fault condition. 
Most ARINC Characteristics now contain text specifying that DITS receivers should discontinue operation when the voltage thresholds fall into the undefined regions between  "Null" and "Hi" or "Null" and "Lo."  Manufacturers building DITS receivers are urged to incorporate this feature in their circuitry whether it is to be used in ARINC 7XX-series equipment or Non-ARINC devices. 
 
2.2.2  Modulation RZ bipolar modulation should be used.  This is tri-level state modulation consisting of "HI," "NULL" and "LO" states. 
2.2.3  Voltage Levels 
 
2.2.3.1  Transmitter Voltage Levels The differential output signal across the specified output terminals (balanced to ground at the transmitter) should be as given in the following table when the transmitter is open circuit: 

 
0  +0.5

the result of subtracting each value from 360.  Thus, the code for 181o is the twos complement of the code for 179o.  Throughout the negative semicircle, which includes 180o, the sign/status matrix contains the negative sign. 

 
 
For convenience, all binary word ranges in Attachment 2 are shown as whole binary numbers rather than such numbers less one least significant bit value.  Also, the resolutions shown are approximate only.  Accurate resolutions can be determined, if required, by reference to the range values and numbers of significant bits for the words of interest. 

It should be noted that in all applications of the twos complement fractional notation, the maximum value of the word, once chosen, cannot be changed by the use of more bits in the data field.  The number of bits in the word affects only the resolution of the data, not its range. 

Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) data is encoded per the numeric subset of the ISO Alphabet #5 code (see Attachment 5 to this document) using Bit Numbers 1 through 4 of the seven-bit-per-character code. Alpha/numeric data is encoded using all seven bits per character of the ISO Alphabet #5 code and is transmitted using the special word format described in Section 2.3.1.3 of this document. 

2.2  Electrically Related Elements This section describes the digital transfer system elements considered to be principally related to the electrical aspects of the signal circuit. 

2.2.1  Transmission System Interconnect A data source should be connected to the data sink(s) by means of a single twisted and shielded pair of wires.  The shields should be grounded at both ends to an aircraft ground close to the rack connector and at all production breaks in the cable. 

COMMENTARY 
In practical wire line digital information transmission systems, cable characteristics and electrical mismatches can produce distortion of the digital data pulses.  Also, noise due to electrical interference perturbs digital signals. 

The performance of a digital receiver depends upon the receiver input signal characteristics (data with distortion and noise) and the receiver design. 

 
2.0  DIGITAL INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM STANDARDS  
 
2.2.3.2  Receiver Voltage Levels The differential voltage presented at the receiver input terminals will be dependent upon line length, stub configuration and the number of receivers connected.  In the 
absence of noise, the normal ranges of voltages presented to 
the receiver terminals (A and B) would be: 
 
"HI" 
+7.25V to +11V 
 
 
"NULL" +0.5V to -0.5V 
 
 
"LO" 
-7.25V to -11V In practice, these nominal voltages will be perturbed by noise and pulse distortion.  Thus, receivers should associate the following voltage ranges with the three states indicated: 
 
"HI" 
+6.5V to 13V 
 
 
"NULL" +2.5V to -2.5V 
 
 
"LO" 
-6.5V to -13V 
 
COMMENTARY 
 
Receiver reaction is currently undefined herein for voltages that fall in the range just above and below the "Null" range.  Respective equipment characteristics should be referenced for desired receiver response in this range.  However, it is desirable that all DITS receivers will discontinue operation when the voltage levels fall into the undefined regions.  Manufacturers are urged, as new equipment is developed, to "design in" the rejection capability. 
The opinion is held by some people that conditions on 
transmission lines will be encountered which will require receivers to operate with less than the above defined minimum difference of 4.0V between the NULL and HI and NULL and LO states.  Receiver designers 
are 
encouraged 
to 
investigate 
the 
possibilities and problems of working with a minimum difference of 1 volt between these states and to report their findings. 
 
 
Receiver input common mode voltages (terminal A to 
ground and terminal B to ground) are not specified because of the difficulties of defining ground with any 
satisfactory 
degree 
of 
precision. 
 
Receiver 
manufacturers are encouraged to work with the differential input voltage (line A to line B) and not lineto-ground voltages. 
2.2.4  Impedance Levels 2.2.4.1  Transmitter Output Impedance The transmitter output impedance should be 75 ±5 ohms, divided equally between line A and line B to provide an impedance balanced output.  This output impedance should be present for the "HI," "NULL" and "LO" transmitter output conditions and also during transitions between these levels. 
COMMENTARY 
The output impedance of the transmitter is specified as 
75 ± 5 ohms to provide an approximate match to the characteristic impedance of the cable.  The match can 
only be approximate due to the wide range of characteristic impedances which may be encountered due to the variety of conductor wire gauges and insulation properties.  Measurements on a few samples of wire showed a spread of characteristic impedance of 
63 to 71 ohms.  An extrapolation over the wire gauges 
20 to 26 for wrapped and extruded insulation indicate an expected characteristic impedance spread of 60 to 80 ohms approx.  Twisted shielded wire specifications do not control the characteristic impedance of the cable, 
thus 
future 
developments 
in 
insulation 
techniques may result in cables having characteristic impedances outside the range estimated. 
2.2.4.2  Receiver Input Impedance The receiver should exhibit the following characteristics, measured at the receiver input terminals: 
Differential Input Resistance RI = 12,000 ohms minimum 
Differential Input Capacitance CI = 50pF maximum 
Resistance to Ground RH and RG ≥ 12,000 ohms 
Capacitance to Ground CH and CG ≤ 50pF. The total receiver input resistance including the effects of 
RI, RH and RG in parallel should be 8,000 ohms minimum 
(400 ohms minimum for twenty receiver loads). No more than twenty receivers should be connected on to one digital data bus and each receiver should incorporate isolation provisions to ensure that the occurrence of any reasonably probable failure does not cause loss of data to the others. See Attachment 4 to this document for a pictorial representation of the input and output circuit standards. 
COMMENTARY 
The above characteristics apply to differential 
amplifier receivers.  Opto-isolator technology is progressing and may soon find application in digital data receivers.  Opto-isolator receivers impose slightly 
greater loads on data buses than differential amplifier receivers and the way in which they are characterized is different.  It is probable, however, that a future revision of this Specification will include material specifically related to their use. 2.2.5  Fault Tolerance 2.2.5.1  Receiver External Fault Voltage Tolerance Receivers should withstand without sustaining damage the following steady-state voltages being applied to their terminals, superimposed upon a normally operating bus. Operation within specification limits is not required under these conditions. a.  30 Vac RMS applied across terminals A and B, or b.  ±29 Vdc applied between terminal A and ground, or c.  ±29 Vdc applied between terminal B and ground. 
 
2.0 DIGITAL INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM STANDARDS  
 
discrete information contained in a numeric data word assigned a label in Attachment 1-1 is specified in the definition for that word in Attachment 6. 

The rule to be followed in the assignment soft bits to discrete in numeric data words is to start with the least significant bit of the word and to continue towards the most significant bit available in the word.  Attachment 6 shows its against the background of the generalized word structure. There are two types of discrete words.  These are general purpose discrete words, and dedicated discrete words. Seven labels (270 XXX-276 XXX) are assigned to the general purpose words in Attachment 1-1.  These words should be used in ascending label order (starting with 270 XXX) when the system receiving the data can identify its source by reference to the port at which it arrives. 2.3.1.3 
Maintenance Data (General Purpose) The general purpose maintenance words are assigned labels in sequential order as are the labels for the general purpose discrete words.  The lowest octal value label assigned to the maintenance words should be used when only one maintenance word is transmitted.  When more than one word is transmitted the lowest octal value label should be used first and the other labels used sequentially until the message has been completed.  The general purpose maintenance words may contain discrete, BCD or BNR numeric data but should never contain ISO Alphabet Number 5 messages.  The general purpose maintenance words should be formatted according to the layouts of the corresponding BCD/BNR/discrete data words shown in Attachment 2. 

2.3.1.4  AIM Data The information previously contained in this section is no longer applicable to ARINC Specification 429.  For reference purposes, the section header is retained and the original contents of this section are located in Part 3 of this Specification. 

2.3.1.5  File Data Transfer This section previously described a character-oriented file data transfer protocol.  This definition was used as guidance for the character-oriented file transfer protocol descriptions incorporated into many ARINC equipment characteristics. The original contents of this section are located in Part 3 of this Specification. The protocol defined in Part 3 is preferred for new applications. 

 
The purpose of this bit-oriented communications protocol is to provide for the transparent transfer of data files using the ARINC 429 data bus. 

COMMENTARY 
The data transparent protocol described in Part 3 was developed in order to facilitate the communications of the ACARS Management Unit (MU) and the Satellite Data Unit (SDU).  Its viability as a universal protocol was recognized by the Systems Architecture and Interfaces (SAI) Subcommittee, which recommended its inclusion herein as the standard means of file data transfer. 

 
2.2.5.2  Transmitter External Fault Voltage Transmitter failures caused by external fault voltages should not cause other transmitters or other circuitry in the unit to function outside of their specification limits or to fail. 

 
2.2.5.3 Transmitter External Fault Load Tolerance Transmitters should indefinitely withstand without sustaining damage a short circuit applied: a.  across terminals A and B, or b.  from terminal A to ground, or c.  from terminal B to ground, or d.  b and c above, simultaneously. 

2.2.6  Fault Isolation 
 
2.2.6.1  Receiver Fault Isolation Each receiver should incorporate isolation provisions to ensure that the occurrence of any reasonably probable internal LRU or bus receiver failure does not cause any input bus to operate outside of its specification limits (both undervoltage or overvoltage). 

2.2.6.2  Transmitter Fault Isolation Each transmitter should incorporate isolation provisions to ensure that it does not under any reasonably probable LRU fault condition provide an output voltage in excess of: a. 

a voltage greater than 30 Vac RMS between terminal A 
and B, or b. greater than ±29 Vdc between A and ground, or c. 

greater than ±29 Vdc between B and ground. 

 
2.3  Logic Related Elements 
 
This section describes the digital transfer system elements considered to be principally related to the logic aspects of the signal circuit. 2.3.1  Digital Language 2.3.1.1  Numeric Data The Mark 33 DITS should accommodate numeric data encoded in two digital languages, (i) BNR expressed in twos complement fractional notation and (ii) BCD per the numerical subset of ISO Alphabet Number 5 (see Attachment 5 to this document).  An information item encoded in both languages will be assigned a unique address for each (see Section 2.1.3 and Attachment 1-1). Word formats are illustrated in Attachment 6 to this document. 

2.3.1.2  Discretes In addition to handling numeric data as specified above, the Mark 33 DITS should also be capable of accommodating discrete items of information either in the unused (pad) bits of data words or, when necessary, in dedicated words.  Any 

c-14
c-13
c-5

 
2.0  DIGITAL INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM STANDARDS  
 
The process for determining the protocol (characteroriented or bit-oriented) to be used in the interaction between two units, where this information is not predetermined is described in Part 3 of ARINC 429. 

2.3.1.5.1  Bit-Oriented Protocol Determination The ALO word should be sent by any system which supports the bit-oriented Link Layer protocol just after the system powers-up, or performs a re-initialization for any reason.  The ALO/ALR protocol process may also be used when  a bit-oriented Link Layer protocol system needs to determine if any of its interfaces support the bit-oriented protocol. All systems which support the Link Layer bitoriented protocol must be able to respond to the initiation of this process.  Attachment 11C of Part 3 to ARINC 429, shows the ALO and ALR word formats. When a system with a bit-oriented Link Layer protocol has the need to make this determination, it should construct the ALO word and transmit this word to the device in question. The system should then wait for a maximum period of time defined by T12.  If the device in question has not responded within T12, the initiating system should initiate another ALO 
word and again delay up to T12.  An initiating system will attempt a maximum of N6 ALO word operations before declaring the device in question as "Not bit-oriented" or 
"Not able to respond." 
2.3.2  Transmission Order The Least Significant Bit (LSB) and Least Significant Character (LSC) of each word should be transmitted first. It may be noted that the least significant bit of the word is the most significant bit of the label and that the label is transmitted ahead of the data in each case.  This "reversed label" characteristic is a legacy from past systems in which the octal coding of the label field was, apparently, of no significance. 

2.3.3  Data Bit Encoding Logic A "HI" state after the beginning of the bit interval returning to a "NULL" state before the end of the same bit interval signifies a logic "one." A "LO" state after the beginning of the bit interval returning to a "NULL" state before the end of the same bit interval signifies a logic "zero."  This is represented graphically in Attachment 7 to this document. 2.3.4  Error Detection/Correction The last bit of each word should be encoded such that word parity is rendered odd to allow error detection in receivers. Note that the parity calculation encompasses all 31 label and information bits of the word. 

COMMENTARY 
Air transport industry experience with digital information transfer systems pre-dating the Mark 33 DITS has shown that the twisted shielded pair of wires can be regarded as a high integrity link unlikely to introduce bit errors into the data passing through it.  It is for this reason that no means for error correction are specified in this document.  The error detection capability specified above may be used as desired in receiving terminals.  BNR data, for example, may be checked for parity by reference to the binary state of Bit Number 32 of each word.  Also, the data may be submitted to reasonableness checks.  BCD may be submitted to reasonableness checks.  BCD data intended for human consumption in the cockpit is normally smoothed before transmission to ensure tolerable levels of display jitter.  As this process eliminates any obviously wild data points, the need for further error detection is questionable.  As pointed out in the Commentary following Section 2.1.2 of this document, the parity bit was added to the BCD word for reasons related to BCD/BNR transmitter hardware commonality, not because a need for it existed for error detection. 

 
2.4  Timing Related Elements This section describes the digital data transfer system elements considered to be principally related to the timing aspects of the signal circuit. 

2.4.1  Bit Rate 2.4.1.1  High Speed Operation The bit rate for high speed operation of the system should be 100 kilobits per second ±1%. 

2.4.1.2  Low Speed Operation The bit rate for low speed operation of the system should be within the range 12.0 to 14.5 kilobits per second.  The selected rate should be maintained within 1%. NOTE: 
High bit rate and low bit rate messages will not be intermixed on the same bus. 

 
COMMENTARY 
Although the bit rates specified above should be held within the stated tolerances over the long term, individual bit lengths may fall outside the limits expected from these tolerances.  Bit symmetry and jitter should be within the tolerances specified in Attachment 8. 

 
Also, notwithstanding the RFI performance of the ARINC 429 DITS reported in Appendix 1 to this document, system designers are advised to avoid selection of 13.6 kilobits per second for low speed operations and precisely 100 kilobits per second for high speed operations to ensure that the system is not responsible for interference to LORAN C systems with which the aircraft might be equipped. 

2.4.2  Information Rates The minimum and maximum transmit intervals for each item of information transferred by the Mark 33 DITS are specified in the tables of Attachment 2.  Words with like labels but with different SDI codes should be treated as unique items of information.  Each and every unique item of information should be transmitted once during an interval bounded in length by the minimum and maximum  

## C-5

 
2.4.2  Information Rates (cont'd) values specified in Attachment 2.  Stated another way, a word having the same label and four different SDI codes should appear on the bus four times (once for each SDI 
code) during that time interval. 

COMMENTARY 
 
There are no values given for refresh rates in this Specification.  However, it is desirable that data be refreshed at least once per transmission.  Those data actually requiring long processing times or a large number of samples are the only types not expected to be refreshed with every transmission. Discretes contained within data words should be transferred at the bit rate and repeated at the update rate of the primary data.  Words dedicated to discretes should be repeated continuously at the rates defined in Attachment 2. 

COMMENTARY 
The time intervals between successive transmissions of a given BCD word specified in table 1 of Attachment 2 to this document are, in general, too short for the signal to be of use in driving a display device directly.  If the signal was so used the least significant character of the display, would change too rapidly for human perception.  Considerations other than human factors demand the time intervals specified.  Thus, display designers should incorporate into their devices means for selecting those words to be used for updating the display from the greater quantity delivered. 

 
2.4.3  Clocking Method Clocking is inherent in the data transmission.  The identification of the bit interval is related to the initiation of either a "HI" or "LO" state from a previous "NULL" state in a bipolar RZ code. 

2.4.4  Word Synchronization 
 
The digital word should be synchronized by reference to a gap of four bit times (minimum) between the periods of word transmissions.  The beginning of the first transmitted bit following this gap signifies the beginning of the new word. 2.4.5  Timing Tolerances The waveform timing tolerances should be as shown in Attachment 8 to this document. 

 
COMMENTARY 
 
RF interference radiated by the Mark 33 DITS using the waveform characteristics specified in this section has been shown not to exceed that permitted by Figure 21-5 of RTCA Document DO-160, "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Electronic/Electrical Equipment and Instruments." 
Also, conducted RF interference is within the limits specified in Figure 21-2 of DO-160.  Appendix 1 to this document refers.

3.0  MARK 33 DITS APPLICATIONS NOTES 
 
3.1  Radio Systems Management One special application of the Mark 33 DITS is to radio systems frequency selection and function switching.  The following paragraphs set forth the rules which should be followed in the application of the DITS to ensure interchangeability of radios and control sources. 

3.1.1  Word Format and Digital Language The standard DITS 32-bit BCD word should be used, of which Bit Numbers 1 through 8 constitute the label, Bit Numbers 9 and 10 are reserved for a source/destination identifier code, bit Numbers 11 through 29 constitute the data, Bit Numbers 30 and 31 form the sign/status matrix and Bit Number 32 is the word parity bit. The data field should contain the frequency to which the radio defined by the label field is to tune encoded in BCD characters, together with the discretes required for function switching for that radio.  Attachment 6 shows how the word should be structured for each radio system requiring the DITS management service. 

3.1.2  Update Rate The nominal update rate for all radio systems management words should be five times per second. 

3.1.3  Sign/Status Matrix Since sign is not a characteristic of radio systems management information, the normal states of the sign/status matrix bits will be binary "zeros."  However, the radios should recognize the codes for "functional test" and "no computed data," (see Section 2.1.5 of this document).  They should interpret the former as an instruction to perform a functional test or functional test sequence.  They should regard the latter as an instruction to remain tuned to the frequency contained in the last valid word received until either another valid word is decoded or their primary power is removed.

Equipment Identification

6-17/Note 2

[1]    XXX or YYY is applicable to all Equipment IDs. [2]    The preferred SSM encoding method for the Equipment Identification Word is according to the Discrete word guidelines.  When this label was originally assigned, it was recognized as a non-BNR word. The SSM encoding was according to the BCD and DISC guidelines that were identical at that time. During development of Supplement 4, the SSM for DISC was revised to it current form to   
        provide enhanced failure warning. When the SSM encoding was changed, some systems retained the BCD encoding for the Equipment Identification word and others changed to DISC encoding.

         There are ARINC standards that are still active that have the SSM for Equipment Identification designated as BCD. You will need to
        check with the equipment manufacturer to determine the SSM format.

[3]     The Label does not adhere to ARINC 429 Standard Signal Format and contains both BCD and BRN bit encoding depending on the 
          selected mode.

DATA STANDARDS 
TABLE 2 - BNR DATA 
[1] 
The number entered into the Range Column for each 
parameter that is not angular in nature is the nearest 
whole binary number greater than the parameter range 
required.  As explained in the Commentary following 
Section 2.1.6 of this document, the weight of the most significant bit of the twos complement fractional notation binary word will be one half this value, and the actual maximum value of the parameter capable of being encoded will be the number in the range column less one least significant bit value.  The numbers entered in the RANGE column for angular parameters are the actual degree ranges required.  The way in which these parameters are encoded is also explained in the Commentary following Section 2.1.6. [2] 
Transmit intervals and the number of parameters to be 
transmitted are prime factors in bus loading.  The interval for transmission of parameters should fall between the minimum and maximum specified intervals and nominally should be near the center of the range at equal intervals between transmissions.  When heavy bus loading dictates a shift from the center of the range, the shift should be toward the maximum transmit interval. 
When words with like labels and with different SDI codes are transmitted, each of those words is considered a unique item of information.  The guidance given in this document for transmit intervals should be applied to those words as if each word were identified by a different label. [3] 
Maximum transport delay is the worst case total delay 
between an input function and the output response. 
 
COMMENTARY 
 
Since the nature of the data varies, the definition of transport delay will differ depending on the application.  In the case of a sampling system, a sample is complete when the 32-bit word constituting the output data is complete.  In the case of a system involving filtering, transport delay is the 
phase slope of the transfer function across the frequency band of interest. 
There can be situations in which it is necessary to define 
which portions of an equipment are included in the transport delay term.  Such definitions should appear in individual equipment Characteristics when needed. [4] 
The values shown in parentheses are the preferred data 
standards for stator vane angle.  However, a considerable portion of existing equipment use the other (nonparenthesized) values.  Users should verify the data standards of the equipment they are or will be using. [5] 
These labels can provide data in a degraded accuracy 
mode.  See Section 2.1.5.1 and 2.1.5.2. [6] 
Optionally transmitted. [7]

Documentary Data Word 
 
[1] 
Source/Destination Identifier (SDI) Field 
The purpose of the SDI field is explained in Section 2.1.4 of this document, as are also the limitations on its use. When the SDI function is not required, this field may be occupied by binary zero or valid data pad bits. [2] 
Discretes 
As discussed in Section 2.3.1.2 of this document, unused bits in a word may be assigned to discrete functions, one 
bit per variable.  Bit #11 of the word should be the first to be so assigned, followed by bit #12 and so on, in ascending numerical order, until the data field is reached.  In the absence of discretes, unused bit positions should be occupied by binary zero or valid data pad bits. [3] 
Pad 
All bit positions not used for data or discrete should be filled with binary zero or valid data pad bits.  Section 2.1.2 of this document refers. [4] 
Sign/Status Matrix (SSM) 
Section 2.1.5 of this document describes the functions of the sign/status matrix and the ways in which the bits constituting it are encoded. [5] 
Parity Bit 
This bit is encoded to render word parity odd.  Section 2.3.4 of this document refers.

 NOTES: [1] 
"P" denotes pad "zero" or valid data, see Section 2.1.2.  Note possible use of pad bits for discrete functions per 
Section 2.3.1.2. [2] 
Because of the actual maximum value of the most significant character of these quantities exceeds 7, it cannot 
be encoded in the most significant character position of the BCD word.  For this reason, each quantity has been given an "artificial" MSC of zero and its actual MSC encoded in the next most significant character position of the word.

 NOTES: [1] 
"P" denotes pad "zero" or valid data, see Section 2.1.2.  Note possible use of pad bits for discrete functions per 
Section 2.3.1.2. 
 
[2] 
Negative values are encoded as the two's complements of positive values and the negative sign is annunciated 
in the sign/status matrix. 
 
[3] 
Angles in the range 0 to 180o are encoded as positive numbers.  Angles in the range 180o to 360o are subtracted 
from 360o and the resulting number encoded as a negative value per note 2.  Arc minutes and seconds are 
encoded as decimal degrees.

NOTE: The following information is provided in order to clarify the confusion that existed in the Industry in regards to definition of the SSM for Label 233-236. It is expected that Flight ID will be sourced from FMC EQ ID of 002.  Alternative implementation may include Mode "S" XPDR EQ ID 018.  In this case the user cautioned that the SSM will be BCD format.  See ARINC Characteristic 718A, "Mark 4 Air Traffic Control Transponder (ATCRB/MODE 
S)", Attachment 
3A 
for more detailed information.

11 - CENTER TANK Label 241 is transmitted approximately once per second.  The data encoding depends on the sequence which it is transmitted.  Label 241 transmitting sequence, as defined below, starts with the left main tank data followed by the right main tank and then the center tank.  Once all the tank data has been transmitted (63 words of data), the sequence will 
repeat with word number 1, left main tank, and so on.  To determine the data that is transmitted at any specific time requires knowing where in the following sequence the word is taken.

Horizontal Alarm Limit (HAL) / Horizontal Integrity Threshold The LDPU's optional internal GNSS receiver will generate a horizontal position integrity alarm when the EPU (Estimated Position Uncertainty) exceeds the Horizontal Alarm Limit for a period of time equal to the Time To Alarm for the current phase of flight.  If the value of the HPL (Horizontal Protection Level, label 130) output from the internal GNSS receiver exceeds the horizontal integrity threshold specified in label 124, then horizontal integrity is deemed to be unavailable. In the HAL field, the LSB (bit 16) has a weight of 1 meter, while the MSB (bit 28) has a weight of 4096 m. [3] 
"All Ones" Value for HAL Field If an "all ones" value is encoded into bits 28 to 18, the HAL value should be assumed to be the default value for the phase of flight 
specified in bits 13 to 11.  If the HAL value is "all ones" (8191 meters) and the phase of flight code is "000" ("unspecified") then the 
SSM field should be set to NCD. [4] 
Pad Bits 
 
The pad bits, bits 15 and 14, should be set to 0. [5] 
Phase of Flight The "phase of flight" field, bits 13 to 11, informs an optional GNSS receiver within the LDPU of the current phase of flight, so that 
the GNSS receiver may adjust its internal parameters to meet requirements for that phase of flight.

Vertical Alarm Limit (VAL) / Vertical Integrity Threshold The LDPU's optional internal GNSS receiver will generate a vertical position integrity alarm when the estimated error in vertical position exceeds the Vertical Alarm Limit for longer than the time-to-alarm for the current phase of flight.  (The phase of flight is 
specified in label 124.)  If the value of the VPL (Vertical Protection Level, label 130) output from the internal GNSS receiver exceeds the vertical alarm limit specified in bits 28-21, then vertical position integrity is defined to be "unavailable." The LSB, bit 21, has a weight of 1 meter, while the MSB, bit 28, has a weight of 128 m. [3] 
Pad Bits The pad bits, bits 20 to 11, should be set to 0.

APPENDIX A 
LABORATORY VERIFICATION OF ARINC 429 DITS ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS 
 
 
A1-1.0  Introduction Selection of the electrical characteristics of the Mark 33 DITS followed verification of the suitability of proposed values in 
laboratory tests performed by the Boeing Commercial Airplane Co.  Boeing presented two reports to AEEC's Systems 
Architecture and Interfaces Subcommittee on these activities, one at the meeting held in Arlington, Virginia, in March 1977 and the other at the meeting held in Los Angeles, California, in May 1977.  The material in this Appendix is excerpted from these reports. 
A1-2.0  Electromagnetic Emission and Susceptibility Tests Electromagnetic emission and susceptibility tests were conducted to determine if the proposed 100 kbps waveform was suitable for use in a commercial airplane EMI environment.  The EMI conditions used for the tests were derived from RTCA Document DO-160, "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Electronic/Electrical Equipment 
and Instruments" dated February 28th, 1975. 
A1-2.1  Cable and Test Configuration The cable used for the tests was standard aircraft type twisted shielded wire of 22 AWG.  The wire configuration consisted of approximately 60 ft. of cable which was subjected to the EMI environment within a screened room.  This cable was connected in series with 300 ft. of cable not subjected to the EMI environment.  The test was configured to simulate the maximum length wire run with DO-160 conditions applied. The 60 Ft. length of cable was connected to the transmitter for the emission tests and to the receiver for the susceptibility 
tests. 
A1-2.2  Transmitter Characteristics The block schematic of the bipolar line driving transmitter built for the tests is shown in Figure a-(i).  The waveform was shaped at the pulse generator such that it exhibited the following characteristics:

Risetime = Falltime = l.0 µ sec 


Bit Rate= 100 kilobits/second 


HI time= NULL time= LO time 
A1-2.3  Receiver Input Circuit Description To perform the susceptibility tests, receivers were constructed utilizing various methods of common mode rejection and various processing schemes. 
Differential Amplifier Input.  Figure a-(ii) shows schematics of the differential input stages used for the receivers.  The 
differential amplifier input stage required resistors to local ground at the input to provide a path for the input current for the voltage followers.  Voltage protection was used to prevent damage to the voltage followers in the event of high voltage, common mode spikes.  The voltage follower stages provided a controlled impedance for the differential amplifier stage. 
Opto-Isolator Input  The opto-isolator input stage utilized two H-P 5082-4371 isolators connected in opposite polarity to 
detect the bipolar data.  The HP 5082-4371 input has a forward conduction "knee" at approximately 1.4 volts.  A second simple LED (HP 5082-4650) was connected in series with each opto-isolator to provide a combined knee voltage of approximately 3 volts.  A series resistor RL of 1000 ohms was placed in series with the LED/opto-isolator network to limit the receiver current to 7mA at 10 volts (differential) applied at the input.  At 4.5V differential on the line, one opto-isolator 
conducts 1.5 mA. One circuit configuration which enables the opto-isolator to operate at 100 kilobits per second at these low input currents is shown in figure a-(iii).  A potential of +15 volts is applied to pin 8 to provide maximum gain in the first transistor.  During 
conduction, a charge on the second transistor is discharged via pin 7 and R2 to a potential of +0.5 volts set by R1 and R3. Discharging to a +0.5 volt potential reduces the possibility of a loss of the first bit following a long null period.  This problem has been observed when discharging pin 7 to ground potential.

A1-2.4  Receiver Data Detection Technique Two data detection schemes were used, (i) data sampling (sample and decision) and (ii) integrate and dump (Figure a-(iv). 

 
The data sampling system detects positive-going or negative-going edges which exceed ±3 volts differential voltage.  
The edges cause a timing circuit to time for approximately 2 µsec.  When the timing circuit has timed out, a sample of the input is taken.  If the sample is HI, a ONE is declared.  If the sample is LO, a ZERO is declared.  If the sample is NULL, and error diagnostic can be output, since a NULL state is known to be invalid at the data sampling time.  An error diagnostic will be output if, for example, during a period of NULL on the line, a short-duration noise spike causes the input to exceed the ±3V threshold, so initiating the edge detector timing circuit, but dissipates rapidly so that a NULL is estimated at the data sampling time. The integrate-and-dump processor circuit detects positive or negative-going edges which exceed the ±3V differential threshold.  The edge detection causes an integration circuit to integrate the input voltage for a period of 5 µsec.  The output of the integrator is sampled (timing is derived from the edge detector) at the end of the integration period.  If it is above zero voltage, a ONE is declared; if it is below zero voltage, a ZERO is declared. A threshold level could be introduced about zero voltage to provide an indication of the total energy contained in the pulse.  If the integrator output fell within the threshold, an error diagnostic could be presented indicating the at the detection of the bit was marginal. 

A1-2.5  Test Data Message The test waveform was a continuous pseudo-random bit pattern.  This continuous pattern did not test the initial synchronization or "false-alarm" aspects in a word-by-word transmission environment with NULL on the transmission line between words.

The interference measured was within the limits specified in DO-160 Figure 21-5. It should be noted that the 20dB limit exceedance permitted in DO 160 was not taken.  The transmitter output spectrum can be further improved by the addition of filtering to attenuate output frequencies above those of interest in the digital data.

A1-3.0  Pulse Distortion Tests For Typical Aircraft wire Installations Laboratory testing and computer simulation studies were conducted to investigate the pulse distortion introduced on typical aircraft wire installations. A1-3.1  Laboratory Tests Receivers and a transmitter were constructed to operate using the DITS high speed (100 KBPS) waveform.  Lengths of twisted shielded cable were connected to form a representative wiring configuration for digital data.  The wire length and stub configuration were selected to represent postulated installations on a B747 airplane.  The cable used for lab tests was 20 and 22 AWG twisted shielded cable with wrapped KAPTON insulation, no. BMS B-51, Class 2 type III.  The pulse distortion at the receiver nodes of the wiring systems were recorded.  The characteristics of the 20 AWG cable were measured and used to develop the cable model used in the computer simulation. 

A1-3.2  Computer Simulation A computer program was developed to evaluate pulse distortion on lines with stubs.  The DITS transmitter impedance and voltage waveform was modeled.  The cable model was developed from the measured cable characteristics.  The DITS receiver input impedance was modeled. The computer simulation was run and results were plotted for various line length and stub configurations representing postulated installations on a B747 airplane. 

A1-3.3  Results The results of the laboratory tests and computer simulation for the same cable configuration showed good agreement, with a maximum difference of 0.4 volts on rising and falling edges.  The computer simulation showed slightly higher cable loss effect than the lab test.  The lab test results were recorded using an oscilloscope camera; the computer results were plotted.  Only the plotted results are presented here.

## Appendix B An Approach To A Hybrid Broadcast-Command/Response Data Bus Architecture

A2-1.0  Introduction 
 
During the time that the broadcast approach to digital information transfer became established in the air transport industry, the military aviation community adopted a command/response time division multiplex technique as its standard. In this approach, all aircraft systems needing to exchange digital data are connected to a common bus and a dedicated "bus controller" determines which of them may output data on to the bus at any given time. MIL STD 1553 was written to describe this system. The airlines considered adopting MIL STD 1553, or something like it, for use on post-1980 new civil aircraft types but found the multiplex technique to be inappropriate for such applications. In civil avionics systems, data typically flows from a given source to a single sink, or group of sinks which may be connected in a parallel, and these sinks are typically not themselves data sources. Thus there is no need for the data transfer system to provide the capability for every unit of every avionics system to both talk and listen to every other unit. The broadcast technique is adequate, and thus the airlines elected to stay with it for their new DITS. Another development in this same time frame has been the increased use by the military, particularly in transport aircraft, of avionics equipment designed originally for the airlines. This trend may be expected to continue and so give rise to the need to interface equipment providing Mark 33 DITS I/0 capability with a MIL STD 1553A data bus system. The material in this Appendix prepared by the Information Engineering Division of the USAF Directorate of Avionics Engineering describes one way of doing this, using a data exchange buffer to compensate for the electrical, logic and timing differences between the two systems. 

A2-2.0  Suggested Mark 33 DITS/MIL STD 1553A Interface The following is a proposed method for interfacing an avionic system employing sensors designed for any combination of ARINC Mark 33 DITS and MIL-STD-1553A. This method minimizes message related differences and compensates for electrical, logic and timing differences in a Data Exchange Buffer (DEB). In a hybrid system such as shown in Figure b-(i), a signal may originate in either a DITS type subsystem or a 1553A subsystem and may be destined for either type of terminal. DITS data received by a DEB is momentarily stored and then retransmitted, complete with label, to the 1553A bus controller. The bus controller determines the intended destinations from the label and look-up table. For DITS destinations, the word is retransmitted, as received, to the appropriate DEB. For 
1553A destinations, the data may be retransmitted as received or reformatted, as required by the destination subsystem. Reformatting could involve removal of label and reversing of bit order (MSB vs LSB first). Figure b-(ii) shows the handling of a word originating in the destined for DITS terminals. Upon arrival at the appropriate destination DEB, the data is momentarily stored and then retransmitted in DITS format, complete with label, to the destination subsystem. If all labels in the system are unique, all receivers in all subsystems associated with a DEB may be connected in parallel. Only the data with the proper label will be recognized by each receiver. If labels are not unique, the DEB must have separate transmitters to transmit the data with identical labels. The desired transmitter could be specified in the 1553A subaddress field. 

The retransmission of the data by the DEB allows inherently for different electrical and logical characteristics. The storage of the data allows for simultaneous reception from multiple receivers (DITS and 1553A) and retransmission when the desired bus is available. The much higher speed of 1553A would make retransmission delays small. Figure b-(iii) illustrates the organization of a minimum system. It consists of multiple DITS receivers dumping received data into a first-in first-out (FIFO) stack, available as single LSI chips. The received data is temporarily stored and then retransmitted by the 1553A terminal. Data received via 1553A is dumped into another FIFO for retransmission by a DITS transmitter. The hardware consists only of DITS receivers, the 1553A terminal, the DITS transmitter, and as many FIFO's as are required. Hand-shaking signals available on the FIFO's eliminate almost all supporting SSI chips. This entire system would probably fit on one full ATR card or less. Figure b-(iv) illustrates possible organization for a more sophisticated DEB. It consists of an many DITS transmitters and receivers as necessary, a single (internally redundant) 1553A remote terminal, a buffer memory, a controller (microprocessor), and a program for the controller contained in ROM. Whenever a complete, valid word is available at a receiver, the controller is notified. When the parallel data bus becomes available, the word is transferred to memory. When the desired transmitter (DITS or 1553A) becomes available, the data word is routed from memory to the transmitter. The low rate of DITS terminals (minimum 320 microsec/word) would result in a very low loading of the parallel bus and controller. The speed of the 1553A terminal might necessitate a direct memory access arrangement. The controller, the program memory, the buffer memory and a dual 1553A remote terminal would probably fit on one one-sided 3/4 ATR card. The required ARINC transmitters and receivers would probably fit on another card. This method represents one way of constructing a hybrid system. The retransmission of the label with the data greatly reduces the intelligence required by the DEB but increases bus loading. A more intelligent DEB, perhaps located in the bus controller, could achieve much higher efficiencies. 

## Appendix C Digital Systems Guidance (Part 1)

There is nothing uniquely digital in this area.  Here our concern is with those characteristics that are most often used in linear system stability analysis - namely gain and phase characteristics.  We recognize at the outset that all sensor systems are not 100% linear but this does not prevent us from defining a linear model of sufficient quality to support stability analyses.   It is useful to consider here that generally the sensor will be wideband relative to the band of frequencies of interest to the control system.  This is necessary from a stability point of view since the converse (that is, signals narrowband relative to the control band) would introduce excessive phase lag in the control band.  Thus far we have implicitly considered both bandpass and lowpass centered at zero frequency.  For simplicity, however, the discussion below will assume low pass sensor characteristics but the ideas apply generally.  Figure 1 illustrates an assumed sensor characteristic. 

Gain and Phase Constraints Note that prime concerns are that the gain remain essentially constant through the control band and that the phase be bounded by a linear characteristic through the control band.  From a control law stability point of view, we are not concerned with what happens at frequencies above the control band because these are beyond the range where the data is being used by the control system.  If we consider open loop Bode plots broken at the sensor output, the control band as used above should be wide enough to include the phase crossover as well as the gain crossover.  The phase and gain characteristics provide information about phase and gain margin degradation.  For most sensors the gain crossover in typical control laws is known approximately.  Phase crossover is not as easily determined.  A reasonable first cut would be to define the control band as approximately ten times the open loop crossover frequency with the expectation  
that beyond this range control law gain is low enough to prevent gain margin

The discussion below summarizes concepts that have grown out of an in-house effort   to   determine  what  parameter  characteristics   Collins feels  should   be included  in the data  standards tables of ARINC   Bus Specification  429 (DITS). 

The DITS specification seems to be evolving as more than merely a digital bus description since in many ways it is taking on the characteristics of a system interface specification.  This raises philosophical questions concerning those characteristics, which should appear in the individual equipment specifications versus those which should appear in "429".   The authors cannot resolve such partitioning questions.  Hopefully we can contribute, as outlined below, to an understanding of what information is required by control systems designers to achieve an acceptable system performance.  The detailed discussion in this paper evolves a set of terms (outlined below) which are usable in a specification. Which of these terms appear in the individual equipment specifications and which appear in "429" remains to be determined. 

 
At the present time, it is suggested that control system designers interfacing with digitally bused data should be concerned with three prime areas: stability considerations, signal degradation, and spectral characteristics.  Without these elements of information, thorough analysis of system performance will not be possible.   
 
The following eight parameter characteristics should prove adequate for the minimal control of interfacing considerations.

problems.  However, some sensors may have trouble holding a tight gain (and 
phase) spec over this wide a bandwidth.  Possibly in these cases a loosening of the 
spec between open loop crossover and ten times open loop crossover may be 
required.  With this kind of specification a simple transport delay in combination 
with a gain change can be used for stability analysis or, for slightly more complex 
cases, simple transfer functions can be used to approximately fit the spec.  The 
important point here is not to constrain the sensor designer to a first order or 
second order or any specific implementation, but to rather bound in a simple yet 
usable sense the stability degradation the sensor can introduce.  The important 
stability characteristics are defined concisely below. 
 
 
- 
Control Band - That band of frequencies over which magnitude and phase 
characteristics of the sensor are important to the control system stability. 
 
- 
Magnitude Constraint - The bounds (envelope) on the permissible gain 
variation in a linear frequency response sense that are permissible over the 
control band. 
 
- 
Phase Constraint - The bounds (envelope) on the permissible phase variation 
in a linear frequency response sense that are permissible over the control 
band.

These quantities could be measured by providing a sinusoidal input stimuli at selected frequencies in the control band using a mid-range amplitude.  At each frequency the output component of interest (assuming some distortion) will be the output component whose frequency corresponds to the input frequency.  The phase and amplitude of this component of this component relative to the forcing function will provide the magnitude and phase information.  In the terminology of nonlinear system analysis, this procedure yields and empirically derived describing function for the sensor over the control band.  If amplitude dependent nonlinearities are severe, more than one amplitude of forcing function may have to be used with the procedure repeated at each amplitude. 

## Iii.  Signal Degradation

 
In this area we are concerned with what the sensor may have done to degrade the signal.  The thrust here is not stability but performance.  Figure 2 presents a view of sensor and signal characteristics that is useful in this context.  In Figure 2 some important sources of signal degradation are illustrated.    The term "noise" is used somewhat loosely in Figure 2 to denote degradation sources.  Process noise and installation noise are inherent in the signal impinging on the sensor - the former being things such as gust noise and beam noise and the latter being effects such as EMI, mounting errors, etc.  Within the sensor itself there is internally generated noise such as shot noise from resistors, EMI from digital buses, etc. that is independent of the input signal.  In a radio receiver this is the kind of noise that is measured at the output when the input is shorted.  Note that this "noise" can also include bias and drift effects.  If there is a digital sampling process in the sensor, some aliasing of the input signal spectrum will occur.  This aliased energy may also be regarded as noise. 

 
The other inherent sensor degradation is more difficult to deal with, however, for it is signal dependent.  A familiar analog example is input amplitude dependent characteristics such as saturation effects that only become significant above certain input amplitudes.  Another is nonlinearities that produce harmonic distortion under sine wave excitation as shown in the example below. 

## Appendix C Digital Systems Guidance (Part 1)

To evaluate the spectral characteristics of measurement error will require tests which force the system with noise type inputs.  Exponentially correlated noise of specified variance and correlation time (or bandwidth) should be sufficient in most cases.  If a sensor is known to be susceptible to a specific type of noise, however, that noise should be included in the test.  Often it will be useful to separate out the low frequency or d-c components of measurement error since these may be more tolerable in some applications than dynamic errors.  A set of tests that will measure these characteristics is described below. 

Force the sensor with random noise of specified rms value (σ) and correlation time (τ).  Determine the power spectral density (PSD) of the input signal to the sensor.  Determine the PSD of the measurement error.  Plot the two PSD's on a common plot as shown in Figure 3.  Define a modified signal to noise ratio 
(which will be a function of frequency) as the square root of noise ratio at each frequency of signal PSD amplitude to measurement error PSD.  Note in the example shown in Figure 3 there is a bulge in the measurement error around zero frequency.  This effect would indicate d-c bias and possibly low frequency bias drift from the sensor.  This effect may or may not be important depending on whether the application permits washing out low frequency components, e.g. in a complementary filter.  In the range of frequencies where accurate sensor response is required, it is suggested that appropriate values for the modified signal to noise 
(MSN) will be 100 to 1000.  Roughly, these numbers correspond to noise power being 1% to .1% of signal power at each frequency or noise being 40 to 60 db down from signal.  The relationship between MSD and ordinary signal to noise can be understood by assuming both signal and noise PSD's are flat over a band of frequencies ∆w as shown in Figure 3.  Let the value of the signal PSD in this band be So, then rms signal power in the band ∆w is given by  So*w.  Similarly, rms error power is given by  Po*w .     Therefore conventional signal to noise over the band w is given by      .  Requiring that this signal to noise be 100 is equivalent to requiring that noise power be 1% of signal power over  this band. 

Carrying this back to the MSN implies that MSN (w) =        = 100 over the band 
∆w. The above also represents the motivation for considering square root of the ratio than the ratio directly. 

 
Harmonic Distortion 
 
 
Consider square law distortion in an otherwise linear sensor.  Let the sensor  
output be y(t) = x(t) + kx(t)² 
 
Where x(t) is the sensor input and let x(t) = sinwt.  Then 
 
 
y(t) = sinwt + ksin²wt Note that d.c. and second harmonic components as well as the forcing frequency appear at the output.  In digital systems a similar effect occurs when multiple rates are introduced, such as signals being received at one rate from a digital bus and being used at a different rate by a software program.  If the analog signals originally sampled and put on the bus were sinusoidal at one frequency then, in general, frequency components less than and greater than the input frequency (as well as the input frequency) appear after the second sampler.  The amplitude and number of these spurious outputs is a function of the two sampling rates as well as the input frequency.  The net effect of all such internal sensor effects is observable by subtracting sensor input from sensor output to yield measurement error as shown in Figure 2. 

 
Measurement Error 
 
The involved nature of what can happen to the signal within the sensor as shown in Figure 2 is the source of ambiguity in conventional "accuracy" specs.  Since measurement noise can be dependent on input amplitude as well as spectral characteristics, it is not possible to specify it with a single and simple metric.  It should also be apparent that measurement error must be addressed statistically since a significant portion of the input, process noise, is only describable as a random process.1  Technically the input signal is also in general a random processes influenced by such things as the gust striking the aircraft.  Gusts also can only be described as random processes. 

 
The approach described above tests for input frequency dependent degradations by providing a realistic input spectrum.  It should be realized that if there are amplitude dependent degradations, the MSN analysis will yield different answers depending on the rms value of the input noise.  It is suggested that the MSN 
measurement be done with worst case input noise, i.e., largest rms and bandwidth

1 Recognizing that a complete description of a random process includes not only probability distributions but also spectral characteristics. 

## Appendix C Digital Systems Guidance (Part 1) Potential Measurement Technique

Modified Signal to Noise (MSN) determination requires assuming a random process model for the signal impinging on the sensor.  Normally an exponentially correlated signal with specified variance will be sufficient.  Empirically determined power spectral densities (using discrete Fourier Transform techniques) will need to be measured for input signal as well as measurement error.  Static accuracy measurement was described above. 

 
IV. 

Spectral Characteristics 
 
In this area the digital nature of the system interface must be faced squarely.  The control system designer cannot alter the signal degradation introduced by that will be encountered.  In some cases alternate MSN specs for different flight regimes may be appropriate. 

 
 
In many cases a more explicit presentation of the amplitude dependent nonlinearities may be desirable.  A good example here is localizer receiver linearity, specified as being linear within a given percentage up to .155 DDM, a larger percentage from .155 to .310 DDM and not decreasing between .310 and .400 
DDM.  Such a specification is important in defining localizer capture laws, where one can begin "using" the signal crudely before it is linear or precisely accurate. It should be noted that this is a slightly different use of sensor data than for precise state control, i.e. the control is carrying the system to a prescribed state rather than maintaining it at a prescribed state in the presence of noise.  Normally the latter operation will require more accurate information from the sensor.  The amplitude dependent degradations should be measured statically -- that is, one should provide a test input at specified amplitude, allow transients to settle, and measure the output value. 

 
The important signal degradation terms are defined concisely below.  Only the last two are proposed as parameter characteristics--the first three being definitions to clarify the last two. 

- 
Measurement Error - The difference between the signal impinging on the sensor and the output representation of that signal by the sensor expressed in consistent units. 

- 
Signal PSD (SPSD) - The power spectral density of the signal impinging on the sensor. 

- 
Measurement Error PSD (MEPSD) - The power spectral density of measurement error introduced by the sensor. 

- 
Modified Signal to Noise Ratio - A measure primarily of the spectral characteristics of sensor errors defined as the square root of the ratio of SPSD and MEPSD at each frequency in the control band. 

- 
Static Accuracy - A measure of the amplitude dependent 
characteristics of sensor errors defined as the difference between 
input and output signals after all transients have settled. 

## Appendix C Digital Systems Guidance (Part 1)

Adequate roll off chracteristic of the digitally bused data reduces the aliasing problem of the second sampler if the second sampling is properly performed. 

However, not only this spectrum but also the frequency F1 enters into the aliasing in F2 (s), therefore, it is desirable also to carefully specify F1.  This will be accomplished through the update interval.  Assuming F2 is somewhat fixed by computer speed and loading considerations, aliasing can be minimized for a given input spectrum by making F1 as high relative to F2 as possible. 

 
The important spectral characteristic terms are defined concisely below. 

Update Interval - The cyclic time interval, as measured at the DITS bus interface, between transmissions of new freshly sensed and converted/derived values of the parameter.  
the sensor whether it be due to nonlinearities, aliasing, noise, etc.  He has great potential, however, for making matters worse if he is not alert to potential aliasing problems that he may introduce.  To analyze aliasing precisely he would need a precise definition of the spectrum of each signal being received on the digital bus including the update interval for each signal.  A more practical approach is to place an upper bound on the received signal spectrum and then ensure downstream performance is adequate using this bound as the signal spectrum.  
These ideas are made more precise below. 

 
Multirate Sampling 
 
A simple model for signals received from a bus and used in a digital processor is shown in Figure 4.  We note that the spectrum of the signal on the bus, F1 (s), is an infinitely replicated version of the analog input spectrum with replicas spaced by the input sampling frequency F1.   We cannot, therefore, speak of the bandwidth of F1 (s) strictly.  What we mean here is that a bound is required on each copy in F1 (s).  Deriving the spectrum of the signal F2 (s) is beyond the scope of this discussion but a technique has been developed that will yield this spectrum, F2 (s), given the quantities F1,  F2,   and the shape of the repeated spectrum of F (s) in F1 
(s).  There is considerable spreading of signal energy in this process with considerable "aliasing" potential even if the quantity fc in Figure 4 is much less than the Nyquist frequency for both F1  and   F2.     The "aliasing" in the spectrum F2 (s) occurs because the second sampler is not operating on a properly band limited function (see Figure 4) due to the "infinite replica" nature of the spectrum F2 (s). 

Deterministic Versus Random Signals 
 
The discussion above did not specify whether the original analog quantity was a deterministic signal or a random process.  For deterministic cases we deal with the Fourier transforms of the signals involved.  However, as pointed out in Section III the signals of interest are really describable only in terms of random processes.  For this case the development must proceed in terms of power spectral density of the signals involved.  Figure 5 then illustrates the bound on bused signal PSD that is envisioned.  Recall that white noise through a lowpass filter yields a PSD that rolls off at 40 db/decade as shown below.

DESIGN PARAMETERS FOR DIGITAL AVIONIC SYSTEMS 
Prepared by Boeing Commercial Airplane Company REVISION A 
Summary 
 
This paper explains the necessity for defining presampling filter characteristics, transport delays and minimum update rates for digital and noise characteristics are discussed.  A design procedure for selecting the required filter characteristic and update rate is presented. 

Introduction The new generation of commercial aircraft will use digital technology to implement many functions, which were traditionally performed with analog hardware.  These functions include inner and outer servo loops for aircraft control and guidance, processing and filtering signals from navigation and other sensors, and filtering of data prior to its display on cockpit instruments.  Digital technology will also replace the majority of the formerly analog communication paths between systems, sensors, instruments and actuators. 

 
A basic property of these and other digital systems is that they only process or transfer values of data from discrete points in time.  The contrast between the discrete time nature of a digital system and the continuous time nature of an analog system is shown in Figure 1.  Analog systems are said to operate in the continuous time domain while digital systems are said to operate in the discrete time domain. 

 
In order for discrete time digital systems to be used to process or transfer the inherently continuous time data from real world physical systems, samples of the continuous data must be taken at periodic intervals.  These samples from discrete points in time can then be used as the input to the discrete time digital system.  It is intuitively obvious that the interval between samples affects the accuracy with which the continuous time data is represented by the discrete samples.  It is also obvious that rapidly varying signals should be sampled more often than slowly varying signals in order to maintain an adequate representation of the continuous analog data.  Selection of a proper sampling rate for each signal is a design task unique to digital systems.  An understanding of the Sampling Theorem is necessary in order to make the proper trade offs between sampling rate, signal-to-noise ratio, signal delay, and system complexity.

Dear Rick: 
 
The enclosed paper is a revised version of "Design Parameters for Digital Avionic Systems," which was originally circulated with AEEC letter 79-
022/SAI-99.  The revision addresses the topic of aliasing which could occur when reducing the sampling rate of a digitally encoded signal.  This topic was discussed at the DITS working group meeting held on April 18 
and 19.

effect of aliasing and they each result in some negative impact on the overall system. 

 
An increase in the sampling rate requires more computations to be done in a given period of time.  This requires more computational resources, which increases the weight, complexity, and power requirements of the computer subsystems.  The use of a presampling filter to limit the bandwidth prior to sampling distorts the signal.  It also increases the delay experienced by signals as they propagate through the system.  The increase in delay reduces phase margin if the signal is used in a closed loop control system.  Therefore, more stringent delay requirements must be placed on other components in the loop if the system phase margin is to remain constant. 

 
Design Tradeoffs for Digital Avionics Systems 
 
The final choices of sample rate and presampling filter depend upon the input signal and noise spectra, maximum allowable signal-to-noise ratio degradation due to aliasing, maximum allowable transport delay, available computational resources, and the bandwidth of the system which uses the data.  A practical way to make these choices is to analyze the system for various sample rates and filters.  This can best be done with the aid of a computer program which computers the effect of each combination of sample rate and filter characteristic on the output signal-to-noise ratio for the defined input signal and noise spectra. 

 
 
The initial computation is to determine the effect of the prefilter on the inband signal-to-noise ratio without regard to aliasing effects.  A typical plot of signal-to-noise ratio versus presampling filter bandwidth is shown in the top curve of Figure 6.  This curve forms a baseline against which signal-to-noise ratio degradation caused by aliasing can be compared.  
The signal-to-noise ratio is determined by computing the input signal power and input noise power, which is passed by the selected prefilter.  
This parameter will generally exhibit a peak value at a specific bandwidth.  
The signal-to-noise ratio will decrease with increasing bandwidth as more noise is admitted and decrease with decreasing bandwidth as signal energy is eliminated. 

 
 
The filter order is an important design parameter because higher order filters roll off more rapidly near the cutoff frequency.  Therefore higher order filters admit less noise and signal from beyond the cutoff frequency than low order filters.  Because of this characteristic, high order filters alias no more noise into the signal than slightly narrower bandwidth low order filters.  However, high order filters delay the signal more than low order filters. 

 
 
The ultimate objective of the design task discussed in this paper is to achieve acceptable system performance with the minimum possible

The Sampling Theorem 
 
The Sampling Theorem states that a signal which contains no frequency components higher than fo  Hertz can be exactly recovered from a set of its samples if the samples are spaced no further apart than ½ fo  seconds.  This is equivalent to requiring that the sampling frequency be greater than twice the highest frequency component of the signal. 

 
The reason for this requirement can be shown by examing the frequency spectrum of the sampler output.  Modeling the sampling operation as the multiplication of the input signal by an impulse train as shown in Figure 2 
allows the sampler output spectrum to be computed from a Fourier Transform identity.  The required identity states that time domain multiplication is equivalent to frequency domain convolution.  Therefore, the output spectrum is found by convolving the input spectrum with the spectrum of the impulse train.  This relationship is shown in Figure 3.  
The convolution operation has the effect of reproducing the spectrum of the input signal about zero frequency and at all harmonics of the sampling frequency.  If the sampling frequency, 1/Ts, is greater than twice fo the spectral components centered about the sampling frequency and its harmonics will not overlap the spectral component centered about zero frequency.  Therefore, the spectral component centered about zero, which is identical to the input spectrum, can be obtained by passing the sampled output through a low pass filter with a bandwidth of fo Hz. 

 
Application of the Sampling Theorem to Digital Avionics Systems 
 
The discussion of the Sampling Theorem in the preceding section has shown that a signal which contains no frequency components higher than fo Hz. can be exactly represented by a series of samples spaced no further apart than ½ fo seconds.  However, signals, which represent physical quantities, such as those processed by avionic systems never satisfy the strict bandwidth limitation requirement stated above.  Therefore exact reproduction of the original signal from its samples is not possible.  The effect of the non-bandlimited nature of signals is to distort the replica reconstructed from the samples.  The shaded area shown in Figure 4 
represents typical high frequency signal energy which distorts the low frequency portion of the signal spectrum.  The high frequency portion of the signal takes on the identity of the lower frequencies, hence the name 
"aliasing" for this phenomenon. 

 
Aliasing becomes a greater problem when the signal is corrupted by noise, which has a wider bandwidth than the signal.  When this occurs both signal energy and noise energy which is beyond one half of the sampling frequency is aliased into the low frequency portion of the recovered signal.  This effect is shown in Figure 5.  The signal-to-noise ratio is degraded by both noise and signal components which are aliased into the low frequency portion of the signal spectrum.  The effect of aliasing can be decreased by sampling the incoming signal at a higher rate and/or using a presampling filter to reduce the bandwidth of the signal prior to sampling.  Neither of these approaches can ever completely eliminate the

due to aliasing.  Signal and noise spectra of the signal to be sampled must be supplied as an input to the design procedure.

sampling rate.  System performance is adversely affected by large propagation delays and high in-band noise levels. 

 
If the maximum allowable propagation delay is given, the minimum usable filter bandwidth can be found standard plots of group delay versus frequency for the type and order of filter considered.   (See for example Reference 1, page 112.)  This minimum bandwidth is plotted on Figure 6 
as a vertical line.  The maximum achievable signal-to-noise ratio is constrained by the requirement for a presampling filter wide enough to limit delay to the given value.  The intersection of the minimum bandwidth line with the top curve of Figure 6 gives the maximum achievable signal-to-noise ratio i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio which would be achieved by an unsampled system. 

 
Sampling rate is chosen by comparing the maximum acceptable degradation in signal-to-noise ratio to the actual aliasing degradation due to sampling at the candidate rates.  For the example shown in Figure 6, a sampling rate of 50Hz would be chosen. 

 
A system interface which meets prescribed limits on signal delay and maximum noise due to aliasing can be designed using the procedures outlined above.  Some systems which use sampled data, such as closed loop control systems, have a bandwidth which is much smaller than that of the sampling filter.  For this reason it is important to verify that the signal and noise power which is aliased into the frequency band of interest is well below the inherent noise in that band. 

 
This can be accomplished by constructing a signal and noise power spectral density plot for the filter and sampling rate chosen.  The power spectral density plot is most easily obtained with the aid of a computer program.  A typical plot of this type is shown in Figure 7.  The example power spectral densities in Figure 7 show that the aliased signal and noise is much lower than the inherent noise level in the frequency range of interest.  If this constraint is not met a different combination of filter and sampling frequency must be chosen. 

 
In some situations it may be desired to reduce the sampling rate of a digitally encoded signal.  This may be done where wideband digital data is used to drive an instrument or subsystem which responds only to narrower bandwidth data.  Simple deletion of unwanted samples to reduce the sampling rate can cause aliasing problems similar to those encountered when sampling an analog signal at an insufficient rate.  The aliasing can be elimination of the unwanted samples.  Design of the digital filter is subject to the same set of delay versus aliasing noise tradeoffs as the design of an analog presampling filter. 

 
Conclusion 
 
The procedures outlined in this paper can be used to choose the presampling filter and sampling rate required for interfaces to a digital signal processing or control system.  The values are chosen to meet the constraints of maximum allowable delay and maximum allowable noise

APPENDIX E 
GUIDELINES FOR LABEL ASSIGNMENTS The ARINC 429 data bus was developed to provide a standardized means of digital information transfer between the "ARINC 700" series of avionics units. ARINC 429 has proven to be a very flexible standard and its usage has extended to provide data transfer between Line Replaceable Units (LRU) which are not otherwise covered by ARINC Characteristics. It 
is important that each new usage of ARINC 429 be coordinated and indexed by ARINC such that the information on usage 
(label allocation, data format, etc.) is available industry-wide. The use of the same label for two different functions on a 
particular LRU type built by different manufacturers can create serious problems. To facilitate the coordination of ARINC 429 label usage between the industry and the ARINC staff, a set of guidelines is provided. 1. 
New labels should be selected from the five character field as defined in Section 2.3 (three octal and three 
hexadecimal). 2. 
The following labels have special significance and should not be used: label 000 (not used) and label 377 
(equipment identification).  The preferred SSM encoding for method for the Equipment Identification Word (label 377) is according to the Discrete word guidelines. When this label was originally assigned, it was recognized as a non-BNR word. The SSM encoding was according to the BCD and DISC guidelines that were identical at that time. During development of Supplement 4, the SSM for DISC was revised to it current form to provide enhanced failure warning. When the SSM encoding was changed, some systems retained the BCD encoding for the Equipment Identification word and others changed to DISC encoding. 3. 
The following labels are presently "spare" and should only be used for new parameters which may have very widespread usage throughout the airplane architecture.

Where possible, similar word usage should be "grouped"; for example, if Engine N 1 is to be provided from a new 
unit (PMUX) it should utilize label 246 which is presently N 1 (engine direct). 5. 
Where possible, grouped usage should have identical data specification (units, range, significant digits/bits, positive 
sense, resolution, min--max transmit interval). To facilitate this commonality it is permissible for a particular LRU to output a lower resolution signal (fewer significant digits/bits) if the least significant remainder of the data field is set to zeros. 6. 
Where word grouping is not possible, the labels should be selected from the following subgroups: 
Binary coded decimal (BCD) sub-group  001 to 067, 125, 165, 170, 200, 201,230 to 237. 
 
 
Binary (BNR) subgroup  070 to 124, 126 to 144, 150 to 154, 162 to 164, 166, 167, 171 to 177, 202 to 227, 240 to 257, 262 to 265, 267, 310 to 347, 360 to 376.

The data should be fully defined by Equipment ID and the label and the Source Destination Indicator (SDI). It should not be necessary to decode additional bits in the word to correctly interpret the data field. 9. 
The equipment ID should be allocated as the two least significant digits of the 7XX ARINC equipment specification, if one exists. For equipment not otherwise covered by an ARINC Specification, an equipment ID should be allocated with a non-numeric value of the hexadecimal character set as the least significant digit. 10.

X-l.0  Chronology 
 
AEEC established the Systems Architecture and Interfaces (SAI) Subcommittee in 1975 to develop the air transport 
industry's approach to digital avionics systems architecture, to define digital system interface standards. With respect to this 
last-named, the Subcommittee soon determined that the industry's previous approaches to digital information transfer, described in ARINC Specification 419, "Digital Data System Compendium", needed rationalization and modernization to be applicable in the future digital systems world. However, this work was not started immediately because of the need to concentrate on the more basic tasks related to digital systems architecture. About a year later, AEEC deemed it timely to start the spec-writing for a digital automatic flight control system based on the system architecture concepts developed by the SAI Subcommittee. The Subcommittee AEEC established to do this began its 
work in January 1977. Part of this activity was the definition of black box interface standards, and this brought into sharp 
focus the need for the new digital information transfer system to be properly specified. The SAI Subcommittee immediately began to devote time to the discussion of the issues involved to give direction to the Digital Information Transfer System (DITS) working group it set up to develop a spec draft. This group met early in April 1977, and produced a draft which the full Subcommittee reviewed at its meeting in May. A second working group meeting during the period of that Subcommittee meeting, followed by a third in mid-June, produced the second draft of the spec. This draft was submitted to AEEC for adoption, which was achieved at the Summer 1977 General Session in July. The spec adopted by AEEC contained details of numeric data (BNR and BCD) transfer only. The SAI Subcommittee notified AEEC of its intent to broaden the scope of the document to cover alpha/numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) and graphic data handling also. These subjects would be addressed in a Supplement to the spec which AEEC would be asked to approve at a later date.

MARK 33 DIGITAL INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM (DITS) 
Published: June 1, 1978 
 
A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement adds to Specification 429 material related to the transfer of graphic and ISO alphabet No. 5 encoded alpha/numeric data by the Mark 33 DITS.  Also, it clarifies the purpose of the SDI function, adds BCD and BNR numeric data encoding examples to Attachment 6 and introduces two Appendices into the Specification. 

 
B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c-1" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace. The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-1 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C.

INTRODUCED BY THIS SUPPLEMENT This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is identified by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification, or by the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Specification is reproduced for reference. 

1.3.2  ISO Alphabet No. 5 Data Transfer Existing text supplemented - no other changes. 

 
1.3.3  Graphic Data Transfer New section added by this Supplement. 

2.1.2  Information Element 
 
COMMENTARY 
 
revised to improved clarity of opening sentence, and to modify the statement concerning the BCD- encoding of latitude and longitude as a consequence of the clarification of the use priorities for bit nos. 9 and 10 introduced into Section 2.1.4 by this Supplement. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS To permit the use of common hardware elements for the transmission of BNR and BCD numeric data, the format for the Mark 33 DITS BCD word differs from that used formerly for this type of data.  Bit no. 32 is assigned to parity, bit nos. 31 and 30 to the sign/status matrix, bit no. 29 is the most significant bit of the data field, and the maximum decimal value of the most significant character is 7.  Previously, the BCD word contained no parity bit, the sign/status matrix occupied bit nos. 32 and 31, bit no. 30 was the most significant data bit and the maximum decimal value of the most significant character was 3. This format made the word 8-bit byte oriented with respect to the data.  This characteristic is not retained in the Mark 33 system. Also, the Mark 33 BCD word will not accommodate latitude and longitude to the formerly specified resolution of 0.1 minute of arc.  If BCD transmission of these quantities in required, either the resolution must be decreased or the word must be restructured.  
Restructuring involves limiting the maximum decimal value of the most significant character to 1, moving the remaining BCD characters towards the MSB by two bit positions and using bit nos. 9 and 10 for data instead of reserving them for source/destination identification encoding per Section 2.1.4 of this document.  It is probable, however, that future latitude and longitude displays will not be the simple, dedicated read-out type for which BCD data is intended.  More likely is the use of some form of multiple-message display, such as a CRT, which will be backed by its own data processor and prefer inputs of BNR data.  If this proves to be the case, there will be no problem! 

2.1.3  Information Identifier Text expanded to explain differing roles of label codes in numeric (BCD/BNR) and alpha/numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) data transfer.  "Special Note" added. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS The first eight bits of each word are assigned to a label function so that the data contained in the word may be identified.  Label code assignments are set forth in the table of Attachment 1 to this document. 

2.1.4  Source/Destination Identifier Section modified to indicate that bit nos. 9 & 10 are not available for the SDI function in DITS words employed for graphic and ISO Alphabet No. 5 data transfer, or in BNR/BCD words in which bit nos. 9 and 10 are needed for valid data in order to achieve the desired resolution. Code table revised and function application more fully described.  Consequential revisions to Commentary. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS Bit nos. 9 & 10 of the word should be reserved for a data source/destination identification function.  This function may find application when specific words need to be directed to a specific system of a multi-system installation or when the source system of a multi-system installation needs to be recognizable from the word content.  When the source/destination identifier function is used, bit nos. 9 & 10 should be encoded as follows.  When it is not used, binary zeros or valid data should be transmitted in these positions Bit No. 

| 10     |   9  |
|--------|------|
| System |      |
| 0      |   0  |
| 0      |   1  |
| 1      |   0  |
| 1      |   1  |

. 

COMMENTARY 
 
In many applications of the Mark 33 DITS, data source/destination identification will not be needed. In these cases, bits 9 & 10 will be used as pad bits for valid data.  In certain other applications of the system, for example, BCD latitude and longitude encoding (if needed - see Commentary following Section 2.1.2 of this document), the need to use bit nos. 9 and 10 to obtain adequate data resolution will preclude source/destination identification in this way. 

 
Note that this document does not address the practical question of how these bits will be set in those multi-system installations in which the source/destination identification function is desired. One way would be to use program pins on individual system black boxes which would be wired to set up the appropriate code.  The ARINC Characteristics devoted to the individual systems will define the method actually to be used. 

2.1.5  Sign/Status Matrix 
 
Section divided into two sub-sections, one to describe the BCD numeric and ISO Alphabet #5 alpha/numeric data sign status matrix, and the other to describe the BNR numeric data sign/status matrix. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS The "sign" (plus, minus, north, south, etc.) of the transmitted data and the status of the transmitter hardware should be encoded in bit nos. 30 and 31 as shown in the table below. 

Designation Bit No. 31       30 
BNR/BCD Data ISO # 5 Data 

| 0          |   0  | Plus, North, East    |
|------------|------|----------------------|
| Right, To  |      |                      |
|            |      |                      |
| 0          |   1  | No Computed Data     |
| 1          |   0  | Functional Test      |
| 1          |   1  | Minus, South, West,  |
| Left, From |      |                      |
|            |      |                      |

Notes: 
1. A source system should indicate failure by ceasing to supply data to a bus. 2. Both bits should be "zero" in BNR and BCD words when no sign is needed. 3. The "no computed data" code should be generated when computed data is not available for reasons other than equipment failure. 4. When is appears in a word identified by its label as a system output, the "functional test" code should be interpreted as advice that the data in the word results from the execution of a functional test.  When it appears in a word identified by its label as an instruction, e.g., a radio channel change command, this code should be interpreted as a command to perform a functional test. 

 
2.1.6  Data Standards Typographical errors corrected in second paragraph of Commentary. 2.2.1  Transmission System Interconnect Existing material supplemented with information concerning shield grounding. 

2.2.3.2  Receiver Voltage Levels DC levels between terminal A and ground and terminal B and ground at which receivers should not be damaged raised from +20VDC to +28VDC (min) and for –20VDC to –28VDC (min) respectively to align numerical values with aircraft DC power supply value. 

2.3.1.3  ISO Alphabet No. 5 Data New section added by this Supplement. 

2.4.1  Bit Rate Existing commentary supplemented with warning against selection of 13.6 KBPS and 100 KBPS because of possible interference with operation of OMEGA and LORAN C system on the aircraft. 

Attachment 2: Data Standards Tables 1 and 2 Column heading "MIN TRANSMIT INTERVAL msec" changed to "MAX TRANSMIT INTERVAL msec" in each case. 

Attachment 2: Data Standards Table 3 Table 3 (Alpha/Numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) Data Standards) deleted.  Table 4 (Discrete Data) renumbered Table 3. Note: Table 3 was reserved for alpha/numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) data standards prior to the preparation of this Supplement.  The need for it disappeared as a result of the particular approach selected for handling this data introduced into Specification 429 by this Supplement. 

Attachment 6: General Word Formats and Encoding Examples BNR word format example amended as consequence of change to sign/status matrix (see Section 2.1.5) General Word Formats for ISO Alphabet No. 5 data added.  
Encoding examples added.

SUPPLEMENT 2 TO ARINC SPECIFICATION 429 - Page 2 
A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement amends the material added to Specification 429 on ISO Alphabet No. 5 data transfer, and expands the multiple-word DITS message concept first used in this application to cover Discrete, Acknowledgement and Maintenance (ISO Alphabet No. 5 and discrete data formats) information transfer as well. 

The Application Notes of Chapter 3 of the Specification are amended to bring them into line with adopted practice in the control of DME's and ATC transponders, and supplemented with material related to the multipleword message applications of the system just mentioned.  Also, additions and modifications have been made to the label codes and data standards in Attachments 1 and 2 of the Specification to bring them into line with adopted practice. 

B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original test for comparison purposes.

INTRODUCED BY THIS SUPPLEMENT This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is entitled by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification, or by the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Specification is reproduced for reference. 

2.1.2  INFORMATION ELEMENT Text revised to describe word application groups. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.1.2  Information Element The basic information element is a digital word containing 32 bits.  Word formats for the different types of data handled by the Mark 33 DITS (see Section 2.3.1 of this document) are depicted in Attachment 6.  When less than the full data field is needed to accommodate the information conveyed in a word in the desired manner, the unused bit positions should be filled with binary zeros or valid data pad bits.  If valid data  bits are used, the resolution possible for the information will exceed that called for in this specification.  The Commentary following Section 2.1.6 of this document refers. 

2.1.3  INFORMATION IDENTIFIER Text revised to describe label use for AIM/Discrete/Maintenance data word type identification. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
2.1.3  Information Identifier The first eight bits of each word are assigned to a label function.  Labels will a)  identify the information contained within numeric (BCD/BNR) data words (e.g., DME distance, static air temperature), and b)  act as receiving device addresses for alpha/numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) data words (e.g., navigation system CDU or map display).  Label code assignments are set forth in Attachment 1 to this document. 

2.1.5.1  BCD NUMERIC AND AIM DATA WORDS Title and text revised to include other AIM applications in material originally prepared to describe sign/status matrix use in ISO Alphabet No. 5 words, and to provide definition of Self-Test. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.1.5.1  BCD Numeric and ISO Alphabet No. 5 Data Words The sign (plus, minus, north, south, etc.) of BCD numeric data, the word type of alpha/numeric (ISO alphabet No. 5) data and the status of the transmitter hardware should be encoded in bit nos. 30 and 31 of the word as shown in the table below.

 Notes: 1. 
A source system should annunciate any detected 
failure that causes one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable by ceasing to supply the affected word or words to the data bus. 
2. 
Both bits should be "zero" when no sign is 
needed. 3. 
The "no computed data" code should be 
generated when computed data is not available for reasons other than equipment failure. 4. When it appears in a word identified by its label as 
a system output, the "functional test" code should be interpreted as advice that the data in the word results from the execution of a functional test. When it appears in a word identified by its label as an instruction, e.g., a radio channel change 
command, this code should be interpreted as a command to perform a functional test. 5. See Section 2.3.1.3 of this document for definitions 
of the terms "Initial Word", "Intermediate Word" and "Final Word".

 Notes: 
 
1. A source system should annunciate any detected 
failure that causes one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable by setting bit nos. 30 and 31 in the affected word(s) to the "failure warning" code defined above.  Words containing this code should continue to be supplied to the data bus during the failure condition. 2. Bit no. 29 should be "zero" when no sign is needed. 3. The "no computed data" code should be generated 
when computed data is not available for reasons other than equipment failure. 4. When it appears in a word identified by its label as 
a system output, the "functional test" code should be interpreted as advice that the data in the word results from the execution of a functional test.  A self-test should produce indications of 1/8 of positive full-scale values unless indicated otherwise in an ARINC Equipment Characteristic. 
 5. If, during the execution of a functional test, a source system detects a failure which causes one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable, it should immediately change the states of bit nos. 30 and 31 in the annunciation is replaced with the "failure warning" annunciation 
 
2.2.3.1  TRANSMITTER VOLTAGE LEVELS Tolerances on "HI" and "LO" voltage states changed from ±  0.5 volt to ±  1.0 volt to correct previously undetected error. 

2.3.1.2  DISCRETES Minor changes to existing wording to improve clarity. New paragraphs added to describe two types of dedicated –to-discrete words and their applications. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
2.3.1.2  Discretes In addition to handling numeric data as specified above, the Mark 33 DITS should also be capable of accommodating discrete items of information, either in the "spare" bits of data words or, when necessary, in dedicated words.  Any discrete information contained in a word assigned a label in Attachment 1 is specified in the definition for that word in Attachment 2. The rule to be followed in the assignment of bits to discrete functions is to start with the least significant bit available in the word and to continue towards the most significant bit.  Attachment 6 shows this against the background of the generalized word structure. 

 2.3.1.3  Maintenance Data (General Purpose) This section inserted to describe use and application of general purpose Maintenance words. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
2.3.1.3  Alpha/Numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) Data 
 
ISO Alphabet No. 5 alpha/numeric data will consist of seven-bit characters encoded per the table of Attachment 5 to this document.  Three such characters should occupy bit nos. 9 through 29 of a DITS 32-bit word, as shown in the general word format diagram in Attachment 6.  As for numeric (BCD) data words, bit nos. 1 through 8 should be the word label (receiving device address-see Section 2.1.3), bit nos. 30 and 31 the sign/status matrix and bit no. 32 the word parity bit. The typical alpha/numeric message contains more than three ISO Alphabet No. 5 characters, necessitating the transmission of multi-DITS-word messages.  The following procedure should be used to permit receivers to determine that such messages are received in their entirety, with no words having been "lost along the way".  Only when this determination has been made, and the parity check for each word shows the data to be error-free, should the message be displayed to the aircrew or otherwise utilized. 

 
2.3.1.3  Alpha/Numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) Data (cont'd) The first DITS word of the message should contain the label in bit nos. 1 through 8, two numeric characters encoded per ISO Alphabet No. 5 in bit nos. 9 through 
15 and 16 through 22 and the ISO Alphabet No. 5 control character "STX"in bit nos. 23 through 29.  The two numeric characters should indicate the decimal number of DITS words in the message (maximum number is 99), with the most significant character occupying bit nos. 16 through 22.  This count, which should include this initial word, will be one plus the next whole number greater than one third of the number of ISO Alphabet No. 5 characters to be transmitted.  The sign/status matrix should contain the "initial word" code defined in Section 2.1.5 of this document. The subsequent DITS words of the message should each contain the label in bit nos. 1 through 8 and three ISO Alphabet No. 5 characters.  The sign/status matrix  of all these words except the last word should contain the "intermediate word" code defined in Section 2.1.5.1 of this document.  The last word of the message should contain the "final word" code in its sign/status matrix. Any unused bit positions in the final word resulting from the number of ISO characters in the message being one or two less than a number wholly divisible  by three should be filled with binary "zeros". 

2.3.1.4  AIM Data Section number, text and title revised to include other AIM word applications in material originally prepared to describe ISO Alphabet No. 5 data handling (originally in Section 2.3.1.3).  Detailed amendments in this area also. 3.1.4.2  DME The "Override" switching function has been replaced by the "DME Mode Select" function. 

3.1.4.7  ATC TRANSPONDER "Mode A/B Select" and "Standby" deleted from list of switching functions.  Control word format re-structured to release bits unneeded in numeric data part of word for assignment to discrete switching functions. 

Fig. 3-1 Radio Systems Management Word Formats Bit nos. 11 and 12 in the DME data word have been assigned to "DME Mode Select". The description of bit 14 in the VOR/ILS data word has been revised to improve clarity.

MARK 33 DIGITAL INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM (DITS) 
Published:  November 1, 1979 
A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement introduces material on the transfer of file data and the related protocol.  The file transfer capability is being added primarily for the Flight management Computer (FMC) program/data load and update and FMC intersystem crosstalk.   A number of labels and corresponding data standards have been added. 

B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement; and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c- 3" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-3 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C.

INTRODUCED BY THIS SUPPLEMENT This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is entitled by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification or by the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Specification is reproduced for reference. 2.1.5.1  BCD NUMERIC, DISCRETE AND AIM

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.1.6  Data Standards The units, ranges, resolutions, refresh rates, number of significant bits, pad bits etc. for the items of information to be transferred by the Mark 33 DITS are tabulated in Attachment 2 to this document. 

 
COMMENTARY 
 
Note that Section 2.3.1.1 of this document calls for numeric data to be encoded in BCD and binary, the latter using two's complement fractional notation. In this notation, the most significant bit of the data filed represents one half of the maximum value chosen for the parameter being defined.  
Successive bits represents the increments of a binary fraction series.  Negative number are encoded as the complements of positive values and the negative sign is annunciated in the sign/status matrix. 

 
In establishing a given parameter's binary data standards for inclusion in Attachment 2, the units, maximum value and resolution of the parameter are first determined in that order.  The least significant bit of the word is then given a value equal to the resolution increment, and the number of significant bits is chosen such that the maximum value of the fractional binary series just exceeds the maximum value of the parameter, i.e., equals the next whole binary number greater than the maximum parameter value less one least significant bit value.  For example, if the Mark 33 DITS is required to transfer altitude in units of feet over a range of zero to 100,000 feet with a resolution of one foot, the number of significant bits is 17 and the maximum value of the fractional binary series is 131,071 (i.e., 131,071 - 1).  Note that because accuracy is a quality of the measurement process and not the data transfer process, it plays no part in the selection of word characteristics.  Obviously, the resolution provided in the DITS word should equal or exceed the accuracy in order not to degrade it. 

 
For the binary representation of angular data, the Mark 33 DITS employs "degrees divided by 180o" 
as the unit  of data transfer and ± 1 (semicircle) as the range for two's complement fractional notation encoding ignoring, for the moment, the subtraction of the least significant bit value.  Thus the angular range 0 through 359.XXX degrees is encoded as 0 
through ± 179.XXX degrees, the value of the most significant bit is none half semicircle and there are no discontinuities in the code. 

 
For convenience, all binary word ranges in Attachment 2 are shown as whole binary numbers rather than such numbers less one least significant bit value.  Also the resolutions shown are approximate only.  Accurate resolutions can be determined, if required, by reference to the range values and numbers of significant bits for the words of interest.

Data Standards (cont'd) 
 
COMMENTARY (cont'd) 
 
It should be noted that in all applications of the two's complement fractional notation, the maximum value of the word, once chosen, cannot be changed by the use of more bits in the data field.  
The number of bits in the word affects only the resolution of the data, not its range. Binary coded decimal (BCD) data is encoded per the numeric subset of the ISO Alphabet No. 5 code (see Attachment 5 to this document) using bit nos. 1 through 4 of the seven-bit-per-character code. Alpha/numeric data is encoded using all seven bits per character of the ISO Alphabet #5 code and is transmitted using the special word format described in Section 2.3.1.3 of this document. 

2.3.1.5  FILE DATA TRANSFER Section added to provide description of file data transfer protocol. 

FORMATS Error corrected in bits 24 and 25 of ILS word. HF COMM frequency word format changed and second word added to enable the use of 100 Hz channel spacing.

4. A change in ARINC 710 not shown in Supplement 
2 is a planned change for Supplement 3.  The resolution of Selected Runway Heading (BCD and BNR) will be changed to .1 o. 5. A change being considered for Supplement 3 is to change the range to –6g - +4g to facilitate direct recording by the flight recorder. ATTACHMENT 6: GENERAL WORD FORMATS & ENCODING EXAMPLES SSM codes in AIM words changed to reflect table amendment of section 2.1.5.1. Radio Height code example changed to reflect shift in field. Note 4 of Table 6.2 deleted to revert data coding to the original two's complement notation. Word formats added for date/flight leg and flight number information. Word format added for VOR Omnibearing. Codes 203, 204, 206 and 207 deleted in Table 6.1a. 

ATTACHMENT 2: DATA STANDARDS (cont'd) NOTES 1. The number entered in the Range Column for each 
parameter that is not angular in nature is the 
nearest whole binary number greater than the parameter range required.  As explained in the 
Commentary following Section 2.1.6 of this document, the weight of the most significant bit of the two's complement fractional notation binary word will be one half this value, and the actual maximum value of the parameter capable of being encoded will be the number in the range column less one least significant bit value.  The numbers entered in the RANGE column for angular parameters are the actual degree ranges required. The way in which these parameters are encoded is also explained in the Commentary following Section 2.1.6. 2. Bit nos. 9 and 10 of the word may be used to 
achieve a 20 bit capability for high resolution of the Lat./Long. Position (codes 310 and 311).  The 
resulting resolution is .000086o for latitude and 
.00017 o  for longitude. 3. A change in ARINC 707 not shown in Supplement 
2 is a planned change for Supplement 3.  A selftest inhibit bit will be added and the range of the data word will be halved to a value of 8192 ft.

GENERAL WORD FORMATS AND ENCODING EXAMPLES 
 
NOTES [1] 
Source/Destination Identifier (SDI) Field The purpose of the SDI field is explained in Section 2.1.4 of this document, as are also the limitations on its use.  When the SDI function is not required, this field may be occupied by binary zero or valid data pad bits. [2] 
Discretes As discussed in Section 2.3.1.2 of this document, unused bits in a word may be assigned to discrete functions, one bit per variable.  Bit #11 of the word should be the first to be so assigned; followed by bit #12 and so on in ascending 
numerical order until the data field is reached.  In the absence of discretes, unused bit positions should be occupied by binary zero or valid data pad bits. 
[3] 
Pad 
 
All bit positions not used for data or discretes should be filled with binary zero or valid pad bits. Section 2.1.2 of this document refers. 
[4] 
Sign/Status Matrix (SSM) 


Section 2.1.5 of this document describes the 
functions of the sign/status matrix and the ways in which the bits constituting it are encoded. [5] 
Parity Bit 
This bit is encoded to render word parity odd. Section 2.3.4 of this document refers. NOTES: 
[1] 
"P" denotes pad "zero" or valid data.  Section 2.1.2 if this document refers.  Note possible use 
 
 
of pad bits for discrete functions per Section 2.3.1.2. 
[2] 
Because the actual maximum value of the most significant character of each of these quantities 
 
 
exceeds 7, it cannot be encoded in the most significant character position of the BCD word.  For 
 
this reason each quantity has been given and "artificial" MSC of zero and its actual MSC
 
encoded in the next most significant character position of the word. 

 
 
BNR DATA ENCODING EXAMPLES NOTES: [1] 
"P" denotes pad "zero" or valid data.  Section 2.1.2 of this document refers.  Note possible use 
 
 
of  pad bits for discrete functions per Section 2.3.1.2. 
[2] 
Negative values are encoded as the two's complements of positive values and the negative sign 
 
 
is annunciated in the sign/status matrix. 
[3] 
Angles in the range 0 to 180o are encoded as positive numbers.  Angles in the range 180 o  to 360 o 
 
 
are subtracted from 360 o and the resulting number encoded as a negative value per note 2.  Arc 
 
 
minutes and seconds are encoded as decimal degrees. 
[4] 
Latitude values are encoded as positive angles in the range 0 to 90 o with the sign/status matrix 
 
 
indicating North or South.  Longitude values are encoded as positive angles in the range 0 to  
 
 
180 o with the sign/status matrix indicating East or West.  Arc minutes and seconds are encoded 
 
 
as decimal degrees.

MARK 33 DIGITAL INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM (DITS) 
Published:  August 1, 1980 
A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement introduces material on defining "No Computed Data" and "Failure Warning", priority assignment of SSM codes, description of fault tolerance and isolation, address capability of A/N messages, command/response protocol, modification of data standards, addition of new labels, change of some word formats, addition of material on signal characteristics, change of receiver impedance limits, expansion of the current label, change of the receiver voltage thresholds and modification of the HF and DME word formats. 

B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains description of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c- 4" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-4 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C. 

CHANGES 
TO 
SPECIFICATION 
429 
Label code assignments are set forth in Attachment 1 to this document. Special Note: In some ARINC 429 DITS applications, a bus will be dedicated to delivering a single information element from a source to one or more identical sink devices.  In such circumstances, the sink device designer might be tempted to assume that decoding the word label is not necessary.  Experience has shown, however, that system developments frequently occur that result in the need for additional information elements to appear on the bus.  If a sink device designed for service prior to such a development cannot decode the original word label, it cannot differentiate between this word and the new data in the new situation.  The message for sink designers should therefore be quite clear - provide label decoding from the outset, no matter how strong the temptation to omit it might be. 

COMMENTARY 
 
Attachment 1 defines 256 discrete label codes. This quantity is expected to meet label assignment needs for the foreseeable future.  Should additional labeling capability be required in the longer term, it is envisaged that, rather than extend the length of the label field, a scheme will be devised in which existing label assignments are duplicated.  For example, the system could readily accommodate the assignment of the same label to two dissimilar parameters for which the probability of transmission on the same bus is very low. 

 
Adherence to the label code assignments of Attachment 
1 
is essential in inter-system communications and in intra-system communications where the system elements are defined as "unit interchangeable" per ARINC Report No. 403.  The assignment of label codes for all such communications must be coordinated with the air transport industry if chaos is to be avoided. A manufacturer who finds that Attachment 1 does not specify the label he needs for such system application must not simply choose one from those unassigned and "drive on".  He should contact ARINC for assistance. 2.1.5.1  BCD NUMERIC, DISCRETE, AIM DATA 

AND FILE TRANSFER WORDS Text describing "no computed data" modified. Commentary providing definitions added. 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.1.5.1  BCD Numeric, Discrete, AIM Data and File 
Transfer Words The sign (Plus, minus, North, South, etc.) of BCD numeric data, the word type (first, intermediate, control, last) for AIM data, and the status of the transmitter hardware should be encoded in bit nos. 30 and 31 of the word as shown in the table below.  The sign/status matrices of Discrete words should be encoded per the rules set forth for BCD numeric data. 

INTRODUCED BY THIS SUPPLEMENT This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is entitled by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification, or the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.

2.1.5.3  STATUS PRIORITIES New section inserted. 

2.2.1  TRANSMISSION SYSTEM INTERCONNECT 
 
Commentary expanded to provide description of possible solutions to single-wire fault conditions. 

 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.2.1 Transmission System Interconnect A data source should be connected to the data sink(s) by means of a single twisted and shielded pair of wires. The shields should be grounded at both ends and at all production breaks in the cable.  The interwiring diagram to be found in each ARINC Equipment Characteristic shows connector pins assigned to carry shields into black boxes for grounding.  Equipment manufacturers should ensure, however, that their equipment will operate correctly if, instead of being terminated on these pins, shields are grounded in the aircraft close to the rack connector. 

COMMENTARY 
 
In practical wire line digital information transmission systems, cable characteristics and electrical mismatches can produce distortion of the digital data pulses.  Also, noise due to electrical interference perturbs digital signals. 

 
The performance of a digital receiver depends upon the receiver input signal characteristics (data with distortion and noise) and the receiver design. 

 
Prior to the selection of the voltage and impedance parameters set forth in this Section of this document, the pulse distortion likely to be encountered in systems built around them in existing size commercial aircraft was evaluated and judged to be acceptable for a well-designed receiver.  No restriction is placed by this specification, therefore, on the number or length of sturbs for installations on aircraft no larger than those existing, e.g., B 747.  See Appendix 1 to this document for a report of this investigation. 

2.2.3.1  TRANSMITTER VOLTAGE LEVELS Text changed to improve clarity. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.2.3.1  Transmitter Voltage Levels The differential output signal across the specified output terminals (balanced to ground at the transmitter) 
should be + 10 ± 1.0 volts, 0 ± 0.5 volts and –10 ± 1.0 
volts respectively for the "HI", "NULL" and "LO" states when the transmitter is open circuit.  The output impedance of the transmitter should be as specified in Section 2.2.4.1 of this document.  This output impedance should be present for the "HI", "NULL" and "LO" transmitter output conditions and also during transitions between these levels. 

2.2.3.2  RECEIVER VOLTAGE LEVELS Receiver voltage thresholds changed. Fault voltage text deleted. 
Commentary revised to include description of receiver reaction to undefined voltages. 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
2.2.3.2  Receiver Voltage Levels The differential voltage presented at the receiver input terminals will be dependent upon line length, stub configuration and the number of receivers connected. In the absence of noise, the normal ranges of voltages presented to the receiver terminals (A and B) would be: 
"HI" 
+6V to 10V 
 
"NULL" 
+0.5 to –0.5V 
 
"LO" 
-6V to –10V In practice, these nominal voltages will be perturbed by noise and pulse distortion.  Thus, receivers should associate the following voltage ranges with the three states indicated: 
"HI" 
+5V to 13V 
 
"NULL" 
+2.5V to –2.5V 
 
"LO" 
-5V to –13V Receivers should not be damaged by the application of up to 20VAC (RMS) across terminals A and B by the application of up to +28Vdc (min) bias between terminal A and ground and –28Vdc (min) bias between terminal B and ground.  See Attachment 3 to this document for a pictorial representation of transmitter and receiver voltage levels. 
COMMENTARY 
 
Receiver input common mode voltages (terminal A to ground and terminal B to ground) are not specified because of the difficulties of defining ground with any satisfactory degree of precision. Receiver manufacturers are encouraged to work with the differential input voltage (line A to line B) and not line-to-ground voltages. 
 
The opinion is held by some people that conditions on transmission lines will be encountered which will require receivers to operate with less than the above-defined 
minimum difference of 2.5V 
between the NULL and HI and NULL and LO states.  Receiver designers are encouraged to investigate the possibilities and problems of working with a minimum difference of 1 volt between these states and to report their findings.

2.3.1.2  Discretes Text modified to expand label examples. Reference to AIDS limitations deleted. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
2.3.1.2  Discretes In addition to handling numeric data as specified above, the Mark 33 DITS should also be capable of accommodating discrete items of information either in the unused (pad) bits of data words or, when necessary, in dedicated words.  Any discrete information contained in a numeric data word assigned a label in Attachment 1 is specified in the definition for that word in Attachment 2. The rule to be followed in the assignments of bits to discretes in numeric data words is to start with the least significant bit of the word and to continue towards the most significant bit available in the word.  Attachment 6 shows that this against the background of the generalized word structure. There are two types of discrete words.  These are general purpose discrete words, and dedicated discrete words.  Five labels (octal 270-274) are assigned to the general purpose words in Attachment 1.  These words should be used in ascending label order (starting with octal 270) when the system receiving the data can identify its source by reference to the port at which it arrives.  The dedicated words should be used when  the  
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.2.4.1  Transmitter Output Impedance The transmitter output impedance should be 75 ± 5 
ohms, divided equally between line A and line B to provide an impedance balanced output. 

COMMENTARY 
 
The output impedance of the transmitter is specified as 75 ± 5 ohms to provide an approximate match to the characteristic impedance of the cable.  The match can only be approximate due to the wide range of characteristic impedance which may be encountered due to the variety of conductor wire gages and insulation properties. Measurements on a few samples of wire showed a spread of characteristic impedance of 63 and 71 ohms.  An extrapolation over the wire gages 20 to 26 for wrapped and extruded insulation indicate an expected characteristic impedance spread of 80 to 60 ohms approx.  Twisted shielded wire specifications do not control the characteristic impedance of the cable, thus future developments in insulation techniques may result in cables having characteristic impedances outside the range estimated. 

2.2.4.2 RECEIVER INPUT IMPEDANCE Value of RI changed. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
2.2.4.2 Receiver Input Impedance The receiver should exhibit the following characteristics, measured at the receiver input terminals: Differential Input Resistance RI = 6,000 ohms minimum Differential Input Capacitance CI = 50pF maximum Resistance to Ground RH and RG ≥ 12,000 ohms Capacitance to Ground CH and CG ≤ 50pF. No more than twenty receivers should be connected on to one digital data bus and each receiver should incorporate isolation provisions to ensure that the occurrence of any reasonably probable failure does not cause loss of data to the others. See Attachment 4 to this document for a pictorial representation of the input and output circuits standards. 

COMMENTARY 
 
The above characteristics apply to differential amplifier receivers.  Opto-isolator technology is progressing and may soon find application in digital data receivers.   Opto-isolator receivers impose slightly greater loads on data buses than differential amplifier receivers and the way in which they are characterized is different.  It is probable, however, that a future revision of this 
2.3.1.2  Discretes (cont'd) data is intended for the AIDS DFDAU which cannot identify sources in this way. 

COMMENTARY 
 
The foregoing special provisions for the delivery of discrete data to an AIDS were made to compensate for the number of digital ports required when many ports are used is extremely difficult to achieve, which necessitated the development of the special AIDS words.  These words should be limited to AIDS utilization.  The few aircraft systems which deliver discretes to an AIDS by means of the Mark 33 DITS will be burdened very little by this. Similarly, the impact of label use will be small. 

 
2.3.1.4  AIM DATA Text added to describe unit addressing. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
2.3.1.4  AIMS Data AIM data (Acknowledgement, ISO Alphabet No. 5 and Maintenance information encoded in dedicated words) should be handled in the manner described in this Section. All three of these applications may involve the transfer of more than 21 bits per "data package".  Source equipment should format such long messages into groups of 32-bit DITS words, each word containing the relevant application label (see Attachment 1) in bit nos. 1 through 8, and a sign/status matrix code in bit nos. 30 and 31. Bit no. 32 should be encoded to render word parity odd. The first word of each group should contain the sign/status matrix code defined for "initial word" in Section 2.1.5.1 of this document.  It should also contain, in bit nos. 9 through 16, the binary representation of the number of words in the group, except that when this word is the only word to be transmitted, i.e., the total number of information bits to be transmitted is 13 or less, bit nos. 9 through 16 should all be binary "zeros". When the word application label is assigned in Attachment 1 for Acknowledgement Data, bit nos. 17 through 29 of this initial word may be used for information transfer.  When the word application label is either of those assigned in Attachment 1 for ISO Alphabet No. 5 data transfer or Maintenance Data (ISO Alphabet Not. 5), bit nos. 17 through 22 should be binary "zeros" (spares) and bit nos. 23 through 29 should take on the pattern of the ISO Alphabet No. 5 control character "STX". The second word of the ISO Alphabet No. 5 and Maintenance Data (ISO Alphabet No. 5) application groups is an optional control word containing the sign/status matrix code for "control" information for the display.  When it is used, bit nos. 9 through 13 should contain the binary representation of the line count, bit nos. 14 through 16 should encode the required color, bit nos. 17 and 18 the required intensity, bit nos. 19 and 20 the required character size and bit no. 

21 should indicate whether or not the display is required to flash.  See Attachment 6 to this document for the encoding standards.  Bit nos. 22 through 29 of the word should be binary "zero" (spares). 

Intermediate words, containing the sign/status matrix code for "intermediate word", follow the initial word of the group or the control word, when used.  Intermediate words are optional in the sense that they are only transmitted if more words than the initial word and the final word (see below) are needed to accommodate the quantity of information to be transferred.  When the word application group label that is assigned in Attachment 1 for Acknowledgement, Data bit nos. 9 through 29 of that word are available for information transfer.  When the word application label is either of those assigned in Attachment 1 for ISO Alphabet No. 5 data transfer or Maintenance Data (ISO Alphabet No. 5), bit nos. 9 through 29 of each word should be divided into three seven-bit bytes (bit nos. 9 through 15, 16 through 22 and 23 through 29), each of which contains one ISO Alphabet No. 5 character. Each AIM application group transmission other than single-word transmissions (see below) should be terminated with a word containing the sign/status matrix code for "final word" defined in Section 2.1.5.1 of this document.  The data field of this word should be structured similarly to that of the intermediate word. Any unused bit positions in ISO Alphabet No. 5) final transfer or Maintenance Data (ISO Alphabet No. 5) final words resulting from the number of ISO Alphabet No. 5 characters in the message being one or two less than a number wholly divisible by three should be filled with binary "zeros". 2.3.1.5.1 
 COMMAND/RESPONSE PROTOCOL Text modified to describe transmitter reaction to lack of "Clear to send". 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.3.1.5.1 
Command/Response Protocol File data will consist of both ARINC 429 BNR numeric words and ISO alphabet No. 5 characters.  A file may contain from 1 to 127 records.  Each record may contain from 1 to 126 data words. A record will contain, at the minimum, one of the eight versions of the "initial word" described in Section 2.3.1.5.2.  Records in which this initial word contains the "Data Follows" code will also contain from 1 to 126 "intermediate words" (data) and a "final word" (error control).  The file data transfer protocol is as follows. A transmitter having the data to send to a receiver transmits, on the bus connecting it to that receiver, the "Request to Send" initial word.  The receiver responds, on the separate bus provided for return data flow, with the "Clear to Send" reply.  The transmitter then sends the "Data Follows" initial word, the "intermediate words" and the "final word".  The receiver processes the error control information in the "final word" and, if no errors are revealed, closes out the transaction by 
2.4.2  INFORMATION RATES Commentary added to describe refresh rate. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
2.4.2 Information Rates The minimum update interval for each item of information transferred by the Mark 33 DITS is specified in the tables of Attachment 2. Discretes contained within data words will be transferred at the bit rate and repeated at the update rate of the primary data.  Words dedicated to discretes should be repeated continuously at the rates defined in Attachment 2. 

COMMENTARY 
 
The time intervals between successive transmissions of a given BCD word specified in table 1 of Attachment 2 to this document are, in general, too short for the signal to be of use in driving a display device directly.  If the signal was so used, the least significant character of the display would change too rapidly for human perception.  Considerations other than human factors demand the time intervals specified.  Thus, display designers should incorporate into their devices means for selecting those words to be used for updating the display from the greater quantity delivered. 

3.1.4.2  DME Encoding and switch functions modified. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
3.1.4.2  DME Frequency Range:      108.00MHz to 135.95MHz Frequency Selection:     50kHz Increment:  
Characters encoded 
     10MHz, 1MHz, 0.1MHz, 
 
In DITS word:      0.01MHz, (100MHz 
                Character is always Decimal 1) 
Switching Functions:     Standby, DME Mode Select ILS Mode sending the "Data Received OK" word to the transmitter. If the receiver is not ready to accept data when the transmitter sends its "Request to Send" word, it will so indicate in its response (see Section 2.3.1.5.2).  The transmitter should then wait 200 milliseconds and retransmit the "Request to Send".  The transmitter should also repeat a "Request to Send" transmission 50 milliseconds after the initial transmission if no response is obtained from the receiver.  An alert should be raised in the system containing the transmitter if 4 attempts to obtain a "Clear to Send" response from a receiver are unsuccessful. If the receiver detects a parity error during the transmission, it may request an error-correcting retransmission by sending a "Data Received Not OK" word to the transmitter in which is identified the record in which the error occurred.  The transmitter will interrupt the data flow and back up to the start of the record so identified.  It will then send a "Data Follows" initial word identifying this record as the starting point of the retransmission and recommence its output of data, continuing through the "final word".  The receiver will then close out the transaction as before. An error detected by processing the error control information in the "final word" will also result in the receiver sending a "Data Received Not OK" word to the transmitter.  In the absence of identification of the record in which the error occurred, this word should contain the sequence number of the first record of the file.  The transmitter's response will be to retransmit the whole file. The receiver can signal loss of synchronization to the transmitter at any time by sending the  
"Synchronization Lost" initial word.  On receiving this word the transmitter should curtail the data flow and back up to the beginning of the file.  It should then reestablish that the receiver can accept data by going through the request-to-send/clear-to-send routine.  
Having done this it should send the "Data Follows" initial word, followed by the data and the "final word". 

The protocol also allows a transmitter to send file size information to a receiver without any commitment to send, or request to the receiver to accept, the file itself. The "Header Information" initial word is used for this purpose.  Additionally, a "Poll" initial word is defined for use in system in which continuous "handshaking" between two terminals is desired.  The response to a "Poll" word will be either a "Request to Send" initial word when the polled terminal does have data to transmit, or another "Poll" word when it does not.  An exchange of "Poll" words may be interpreted as the message, " I have nothing for you, do you have anything for me?"

Transmit 
intervals 
and 
the 
number 
of 
parameters to be transmitted are prime factors 
in bus loading.  It was suggested that a Minimum Transmit Interval be specified 
(perhaps a value of ½ the Transmit Interval) to control bus loading.  The ability of receivers to reject unwanted words would also be effective in improving bus efficiency.

TO 
 
ARINC  SPECIFICATION 429 
 
MARK 33 DIGITAL INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM (DITS) 
Published: April 4 1981 
A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement introduces material on fault detection, transmit intervals for words using multiple SDI codes, modification of IRS/AHRS discrete formats, expansion of error control definition, revision of ILS word, addition of new labels and change of existing data standards. 

B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c- 5" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-5 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C. 

 
CHANGES 
TO 
SPECIFICATION 
429 

performance of a digital receiver depends upon the receiver input signal characteristics (data with distortion and noise) and the receiver design. 
 
Prior to the selection of the voltage and impedance 
parameters set forth in this Section of  this document, the pulse distortion likely to be  
encountered in systems built around them in existing size commercial aircraft was evaluated and judged to be acceptable for a well-designed receiver.  No restriction is placed by this specification, therefore, on the number or length of stubs for installations on aircraft no larger than those existing, e.g., B 747.  See Appendix 1 to this document for a report of this investigation. 
 
Tests have shown that some receivers continue decoding data properly when one side of the transmission line is open or shorted to ground. When this condition exists noise immunity decreases and intermittent operation may occur. Users desire protection against non-annunciated system operation in this mode.  This protection may consist of additional circuitry to detect and annunciate the fault. 
2.2.3.2  RECEIVER VOLTAGE LEVELS Normal voltage ranges changed due to impedance changes. 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.2.3.2  Receiver Voltage Levels The differential voltage presented at the receiver input terminals will be dependent upon line length, stub configuration and the number of receivers connected. In the absence of noise, the normal ranges of voltages presented to the receiver terminals (A and B) would be: 
"HI" 
+6.5V to 10V 
 
"NULL" +2.5V to –2.5V 
 
"LO" 
-6.5V to –13V 
In practice, these nominal voltages will be perturbed by 
noise and pulse distortion.  Thus, receivers should associate the following voltage ranges with the three states indicated: 
"HI" 
+6.5V to 13V 
 
"NULL" +2.5V to –2.5V 
 
"LO" 
-6.5V to –13V 
 
COMMENTARY 
 
Receiver reaction is currently undefined in Specification 429 for voltages that fall in the range just above and below the "NULL" range. Respective equipment Characteristics should be referenced for desired receiver response in this range.  However, it is desirable that all DITS receivers will discontinue operation when the voltage levels fall into the undefined regions. Manufacturers are urged, as new equipment is developed, to "design in" the rejection capability.   
 
The opinion is held by some people that conditions on transmission lines will be encountered which will require receivers to operate with less than the 
INTRODUCED BY THIS SUPPLEMENT This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is entitled by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification, or by the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Specification is reproduced for reference. 

2.2.1  TRANSMISSION SYSTEM INTERCONNECT Text revised for break connections. Text added to Commentary describing increase of voltage threshold. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
2.2.1  Transmission System Interconnect A data source should be connected to the data sink(s) by means of a single twisted and shielded pair of wires. The shields should be grounded at both ends and at all production breaks in the cable to an aircraft ground close to the rack connector. 

COMMENTARY 
 
In practical wire line digital information transmission systems, cable characteristics and electrical mismatches can produce distortion of the digital data pulses.  Also, noise due to electrical interference perturbs digital signals. 

 
The 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
2.4.2  Information Rates The minimum and maximum transmit intervals for each 
item of information transferred by the Mark 33 DITS are specified in the tables of Attachment 2. 
 
COMMENTARY 
 
There are no values given for refresh rates in this Specification.  However, it is desirable that data be refreshed at least once per transmission.  Those data actually requiring long processing times or a large number of samples are the only types not expected to be refreshed with every transmission. Discretes contained within data words should be transferred at the bit rate and repeated at the update rate of the primary data.  Words dedicated to discretes should be repeated continuously at the rates defined in Attachment 2. 
COMMENTARY 
 
The 
time 
intervals 
between 
successive 
transmissions of a given BCD word specified in table 1 of Attachment 2 to this document are, in general, too short for the signal to be of use in driving a display device directly.  If the signal was so used, the least significant character of the display would change too rapidly for human perception.  Considerations other than human factors demand the time intervals specified.  Thus, display designers should incorporate into their devices means for selecting those words to be used for updating the display from the greater quantity delivered. 
 
above-defined minimum difference of 4.0V 
between the NULL and HI and NULL and LO states.  Receiver designers are encouraged to investigate the possibilities and problems of working with a minimum difference of  1 volt between these states and to report their findings. 

 
Receiver input common mode voltages (terminal A to ground and terminal B to ground) are not specified because of the difficulties of defining ground with any satisfactory degree of precision. Receiver manufacturers are encouraged to work with the differential input voltage (line A to line B) and not line-to-ground voltages. 

 
2.3.1.5.4  FINAL WORDS Text added to define checksum. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
2.3.1.5.4  Final Words The final word of each record contains error control information.  Bit nos. 1 through 8 contain the file label. Bit nos. 9 through 29 contain an error control checksum computed from the states of bit nos. 9 through 31 of each intermediate word of the record.  Bit nos. 30 and 31 of this word contain the code identifying it as a final word.  Bit no. 32 is encoded to render word parity odd. 

2.3.4  ERROR DETECTION/CORRECTION Obsolete text deleted. 

ORIGIANL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.3.4  Error Detection/Correction The last bit of each word should be encoded such that word parity is rendered odd to allow error detection in receivers.  Note that the parity calculation encompasses all 31 label and information bits of the word.  The Mark 33 DITS contains no provisions for message retransmission, the inclusion of redundant bits in words or other means of error correction. Fig. 3-1: RADIO SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT WORD 
FORMATS Bits 3 and 7 of transponder word changed to "0". (editorial) Bit 11 and 12 assigned to ILS category designation. Control Panel Function Matrix added to transponder word.

Transmit intervals and the number of parameters 
to be transmitted are prime factors in bus loading.  The interval for transmission of parameters should fall between the minimum and maximum specified intervals and nominally should be near the center of the range at equal intervals between transmissions.  When heavy bus loading dictates a shift from the center of the range, the shift should be toward the maximum transmit interval. Discrete word formats revised.

"NCD" code, as defined in sections2.1.5.1 and 
2.1.5.2.  The system indicators may or may not be flagged depending on system requirements. 
 
Failure Warning - is a particular case of data 
invalidity where the system monitors have detected one or more failures.  These failures are uniquely characterized by boundaries defined in the system characteristic.  When such a condition exists, the source system should annunciate its outputs to be invalid by either ceasing to supply the affected words to the data bus (the case of BCD data and ILS-LRRA installations with provisions for the interruption of AFS BNR data - see ARINC characteristics 707 and 710) or by setting the sign/status matrix of the affected words to the "Failure Warning" code (BNR case), as defined in sections 2.1.5.1 and 2.1.5.2.  The system indicators should always be flagged during a "Failure Warning" condition.

COMMENTARY 
 
Definitions 
 
Invalid Data - is defined as any data generated by a 
source system whose fundamental characteristic is the inability to convey reliable information for the proper performance of a user system.  There are two categories of invalid data, namely, "No Computed Data" and "Failure Warning". 
 
No Computed Data - is a particular case of data 
invalidity where the source system is unable to 
compute reliable data for reasons other than system failure.  This inability to compute reliable data is caused exclusively by a definite set of events or conditions whose boundaries are uniquely defined in the system characteristic.  When such a condition 
exists 
the 
source 
system 
should 
annunciate its outputs to be invalid by setting the sign/status matrix of the affected words to the "NCD" code, as defined in sections 2.1.5.1 and 2.1.5.2.  The system indicators may or may not be flagged depending on system requirements. 
 
Failure Warning - is a particular case of data 
invalidity where the system monitors have detected one or more failures.  These failures are uniquely characterized by boundaries defined in the system characteristic.  When such a condition exists, the source system should annunciate its outputs to be invalid by either ceasing to supply the affected words to the data bus (the case of BCD data and ILS-LRRA Installations with provisions for the interruption of AFS BNR data - see ARINC Characteristics 707 and 710) or by setting the 

## And File Transfer Words Commentary Revised To Reflect Use Of Failure Warning Flags In Discrete Words. Original Text Follows: Commentary Definitions Invalid Data - Is Defined As Any Data Generated By A Source System Whose Fundamental Characteristic Is The Inability To Convey Reliable Information For The Proper Performance Of A User System.  There Are Two Categories Of Invalid Data Namely, "No Computed Data" And "Failure Warning". No Computes Data - Is A Particular Case Of Data Invalidity Where The Source System Is Unable To Compute Reliable Data For Reasons Other Than System Failure.  This Inability To Compute Reliable Data Is Caused Exclusively Be A Definite Set Of Events Or

A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement introduces new label assignments, revised data standards, expanded text describing SDI codes and makes note of a change in the resolution of the Magnetic Heading label incorporated in Supplement 7. 

 
B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c-8" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-8 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C. 

 
CHANGES 
TO 
SPECIFICATION 
429 Note: In certain specialized application of the SDI function the all-call capability may be forfeited so that code "00" is available as an "installation no. 4" identifier. When the SDI function is not used, binary zeros or valid data should be transmitted in bit nos. 9 and 10. 

COMMENTARY 
 
This document does not address the practical question of how the SDI bits will be set in those multi-installation systems in which the source/destination function is desired.  One way would be to use program pins on the individual installation black boxes which would be wired to set up the appropriate code.  The ARINC Characteristics devoted to the individual systems will define the method actually to be used. 

 
ATTACHMENT 1 - LABEL CODES The following labels have been given new assignments: 012 25, 060 3C, 061 3C, 062 3C, 063 3C, 064 3C, 137 2F, 137 3F, 140 25, 141 25, 142 25, 151 27, 152 27, 153 27, 154 27, 155 27, 156 27, 157 27, 160 27, 161 27, 162 27, 163 27, 164 25, 164 27, 165 27, 170 C5, 173 25, 270 25, 271 C5, 272 C5, 273 C5, 274 25, 275 25, 313 25, 314 25, 317 25, 320 25, 324 25, 325 25, 330 2F, 330 3F, 331 2F, 332 2F, 332 3F, 333 3F, 334 2F, 334 3F, 350 25, 351 25, 352 25, 353 25, 370 C5. 

ATTACHMENT 1 - EQUIPMENT CODES Code 3C assigned to Tire Pressure System. 

ATTACHMENT 2 - DATA STANDARDS Table 1 had been modified in Supplement 7 to reflect the resolution of label 014 as 0.1, rather than 1.0, which had been incorrectly introduced in a previous Supplement. This change is hereby noted. Data standards added for new labels. Data standards revised for labels 115 2F, 115 3F, 325 2F, 325 3F. 

ATTACHMENT 6 - GENERAL WORD FORMATS Tire pressure SDI bit coding added. 

INTRODUCED BY THIS SUPPLEMENT This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is entitled by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification, or by the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Specification is reproduced for reference. 

2.1.4  SOURCE DESTINATION IDENTIFIER 
 
Text added to clarify use of SDI on combined source/sink equipment. 

 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.1.4  Source/Destination Identifier Bit nos. 9 and 10 of numeric data words should be reserved for a data source/destination identification function.  They are not available for this function in alpha/numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) data words (See Section 2.3.1.3 of this document) or when the resolution needed for numeric (BNR/BCD) data necessitates their use for valid data.  The source/destination identifier function may find application when specific words need to be directed to a specific system of a multi-system installation or when the source system of a multi-system installation needs to be recognizable from the word content.  When it is used,  a  source  equipment  should encode  its   aircraft installation number in bit nos. 9 and 10 as shown in the table below.  A sink equipment should recognize words containing its own installation number code and words containing code "00", the "all-call" code.

SUPPLEMENT 9 
 
TO 
 
ARINC  SPECIFICATION 429 
 
MARK 33 DIGITAL INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM (DITS) 
Published: April 30, 1985 
 
 
A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement introduces new label assignments and equipment identification codes.  This Supplement also corrects a word format bit error introduced in a previous Supplement. 

B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c- 9" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-9 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C.

A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement introduces new label assignments and equipment identification codes. 

B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c-11" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-11 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C.

SUPPLEMENT 12 
 
TO 
 
ARINC  SPECIFICATION 429 
 
MARK 33 DIGITAL INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM (DITS) 
Published: July 1, 1990 
A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The Supplement introduces the Williamsburg bit-oriented file data transfer protocol which supports the transfer of binary and character data.  The previous AIM and character-oriented file transfer protocol sections are moved to Appendix 6.  The Sign Status Matrix (SSM) information is revised and reorganized.  In addition, this Supplement introduces new label assignments and equipment identification codes. 

B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c-12" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should e inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-12 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C. CHANGES 
TO 
SPECIFICATION 
429 
INTRODUCED BY THIS SUPPLEMENT This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is entitled by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification, or by the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change and, for other than very minor revision, any text originally contained into the Specification reproduced for reference. 

2.1.3  Information Identifier This section contains editorial corrections to comply with changes introduced in Supplement 11. 

2.1.5  Sign/Status Matrix This section was revised and reorganized.  The changes include moving the AIM and file transfer SSM definitions to Appendix 6, adding failure reporting to the discrete word truth table (Section 2.1.5.3) and moving the description of status priorities to Section 2.1.5. 

2.3.1  Digital Language The contents of Sections 2.3.1.4 through 2.3.1.5.7 were moved to Appendix 6.  The AIM Data and File Data Transfer section headings were retained for reference purposes.  Section 2.3.1.5. File Data Transfer, provides the reason for moving the original file transfer protocol and introduces the Williamsburg protocol.

## Aeec Staff Note:  These Changes Apply To Arinc 429, Part 3 Only.

INTRODUCED BY THIS SUPPLEMENT This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is defined by the section number and the title currently employed in the Specification or by the section name and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case a brief description of the change or addition is included. 

2.3.1.5  File Data Transfer An editorial change, correction to section numbering. 

 
2.3.1.5.1  Bit-Oriented Protocol Determination 
 
New Section added to describe ALO/ALR protocol process to be used when a bilingual Link Layer protocol system needs to determine necessary bit-oriented interfaces. 

2.5  Bit-Oriented communications Protocol Included term "Williamsburg" parenthetically since this terminology well-known in industry.  Added commentary to explain non-negotiation or parameters in this protocol. 

D. Corrected Network Layer definition. 

 
2.5.2  Link Data Unit (LDU) Size and Word Count Added second paragraph to text, since it is a requirement, and removed second paragraph from commentary.

2.5.6  Response to RTS The last sentence in the second paragraph was reworded and moved to a more appropriate section, 2.5.6.2. 

2.5.6.1  Clear to Send (CTS) In the second to last sentence, the word "valid" was added to clarify the Not clear to send condition.  The last sentence was added to clarify the resetting of RTS counters. 

2.5.6.2  Not Clear to Send (NCTS) The first paragraph was updated to include the information deleted from Section 2.5.6 and to clarify the validity requirements.  The second paragraph was updated to describe that and NCTS counter would be reset upon a valid CTS response.  The last sentence in the third paragraph was deleted and it's content expanded in the following commentary of that section. 

2.5.6.3  Destination Busy The second paragraph of this section was updated to indicate that a BUSY counter should be reset with a valid CTS response to RTS. 

2.5.7  No Response to RTS The first paragraph of this section was updated to describe proper response to RTS. 

2.5.9  Unexpected RTS This section was updated to include editorial changes and a description of the correct responses to RTS.  The last sentence was deleted as redundant to Section in 2.5.13.1 and in conflict with other possible responses.

MARK 33 DIGITAL INFORMATION TRANSFER SYSTEM (DITS) 
Published: January 4, 1993 
A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement introduces changes made to increase the efficiency of data transfer across an ARINC 429 high speed bit-oriented link.  This protocol supports the transfer of binary and character data. 

B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of changes introduced into this Specification by this Supplement.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect the changes.  The modified and added material on each page is identified by a c-14 in the margins.  Existing copies of ARINC 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages are inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. C. CHANGES TO ARINC SPECIFICATION 429 
AEEC STAFF NOTE:  THESE CHANGES APPLY TO ARINC 429, PART 3 ONLY. 

--``,,,````,,,,`,````,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
INTRODUCED BY THIS SUPPLEMENT This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change and addition is defined by the section number and the title currently employed in the Specification or by the section name and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case a brief description of the change or addition is included. 

2.3.1.5  File Data Transfer An editorial change was needed to reference new section. 2.3.1.5.1 
 Bit-Oriented Protocol Determination 
 
This section was expanded to include determination of different version numbers of the bit-oriented protocol, and was moved to Section 2.5.19. 

2.5  Bit-Oriented Communication Protocol An editorial change references a new section number. 

2.5.4  Bit Rate and Word Timing A maximum word gap of 64 bit-times, (averaged over the LDU transmission) was added to eliminate excessive delay in source transmission time. Note: Sections 2.5.5 through 2.7 have been renumbered and reordered for consistency. 

2.5.5  Word type The basic definition of "word type" was corrected to include bits  31-29 in all bit-oriented words of an LDU. 

2.5.6  Protocol Words This section was added to specifically define the word type for protocol words. 

2.5.6.1  Protocol Identifier 
 
This section was added to clarify the definition of bits 28- 25 for protocol words and to specify the relevant addition for error conditions. 

2.5.6.2  Destination Code This section was updated, and a commentary added, to clarify the role of the link layer protocol for upward compatibility with changing network functionality.  The requirement for Destination code validation is not a link layer function. 

2.5.6.3  Word Count This section was renumbered. 

2.5.7  Request to Send (RTS) This section was previously titled "Response to TS", and has been renumbered.  The title was changed for consistency, and an introductory paragraph added to clarify the basic RTS function. 

2.5.7.1  Clear to Send (CTS) This section was renumbered. 

2.5.7.2  Not Clear to Send (NCTS) This section was renumbered. 

2.5.7.3  Destination Busy This section was renumbered, and an introductory replacement paragraph inserted to clarify the "optional" BUSY response, which may be used when a system cannot accept a transmission by the source in a "timely manner".  New commentary equates a "timely manner" to the shorter retry sequence of the NCTS series. 

2.5.7.4  No Response to RTS This section was renumbered, and the ALOHA word was included in the logic for error determination. 

2.5.10  Start of Transmission (SOT) 
 
Timer T13 was added as a requirement on the source to begin transmission of an LDU within a specified interval after receipt of the CTS word from the sink. 

2.5.10.1  General Format Identifier (GFI) This section was updated, and commentary added to clarify the role of the GFI in pre-OSI as well as OSI environments.  Validation of the GFI code is required by a high level entity (network layer) in both environments to determine the format of the data words to follow.  GFI validation is not necessarily a link layer function. 

## 2.5.20  Bit Protocol Verification 2.6  Windowed Bit-Oriented Protocol This Is A Completely New Section Which Contains The System Description Of The New Llc2-Like Bit-Oriented Link Layer Protocol For 429.  It Is Based On Section 2.5, "Bit- Oriented Communications Protocol", With Expanded Text As Specified To Allow For More Efficient Use Of The 429 High (Or Low) Speed Data Bus Through "Windowing".  The Definition Includes Provision For A Link Control Word Prior To Each Ldu. Attachment 1 - Equipment Codes New Equipment Code Identifiers Were Added. Attachement 6 - Word Formats And Encoding Examples Example Added For Label 171. Attachment 10 - Variables Of Bit

ORIENTED PROTOCOL Table 10-1 was updated to include a standard value for N7, the maximum number of LDUs in a window (see Section 2.6 "Windowed Bit-Oriented Protocol"). 

Table 10-3 deleted Option 6 (O6) for NAK Send Time, and deleted Option 9 (O9) for the Character Data Word, both of which are no longer used. Table 10-4 was revised to include columns for low speed maximum and minimum values.  These values were established for timers and as response time design goals for incoming transmissions.  Timers T13 through T16 were added. Table 10-5 was added to include a definition of high speed maximum and minimum values for timers and response time design goals.  The format is the same as the revised Table 10-4.  Timer T10 is not used in the high speed protocol. 

Table 10-6 was added to include notes to Tables 10-1 through 10-5. ATTACHMENT 11 - BIT-ORIENTED DATA FILE 
TRANSFER WORD FORMATS Table 11-1A added "spares" for the deleted Character Data Formats and corrected "Protocol Data Word" to read "Protocol Word". Table 11-4 updated definitions for bits 9 through 24 of the ALO and ALR words, and added the LCW (LDU Control Word) format definition. Table 11-4A was added as a partial replacement for ATTACHMENT 11C and Table 11-4B was added to define the new window definitions for the Windowed Bit- Oriented protocol in Section 2.6. Table 11-6A was revised, changing the former GFI bit pattern (0001) for ISO 8208 to "unassigned".  The bit pattern (0100) for ISO 8473 was changed to a more 
2.5.11  Data All references to Character Data word formats were deleted. 

2.5.11.3  Character Data Words 
 
This section was deleted.  The Character Data Word format was removed from Supplement 14, as the format is incompatible with those for Full and Partial Data word formats.  Currently, both binary and character data are transmitted in octets defined by the other two data word formats.  The special character data format is not required. 

2.5.12.1  CRC Encoding References to character data words were deleted.  The text for equation: M9x) = x16G(x) + R(x) was corrected by moving the "bar" from G(x) to R(x). 

2.5.13  Negative Acknowledgement (NAK) NAK word interpretation was changed to remove constraint on source for specific order of file sequencing (i.e. Allows source to restart file with new FSN if necessary). 

2.5.14.1  Duplicate LDU This first paragraph was rewritten to clarify. 

2.5.14.3  Incomplete File Timer This section was added to allow the sink to discard a partial file of multiple LDUs when the T14 timeout between LDU transmissions is exceeded.  It ensures that a source device cannot "lock-up" a sink. 

2.5.15  SYN Word The LDU sequence anomalies which generate a SYN response by the sink were clarified. 

2.5.16  Response to ACK/NAK/SYN 
 
The T16 timer was introduced to replace T10  and T8.  Also, the action taken by the source upon receipt of a SYN word was updated, which relaxes requirements to maintain a specific File Sequence ordering by the source. 

2.5.19  Protocol Initialization 
 
2.5.19.1  Bit-Oriented Protocol Version, 2.5.19.2  ALOHA Response, and 
 
2.5.19.3  Character-429 Determination This section has been added to replace and expand on the definition of the process to determine the link layer protocol version supported by an interfacing system. These sections replace three sections from Supplement 13. 2.3.1.5.1 
 Bit-Oriented Protocol Determination 2.5.19  ALO Response, and 

## Attachment 11 - Bit-Oriented Data File Transfer Word Formats (Cont'D) Generic Iso 9577 Definition.  The Bit Pattern 1110 (Hex"E") Is Now Defined As "Acars Vhf Format".The "Notes" In Attachment 11 Have Been Renumbered To Correspond To The New Table Definitions. Attachment 11C - Aloha/Aloha Response Protocol Word Definition This Attachment Has Been Deleted.  This Information Has Been Moved To Tables 11-4, 11-4A, And 11-4B. Attachment 13A - Aloha Version Determination Sequence This Attachment Was Added To Support The Aloha Version Determination Sequence Called Out In Section 2.5.19.1.1. Attachment 14 - System Adderess Labels New System Address Labels (Sal) Were Added. Attachment 16 - Sequence Of Protocol And Data Words In Window Transfer This Attachment Was Added To Illustrate The Window Transfers For New Section 2.6. Attachment 17 - Flow Diagram Used To Determine Character-Oriented Vs Bit- Oriented Protocol This Attachment Was Added To Illustrate The Logic Flow That Determines Whether A Character-Oriented Or Bitoriented Link Layer Protocol Interface Is To Be Used.

2.2.2  Modulation The following Commentary was added: "Avionics manufacturers are warned that bus activity monitoring should be implemented with caution.  Crossed wiring (interchanging A and B) at one end of the bus, which will cause improper LRU/system operation, may not necessarily be detected by a "simple" bus activity monitor." 
2.2.4.2  Receiver Input Impedance The word "parallel" was changed to "combination".

A.  PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT This Supplement introduces new label assignments, equipment IDs, system address labels and updates to the 429W protocol. 

 
B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper contains descriptions of changes introduced into this Specification by this Supplement.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect the changes.  The modified and added material on each page is identified by a c-15 in the margins.  Existing copies of ARINC Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages are inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. 

C.   CHANGES TO ARINC SPECIFICATION 429 
      INTRODUCED BY THIS SUPPLEMENT This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is defined by the section number and the title currently employed in the Specification or by the section name and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated. In each case a brief description of the change or addition is included. 

2.0  Digital Information Transfer System Standards Numerous changes were made to the protocol throughout this Section. 

2.1.5.3  Discrete Data Words The technique for encoding SSM bits in discrete words were revised. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
2.1.5.3  Discrete Data Words A source system should annunciate any detected failure that could cause one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable.  Three methods are defined. The first method is to set bit numbers 30 and 31 in the affected word(s) to the "Failure Warning" code defined in the table below.  This is the preferred method.  Words containing the "Failure Warning" code should continue to be supplied to the data bus during the failure condition. When using the second method, the equipment may stop transmitting the affected word or words on the data bus. The third method applies to data words which are defined such that they contain failure information within the data field.  For these applications, refer to the associated ARINC equipment characteristic to determine the proper SSM reporting. The "No Computed Data" code should be annunciated in the affected Discrete Data word(s) when a source system is unable to compute reliable data for reasons other than system failure.

ARINC Industry Activities Projects and Work Program A project is established in order to accomplish a technical task approved by one or more of the committees (AEEC, AMC, FSEMC) Projects generally but not exclusively result in a new ARINC standard or modify an existing ARINC standard. All projects are typically approved on a calendar year basis.  Any project extending beyond a single year will be reviewed annually before being reauthorized. The work program of Industry Activities (IA) consists of all projects authorized by AEEC, AMC, or FSEMC (The Committees) for the current calendar year. The Committees establish a project after consideration of an ARINC Project Initiation/Modification (APIM) request. This document includes a template which has provisions for all of the information required by The Committees to determine the relative priority of the project in relation to the entire work program. All recommendations to the committees to establish or reauthorize a project, whether originated by an airline or from the industry, should be prepared using the APIM template.  Any field that cannot be filled in by the originator may be left blank for subsequent action. 

## 2. Normal Apim Evaluation Process Initiation Of An Apim

All proposed projects must be formally initiated by filling in the APIM template. An APIM may be initiated by anyone in the airline community, e.g., airline, vendor, committee staff. 

## Staff Support

All proposed APIMs will be processed by committee staff.  Each proposal will be numbered, logged, and evaluated for completeness.  Proposals may be edited to present a style consistent with the committee evaluation process.  For example, narrative sentences may be changed to bullet items, etc. When an APIM is complete, it will be forwarded to the appropriate Committee for evaluation. The committee staff will track all ongoing projects and prepare annual reports on progress.   

## Committee Evaluation And Acceptance Or Rejection

The annual work program for each Committee is normally established at its annual meeting.  Additional work tasks may be evaluated at other meetings held during the year.  Each committee (i.e., AMC, AEEC, FSEMC) has its own schedule of annual and interim meetings. 

The committee staff will endeavor to process APIMs and present them to the appropriate Committee at its next available meeting.  The Committee will then evaluate the proposal.  Evaluation criteria will include: 
- Airline support - number and strength of airline support for the project, 
including whether or not an airline chairman has been identified 
- Issues - what technical, programmatic, or competitive issues are 
addressed by the project, what problem will be solved 
- Schedule - what regulatory, aircraft development or modification, 
airline equipment upgrade, or other projected events drive the urgency for this project  
Accepted proposals will be assigned to a subcommittee for action with one of two priorities:  
- High Priority - technical solution needed as rapidly as possible - Routine Priority - technical solution to proceed at a normal pace 
Proposals may have designated coordination with other groups.  This means that the final work must be coordinated with the designated group(s) prior to submittal for adoption consideration. Proposals that are not accepted may be classified as follows: 
- Deferred for later consideration - the project is not deemed of sufficient 
urgency to be placed on the current calendar of activities but will be reconsidered at a later date 
- Deferred to a subcommittee for refinement - the subcommittee will be 
requested to, for example, gain stronger airline support or resolve 
architectural issues 
- Rejected - the proposal is not seen as being appropriate, e.g., out of 
scope of the committee

APIM Template  
The following is an annotated outline for the APIM.  Proposal initiators are requested to fill in all fields as completely as possible, replacing the italicized explanations in each section with information as available. Fields that cannot be completed may be left blank.  When using the Word file version of the following template, update the header and footer to identify the project.

## Arinc Ia Project Initiation/Modification (Apim)

Name of proposed project 
                                            APIM #:  _____ 
Name for proposed project. 
Suggested Subcommittee assignment 
Identify an existing group that has the expertise to successfully complete the 
project.  If no such group is known to exist, a recommendation to form a new 
group may be made.  

## Project Scope

Describe the scope of the project clearly and concisely.  The scope should describe "what" will be done, i.e., the technical boundaries of the project. 

Example: "This project will standardize a protocol for the control of printers.  
The protocol will be independent of the underlying data stream or page description language but will be usable by all classes of printers." 

## Project Benefit

Describe the purpose and benefit of the project.  This section should describe 
"why" the project should be done. Describe how the new standard will improve competition among vendors, giving airlines freedom of choice. This section provides justification for the allocation of both IA and airline resources. Example: "Currently each class of printers implements its own proprietary protocol for the transfer of a print job.  In order to provide access to the cockpit printer from several different avionics sources, a single protocol is needed. The protocol will permit automatic determination of printer type and configuration to provide for growth and product differentiation." 

## Airlines Supporting Effort

Name, airline, and contact information for proposed chairman, lead airline, list of airlines expressing interest in working on the project (supporting airlines), and list of airlines expressing interest but unable to support (sponsoring airlines).  It is important for airline support to be gained prior to submittal.  Other organizations, such as airframe manufacturers, avionics vendors, etc. supporting the effort should also be listed. 

## Issues To Be Worked

Describe the major issues to be addressed by the proposed ARINC standard.   
Recommended Coordination with other groups Draft documents may have impact on the work of groups other than the originating group.  The APIM writer or, subsequently, The Committee may identify other groups which must be given the opportunity to review and comment upon mature draft documents. 

## Projects/Programs Supported By Work

If the timetable for this work is driven by a new airplane type, major avionics overhaul, regulatory mandate, etc., that information should be placed in this section.  This information is a key factor in assessing the priority of this proposed task against all other tasks competing for subcommittee meeting time and other resources. 

## Timetable For Projects/Programs

Identify when the new ARINC standard is needed (month/year).  

## Documents To Be Produced And Date Of Expected Result

The name and number (if already assigned) of the proposed ARINC standard to be either newly produced or modified. 

## Comments

Anything else deemed useful to the committees for prioritization of this work.
