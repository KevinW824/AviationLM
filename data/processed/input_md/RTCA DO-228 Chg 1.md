## 1. General Changes

 Change all references to RTCA DO-160C to RTCA DO-160D. 

2. 

Specific Changes 

 
a. 
Page 6, paragraph 2.2.1.1, GPS Operating Frequency - Replace with the following: 
 
The antenna shall operate over the minimum frequency range of 1575.42 MHz ± 
10MHz. The gain shall not vary more than 3 dB over the frequency range. b. 

Page 7, paragraph 2.2.1.5, Axial Ratio - Replace with the following: 
The axial ratio shall not exceed 3.0 dB for all operating frequencies as measured at the boresight of the antenna. 

 
c. 
Page 9, paragraph 2.2.2.5, Burnout Protection - Replace with the following: 
The preamplifier shall withstand a CW input carrier of +20 dBm without damage. Under these conditions, the output of the preamplifier shall be limited to +20 dBm. 

Note: The burnout protection of +20 dBm may not guarantee compatibility with all aircraft or all operations. Some contemporary commercial airborne installations require +30 dBm with the output limited to +20 dBm. 

 

d. 
Page 10, Add paragraph 2.2.3, Differential Group Delay -  
The differential group delay of the antenna, or antenna with an integrated preamplifier shall not exceed 50 nanoseconds. The differential group delay is defined as: 

$$|\,{\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}\omega}}(\mathrm{f_{c}})\,\cdot\,{\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}\omega}}\,(\mathrm{f_{3d B}})|$$
where: 
fc is the pre-correlation band pass filter center frequency f3dB are the 3dB cut off points of the filter 
φ is the phase response of pre-correlation band pass filter ω is the frequency 

e. 
Page 10, paragraph 2.2.2.6, Include the following data with the Replacement Figure 2-3 (provided below):
