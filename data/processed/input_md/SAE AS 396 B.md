## 7. Qualification Tests:

As many instruments as deemed necessary to demonstrate that all instruments will comply with the requirements of this section shall be tested in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.

## 7.1 Low Temperature:

The instrument, shall be subjected to the temperature indicated in the following table, in accordance with their location in the aircraft.  After exposure to this temperature for 5 hours, the instrument shall start upon application of rated power and at that temperature shall meet the requirements of Paragraph 6.2 except that the allowable alignment tolerance shall be 2 degrees.

| Instrument Location                      | Temperature   |
|------------------------------------------|---------------|

The requirements of Paragraph 7.1 shall apply except that the exposure temperature shall be 50C for heated areas and 70C for unheated areas.

## 7.3 Extreme Temperature Exposure:

The instrument shall, after alternate exposures to ambient temperature of 65C and 70C for periods of 24 hours each and a delay of 3 hours at room temperature following completion of the exposure, meet the requirements of Section 6 at room temperature.  There shall be no evidence of damage as a result of exposure to the extreme temperatures specified herein.

This test shall first be made with the indicator not operating and then shall be repeated with the indicator in normal operation.  The maximum deflection of the free magnet shall not exceed 5 degrees for any pointer or dial position.

## 7.5 Humidity:

The instrument (indicator, remote gyro, amplifier, etc.) shall be mounted in a chamber maintained at a temperature of 70 ± 2C and a relative humidity of 95 ± 5% for a period of six hours.  After this period the heat shall be shut off and the instrument shall be allowed to cool for a period of 18 hours in this atmosphere in which the humidity rises to 100% as the temperature decreases to not more than 38 C.  This complete cycle shall be conducted:

a.
Five times for components located in uncontrolled temperature areas.
b.

Immediately after recycling; there shall be no evidence of damage or corrosion which affects performance, following this test, and the instrument shall meet the requirements of Section 6 except for Paragraph 6.4.

## 7.6 Vibration:

Resonance - The instrument, while operating, shall be subjected to a resonant frequency survey of the appropriate range specified in Paragraph 3.3.3 in order to determine if there exists any resonant frequencies of the parts.  The amplitude used may be any convenient value that does not exceed the maximum double amplitude and the maximum acceleration specified in Paragraph 3.3.3. The instrument shall then be subjected to a vibration at the appropriate maximum double amplitude or maximum acceleration specified in Paragraph 3.3.3 at the resonant frequency for a period of one hour in each axis or with circular motion vibration, whichever is applicable.  When more than one resonant frequency is encountered with vibration applied along any one axis a test period may be accomplished at the most severe resonance, or the period may be divided among the resonant frequencies, whichever shall be considered most likely to produce failure.  The test period shall not be less than one-half hour at any resonant mode.  When resonant frequencies are not apparent within the specified frequency range, the instrument shall be vibrated for two hours in accordance with the vibration requirements schedule (Paragraph 3.3.3) at the maximum double amplitude and the frequency to provide the maximum acceleration. Cycling - The instrument, while operating, shall be tested with the frequency cycled between limits specified in Paragraph 3.3.3 in 15 minute cycles for a period of one hour in each axis at an applied double amplitude specified in Paragraph 3.3.3, or an acceleration specified in Paragraph 3.3.3, whichever is the limiting value or a total of three hours for circular motion vibration, whichever is applicable. The instrument shall be tested during vibration to determine that it is functioning properly.  After the completion of this vibration test, no damage shall be evident and the instrument shall meet the requirements of Section 6 (other than Paragraph 6.4).
