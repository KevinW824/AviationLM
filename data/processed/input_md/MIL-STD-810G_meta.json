Processed results from the SRS, ESD, or FS are typically logarithmically transformed to provide estimates that are more normally distributed.  This transformation is important since often very few estimates are available from a test series and the probability distribution of the untransformed estimates cannot be assumed to be normally distributed.  In virtually all cases, combination of processed results will fall under the category of small sample statistics and need to be considered with care with other parametric or less powerful nonparametric methods of statistical analysis.

Damage to the exterior shipping container that is the result of improper interior packaging, blocking, or bracing is cause for rejection.  Structural damage to the exterior shipping container that results in either spilling of the contents or failure of the container in subsequent handling is cause for rejection.  Assess whether a substantial amount of shifting of the contents within the shipping container created conditions likely to cause damage during shipment, storage, and reshipment of the container.  Minor container damage such as chipping of wood members, dents, paint chipping, is not cause for rejection.  If recorded, acceleration time histories or other sensor data can provide valuable information related to the response characteristics of the test item.",

At the other extreme, a total of nine shocks are required if each shock only satisfies the test requirements in one direction of one axis.

This test method is applicable when materiel is required to demonstrate its adequacy to resist a \u201cgunfire schedule\u201d environment without unacceptable degradation of its structural integrity and functional performance (\u201cgunfire schedule\u201d here refers to the firing rate and the number of rounds fired in a given firing).  The gunfire environment may be considered to be a high rate repetitive shock having form of a substantial transient vibration produced by (1) an air-borne gun muzzle blast pressure wave impinging on the materiel at the gun firing rate,  (2) a structure-borne repetitive shock transmitted through structure connecting the gun mechanism and the materiel, and/or a combination of (1) and (2).  The closer the materiel surface is to direct pressure pulse exposure, the more likely the measured acceleration environment appears as a repetitive shock producing high rise time and rapid decay of materiel response, and the less role the structure-borne repetitive shock contributes to the overall materiel response environment.  The farther the materiel surface is from direct pressure pulse exposure, the more the measured acceleration environment appears as a structure-borne high rate repetitive shock (or a substantial transient vibration) with some periodic nature that has been filtered by the structure intervening between the gun mechanism and the materiel.  Repetitive shock applied to a complex multi-modal materiel system will cause the materiel to respond (1) at forced frequencies imposed on the materiel from the external excitation environment, and (2) to the materiel\u2019s resonant natural frequencies either during or immediately after application of the external excitation.  Such response may cause: materiel failure as a result of increased or decreased friction between parts, or general interference between parts;",
