6.2
Dielectric: Ungrounded instruments or grounded instruments prior to connection of the internal ground 
wire shall be tested by either the method of inspection of paragraph 6.2.1 or 6.2.2.
6.2.1
Insulation Resistance: The insulation resistance measured at 200 volts D.C. for five seconds between 
all electrical circuits connected together and the metallic case shall not be less than 5 megohms. Insulation resistance measurements shall not be made to circuits where the potential will appear across elements such as windings, resistors, capacitors, etc., since this measurement is intended only to determine adequacy of insulation.
6.2.2
Overpotential Tests: Equipment shall not be damaged by the application of a test potential between 
electrical circuits, and between electrical circuits and the metallic case. The test potential shall be a sinusoidal voltage of a commercial frequency with an RMS value of five times the maximum circuit voltage or per paragraphs 6.2.2.1 or 6.2.2.2 whichever applies. The potential shall start from zero and be increased at a uniform rate to its test value. It shall be maintained at this value for five seconds, and then reduced at a uniform rate to zero.
Since these tests are intended to insure proper electrical isolation of the circuit components in question, these tests shall not be applied to circuits where the potential will appear across elements such as winding, resistors, capacitors, etc.

                                                                                          
6.2.2.1
Hermetically sealed instruments shall be tested at 200 volts RMS.
6.2.2.2
Circuits that operate at potentials below 15 volts and contain low voltage elements such as 
transistors, doides, capacitors and special signal generators are not to be subjected to overpotential tests.
6.3
Position Error: The change in pointer indication with change in instrument position from normal position 
shall not exceed 25 RPM.
                                                                                          
6.4
Sealing: This test shall apply to hermetically sealed instruments only. The indicator shall be immersed in 
a suitable liquid, such as water. The absolute pressure of the air above the liquid shall then be reduced to 
approximately 1 inch of mercury and maintained for 1 minute, or until air bubbles substantially cease to be given off by the liquid, whichever is longer. The absolute pressure shall then be increased to 2-1/2 inches Hg. Any bubbles coming from within the Indicator case shall be considered as leakage and shall be cause for rejection. Bubbles which are the result of entrapped air in the various exterior parts of the case shall not be considered as a leak.
A helium leak detector or other means of test equal or superior in sensitivity to the immersion method described above, may be used. Where a leak detector is employed for conducting the test, the leak rate shall not exceed 1 micro-cubic foot per hour at a pressure differential of approximately 1 atmosphere. If the indicator incorporates non-hermetically sealed attachments, such as a case extension, these components may be removed prior to the Sealing test.

7.
QUALIFICATION TESTS: As many instruments as may be deemed necessary to demonstrate that all 
instruments will comply with the requirements of this section shall be tested in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
7.1
Low Temperature: The instrument shall be subjected to -30C for three hours. The change in indication 
from the reading obtained at room temperature shall not exceed one percent of full scale. The instrument may be operated at 2000 RPM or half scale, whichever is higher, for a period of 10 minutes before making this scale error test. The force required to turn the generator shaft while and after it has been subjected to a temperature of minus 55C for two hours, shall not exceed 8 pound inches. No damage to 
the generator shall result from this test.
7.2
High Temperature: The instrument shall be subjected to a temperature of 70C for a period of three hours. 
The change in indication from the readings obtained at room temperature shall not exceed one percent of full scale for the range 600-2800 RPM and shall not exceed one and one-half percent of full scale for the range from 3000 to 4500 RPM.
7.3
Extreme Temperature Exposure: The instrument shall, after alternate exposure to ambient temperatures 
specified in Column B of Section 3.3.1 for a period of 24 hours each and a delay of 3 hours at room temperature following completion of the exposure, meet the requirements of Section 6.1. During the high temperature exposure, the generator shall be operating at a shaft speed equivalent to half-scale indicator reading and shall be supplying full-rated electrical load for that speed. There shall be no evidence of damage as a result of exposure to the extreme temperatures specified herein.
                                                                                          
7.4
Magnetic Effect: The magnetic effect of the indicator shall be determined in terms of the deflection of a 
free magnet, approx. 1-1/2 inches long, in a magnetic field with a horizontal intensity of 0.19 Â± 0.01 gauss when the indicator is held in various positions on an east-west line with its nearest part 12 inches from the 
center of the magnet. This test shall first be made with the indicator not operating and then shall be repeated with the indicator in normal operation. The maximum deflection of the free magnet shall not exceed 5 degrees for any pointer or dial position.
7.5
Vibration:
7.5.1
Resonance: The instrument, while operating and with Various pointer settings throughout the range, 
shall be subjected to a resonant frequency survey of the appropriate range specified in Section 3.3.3 in order to determine if there exists any resonant frequencies of the parts. The amplitude used may be of any convenient value that does not exceed the maximum double amplitude and the maximum acceleration specified in Section 3.3.3.
The instrument shall then be subjected to vibration at the appropriate double amplitude or maximum acceleration specified in Section 3.3.3 at the resonant frequency for a period of one hour in each axis or with circular motion vibration whichever is applicable. When more then one resonant frequency is encountered with vibration applied along any one axis, a test period may be accomplished at the most severe resonance, or the period may be divided among the resonant frequencies, whichever shall be considered most likely to produce failure. The test period shall not be less than one-half hour at any resonant mode. When resonant frequencies are not apparent within the specified frequency range, the instrument shall be vibrated for two hours in accordance with the vibration requirements schedule, Section 3.3.3, at the maximum double amplitude and the frequency to provide the maximum acceleration.

While the instrument is being vibrated, the pointer oscillation shall not exceed one percent of full scale indication. The average pointer variation during vibration shall not exceed one percent of full scale indication. After these observations have been made, the vibration stand shall be set as indicated above and operated for the remainder of the two hour test period with the pointer position changed every twenty to thirty minutes. 

7.5.2
Cycling: The instrument, while operating shall be tested with the frequency cycled between the limits 
specified in Section 3.3.3 in 15 minute cycles for a period of one hour in each axis at an applied double amplitude specified in Section 3.3.3, or an acceleration specified in 3.3.3 whichever is the limiting value, or a total of three hours for circular motion vibration, whichever is applicable. The pointer position shall be changed every twenty to thirty minutes during this test. 
After the completion of this vibration test the "Scale Error at Room Temperature" test in Section 6 shall be repeated. No damage shall be evident and the change in indication between this test and the initial room temperature scale error test shall not exceed one percent of full scale indication.

7.6
Humidity: This test shall not apply to hermetically sealed indicators. The indicator and generator shall be 
mounted in the normal operating position and maintained at a temperature of 70 Â± 2C and a relative humidity of 95 Â± 5% for a period of 6 hours. After this period the heat shall be shut off and the instrument shall be allowed to cool for a period of eighteen hours in this atmosphere in which the humidity rises to 100% as the temperature decreases to not more than 38C. This complete cycle shall be conducted:
a. Five times for instruments located in uncontrolled temperature areas. b. Once for instruments located in controlled temperature areas.
Immediately after cycling, the indicator shall be subjected to the "Scale Error Test at Room Temperature" of Section 6. The change in reading between this test and the original scale error at room temperature test shall not exceed 10 RPM.

 
The performance of the generator shall not be adversely affected as a result of this humidity cycling.

7.7
Acceleration Endurance: The generator drive shaft and rotor shall be subject to a uniform acceleration of 
400 revolutions per second per second for a period of at least five seconds. The generator shall be subjected to this acceleration for 500 applications. No damage to any part of the generator shall result from this test.
                                                                                          
7.8
Thermal Shock: This test shall apply to hermetically sealed instruments only. The indicator shall be 
subjected to four cycles of exposure to water at 85 Â± 2C and 5 Â± 2C without evidence of moisture 
penetration or damage to coating or enclosure. Each cycle of the test shall consist of immersing the indicator in water at 85 Â± 2C for a period of 30 minutes, and then within 5 seconds of removal from the bath, the indicator shall be immersed for a period of 30 minutes in the other bath maintained at 5C. This cycle shall be repeated continuously, one cycle following the other until four cycles have been completed. Following this test, the indicator shall be subjected to the Sealing test specified in 6.4. No indicator leakage shall occur as a result of this test.
