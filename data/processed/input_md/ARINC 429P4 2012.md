## Foreword Aeronautical Radio, Inc., The Aeec, And Arinc Standards

ARINC organizes aviation industry committees and participates in related industry activities that benefit aviation at large by providing technical leadership and guidance. These activities directly support aviation industry goals: promote safety, efficiency, regularity, and cost-effectiveness in aircraft operations. ARINC Industry Activities organizes and provides the secretariat for international aviation organizations (AEEC, AMC, FSEMC) which coordinate the work of aviation industry technical professionals and lead the development of technical standards for airborne electronic equipment, aircraft maintenance equipment and practices, and flight simulator equipment used in commercial, military, and business aviation. The AEEC, AMC, and FSEMC develop consensus-based, voluntary standards that are published by ARINC and are known as ARINC Standards. The use of ARINC Standards results in substantial technical and economic benefit to the aviation industry. There are three classes of ARINC Standards: 

--```,````,,,````,`,,```,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
a) ARINC Characteristics - Define the form, fit, function, and interfaces of avionics 
and other airline electronic equipment. ARINC Characteristics indicate to prospective manufacturers of airline electronic equipment the considered and coordinated opinion of the airline technical community concerning the requisites of new equipment including standardized physical and electrical characteristics to foster interchangeability and competition.   
b) ARINC Specifications - Are principally used to define either the physical 
packaging or mounting of avionics equipment, data communication standards, or a high-level computer language.  
c) 
ARINC Reports - Provide guidelines or general information found by the airlines 
to be good practices, often related to avionics maintenance and support.  
The release of an ARINC Standard does not obligate any organization or ARINC to purchase equipment so described, nor does it establish or indicate recognition or the existence of an operational requirement for such equipment, nor does it constitute endorsement of any manufacturer's product designed or built to meet the ARINC Standard. 

In order to facilitate the continuous product improvement of this ARINC Standard, two items are included in the back of this volume: 
An Errata Report solicits any corrections to existing text or diagrams that may be included in a future Supplement to this ARINC Standard. An ARINC IA Project Initiation/Modification (APIM) form solicits any proposals for the addition of technical material to this ARINC Standard.

*ARINC Specification 429 was published as a single doucment through mid-1995. It was adopted as a multi-part document on **April 18, 1995**, and subsequently published in multiple parts. Part 1 and Part 2 
use the same Supplement 15 to record the changes. Part 3 has a unique Supplement 15. Over time, as each part evolved, Supplements were prepared for each part independent of the other, both in content and in date.

## 1.0 Introduction 1.0 Introduction 1.1   Purpose Of This Document

ARINC Specification 429 defines the air transport industry standards for the transfer of digital information between avionics system elements. Since the first release in 
1977, many changes to ARINC Specification 429 have been coordinated with industry. The changes are reflected in the current version of ARINC Specification 429, currently published in multiple parts. 

## 1.2   Organization Of Arinc Specification 429

ARINC Specification 429: *Digital Information Transfer System (DITS)* is published in four parts: 

Part 1 Functional Description, Electrical Interfaces, Label Assignments and 
Word Formats 
Part 2 Discrete Word Data Standards 
Part 3 File Data Transfer Techniques 
Part 4 Archive of ARINC 429 Supplements 
Part 1 provides the basic description of ARINC 429 functions and the supporting physical and electrical interfaces. Data word formats, standard label and address assignments, and examples are provided. Part 2 defines ARINC 429 discrete words and bit assignments in label order. 

Part 3 describes ARINC 429 data transfer protocols and message definitions for data transferred in large blocks and/or file format. 

Part 4 is an archive of the ARINC 429 Supplements as published over the years. It was introduced as part of the update to ARINC 429, Part 1, by Supplement 18, the 
35th anniversary publication (2012). Each part of ARINC Specification 429 is published independent of the others. The dash numbers assigned to each part are not intended to be synchronized. 

Therefore, the latest version of ARINC Specification 429 Part X should be used when designing or procuring equipment. 

## 1.3   Part 4 Content And Overview

Part 4 is the archive of ARINC 429 Supplements. It was prepared in conjunction with Supplement 18 to ARINC Specification 429, Part 1, which represents a digital remastering of the document in the latest ARINC formats and styles. As part of the republishing process, the technical content of each Supplement appears in the latest version of ARINC Specification 429.This activity makes each part of ARINC Specification 429 complete. The Supplements, previously published as "goldenrod pages", are considered historical artifacts. They are published unchanged, both in content and in form. ARINC 429 Supplements are reproduced in Part 4 for historical reference only.

A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement adds to Specification 429 material related to the transfer of graphic and ISO alphabet No. 5 encoded alpha/numeric data by the Mark 33 DITS.  Also, it clarifies the purpose of the SDI function, adds BCD and BNR numeric data encoding examples to Attachment 6 and introduces two Appendices into the Specification. 

 
B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c-1" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace. The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-1 
already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C.

TO 
SPECIFICATION

 This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is identified by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification, or by the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Specification is reproduced for reference. 

 
1.3.2  ISO Alphabet No. 5 Data Transfer Existing text supplemented - no other changes. 

 
1.3.3  Graphic Data Transfer New section added by this Supplement. 

2.1.2  Information Element 
 

 
--```,````,,,````,`,,```,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
revised to improved clarity of opening sentence, and 
to modify the statement concerning the BCD-
encoding of latitude and longitude as a consequence of the clarification of the use priorities for bit nos. 9 and 10 introduced into Section 2.1.4 by this Supplement. 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS To permit the use of common hardware elements for the transmission of BNR and BCD numeric data, the format for the Mark 33 DITS BCD word differs from that used formerly for this type of data.  Bit no. 32 is assigned to parity, bit nos. 31 and 30 to the sign/status matrix, bit no. 29 is the most significant bit of the data field, and the maximum decimal value of the most significant character is 7.  Previously, the BCD word contained no parity bit, the sign/status matrix occupied bit nos. 32 and 31, bit no. 30 was the most significant data bit and the maximum decimal value of the most significant character was 3. This format made the word 8-bit byte oriented with respect to the data.  This characteristic is not retained in the Mark 33 system. Also, the Mark 33 BCD word will not accommodate latitude and longitude to the formerly specified resolution of 0.1 minute of arc.  If BCD transmission of these quantities in required, either the resolution must be decreased or the word must be restructured.  
Restructuring involves limiting the maximum decimal value of the most significant character to 1, moving the remaining BCD characters towards the MSB by two bit positions and using bit nos. 9 and 10 for data instead of reserving them for source/destination identification encoding per Section 2.1.4 of this document.  It is probable, however, that future latitude and longitude displays will not be the simple, dedicated read-out type for which BCD data is intended.  More likely is the use of some form of multiple-message display, such as a CRT, which will be backed by its own data processor and prefer inputs of BNR data.  If this proves to be the case, there will be no problem! 

 
2.1.3  Information Identifier Text expanded to explain differing roles of label codes in numeric (BCD/BNR) and alpha/numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) data transfer.  "Special Note" added. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS The first eight bits of each word are assigned to a label function so that the data contained in the word may be identified.  Label code assignments are set forth in the table of Attachment 1 to this document. 

2.1.4  Source/Destination Identifier Section modified to indicate that bit nos. 9 & 10 are not available for the SDI function in DITS words employed for graphic and ISO Alphabet No. 5 data transfer, or in BNR/BCD words in which bit nos. 9 and 10 are needed for valid data in order to achieve the desired resolution. Code table revised and function application more fully described.  Consequential revisions to Commentary. 

 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS Bit nos. 9 & 10 of the word should be reserved for a data source/destination identification function.  This function may find application when specific words need to be directed to a specific system of a multi-system installation or when the source system of a multi-system installation needs to be recognizable from the word content.  When the source/destination identifier function is used, bit nos. 9 & 10 should be encoded as follows.  When it is not used, binary zeros or valid data should be transmitted in these positions

In many applications of the Mark 33 DITS, data source/destination identification will not be needed. In these cases, bits 9 & 10 will be used as pad bits for valid data.  In certain other applications of the system, for example, BCD latitude and longitude encoding (if needed - see Commentary following Section 2.1.2 of this document), the need to use bit nos. 9 and 10 to obtain adequate data resolution will preclude source/destination identification in this way. 

Note that this document does not address the practical question of how these bits will be set in those multi-system installations in which the source/destination identification function is desired. One way would be to use program pins on individual system black boxes which would be wired to set up the appropriate code.  The ARINC Characteristics devoted to the individual systems will define the method actually to be used. 

## 2.1.5  Sign/Status Matrix Section Divided Into Two Sub-Sections, One To Describe The Bcd Numeric And Iso Alphabet #5 Alpha/Numeric Data Sign Status Matrix, And The Other To Describe The Bnr Numeric Data Sign/Status Matrix. Original Text Follows The "Sign" (Plus, Minus, North, South, Etc.) Of The Transmitted Data And The Status Of The Transmitter Hardware Should Be Encoded In Bit Nos. 30 And 31 As Shown In The Table Below.

Notes: 
1. A source system should indicate failure by ceasing to 
supply data to a bus. 2. Both bits should be "zero" in BNR and BCD words 
when no sign is needed. 3. The "no computed data" code should be generated 
when computed data is not available for reasons other than equipment failure. 4. When is appears in a word identified by its label as a 
system output, the "functional test" code should be interpreted as advice that the data in the word results from the execution of a functional test.  When it appears in a word identified by its label as an instruction, e.g., a radio channel change command, this code should be interpreted as a command to perform a functional test. 
 
2.1.6  Data Standards Typographical errors corrected in second paragraph of Commentary. 

2.2.1  Transmission System Interconnect Existing material supplemented with information concerning shield grounding. 

2.2.3.2  Receiver Voltage Levels DC levels between terminal A and ground and terminal B and ground at which receivers should not be damaged raised from +20VDC to +28VDC (min) and for –20VDC to –28VDC (min) respectively to align numerical values with aircraft DC power supply value. 

2.3.1.3  ISO Alphabet No. 5 Data New section added by this Supplement. 

2.4.1  Bit Rate Existing commentary supplemented with warning against selection of 13.6 KBPS and 100 KBPS because of possible interference with operation of OMEGA and LORAN C system on the aircraft. Attachment 2: Data Standards Tables 1 and 2 Column heading "MIN TRANSMIT INTERVAL msec" changed to "MAX TRANSMIT INTERVAL msec" in each case. Attachment 2: Data Standards Table 3 Table 3 (Alpha/Numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) Data Standards) deleted.  Table 4 (Discrete Data) renumbered Table 3. Note: Table 3 was reserved for alpha/numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) data standards prior to the preparation of this Supplement.  The need for it disappeared as a result of the particular approach selected for handling this data introduced into Specification 429 by this Supplement. 

Attachment 6: General Word Formats and Encoding Examples BNR word format example amended as consequence of change to sign/status matrix (see Section 2.1.5) General Word Formats for ISO Alphabet No. 5 data added.  
Encoding examples added. 

 
Appendix 1: Laboratory Verification of ARINC 429 DITS Electrical Characteristics New material added by this Supplement. Appendix 2: An Approach to a Hybrid Broadcast Command/Response Data Bus Architecture. New material added by this Supplement. 

NOTE:  Due to the large number of changes Created by this Supplement, it is NOT 
available separately to update 429-1.

SUPPLEMENT 2 TO ARINC SPECIFICATION 429 - Page 2 
 
A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement amends the material added to Specification 429 on ISO Alphabet No. 5 data transfer, and expands the multiple-word DITS message concept first used in this application to cover Discrete, Acknowledgement and Maintenance (ISO Alphabet No. 5 and discrete data formats) information transfer as well. 

The Application Notes of Chapter 3 of the Specification are amended to bring them into line with adopted practice in the control of DME's and ATC transponders, and supplemented with material related to the multipleword message applications of the system just mentioned.  Also, additions and modifications have been made to the label codes and data standards in Attachments 1 and 2 of the Specification to bring them into line with adopted practice. 

B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original test for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c- 2" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-2 
already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C.

2.1.2  INFORMATION ELEMENT Text revised to describe word application groups. 

 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.1.2  Information Element The basic information element is a digital word containing 32 bits.  Word formats for the different types of data handled by the Mark 33 DITS (see Section 2.3.1 of this document) are depicted in Attachment 6.  When less than the full data field is needed to accommodate the information conveyed in a word in the desired manner, the unused bit positions should be filled with binary zeros or valid data pad bits.  If valid data  bits are used, the resolution possible for the information will exceed that called for in this specification.  The Commentary following Section 2.1.6 of this document refers. 

2.1.3  INFORMATION IDENTIFIER Text revised to describe label use for AIM/Discrete/Maintenance data word type identification. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
2.1.3  Information Identifier The first eight bits of each word are assigned to a label function.  Labels will a)  identify the information contained within numeric (BCD/BNR) data words (e.g., DME distance, static air temperature), and b)  act as receiving device addresses for alpha/numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) data words (e.g., navigation system CDU or map display).  Label code assignments are set forth in Attachment 1 to this document.

 Notes: 1. 
A source system should annunciate any detected 
failure that causes one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable by ceasing to supply the affected word or words to the data bus. 
2. 
Both bits should be "zero" when no sign is needed. 3. 
The "no computed data" code should be generated when computed data is not available for reasons other than equipment failure. 4. When it appears in a word identified by its label as 
a system output, the "functional test" code should 
be interpreted as advice that the data in the word results from the execution of a functional test. When it appears in a word identified by its label as an instruction, e.g., a radio channel change 
command, this code should be interpreted as a command to perform a functional test. 5. See Section 2.3.1.3 of this document for definitions 
of the terms "Initial Word", "Intermediate Word" and "Final Word".

 Notes: 1. A source system should annunciate any detected 
failure that causes one or more of the words 
normally output by that system to be unreliable by setting bit nos. 30 and 31 in the affected word(s) to the "failure warning" code defined above.  Words containing this code should continue to be supplied to the data bus during the failure condition. 2. Bit no. 29 should be "zero" when no sign is needed. 3. The "no computed data" code should be generated 
when computed data is not available for reasons other than equipment failure. 4. When it appears in a word identified by its label as 
a system output, the "functional test" code should be interpreted as advice that the data in the word results from the execution of a functional test.  A self-test should produce indications of 1/8 of positive full-scale values unless indicated otherwise 
in an ARINC Equipment Characteristic.

 5. If, during the execution of a functional test, a 
source system detects a failure which causes one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable, it should immediately change the states of bit nos. 30 and 31 in the annunciation is replaced with the "failure warning" annunciation 
 
2.2.3.1  TRANSMITTER VOLTAGE LEVELS Tolerances on "HI" and "LO" voltage states changed from ±  0.5 volt to ±  1.0 volt to correct previously undetected error. 

2.3.1.2  DISCRETES Minor changes to existing wording to improve clarity. New paragraphs added to describe two types of dedicated –to-discrete words and their applications. 

 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.3.1.2  Discretes In addition to handling numeric data as specified above, the Mark 33 DITS should also be capable of accommodating discrete items of information, either in the "spare" bits of data words or, when necessary, in dedicated words.  Any discrete information contained in a word assigned a label in Attachment 1 is specified in the definition for that word in Attachment 2. The rule to be followed in the assignment of bits to discrete functions is to start with the least significant bit available in the word and to continue towards the most significant bit.  Attachment 6 shows this against the background of the generalized word structure. 

 2.3.1.3  Maintenance Data (General Purpose) This section inserted to describe use and application of general purpose Maintenance words. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
2.3.1.3  Alpha/Numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) Data 
 
ISO Alphabet No. 5 alpha/numeric data will consist of seven-bit characters encoded per the table of Attachment 5 to this document.  Three such characters should occupy bit nos. 9 through 29 of a DITS 32-bit word, as shown in the general word format diagram in Attachment 6.  As for numeric (BCD) data words, bit nos. 1 through 8 should be the word label (receiving device address-see Section 2.1.3), bit nos. 30 and 31 the sign/status matrix and bit no. 32 the word parity bit. The typical alpha/numeric message contains more than three ISO Alphabet No. 5 characters, necessitating the transmission of multi-DITS-word messages.  The following procedure should be used to permit receivers to determine that such messages are received in their entirety, with no words having been "lost along the way".  Only when this determination has been made, and the parity check for each word shows the data to be error-free, should the message be displayed to the aircrew or otherwise utilized. 

 
2.3.1.3  Alpha/Numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) Data (cont'd) The first DITS word of the message should contain the label in bit nos. 1 through 8, two numeric characters encoded per ISO Alphabet No. 5 in bit nos. 9 through 
15 and 16 through 22 and the ISO Alphabet No. 5 control character "STX"in bit nos. 23 through 29.  The two numeric characters should indicate the decimal number of DITS words in the message (maximum number is 99), with the most significant character occupying bit nos. 16 through 22.  This count, which should include this initial word, will be one plus the next whole number greater than one third of the number of ISO Alphabet No. 5 characters to be transmitted.  The sign/status matrix should contain the "initial word" code defined in Section 2.1.5 of this document. The subsequent DITS words of the message should each contain the label in bit nos. 1 through 8 and three ISO Alphabet No. 5 characters.  The sign/status matrix  of all these words except the last word should contain the "intermediate word" code defined in Section 2.1.5.1 of this document.  The last word of the message should contain the "final word" code in its sign/status matrix. Any unused bit positions in the final word resulting from the number of ISO characters in the message being one or two less than a number wholly divisible  by three should be filled with binary "zeros". 

2.3.1.4  AIM Data Section number, text and title revised to include other AIM word applications in material originally prepared to describe ISO Alphabet No. 5 data handling (originally in Section 2.3.1.3).  Detailed amendments in this area also. 

 
3.1.4.2  DME The "Override" switching function has been replaced by the "DME Mode Select" function. 

3.1.4.7  ATC TRANSPONDER "Mode A/B Select" and "Standby" deleted from list of switching functions.  Control word format re-structured to release bits unneeded in numeric data part of word for assignment to discrete switching functions. Fig. 3-1 Radio Systems Management Word Formats Bit nos. 11 and 12 in the DME data word have been assigned to "DME Mode Select". The description of bit 14 in the VOR/ILS data word has been revised to improve clarity. 

 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: [1] 
When bit no. 4 is "zero", the ILS mode should be "off.  When bit no 14 is "one", the ILS mode should be "one".

A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement introduces material on the transfer of file data and the related protocol.  The file transfer capability is being added primarily for the Flight management Computer (FMC) program/data load and update and FMC intersystem crosstalk.   A number of labels and corresponding data standards have been added. 

B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement; and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c-
3" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-3 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C.

## 2.1.6  Data Standards Text Added To Clarify Data Encoding.

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.1.6  Data Standards The units, ranges, resolutions, refresh rates, number of significant bits, pad bits etc. for the items of information to be transferred by the Mark 33 DITS are tabulated in Attachment 2 to this document. 

 

Note that Section 2.3.1.1 of this document calls for numeric data to be encoded in BCD and binary, the latter using two's complement fractional notation. In this notation, the most significant bit of the data filed represents one half of the maximum value chosen for the parameter being defined.  
Successive bits represents the increments of a binary fraction series.  Negative number are encoded as the complements of positive values and the negative sign is annunciated in the sign/status matrix. 

 
In establishing a given parameter's binary data standards for inclusion in Attachment 2, the units, maximum value and resolution of the parameter are first determined in that order.  The least significant bit of the word is then given a value equal to the resolution increment, and the number of significant bits is chosen such that the maximum value of the fractional binary series just exceeds the maximum value of the parameter, i.e., equals the next whole binary number greater than the maximum parameter value less one least significant bit value.  For example, if the Mark 33 DITS is required to transfer altitude in units of feet over a range of zero to 100,000 feet with a resolution of one foot, the number of significant bits is 17 and the maximum value of the fractional binary series is 131,071 (i.e., 131,071 - 1).  Note that because accuracy is a quality of the measurement process and not the data transfer process, it plays no part in the selection of word characteristics.  Obviously, the resolution provided in the DITS word should equal or exceed the accuracy in order not to degrade it. 

## 

For the binary representation of angular data, the Mark 33 DITS employs "degrees divided by 180o" 
as the unit  of data transfer and ± 1 (semicircle) as the range for two's complement fractional notation encoding ignoring, for the moment, the subtraction of the least significant bit value.  Thus the angular range 0 through 359.XXX degrees is encoded as 0 through ± 179.XXX degrees, the value of the most significant bit is none half semicircle and there are no discontinuities in the code. 

 
For convenience, all binary word ranges in Attachment 2 are shown as whole binary numbers rather than such numbers less one least significant bit value.  Also the resolutions shown are approximate only.  Accurate resolutions can be determined, if required, by reference to the range values and numbers of significant bits for the words of interest. 

 

## 2.1.6 Data Standards (Cont'D) Commentary (Cont'D)

3.1.4.3  HF COMMUNICATIONS Text amended to describe switching functions and finer frequency selection increments. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
 
3.1.4.3  HF Communications Frequency Range: 
2.8MHz to 24MHz 

| Frequency Selection    | 1kHz                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
|                        | Increments            |
| Characters encoded     | 10MHz, 1MHz, 0.1MHz,  |
|                        | in DITS word:         |
| Switching Functions:   | USB/AM mode selection |

 
It should be noted that in all applications of the two's complement fractional notation, the maximum value of the word, once chosen, cannot be changed by the use of more bits in the data field.  
The number of bits in the word affects only the resolution of the data, not its range. Binary coded decimal (BCD) data is encoded per the numeric subset of the ISO Alphabet No. 5 code (see Attachment 5 to this document) using bit nos. 1 through 4 of the seven-bit-per-character code.  
Alpha/numeric data is encoded using all seven bits per character of the ISO Alphabet #5 code and is transmitted using the special word format described in Section 2.3.1.3 of this document. 

## Formats

 
2.3.1.5  FILE DATA TRANSFER Section added to provide description of file data transfer protocol. Error corrected in bits 24 and 25 of ILS word. HF COMM frequency word format changed and second word added to enable the use of 100 Hz channel spacing. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS:

4. A change in ARINC 710 not shown in Supplement 
2 is a planned change for Supplement 3.  The resolution of Selected Runway Heading (BCD and 
BNR) will be changed to .1 o. 5. A change being considered for Supplement 3 is to 
change the range to –6g - +4g to facilitate direct 
recording by the flight recorder. 
ATTACHMENT 2: DATA STANDARDS (cont'd) NOTES 1. The number entered in the Range Column for each 
parameter that is not angular in nature is the 
nearest whole binary number greater than the parameter range required.  As explained in the 
Commentary following Section 2.1.6 of this document, the weight of the most significant bit of the two's complement fractional notation binary word will be one half this value, and the actual maximum value of the parameter capable of being encoded will be the number in the range column less one least significant bit value.  The numbers entered in the RANGE column for angular parameters are the actual degree ranges required. The way in which these parameters are encoded is also explained in the Commentary following Section 2.1.6. 2. Bit nos. 9 and 10 of the word may be used to 
achieve a 20 bit capability for high resolution of the Lat./Long. Position (codes 310 and 311).  The 
resulting resolution is .000086o for latitude and 
.00017 o  for longitude. 
 
ATTACHMENT 6: GENERAL WORD FORMATS & ENCODING EXAMPLES SSM codes in AIM words changed to reflect table amendment of section 2.1.5.1. Radio Height code example changed to reflect shift in field. Note 4 of Table 6.2 deleted to revert data coding to the original two's complement notation. Word formats added for date/flight leg and flight number information. Word format added for VOR Omnibearing. Codes 203, 204, 206 and 207 deleted in Table 6.1a. 

 3. A change in ARINC 707 not shown in Supplement 
2 is a planned change for Supplement 3.  A selftest inhibit bit will be added and the range of the data word will be halved to a value of 8192 ft.

Source/Destination Identifier (SDI) Field The purpose of the SDI field is explained in Section 2.1.4 of this document, as are also the limitations on its use.  When the SDI function is not required, this field may be occupied by binary zero or valid data pad bits. [2] 
Discretes As discussed in Section 2.3.1.2 of this document, unused bits in a word may be assigned to discrete functions, one bit per variable.  Bit #11 of the word should be the first to be so assigned; followed by bit #12 and so on in ascending numerical order until the data field is reached.  In the absence of discretes, unused bit positions should be occupied by binary zero or valid data pad bits.

Pad 
 

All bit positions not used for data or discretes should be filled with binary zero or valid pad bits. Section 2.1.2 of this document refers.

SUPPLEMENT 4 TO ARINC SPECIFICATION 429 - Page 2 
 
A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement introduces material on defining "No Computed Data" and "Failure Warning", priority assignment of SSM codes, description of fault tolerance and isolation, address capability of A/N messages, command/response protocol, modification of data standards, addition of new labels, change of some word formats, addition of material on signal characteristics, change of receiver impedance limits, expansion of the current label, change of the receiver voltage thresholds and modification of the HF and DME word formats. 

 
B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains description of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c-
4" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-4 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C. 

CHANGES 
TO 
SPECIFICATION 
429 

 This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is entitled by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification, or the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Specification is reproduced for reference. 

2.1.3  INFORMATION IDENTIFIER Text changed to describe use of five-character label. Commentary text partially deleted. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
2.1.3  Information Identifier The first eight bits of each word are assigned to a label function.  Label will: 
a. identify the information contained within BNR 
 
and BCD numeric data words (e.g., DME  
 
distance, static air temperature, etc.) and 

 
b. identify the word application for Discrete,   
 
Maintenance and AIM data. 
Label code assignments are set forth in Attachment 1 to this document. Special Note: In some ARINC 429 DITS applications, a bus will be dedicated to delivering a single information element from a source to one or more identical sink devices.  In such circumstances, the sink device designer might be tempted to assume that decoding the word label is not necessary.  Experience has shown, however, that system developments frequently occur that result in the need for additional information elements to appear on the bus.  If a sink device designed for service prior to such a development cannot decode the original word label, it cannot differentiate between this word and the new data in the new situation.  The message for sink designers should therefore be quite clear - provide label decoding from the outset, no matter how strong the temptation to omit it might be. 

 
Attachment 1 defines 256 discrete label codes. This quantity is expected to meet label assignment needs for the foreseeable future.  Should additional labeling capability be required in the longer term, it is envisaged that, rather than extend the length of the label field, a scheme will be devised in which existing label assignments are duplicated.  For example, the system could readily accommodate the assignment of the same label to two dissimilar parameters for which the probability of transmission on the same bus is very low. 

 
Adherence to the label code assignments of Attachment 
1 
is essential in inter-system communications and in intra-system communications where the system elements are defined as "unit interchangeable" per ARINC Report No. 403.  The assignment of label codes for all such communications must be coordinated with the air transport industry if chaos is to be avoided. A manufacturer who finds that Attachment 1 does not specify the label he needs for such system application must not simply choose one from those unassigned and "drive on".  He should contact ARINC for assistance.

 Notes: 1. A source system should annunciate any detected 
failure that causes one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable by ceasing to supply the affected word or words to the data bus. 2. Bit nos. 30 and 31 of BCD numeric data words 
should be "zero" when no sign is needed. 3. The "no computed data" code should be generated 
for BCD numeric data words when computed data is not available for reasons other than equipment 
failure. 4. When it appears in a BCD numeric data word 
identified by its (label) as a system output, the "functional test" code should be interpreted as advice that the data in the word results from the execution of a functional test.  When it appears in a 
BCD numeric data word identified by its label as an instruction, e.g., a radio channel change command, this code should be interpreted as a command to perform a functional test.  A self-test should produce indications of 1/8 of positive fullscale values unless indicated otherwise in an ARINC Equipment Characteristic. 
 
5. See Section 2.3.1.3 of this document for definitions 
of the terms "Initial Word", "Control Word", "Intermediate Word" and "Final Word." 
 
2.1.5.2  BNR NUMERIC DATA WORDS Table modified to permit sign coding for "no computed data". Definition of "failure warning" and "no computed data" added.

 Notes: 1. A source system should annunciate any detected 
failure that causes one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable by setting bit nos. 30 and 31 in the affected word(s) to the "failure warning" code defined above.  Words containing this code should continue to be supplied to the data bus during the failure condition. 2. Bit no. 29 should be "zero" when no sign is 
needed. 3. The "no computed data" code should be generated 
when computed data is not available for reasons other than equipment failure. 4. When it appears in a word identified by its label as 
a system output, the "functional test" code should 
be interpreted as advice that the data in the word results from the execution of a functional test.  A self-test should produce indications of 1/8 of positive 
full-scale 
values 
unless 
indicated 
otherwise in an ARINC Equipment Characteristic. 5. If, during the execution of a functional test, a 
source system detects a failure which causes one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable, it should immediately change the states of bits nos. 30 and 31 in the annunciation to the "failure warning" annunciation. 
 
 
2.1.5.3  STATUS PRIORITIES New section inserted. 2.2.1  TRANSMISSION SYSTEM INTERCONNECT 
Commentary expanded to provide description of possible solutions to single-wire fault conditions. 

 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.2.1 Transmission System Interconnect A data source should be connected to the data sink(s) by means of a single twisted and shielded pair of wires.  
The shields should be grounded at both ends and at all production breaks in the cable.  The interwiring diagram to be found in each ARINC Equipment Characteristic shows connector pins assigned to carry shields into black boxes for grounding.  Equipment manufacturers should ensure, however, that their equipment will operate correctly if, instead of being terminated on these pins, shields are grounded in the aircraft close to the rack connector. 

 

 
In 
practical 
wire 
line 
digital 
information 
transmission systems, cable characteristics and electrical mismatches can produce distortion of the digital data pulses.  Also, noise due to electrical interference perturbs digital signals. 
 
The performance of a digital receiver depends upon the receiver input signal characteristics (data with distortion and noise) and the receiver design. 

 
Prior to the selection of the voltage and impedance parameters set forth in this Section of this document, the pulse distortion likely to be encountered in systems built around them in existing size commercial aircraft was evaluated and judged to be acceptable for a well-designed receiver.  No restriction is placed by this specification, therefore, on the number or length of sturbs for installations on aircraft no larger than those existing, e.g., B 747.  See Appendix 1 to this document for a report of this investigation. 

2.2.3.1  TRANSMITTER VOLTAGE LEVELS Text changed to improve clarity. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.2.3.1  Transmitter Voltage Levels The differential output signal across the specified output terminals (balanced to ground at the transmitter) should be + 10 ± 1.0 volts, 0 ± 0.5 volts and –10 ± 1.0 
volts respectively for the "HI", "NULL" and "LO" states when the transmitter is open circuit.  The output impedance of the transmitter should be as specified in Section 2.2.4.1 of this document.  This output impedance should be present for the "HI", "NULL" and "LO" transmitter output conditions and also during transitions between these levels. 

2.2.3.2  RECEIVER VOLTAGE LEVELS Receiver voltage thresholds changed. Fault voltage text deleted. 

Commentary revised to include description of receiver reaction to undefined voltages. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.2.3.2  Receiver Voltage Levels The differential voltage presented at the receiver input terminals will be dependent upon line length, stub configuration and the number of receivers connected. In the absence of noise, the normal ranges of voltages presented to the receiver terminals (A and B) would be: 
"HI" 
+6V to 10V 

|     | "NULL"    | +0.5 to –0.5V    |
|-----|-----------|------------------|
|     | "LO"      | -6V to –10V      |

 In practice, these nominal voltages will be perturbed by noise and pulse distortion.  Thus, receivers should associate the following voltage ranges with the three states indicated: 
"HI" 
+5V to 13V 

|     | "NULL"    | +2.5V to –2.5V    |
|-----|-----------|-------------------|
|     | "LO"      | -5V to –13V       |

 Receivers should not be damaged by the application of up to 20VAC (RMS) across terminals A and B by the application of up to +28Vdc (min) bias between terminal A and ground and –28Vdc (min) bias between terminal B and ground.  See Attachment 3 to this document for a pictorial representation of transmitter and receiver voltage levels. 

 
Receiver input common mode voltages (terminal A to ground and terminal B to ground) are not specified because of the difficulties of defining ground with any satisfactory degree of precision. Receiver manufacturers are encouraged to work with the differential input voltage (line A to line B) and not line-to-ground voltages. 

 
The opinion is held by some people that conditions on transmission lines will be encountered which will require receivers to operate with less than the above-defined 
minimum difference of 2.5V 
between the NULL and HI and NULL and LO states.  Receiver designers are encouraged to investigate the possibilities and problems of working with a minimum difference of 1 volt between these states and to report their findings. 

## 2.2.4.1  Transmitter Output Impedance Text Added To Improve Clarity.

 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.2.4.1  Transmitter Output Impedance The transmitter output impedance should be 75 ± 5 
ohms, divided equally between line A and line B to provide an impedance balanced output. 

 
The output impedance of the transmitter is specified as 75 ± 5 ohms to provide an approximate match to the characteristic impedance of the cable.  The match can only be approximate due to the wide range of characteristic impedance which may be encountered due to the variety of conductor wire gages and insulation properties.  
Measurements on a few samples of wire showed a spread of characteristic impedance of 63 and 71 ohms.  An extrapolation over the wire gages 20 to 26 for wrapped and extruded insulation indicate an expected characteristic impedance spread of 80 to 60 ohms approx.  Twisted shielded wire specifications do not control the characteristic impedance of the cable, thus future developments in insulation techniques may result in cables having characteristic impedances outside the range estimated. 

2.2.4.2 RECEIVER INPUT IMPEDANCE Value of RI changed. 

 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.2.4.2 Receiver Input Impedance The receiver should exhibit the following characteristics, measured at the receiver input terminals: Differential Input Resistance RI = 6,000 ohms minimum Differential Input Capacitance CI = 50pF maximum Resistance to Ground RH and RG ≥ 12,000 ohms Capacitance to Ground CH and CG ≤ 50pF. No more than twenty receivers should be connected on to one digital data bus and each receiver should incorporate isolation provisions to ensure that the occurrence of any reasonably probable failure does not cause loss of data to the others. See Attachment 4 to this document for a pictorial representation of the input and output circuits standards. 

 
The above characteristics apply to differential amplifier receivers.  Opto-isolator technology is progressing and may soon find application in digital data receivers.   Opto-isolator receivers impose slightly greater loads on data buses than differential amplifier receivers and the way in which they are characterized is different.  It is probable, however, that a future revision of this Specification will include material specifically related to their use. 

2.2.5  Fault Tolerance New section inserted. 2.2.5.1  Receiver External Fault voltage Tolerance New section inserted. 2.2.5.2  Transmitter External Fault Voltage Tolerance New section inserted. 2.2.5.3  Transmitter External Fault Load Tolerance New section inserted. 2.2.6  Fault Isolation New section inserted. 2.2.6.1  Receiver Fault Isolation New section inserted. 2.2.6.2  Transmitter Fault Isolation New section inserted. 2.3.1.2  Discretes Text modified to expand label examples. Reference to AIDS limitations deleted. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.3.1.2  Discretes In addition to handling numeric data as specified above, the Mark 33 DITS should also be capable of accommodating discrete items of information either in 
the unused (pad) bits of data words or, when necessary, in dedicated words.  Any discrete information contained in a numeric data word assigned a label in Attachment 1 is specified in the definition for that word in Attachment 2. The rule to be followed in the assignments of bits to discretes in numeric data words is to start with the least significant bit of the word and to continue towards the most significant bit available in the word.  Attachment 6 shows that this against the background of the generalized word structure. There are two types of discrete words.  These are general purpose discrete words, and dedicated discrete words.  Five labels (octal 270-274) are assigned to the general purpose words in Attachment 1.  These words should be used in ascending label order (starting with octal 270) when the system receiving the data can identify its source by reference to the port at which it arrives.  The dedicated words should be used when  the  

## 2.3.1.2  Discretes (Cont'D) Data Is Intended For The Aids Dfdau Which Cannot Identify Sources In This Way. Commentary

The foregoing special provisions for the delivery of discrete data to an AIDS were made to compensate for the number of digital ports required when many ports are used is extremely difficult to achieve, which necessitated the development of the special AIDS words.  These words should be limited to AIDS utilization.  The few aircraft systems which deliver discretes to an AIDS by means of the Mark 33 DITS will be burdened very little by this. Similarly, the impact of label use will be small. 

 
2.3.1.4  AIM DATA Text added to describe unit addressing. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.3.1.4  AIMS Data AIM data (Acknowledgement, ISO Alphabet No. 5 and Maintenance information encoded in dedicated words) should be handled in the manner described in this Section. All three of these applications may involve the transfer of more than 21 bits per "data package".  Source equipment should format such long messages into groups of 32-bit DITS words, each word containing the relevant application label (see Attachment 1) in bit nos. 1 through 8, and a sign/status matrix code in bit nos. 30 and 31. Bit no. 32 should be encoded to render word parity odd. The first word of each group should contain the sign/status matrix code defined for "initial word" in Section 2.1.5.1 of this document.  It should also contain, in bit nos. 9 through 16, the binary representation of the number of words in the group, except that when this word is the only word to be transmitted, i.e., the total number of information bits to be transmitted is 13 or less, bit nos. 9 through 16 should all be binary "zeros". When the word application label is assigned in Attachment 1 for Acknowledgement Data, bit nos. 17 through 29 of this initial word may be used for information transfer.  When the word application label is either of those assigned in Attachment 1 for ISO Alphabet No. 5 data transfer or Maintenance Data (ISO Alphabet Not. 5), bit nos. 17 through 22 should be binary "zeros" (spares) and bit nos. 23 through 29 should take on the pattern of the ISO Alphabet No. 5 
control character "STX". The second word of the ISO Alphabet No. 5 and Maintenance Data (ISO Alphabet No. 5) application groups is an optional control word containing the sign/status matrix code for "control" information for the display.  When it is used, bit nos. 9 through 13 should contain the binary representation of the line count, bit nos. 14 through 16 should encode the required color, bit nos. 17 and 18 the required intensity, bit nos. 19 and 20 the required character size and bit no. 

21 should indicate whether or not the display is required to flash.  See Attachment 6 to this document for the encoding standards.  Bit nos. 22 through 29 of the word should be binary "zero" (spares). 

Intermediate words, containing the sign/status matrix code for "intermediate word", follow the initial word of the group or the control word, when used.  Intermediate words are optional in the sense that they are only transmitted if more words than the initial word and the final word (see below) are needed to accommodate the quantity of information to be transferred.  When the word application group label that is assigned in Attachment 1 for Acknowledgement, Data bit nos. 9 through 29 of that word are available for information transfer.  When the word application label is either of those assigned in Attachment 1 for ISO Alphabet No. 5 data transfer or Maintenance Data (ISO Alphabet No. 5), bit nos. 9 through 29 of each word should be divided into three seven-bit bytes (bit nos. 9 through 
15, 16 through 22 and 23 through 29), each of which contains one ISO Alphabet No. 5 character. Each AIM application group transmission other than single-word transmissions (see below) should be terminated with a word containing the sign/status matrix code for "final word" defined in Section 2.1.5.1 of this document.  The data field of this word should be structured similarly to that of the intermediate word. Any unused bit positions in ISO Alphabet No. 5) final transfer or Maintenance Data (ISO Alphabet No. 5) final words resulting from the number of ISO Alphabet No. 5 characters in the message being one or two less than a number wholly divisible by three should be filled with binary "zeros". 

2.3.1.5.1 
 COMMAND/RESPONSE PROTOCOL Text modified to describe transmitter reaction to lack of "Clear to send". ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.3.1.5.1 
Command/Response Protocol 

 File data will consist of both ARINC 429 BNR numeric words and ISO alphabet No. 5 characters.  A file may contain from 1 to 127 records.  Each record may contain from 1 to 126 data words. A record will contain, at the minimum, one of the eight versions of the "initial word" described in Section 2.3.1.5.2.  Records in which this initial word contains the "Data Follows" code will also contain from 1 to 126 "intermediate words" (data) and a "final word" (error control).  The file data transfer protocol is as follows. A transmitter having the data to send to a receiver transmits, on the bus connecting it to that receiver, the "Request to Send" initial word.  The receiver responds, on the separate bus provided for return data flow, with the "Clear to Send" reply.  The transmitter then sends the "Data Follows" initial word, the "intermediate words" and the "final word".  The receiver processes the error control information in the "final word" and, if no errors are revealed, closes out the transaction by 
sending the "Data Received OK" word to the transmitter. If the receiver is not ready to accept data when the transmitter sends its "Request to Send" word, it will so indicate in its response (see Section 2.3.1.5.2).  The transmitter should then wait 200 milliseconds and retransmit the "Request to Send".  The transmitter should also repeat a "Request to Send" transmission 50 milliseconds after the initial transmission if no response is obtained from the receiver.  An alert should be raised in the system containing the transmitter if 4 attempts to obtain a "Clear to Send" response from a receiver are unsuccessful. If the receiver detects a parity error during the transmission, it may request an error-correcting retransmission by sending a "Data Received Not OK" word to the transmitter in which is identified the record in which the error occurred.  The transmitter will interrupt the data flow and back up to the start of the record so identified.  It will then send a "Data Follows" initial word identifying this record as the starting point of the retransmission and recommence its output of data, continuing through the "final word".  The receiver will then close out the transaction as before. An error detected by processing the error control information in the "final word" will also result in the receiver sending a "Data Received Not OK" word to the transmitter.  In the absence of identification of the record in which the error occurred, this word should contain the sequence number of the first record of the file.  The transmitter's response will be to retransmit the whole file. The receiver can signal loss of synchronization to the transmitter at any time by sending the  
"Synchronization Lost" initial word.  On receiving this word the transmitter should curtail the data flow and back up to the beginning of the file.  It should then reestablish that the receiver can accept data by going through the request-to-send/clear-to-send routine.  
Having done this it should send the "Data Follows" initial word, followed by the data and the "final word". 

The protocol also allows a transmitter to send file size information to a receiver without any commitment to send, or request to the receiver to accept, the file itself. The "Header Information" initial word is used for this purpose.  Additionally, a "Poll" initial word is defined for use in system in which continuous "handshaking" between two terminals is desired.  The response to a "Poll" word will be either a "Request to Send" initial word when the polled terminal does have data to transmit, or another "Poll" word when it does not.  An exchange of "Poll" words may be interpreted as the message, " I have nothing for you, do you have anything for me?" 
 
2.4.2  INFORMATION RATES Commentary added to describe refresh rate. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.4.2 Information Rates The minimum update interval for each item of information transferred by the Mark 33 DITS is specified in the tables of Attachment 2. Discretes contained within data words will be transferred at the bit rate and repeated at the update rate of the primary data.  Words dedicated to discretes should be repeated continuously at the rates defined in Attachment 2. 

The time intervals between successive transmissions of a given BCD word specified in table 1 of Attachment 2 to this document are, in general, too short for the signal to be of use in driving a display device directly.  If the signal was so used, the least significant character of the display would change too rapidly for human perception.  Considerations other than human factors demand the time intervals specified.  Thus, display designers should incorporate into their devices means for selecting those words to be used for updating the display from the greater quantity delivered.

ATTACHMENT 2: DATA STANDARDS (cont'd) ORIGINAL TEX FOLLOWS: [2] 
Transmit 
intervals 
and 
the 
number 
of 
parameters to be transmitted are prime factors 
in bus loading.  It was suggested that a Minimum Transmit Interval be specified 
(perhaps a value of ½ the Transmit Interval) to control bus loading.  The ability of receivers to reject unwanted words would also be effective in improving bus efficiency.

A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement introduces material on fault detection, transmit intervals for words using multiple SDI codes, modification of IRS/AHRS discrete formats, expansion of error control definition, revision of ILS word, addition of new labels and change of existing data standards. 

 
B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c-
5" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-5 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C. 

 
CHANGES 
TO 
SPECIFICATION 
429 

 This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is entitled by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification, or by the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Specification is reproduced for reference. 

 
2.2.1  TRANSMISSION SYSTEM INTERCONNECT Text revised for break connections. Text added to Commentary describing increase of voltage threshold. 

 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
2.2.1  Transmission System Interconnect A data source should be connected to the data sink(s) by means of a single twisted and shielded pair of wires. The shields should be grounded at both ends and at all production breaks in the cable to an aircraft ground close to the rack connector. 

 
In practical wire line digital information transmission systems, cable characteristics and electrical mismatches can produce distortion of the digital data pulses.  Also, noise due to electrical interference perturbs digital signals. 

 
The performance of a digital receiver depends upon the receiver input signal characteristics (data with distortion and noise) and the receiver design. 

 
Prior to the selection of the voltage and impedance 
parameters set forth in this Section of  this document, the pulse distortion likely to be  
encountered in systems built around them in  
existing size commercial aircraft was evaluated and judged to be acceptable for a well-designed 
receiver.  No restriction is placed by this specification, therefore, on the number or length of stubs for installations on aircraft no larger than those existing, e.g., B 747.  See Appendix 1 to this document for a report of this investigation. 
 
Tests have shown that some receivers continue decoding data properly when one side of the transmission line is open or shorted to ground. When this condition exists noise immunity decreases and intermittent operation may occur. Users desire protection against non-annunciated system operation in this mode.  This protection may consist of additional circuitry to detect and annunciate the fault. 

2.2.3.2  RECEIVER VOLTAGE LEVELS Normal voltage ranges changed due to impedance changes. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.2.3.2  Receiver Voltage Levels The differential voltage presented at the receiver input terminals will be dependent upon line length, stub configuration and the number of receivers connected. In the absence of noise, the normal ranges of voltages presented to the receiver terminals (A and B) would be: 
"HI" 
+6.5V to 10V 
 
"NULL" +2.5V to –2.5V 
 
"LO" 
-6.5V to –13V 
In practice, these nominal voltages will be perturbed by noise and pulse distortion.  Thus, receivers should associate the following voltage ranges with the three states indicated: 
"HI" 
+6.5V to 13V 
 
"NULL" +2.5V to –2.5V 
 
"LO" 
-6.5V to –13V 
 

 
Receiver reaction is currently undefined in Specification 429 for voltages that fall in the range just above and below the "NULL" range. Respective equipment Characteristics should be referenced for desired receiver response in this range.  However, it is desirable that all DITS receivers will discontinue operation when the voltage levels fall into the undefined regions. Manufacturers are urged, as new equipment is developed, to "design in" the rejection capability.   

 
The opinion is held by some people that conditions on transmission lines will be encountered which 
will require receivers to operate with less than the 
above-defined minimum difference of 4.0V 
between the NULL and HI and NULL and LO states.  Receiver designers are encouraged to investigate the possibilities and problems of working with a minimum difference of  1 volt between these states and to report their findings. 

 
ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
2.4.2  Information Rates The minimum and maximum transmit intervals for each item of information transferred by the Mark 33 DITS are specified in the tables of Attachment 2. 

 

 
Receiver input common mode voltages (terminal A to ground and terminal B to ground) are not specified because of the difficulties of defining ground with any satisfactory degree of precision. Receiver manufacturers are encouraged to work with the differential input voltage (line A to line B) and not line-to-ground voltages. 

There are no values given for refresh rates in this Specification.  However, it is desirable that data be refreshed at least once per transmission.  Those data actually requiring long processing times or a large number of samples are the only types not expected to be refreshed with every transmission. Discretes contained within data words should be transferred at the bit rate and repeated at the update rate of the primary data.  Words dedicated to discretes should be repeated continuously at the rates defined in Attachment 2. 

 
The 
time 
intervals 
between 
successive 
transmissions of a given BCD word specified in table 1 of Attachment 2 to this document are, in general, too short for the signal to be of use in driving a display device directly.  If the signal was so used, the least significant character of the display would change too rapidly for human perception.  Considerations other than human factors demand the time intervals specified.  Thus, display designers should incorporate into their devices means for selecting those words to be used for updating the display from the greater quantity delivered.

2.3.1.5.4  FINAL WORDS Text added to define checksum. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.3.1.5.4  Final Words The final word of each record contains error control information.  Bit nos. 1 through 8 contain the file label. Bit nos. 9 through 29 contain an error control checksum computed from the states of bit nos. 9 through 31 of each intermediate word of the record.  Bit nos. 30 and 31 of this word contain the code identifying it as a final word.  Bit no. 32 is encoded to render word parity odd. 

 
2.3.4  ERROR DETECTION/CORRECTION Obsolete text deleted. ORIGIANL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.3.4  Error Detection/Correction The last bit of each word should be encoded such that word parity is rendered odd to allow error detection in receivers.  Note that the parity calculation encompasses all 31 label and information bits of the word.  The Mark 33 DITS contains no provisions for message retransmission, the inclusion of redundant bits in words or other means of error correction.

labels with multiple SDI codes. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: [2] 
Transmit intervals and the number of parameters to be transmitted are prime factors in bus loading.  The interval for transmission of parameters should fall between the minimum and maximum specified intervals and nominally should be near the center of the range at equal intervals between transmissions.  When heavy bus loading dictates a shift from the center of the range, the shift should be toward the maximum 
transmit interval.

2.1.5.1  BCD, NUMERIC, DISCRETE, AIM DATA 

## And File Transfer Words Commentary Revised To Reflect Use Of Failure Warning Flags In Discrete Words. Original Text Follows: Commentary Definitions

 
Invalid Data - is defined as any data generated by a 
source system whose fundamental characteristic is the inability to convey reliable information for the proper performance of a user system.  There are two categories of invalid data namely, "No Computed Data" and "Failure Warning". 
 
No Computes Data - is a particular case of data invalidity where the source system is unable to compute reliable data for reasons other than system failure.  This inability to compute reliable data is caused exclusively be a definite set of events or conditions whose boundaries are uniquely defined in the system characteristic.  When such a condition exists, the source system should annunciate its outputs to be invalid by setting the sign/status matrix of the affected words to the 
"NCD" code, as defined in sections2.1.5.1 and 
2.1.5.2.  The system indicators may or may not be flagged depending on system requirements. 

 
Failure Warning - is a particular case of data 
invalidity where the system monitors have detected one or more failures.  These failures are uniquely characterized by boundaries defined in the system characteristic.  When such a condition exists, the source system should annunciate its outputs to be invalid by either ceasing to supply the affected words to the data bus (the case of BCD data and ILS-LRRA installations with provisions for the 
interruption of AFS BNR data - see ARINC 
characteristics 707 and 710) or by setting the sign/status matrix of the affected words to the "Failure Warning" code (BNR case), as defined in sections 2.1.5.1 and 2.1.5.2.  The system indicators should always be flagged during a "Failure Warning" condition.

Each change or addition is entitled by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification, or by the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Specification is reproduced for reference. 

2.1.4  SOURCE DESTINATION IDENTIFIER Text added to clarify use of SDI on combined source/sink equipment. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.1.4  Source/Destination Identifier Bit nos. 9 and 10 of numeric data words should be reserved for a data source/destination identification function.  They are not available for this function in alpha/numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) data words (See Section 2.3.1.3 of this document) or when the resolution needed for numeric (BNR/BCD) data necessitates their use for valid data.  The source/destination identifier function may find application when specific words need to be directed to a specific system of a multi-system installation or when the source system of a multi-system installation needs to be recognizable from the word content.  When it is used,  a  source  equipment  should encode  its   aircraft installation number in bit nos. 9 and 10 as shown in the table below.  A sink equipment should recognize words containing its own installation number code and words containing code "00", the "all-call" code.

 Note: In certain specialized application of the SDI function the all-call capability may be forfeited so that code "00" is available as an "installation no. 4" identifier. When the SDI function is not used, binary zeros or valid data should be transmitted in bit nos. 9 and 10. 

 
This document does not address the practical question of how the SDI bits will be set in those multi-installation systems in which the source/destination function is desired.  One way would be to use program pins on the individual installation black boxes which would be wired to set up the appropriate code.  The ARINC Characteristics devoted to the individual systems will define the method actually to be used.

A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT This Supplement introduces new label assignments and equipment identification codes. 

 
B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c-11" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should be inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-11 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader. C.

 This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is entitled by the section number and title currently employed in the Specification or by the section number and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Specification is reproduced or reference.

# Supplement 12 To

 

Published: July 1, 1990 
A.  PURPOSE OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The Supplement introduces the Williamsburg bit-oriented file data transfer protocol which supports the transfer of binary and character data.  The previous AIM and character-oriented file transfer protocol sections are moved to Appendix 6.  The Sign Status Matrix (SSM) 
information is revised and reorganized.  In addition, this Supplement introduces new label assignments and equipment identification codes. 

 
B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper contains descriptions of the changes introduced into the Specification by this Supplement, and, where appropriate, extracts from the original text for comparison purposes.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect these changes.  The modified and added material on each replacement page is identified with "c-12" symbols in the margins.  Existing copies of Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages should e inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. Copies of the Specification bearing the number 429-12 already contain this Supplement and thus do not require revisions by the reader.

2.3.1.5  File Data Transfer An editorial change was needed to reference new section. 2.3.1.5.1 
 Bit-Oriented Protocol Determination 
2.5.6  Protocol Words This section was added to specifically define the word type for protocol words. 

2.5.6.1  Protocol Identifier 
 
This section was added to clarify the definition of bits 28- 25 for protocol words and to specify the relevant addition for error conditions. 

2.5.6.2  Destination Code This section was updated, and a commentary added, to clarify the role of the link layer protocol for upward compatibility with changing network functionality.  The requirement for Destination code validation is not a link layer function. 

2.5.6.3  Word Count This section was renumbered. 

2.5.7  Request to Send (RTS) This section was previously titled "Response to TS", and has been renumbered.  The title was changed for consistency, and an introductory paragraph added to clarify the basic RTS function.

New commentary equates a "timely manner" to the shorter retry sequence of the NCTS series. 

2.5.7.4  No Response to RTS This section was renumbered, and the ALOHA word was included in the logic for error determination. 

2.5.10  Start of Transmission (SOT) 
 
Timer T13 was added as a requirement on the source to begin transmission of an LDU within a specified interval after receipt of the CTS word from the sink. 

2.5.10.1  General Format Identifier (GFI) This section was updated, and commentary added to clarify the role of the GFI in pre-OSI as well as OSI environments.  Validation of the GFI code is required by a high level entity (network layer) in both environments to determine the format of the data words to follow.  GFI validation is not necessarily a link layer function. 

 
This section was expanded to include determination of different version numbers of the bit-oriented protocol, and was moved to Section 2.5.19. 

 
2.5  Bit-Oriented Communication Protocol An editorial change references a new section number. 

 
2.5.4  Bit Rate and Word Timing A maximum word gap of 64 bit-times, (averaged over the LDU transmission) was added to eliminate excessive delay in source transmission time. Note: Sections 2.5.5 through 2.7 have been renumbered and reordered for consistency. 

 
2.5.5  Word type The basic definition of "word type" was corrected to include bits  31-29 in all bit-oriented words of an LDU. 

2.5.20  Bit Protocol Verification 
2.6  Windowed Bit-Oriented Protocol This is a completely new section which contains the system description of the new LLC2-like bit-oriented link layer protocol for 429.  It is based on Section 2.5, "Bit-
Oriented Communications Protocol", with expanded text as specified to allow for more efficient use of the 429 high (or low) speed data bus through "windowing".  The definition includes provision for a Link Control Word prior to each LDU.

2.5.11  Data All references to Character Data word formats were deleted. 

2.5.11.3  Character Data Words 
 
This section was deleted.  The Character Data Word format was removed from Supplement 14, as the format is incompatible with those for Full and Partial Data word formats.  Currently, both binary and character data are transmitted in octets defined by the other two data word formats.  The special character data format is not required. 

2.5.12.1  CRC Encoding References to character data words were deleted.  The text for equation: M9x) = x16G(x) + R(x) was corrected by moving the "bar" from G(x) to R(x). 

 
2.5.13  Negative Acknowledgement (NAK) NAK word interpretation was changed to remove constraint on source for specific order of file sequencing (i.e. Allows source to restart file with new FSN if necessary). 

2.5.14.1  Duplicate LDU This first paragraph was rewritten to clarify. 

2.5.14.3  Incomplete File Timer This section was added to allow the sink to discard a partial file of multiple LDUs when the T14 timeout between LDU transmissions is exceeded.  It ensures that a source device cannot "lock-up" a sink. 

 
2.5.15  SYN Word The LDU sequence anomalies which generate a SYN response by the sink were clarified. 

2.5.16  Response to ACK/NAK/SYN 
 
The T16 timer was introduced to replace T10  and T8.  
Also, the action taken by the source upon receipt of a SYN word was updated, which relaxes requirements to maintain a specific File Sequence ordering by the source. 

2.5.19  Protocol Initialization 
 
2.5.19.1  Bit-Oriented Protocol Version, 2.5.19.2  ALOHA Response, and 2.5.19.3  Character-429 Determination This section has been added to replace and expand on the definition of the process to determine the link layer protocol version supported by an interfacing system. These sections replace three sections from Supplement 13. 2.3.1.5.1 
 Bit-Oriented Protocol Determination ORIENTED PROTOCOL Table 10-1 was updated to include a standard value for N7, the maximum number of LDUs in a window (see Section 2.6 "Windowed Bit-Oriented Protocol"). 

 
Table 10-3 deleted Option 6 (O6) for NAK Send Time, and deleted Option 9 (O9) for the Character Data Word, both of which are no longer used. Table 10-4 was revised to include columns for low speed maximum and minimum values.  These values were established for timers and as response time design goals for incoming transmissions.  Timers T13 through T16 were added. Table 10-5 was added to include a definition of high speed maximum and minimum values for timers and response time design goals.  The format is the same as the revised Table 10-4.  Timer T10 is not used in the high speed protocol. 

Table 10-6 was added to include notes to Tables 10-1 
through 10-5. 

ATTACHMENT 11 - BIT-ORIENTED DATA FILE TRANSFER WORD FORMATS Table 11-1A added "spares" for the deleted Character Data Formats and corrected "Protocol Data Word" to read 
"Protocol Word". Table 11-4 updated definitions for bits 9 through 24 of the ALO and ALR words, and added the LCW (LDU Control Word) format definition. Table 11-4A was added as a partial replacement for ATTACHMENT 11C and Table 11-4B was added to define the new window definitions for the Windowed Bit-
Oriented protocol in Section 2.6. Table 11-6A was revised, changing the former GFI bit pattern (0001) for ISO 8208 to "unassigned".  The bit pattern (0100) for ISO 8473 was changed to a more 

## 2.5.19  Alo Response, And Attachment 11 - Bit-Oriented Data File Transfer Word Formats (Cont'D) Generic Iso 9577 Definition.  The Bit Pattern 1110 (Hex"E") Is Now Defined As "Acars Vhf Format".The "Notes" In Attachment 11 Have Been Renumbered To Correspond To The New Table Definitions. Attachment 11C - Aloha/Aloha Response Protocol Word Definition This Attachment Has Been Deleted.  This Information Has Been Moved To Tables 11-4, 11-4A, And 11-4B. Attachment 13A - Aloha Version Determination Sequence This Attachment Was Added To Support The Aloha Version Determination Sequence Called Out In Section 2.5.19.1.1. Attachment 14 - System Adderess Labels New System Address Labels (Sal) Were Added. Attachment 16 - Sequence Of Protocol And Data Words In Window Transfer This Attachment Was Added To Illustrate The Window Transfers For New Section 2.6.

A.  PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT This Supplement introduces new label assignments, equipment IDs, system address labels and updates to the 429W protocol. 

 
B.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS SUPPLEMENT The first part of this document, printed on goldenrod paper contains descriptions of changes introduced into this Specification by this Supplement.  The second part consists of replacement white pages for the Specification, modified to reflect the changes.  The modified and added material on each page is identified by a c-15 in the margins.  Existing copies of ARINC Specification 429 may be updated by simply inserting the replacement white pages where necessary and destroying the pages they replace.  The goldenrod pages are inserted inside the rear cover of the Specification. 

 
C.   CHANGES TO ARINC SPECIFICATION 429 
      INTRODUCED BY THIS SUPPLEMENT This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change or addition is defined by the section number and the title currently employed in the Specification or by the section name and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated. In each case a brief description of the change or addition is included. 

2.0  Digital Information Transfer System Standards Numerous changes were made to the protocol throughout this Section. 

2.1.5.3  Discrete Data Words The technique for encoding SSM bits in discrete words were revised. 

ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 
2.1.5.3  Discrete Data Words A source system should annunciate any detected failure that could cause one or more of the words normally output by that system to be unreliable.  Three methods are defined. The first method is to set bit numbers 30 and 31 in the affected word(s) to the "Failure Warning" code defined in the table below.  This is the preferred method.  Words containing the "Failure Warning" code should continue to be supplied to the data bus during the failure condition. When using the second method, the equipment may stop transmitting the affected word or words on the data bus. The third method applies to data words which are defined such that they contain failure information within the data field.  For these applications, refer to the associated ARINC equipment characteristic to determine the proper SSM reporting. The "No Computed Data" code should be annunciated in the affected Discrete Data word(s) when a source system is unable to compute reliable data for reasons other than system failure.

## A.  Purpose Of This Supplement

This portion of Supplement 15 provides corrections and additions to the file transfer provisions of ARINC Specification 429. The reader should note that the organization of ARINC 429 has been described in Section B below. 

Appendix C was added to assist designers in establishing connectivity between LRUs designed to different versions of Specification 429. Appendix D comprises the Specification and Description Language (SDL) diagrams that reflect the intent of the textual material. The SDL diagrams have not been fully proofed, and remain advisory in nature. Therefore, the text material has precedence over the SDL diagrams. When the SDL diagrams have been validated, they will be moved to an Attachment. 

## B.  Organization Of This Supplement

The portion of this document, printed on goldenrod paper, contains descriptions of changes introduced into this Specification by this Supplement.  In the text, printed on white paper, the modified and added material on each page is identified by a c-15 in the margins. In view of the document reorganization, existing copies of ARINC 429 cannot be updated.

This Supplement is the first in which ARINC Specification 429 is divided into three parts. This part, Part 3, contains the definition of the protocols used for file data transfer. Typically, file data transfer is non-periodic in nature. The fundamental physical layer descriptions of the wire, voltage levels and coding of data are contained in Part 1. Part 1 also contains the listing of data word labels assigned for the transmission of broadcast periodic data. Part 2 contains a tabulation of the ever-increasing list of Discrete data words used to provide status information. 

## C. Changes To Arinc Specification 429 Introduced By This Supplement

This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement.  Each change and addition is defined by the section number and the title currently employed in the Specification or by the section name and title that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.  In each case, a brief description of the change or addition is included. A tabulation of  sections is included with this supplement to enable the reader to correlate the previous section assignments with the new Part 3 Supplement 15 section number assignments. 

The following changes affect only ARINC Specification 429-15, Part 3, File Data Transfer Techniques. Refer to Parts 1 and 2 for changes impacting the broadcast provisions of ARINC Specification 429.

## Supplement 17 To Arinc Specification 429 Mark 33 Digital Information Transfer System (Dits) Part 3 File Data Transfer Techniques

Published:  May 17, 1999 
 

## A. Purpose Of This Supplement

This Supplement introduces the definition of a new bit-oriented file data transfer protocol. The protocol is designed to be consistent with the IEEE-802 Media Access Control (MAC) protocol definition. Version 3 fills the role intended for Version 2 of the Williamsburg protocol by providing a high throughput avionics file data transfer interface. Version 2 was deleted by Supplement 16. Version 3 is intended to be capable of being bridged to other common data bus protocols, most significantly, Ethernet.  

## B. Organization Of This Supplement

Changes introduced by Supplement 17 were deemed sufficiently significant to issue an entirely new publication of Specification 429 Part 3. There is no standalone Supplement. This part, printed on goldenrod colored paper, contains a list of descriptions of changes introduced into this Specification by this Supplement 17. In the body of the document, the changes (.i.e., the modified and added material) introduced by Supplement 17 are identified by c 17 change bars in the margins.   

## C. Changes To Arinc Specification 429, Part 3 Introduced By This Supplement

This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification introduced by this Supplement. In the text below, the Section number and title of each affected Section, Attachment or Appendix is listed, followed by a brief description of the change or addition.

Published:  October 12, 2001 
 

## A. Purpose Of This Supplement

This Supplement introduces the assignment of 3 new satellite links, HFDR Right, TAWS, and CVR into the Destination Code table. 

A Table was added to define the Variables of Low Speed Connectionless Bit- Oriented Protocol. Typographical errors were corrected in the text. 

## B. Organization Of This Supplement

The first part of this document printed on golden-rod paper contains descriptions of changes introduced into this Specification by this Supplement.   
The changes introduced by Supplement 18 have been identified using change bars and are labeled in the margin by a "c-18" indicator. 

## C. Changes To Arinc Specification 429, Part 3 Introduced By This Supplement

This section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Specification to be introduced by this Supplement. Each change or addition is identified by the section number and the title that will be employed for that section when the Supplement is eventually incorporated. In each case a brief description of the change or addition is included. 

## 3.4.3 System Address Labels (Sal)

Corrected the reference to the table of SAL assignments (from Attachment 14 to Attachment 11) in ARINC Specification 429 Part 1.   

## 3.4.4 Bit Rate And Word Timing

Provision was added to specify that the Williamsburg version 3 protocol may be operated at low speed. 

## Attachment 10 - Variables To Bit-Oriented Protocol

Added new Table 10-7 to support low speed operation of Williamsburg protocol at low speed.  Later modified the value of the variables. 

## Attachment 11A - Destination Codes

The assignment of 'T" for the transponder was deleted. Six new entries, HFDR Right, TAWS, CVR Inmarsat, ICO, and Globalstar satellite link identifiers were added as destination codes. The format and content of the table was aligned with the corresponding Table 3-1 of Attachment 3 to ARINC Specification 619 to improve consistency.  

## Appendix A - J

--```,````,,,````,`,,```,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
These appendices were formerly identified as Appendix 1 –10. During the regeneration of Specification Description Language (SDL) diagrams in Appendix I, references to Section 1.3.7 were revised to Section 2.5.19.

## A. Purpose Of This Document

This Supplement provides an addition two destination codes to Attachment 11A to align it with ARINC 619. 

## B. Organization Of This Supplement

In the past, changes introduced by a Supplement to an ARINC Standard were identified by vertical change bars with an annotation indicating the change number. Electronic publication of ARINC Standards has made this mechanism impractical. 

In this document **blue bold** text is used to indicate those areas of text changed by the current Supplement only. 

## C. Changes To Arinc Specification 429 Introduced By This Supplement

This section presents a complete listing of the changes to the document introduced by this Supplement. Each change is identified by the section number and the title as it will appear in the complete document. Where necessary, a brief description of the change is included. 

## 1.3 Development Of File Data Transfer

The clarification "aperiodic file data transfer" was added. 

## 1.3.4 File Data Transfer

The definition of the acronym BOP (Bit-Oriented Protocol) was added. 

## 1.3.5 Transmission Order

Existing text was moved to COMMENTARY. 

## 2.5 Bit-Oriented Communications Protocol

The clarification "conventional broadcast data words" was added. 

## 2.5.3 System Address Labels (Sals)

The clarification "conventional broadcast data words**communications**" was added to the last sentence of the commentary. 

## 2.5.7.4 No Response To Rts

Clarification by adding "The No Response counter (N3) should be reset upon receiving a valid response to the RTS."
