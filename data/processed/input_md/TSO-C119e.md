1. PURPOSE. This technical standard order (TSO) is for manufacturers applying for a TSO 
authorization (TSOA) or letter of design approval (LODA).  In it, we (the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)) tell you what minimum performance standards (MPS) your traffic alert and collision avoidance system II (TCAS II) must first meet for approval and identification with the applicable TSO marking. 

 

## 2. Applicability. This Tso Affects New Applications Submitted After Its Effective Date.

 
a. TSO-C119d will also remain effective until December 31, 2017.  After this date, we will no longer accept applications for TSO-C119d. 

 
b. TCAS II approved under a previous TSOA may still be manufactured under the provisions of their original approval.  

 
3. REQUIREMENTS. New models of TCAS II identified and manufactured on or after the effective date of this TSO must meet the MPS qualification and documentation requirements in these RTCA, Inc. documents:  1) RTCA/DO-185B, Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II), dated June 19, 2008, Section 2, as modified by Change 1 dated July 1, 2009; Change 2 dated March 20, 2013, and appendix 1 of this TSO; and 2)  RTCA/DO-300A, Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II) Hybrid Surveillance, dated March 20, 2013, section 2, as modified by Change 1 dated December 15, 2015 and appendix 2 of this TSO.  

 
a. **Functionality.**  This TSO's standards apply to equipment intended to be used in transponder equipped aircraft to provide a reliable traffic alert and collision avoidance function. 

 
b .  **Failure Condition Classification.**  Failure of the function defined in paragraph **3.a** of this 
TSO is a *hazardous/severe-major* failure condition.  Develop the TCAS II to at least the design assurance level equal to this failure condition classification. 

 
c. Functional Qualification.  Demonstrate the required performance under the test conditions in RTCA/DO-185B, Section 2 as modified by Change 1 and Change 2, and RTCA/DO-300A, Section 2 
as modified by Change 1. 

d. Environmental Qualification. Demonstrate the required performance under the test conditions specified in RTCA/DO-185B Section 2.3 using standard environmental conditions and test procedures appropriate for airborne equipment.  You may use a different standard environmental condition and test procedure than RTCA/DO-160G, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, dated December 8, 2010, provided the standard is appropriate for the TCAS 
II airborne equipment. 

Note: The use of RTCA/DO-160D (with Changes 1 and 2 only, without change 3 incorporated) or earlier versions is generally not considered appropriate and will require substantiation via the deviation process as discussed in paragraph **3.g** of this TSO. 

 
e.  Software Qualification.  If the article includes software, develop the software according to RTCA, Inc. document RTCA/DO-178C, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, dated December 13, 2011, including referenced supplements as applicable, to at least the software level consistent with the failure condition classification defined in paragraph 
3.b of this TSO. You may also develop the software according to RTCA, Inc. document RTCA/DO-
178B, dated December 1, 1992, if you follow the guidance in Advisory Circular (AC) 20-115C, Airborne Software Assurance, dated July 19, 2013. 

 
f.  **Electronic Hardware Qualification.**  If the article includes complex custom airborne electronic hardware, develop the component according to RTCA, Inc. Document RTCA/DO-254, Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware, dated April 19, 2000, to at least the design assurance level consistent with the failure condition classification defined in paragraph **3.b** of this TSO.  For custom airborne electronic hardware determined to be simple, RTCA/DO-254, paragraph 1.6 applies. 

 
g.  **Deviations**.  We have provisions for using alternate or equivalent means of compliance to the criteria in the MPS of this TSO.  If you invoke these provisions, you must show that your equipment maintains an equivalent level of safety.  Apply for a deviation under the provisions of 14 CFR ยง 21.618. 

 

## 4. Marking.

a.  Mark at least one major component permanently and legibly with all the information in 
14 CFR ยง 45.15(b).  Use serial number in place of optional date of manufacture as stated in  
14 CFR ยง45.15(b)(2). 

 
b.  Also, mark the following permanently and legibly, with at least the manufacturer's name, subassembly part number, and the TSO number: 

 
(1)  Each component that is easily removable (without hand tools), and, 
 
 
(2)  Each subassembly of the article that you determined may be interchangeable. 

 
c.   If the article includes software and/or airborne electronic hardware, then the article part numbering scheme must identify the software and airborne electronic hardware configuration.  The part numbering scheme can use separate, unique part numbers for software, hardware, and airborne electronic hardware. 

 
d.  You may use electronic part marking to identify software or airborne electronic hardware components by embedding the identification within the hardware component itself (using software) rather than marking it on the equipment nameplate.  If electronic marking is used, it must be readily accessible without the use of special tools or equipment.

## Appendix 1.  Faa Modifications To Rtca/Do-185B Change 2

1.  This appendix lists FAA modifications to RTCA/DO-185B Change 2, *Minimum Operational* 
Performance Standards for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II). 

 
1.1 
When ownship is on the ground, clarification is required to allow the system to limit the output of TCAS intruders to the display to those within 3000 feet of own altitude.  In lieu of section 2.2.2, System Performance, of RTCA/DO-185B Change 2, substitute the following: 

 
2.2.2  
System Performance 
 
Note:  When operating within the maximum aircraft transponder population and 
electromagnetic interference levels defined in subparagraph 2.2.1.2, TCAS II 
will provide a level of performance for active surveillance of targets-of-interest 
that will support the requirements for generation of collision advisory information. 
Specifically, TCAS II will generate a surveillance track in range and altitude on a target-of-interest at the range and with the track probability and range 
accuracy specified below.  This is to ensure that a correct resolution advisory can be issued in time for the pilot to maintain adequate vertical separation at closest-point-of-approach. 
TCAS II will also generate, whenever possible, a surveillance track in range and altitude on a target-of-interest at the range and with the track probability 
and range accuracy specified below such that a correct traffic advisory can be issued as a precursor to the resolution advisory. 
In addition to the surveillance requirements to support generation of resolution and traffic advisories, TCAS II will display the range and, if available, the 
altitude and bearing position information on targets that generate advisories. The bearing position information will be generated according to the accuracy requirement specified below. 
TCAS II will also generate for display, whenever possible, surveillance range, altitude and bearing position information on Mode C and Mode S aircraft that are within the range specified below and within ยฑ10,000 ft altitude relative to TCAS II when airborne, and within ยฑ3,000 ft altitude relative to TCAS II when on the ground. 
It is acceptable to limit the output of TCAS intruders to the display to those within 3000 feet of own altitude when own aircraft is on the ground.  This is permitted (but not required) so that the altitude surveillance volume for TCAS Mode C intruders can be consistent with the Mode S surveillance altitude limits modified in RTCA/DO-185B Change 2 (section 2.2.4.6.2.2.1).  This allowance 
to limit the display to ยฑ3000 feet does not modify surveillance altitude volumes 
which are defined in RTCA/DO-185B section 2.2.4.6. 

The system shall use the definition of on-ground as defined in RTCA/DO-185B Volume II 2.1.14.  Alternatively, the system may use the definition of 
"operating on Surface" in RTCA/DO-300A section 2.2.8 for on-ground. 

## Appendix 2.  Faa Modifications To Rtca/Do-300A

1.  This appendix lists FAA modifications to RTCA/DO-300A, *Minimum Operational* 
Performance Standards for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II Hybrid Surveillance). 

1.1. 

To facilitate maintenance personnel with monitoring of the hybrid surveillance functionality, add the following requirement as the fifth paragraph (including the Note) in section 2.2.10, Monitoring Requirements: 

TCAS II units shall provide a means for presenting logged hybrid surveillance faults to maintenance personnel to enable on-wing monitoring of hybrid surveillance functionality at periodic intervals. 

Note:  This requirement enables implementation of a scheduled maintenance task to ensure hybrid surveillance is functional on aircraft without a centralized warning system and/or an onboard maintenance computer.
