## 1.0 Purpose And Scope Ld Introduction

This document contains minimum operational performance standards for Strapdown Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRS). This document is intended for equipment that does not use gimbaled sensors. This document is intended for equipment that outputs attitude (pitch and roll), It also addresses functions of heading, turn, slip, and the display of this information. This document does not specify the format of data outputs, These standards specify equipment characteristics that' should be useful to designers, manufacturers, installers and users of the equipment. 

Compliance with these standards is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operation. Any regulatory application of this document is the sole responsibility of appropriate governmental agencies. 

Section 1.0 of this document provides information needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated in the remaining sections. 

It describes typical equipment applications and operation goals, as envisioned by the members of Special Committee 219, and establishes the basis for the standards stated in Sections through 3.0. Definitions and assumptions essential to proper understanding of 
1 
document are also provided in this section, Section_2.0 contains the minimum performance standards for the equipment. These standards specify the required performance under standard and environmental conditions, Also included are recommended laboratory and manufacturer flight evaluation procedures necessary to demonstrate equipment compliance with the stated minimum requirements. 

Section 3.0 describes the performance required of the installed equipment. Tests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through laboratory testing. 

Appendix A discusses demonstrating equipment performance using simulation in lieu of flight evaluation. 

This document considers an equipment configuration consisting of an Attitude and Heading Reference Unit (AHRU) with complementary peripheral equipment specified by the AHRS manufacturer. 

Operation performance standards for functions or components that refer to equipment capabilities that exceed the stated minimum requirements are identified as optional features. 

The word "equipment" as used in this document includes all components and units necessary for the system to properly perform its intended function(s). 

For example, the 
"equipment" may include an AHRU, an associated mounting tray, and a magnetic sensing unit. In the case of this example, all of the foregoing components and units comprise the "equipment." It should not be inferred from this example that each AHRS equipment design will necessarily include all of the foregoing components or units. This will depend on the specific design chosen by the manufacturer. 

## 12 System Overview

As shown in Figure 1-1, the AHRS system may consist of: 

## 1.2.1 Attitude And Heading Reference Unit (Ahru)

The AHRU includes: 
Inertial sensing unit which includes a series of angular rate sensors, accelerometers and/or inclinometers. Electronics package that processes the sensor data into a usable output format. 

Integral power supply assembly. 

Mechanical housing, in which the above components are embedded, which is 
"strapped down" (not gimbaled) to an aircraft frame. 

## Magnetic Sensing Unit (Msu)

1.2.3 
Option(s): 

Mounting tray to assist in precision alignment to aircraft axis Memory device(s) which preserve critical alignment data, as well as other information Installation hardware, connectors, fasteners, etc. 

## 1.24 Complementary Aiding Devices:

| Air    |
|--------|
| GPS,   |
| Ete.   |

## Aircraft Power 13 Operational Applications(S)

One or more AHRS may be used on an aircraft to supply attitude and heading information to the pilots of the aircraft to aid them with the control and guidance of the aireratt. 

'The AHRS may be used to supply attitude and heading, and other information such as angular rates and accelerations to autopilots or stability augmentation equipment on the aircraft. 

Information from the AHRS may be used by other equipment on the aircraft to control their functions. For example, attitude and heading information may be used in an antenna pointing system. 

This document does not define the intended function for the AHRS, and instead requires that the AHRS manufacturer provide performance data to support installation. Thus, the onus is placed on the installer to define the intended use of AHRS, determine appropriate performance requirements, and establish that the AHRS 
complies with those requirements. 

For example, instead of defining attitude accuracy classes based on functions such as primary attitude indicator, secondary attitude indicator, or attitude stabilization device, the document defines five attitude accuracy categories with no definition of the intended use of each of these accuracy levels. As a result, the installation of AHRS will require installation-specific certification and review for each project. 

## Required Functions Attitude

The attitude from the AHRS is the common aircraft pitch and roll information needed to control the aircraft. For a more thorough understanding of the required availability and integrity of this function, consult with the aircraft Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA) 
for the intended application. 

The attitude requirements are found in Section 2. 

## 15 Optional Functions 15.1 Heading

Heading from the AHRS, magnetic or non-magnetic, is the common information used by pilots to determine the direction the aircraft is pointing. 

The heading requirements are found in Section 2.2.3. 

## 15.2 'Turn And Slip

'The turn and slip functions provide the rate and the coordination (slip or skid) of the turn, 
'The AHRS turn and slip performance requirements are provided in Section 2.2.5. 

## 15.3 Other Functions

The AHRS may also provide angular rates and linear accelerations, but these functions are not addressed in this document. 

## 1.6 Operational Goals

The goal of the AHRS 
is to provide attitude, and optionally heading, turn, standard turn bank angle, slip, angular rate, acceleration, and other information, This information is used to enable a pilot, autopilot or other equipment in the aircraft to control and guide the aireraft in a safe manner, The accuracy requirements of the outputs depend on the application. Different accuracy categories have been specified to help in distinguishing AHRS of different capabilities. 

Some equipment may be capable of generating heading without a Magnetic Sensor Unit 
(MSU). Some equipment may only be capable of providing magnetic heading when operating with an MSU. Categories for these and other capabilities are specified. 

## 17 Ahrs Categories 17 Modes Of Operation

An AHRS system may have multiple modes of operation, The equipment will be categorized in accordance with the functions and accuracy that it provides in each of these modes. The manufacturer will declare the performance category for each operating mode (except degraded modes) using a six-character-alphanumeric string as denoted in Table 2-1, Table 2-2, and Table 2-3. Requirements for degraded modes are specified in Section 2.2.4. 

## 1.7.2 Category Strings

The first two characters of a category string are reserved for the mode's attitude performance. The third and fourth characters of a category string are reserved for the mode's heading performance and availability. The fifth and sixth characters of a category string are reserved for the mode's turn and slip availability. An AHRS will have one or more category strings, each associated with an operating mode. An example of an AHRS 
with four available operating modes is shown in Table 
1-1, Each operating mode has its own category string.

## 18 Test Procedures

The test procedures specified in this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the applicable performance requirements. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other equivalent methods may be acceptable. Alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information, In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. 

The order of tests specified suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design, and design qualification, into operational use. For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2.0 will have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section 3.0. 

## Environmental Tests

Environmental test requirements are specified in Section 2.3. The procedures and their associated requirements are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations. 

Unless otherwise specified, the environmental conditions and test procedures contained in RTCA/DO-160G (or other version acceptable to the certification authority), Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, will be used to demonstrate equipment compliance. 

## 2 Laboratory Tests And Flight Evaluations

Laboratory test and flight evaluation procedures are specified in Section 2.4. 

These procedures provide a means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Section 2.2. Results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance, for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design, 

## 3. Installed Equipment Tests

The installed equipment test procedures and their associated limits are specified in Section 3.0. Installed tests are normally performed under two conditions: 

a. 
With the aircraft on the ground and using simulated or operational 
system inputs. 
b. 
With the aircraft in flight using operational system inputs appropriate to 
the equipment under test.

Definition 
Term 
Euler Angles 
Euler angles are three angles introduced by Leonhard Euler to 
describe the orientation of a rigid body such as an aireraft. Euler 
angles define the attitude and heading of an aircraft in terms of a 
series of three rotations from a north-pointing local level coordinate system to the aircraft body coordinate system. The rotations consist 
of: heading rotation about the normal (down) axis; pitch rotation 
about the lateral axis; and roll rotation about the longitudinal axis. 
Euler Rates 
Rate of change of 
the pitch, roll, and heading Euler angles.

2.1.6 

## Effects Of Test

The equipment shalll be designed so that the application of specified test procedures shall not be detrimental to equipment performance following the application of the tests, except as specifically allowed. 

## Design Assurance

The hardware and software shalll be designed and developed such that the probability of providing hazardously misleading information and the probability of loss of function are acceptable based on the overall allocated attitude and heading reference system integrity and continuity requirements, respectively. These requirements apply when the equipment is in its installed configuration for the most stringent intended application. 

To demonstrate compliance, it will be necessary to conduct a safety assessment to evaluate the system's implementation against known failure conditions. Different design assurance levels for the various AHRS functions may apply 
'The manufacturer shall declare in the installation manual the hardware and software design assurance levels of the equipment. 

To support installation approval, the manufacturer should supply information regarding failure modes and failure probabilities for loss of function, malfunction, annunciated misleading data, and un-annunciated misleading data, The following two paragraphs define an acceptable means of compliance based on the hazard classification for complex electronic hardware and software. 

## 21.71 Complex Electronic Hardware Compliance

An acceptable means of compliance is to show that the hardware design assurance level is commensurate with the hazard classification. For complex custom airborne electronic hardware, RTCA/DO-254 (or other version acceptable to the certification authority), Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware, provides an acceptable means of compliance 

## 2.1.7.2 Software Compliance

An acceptable means of compliance is to show that the software design assurance level is commensurate with the hazard classification, For software, RTCA/DO-178B (or other version acceptable to the certification authority), Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, provides an acceptable means for showing that software complies with applicable airworthiness requirements. 

## 2.1.8 Multiple Operating Modes And Performance Categories

If the AHRS implements multiple operating modes (for example, operation with or without an aiding source) the manufacturer shall declare the performance category of all modes of operation except any degraded modes whose requirements are defined in Section 2.2.4. 

Inclusion of degraded modes is not required. 

A manufacturer may invalidate the data in lieu of providing a degraded mode capability. 

System transition from any mode to another shall be free from unacceptable transients, discontinuities, and adverse interactions with other aireraft systems. 

The manufacturer shall conduct testing and/or analysis of each mode to ensure compliance with the performance category standards or degraded mode standard in Section 2.2.4, The installation manual shall clearly identify all operating modes and associated equipment performance. 

The following paragraph describes an acceptable method for showing compliance with Section 2.3, Section 2.4.4 or 2.4.8 in place of repeating the test in each mode. 

Verify performance to a specific environmental test or flight evaluation in the mode where the equipment is in the most stringent category being certified. While performing the test or evaluation, record all of the equipment's outputs and sensor data, Rerun the test or evaluation in the same mode using the equipment's software and the recorded sensor data, To validate replayed software, verify the results from the replayed data matches the recorded resulting data within the expected processing precision. Next, run the equipment's software in the other modes being certified and verify the outputs comply with its category requirements for the mode being tested or evaluated. 

## 21.9 Range Of Operation

'The equipment shall be designed to operate and output pitch, roll and heading data through all attitudes and headings. 

Operational limits on the angular rates, linear accelerations or other parameters of the equipment shall be specified by the manufacturer. The AHRS 
shall be designed to continuously output data without invalidating the outputs up to at least + 70 deg/sec angular rates in each axis, at least + 2 g body axis longitudinal and lateral acceleration, and at least + 4 g body axis normal acceleration. 

Note: The foregoing functional requirement does not impose a performance requirement over the operating range of the equipment. Performance requirements are specified in Section 2.2. 

## 2.1.10 Magnetic Field Strength

Unless otherwise specified, the tests within this standard using MSU input should be made with a total magnetic field strength between 0.20 Gauss and 0.55 Gauss, and with a magnetic field inclination within either the range of +30° to +70° or the range of -30° to - 
70°. 

If testing is done at different magnetic field strengths or inclinations, the manufacturer shall test or perform analysis to show the equipment will meet the requirements for at least one magnetic field condition having characteristics as specified above. 

If the test equipment causes magnetic field disturbances that would interfere with obtaining accurate test results, then the magnetic field measurements may be simulated and provided to the equipment under test via a digital communication protocol identical to that used in an actual installed instrument, Such simulated magnetic measurements must properly account for potential errors in the MSU, changes in the measurements due to any motion prescribed by the test, and the worst-case magnetic measurement errors anticipated in an actual vehicle installation of the equipment. 

## 2111 Geographical Restrictions

'The manufacturer shall specify the geographical limits over which the equipment does not meet the performance requirements of this document. 

For example, outside of the manufacturer's specified range of latitudes, the heading accuracy of a magnetically slaved AHRS is unlikely to meet its specified performance.

aircraft, including loading fuel, cargo and passengers, should not significantly 
influence the ability of the equipment to align or the resulting system accuracy. 
2. 
Any constraints or limitations associated with equipment alignment should be 
documented 
by 
the equipment manufacturer. 
Examples 
of such limitations 
include required availability of aiding inputs or other conditions under which 
alignment is not possible or requires additional time. 

## 2.24.3 In-Flight Or In-Motion Alignment

In-flight or in-motion alignment should be supported. When supported, restrictions on the conditions where in-motion alignment is available and the subsequent performance that is provided shalll be specified. 

## 2.21.4 Annunciations

An appropriate annunciation per the definition in Section 1.9 shall be provided when the AHRS detects conditions where it does not meet the highest declared performance category In addition, each of the following conditions shall be adequately annunciated: 

1. 
Loss of attitude, heading, or turn and slip 
2. 
Operation in a DG mode if a non-DG mode is provided 
3. 
Operation in degraded mode 
Note: These annunciations may not be required to be displayed to the pilot depending on the intended function of the AHRS. However when data is provided to the pilot for control of the aircraft, the annunciation is required. 

## 2.2.1.5 Output Characteristics

1. 
Categorie 
2-RMS values as specified in Sections 2.3 and 2.4. 
This equipment flight evaluation pass/fail verification is determined by visual comparison with a truth reference, rather than through data collection with a truth reference and statistical analysis of results (6.0° is a max error 2 minutes afier resuming steady flight after the maneuver). 

3. 
For category H1, if a magnetic variation model is used to convert from true 
heading to magnetic heading, the error inherent in the model is not included in 
the table values. This also applies to units that utilize GPS as an aiding sensor to 
correct heading error. 
4. 
For category HI, the heading accuracy requirement is applicable at latitudes 
lower than + 60°. 
5. 
Categories H10 and HI are generally intended for relatively short term use 
when the magnetic slaving source could be disturbed (e.g.: during take-off or 
landing on oil drilling platforms). 

## 2.2.3.2 Static Accuracy

'The equipment shall meet the heading accuracy limits as defined in Table 2-2 and tested in accordance with Sections 2.3 and 2.4. 

## 2.2.3.3 Dynamic Accuracy

The equipment shall meet the heading dynamic and flight accuracy limits as defined in 
'Table 2-2 and tested in accordance with Sections 2.3 and 2.4. 

## 2.2.3.4 Dg Mode Considerations

A Directional Gyro (DG) mode shall include a means for the operator to activate the DG 
mode and manually adjust the heading. A valid heading output is determined through the use of inertial sensors (i.e., angular rate sensors and accelerometers) without aiding from a magnetic sensing unit. The AHRS may automatically activate the DG mode. 

When operating in DG mode, the AHRS should not compensate for transport rate. For example, when crossing over or near the Earth's poles with a straight-line ground track, heading should not reverse direction Note: 

1. 
Short-term cutoff logic which ignores magnetic information during brief periods 
(e.g., 
during turns) does not constitute 
a DG mode. Likewise, automatic modes 
h ignore magnetic information for indefinite periods of time, and during 
which heading is appropriately invalidated, also does not constitute 
a DG mode. 
2. 
Strapdown AHRS systems intended for use in a rotorcraft may be required to 
provide either (a) 
a DG mode as described above, or (b) provide an alternate 
'means to address departure from landing platforms with significant magnetic 
disturbance. If an alternate means is provided, it may be desirable to include a 
'means of setting a pilot-selectable initial heading, followed by a time-limited 
period of non-magnetic operation sufficient to complete take-off from the landing 
platform or another automatic means of re-selecting magnetically-slaved 
heading. 

## 2.2.4 Degraded Mode Performance Requirements

The intended function of a degraded mode (if provided) is to provide basic attitude performance, despite one or more AHRS failures. 

A degraded mode is intended to allow a pilot to maintain positive aircraft control while maneuvering under IMC, including IFR 
en route operations, climbs, descents, holds, fly an instrument approach to minimums, and return the aircraft back to level following an upset. Precision flying is secondary. A 
degraded mode may not be sufficient for all installations. 

Issues such as suitability and crew workload impacts are evaluated at time of installation, Specifically, degraded mode requirements do not consider autopilot input or ILS approach requirements. Degraded mode accuracies are stated as maximum, not-to-exceed errors. 

## 2.2.4.1 Incorporation Of Degraded Mode

## 2.2.5.1 Rate Of Turn Performance Requirements

With the equipment level and subjected to the turn rates specified about the vertical axi the turn rate output shall be within the values prescribed in Table 2-4. 

| 'Turn     | Rate    |
|-----------|---------|
| (deg/min) |         |
| 0         | +8      |
| 36        | +9      |
| 90        | +18     |
| 180       | +36     |
| 240       | £48     |

'The preferred method for computing turn rate is based on heading rate. If the turn rate is not based on heading rate, the manufacturer shall provide its definition of how turn rate is computed. 

## 2.2.5.2 Standard Turn Bank Angle Performance Requirement

Standard turn bank angle is a calculated bank angle dependent upon the current aircraft true airspeed. 

If a constant altitude coordinated turn is flown at the standard turn bank angle, then a standard heading rate of 180 or 90 degrees per minute (deg/min) will result at the current airspeed. When the aircraft is flown in a constant altitude coordinated turn at the standard turn bank angle, the resultant turn rate shall be 180 + 36, or 90 + 18 deg/min. The 180 deg/min specification is the default value; a 90 deg/min specification may be selected or may be configurable for application to higher classes of aircraft 

## 2.2.5.3 Slip Skid Performance Requirements

The range of the slip indicator shall be at least + 7°. Within that range, the output shall be accurate to within + 
2°, 

## 2.2.6 Aiding

The AHRS may use aiding sources, such as GNSS, air data, magnetic sensors, etc., in deriving AHRS outputs. Aiding inputs may take different forms, and have different levels of influence on the AHRS outputs, depending on the specific aiding scheme implemented by the manufacturer. Aiding sensors may be integral to the AHRS equipment design, or they may be separate components. 

If aiding is implemented the following requirements apply. 

## 2.2.6.1 Aiding Source Performance

For external aiding sources, the AHRS manufacturer shall define the minimum aiding source performance and integrity requirements. This can be accomplished by identifying the specific aiding equipment or by specifying the performance requirements for aiding sources. Particular attention must be paid to ensuring that the integrity of the aiding inputs is suitable for the intended use of the AHRS equipment. For this reason, when defining the minimum aiding source performance it is recommended to start with 
© Ine.

established standards, such as TSO-C145, TSO-C146, and TSO-C196 for GNSS sources, or TSO-C106 for air data sources. 

Note: 

1. 
AHRS utilizing GNSS aiding to augment the AHRS output should comply with the 
integrity monitoring requirements as specified for TSO-C145, TSO-C146, or TSO 
C196 compliant GNSS sources. Aiding sources meeting only the minimum requirements 
of TSO-CI29 may 
not 
provide 
sufficient 
availability 
or 
performance to perform properly in high interference environments. 
2. 
The GNSS TSOs effective as of this writing do not include performance 
requirements for velocity accuracy or integrity. RTCA SC-159 has determined 
that horizontal position accuracy (HFOM) and integrity (HPL) cannot be 
correlated to the velocity performance. RTCA SC-159 has published a velocity 
accuracy test in DO-310. This velocity accuracy 
test is also available in AC 20- 
138B. At this time, no vetted method for determining velocity integrity has been 
published. 
3. 
The foregoing requirements presume that the AHRS aiding sources are used as 
an integral portion of the AHRS attitude computation, and therefore require 
stringent monitoring, performance, and integrity checking. Aiding sources that 
are used to simply cross check the AHRS output or detect faults in AHRS input 
sources may not require the same fidelity as an aiding source which is used as an 
integral component of the AHRS attitude computations. 

## 2.2.6.2 Loss Of Aiding

Following the detected loss of aiding, if the AHRS cannot meet the requirements of its current operational mode, the AHRS shall revert to a different operational mode, a degraded mode, or invalidate its output. The AHRS shall annunciate the mode change, which may indicate a performance change or loss of function in accordance with Section 
2.2.1.4. The manufacturer shalll provide information on the impact of the loss of aiding. 

## 2.2.6.3 Annunciated Faults From Aiding Source

If the AHRS receives a fault indication from an aiding source, where the fault can result in AHRS performance not meeting the requirements of its current operational mode, then the AHRS shall transition to another operational mode, a degraded mode, or invalidate its output. 

## 2.2.6.4 Faulted And Non-Normal Performance

Depending on the intended use of the AHRS equipment, an aircraft level safety assessment may require that undetected or latent faults in the AHRS equipment, including undetected faults in the AHRS aiding inputs, be mitigated to an acceptable level. The manufacturer shall identify and document (via installation limitations) 
potential undetected aiding source faults and non-normal performance that are likely to occur (see Note below). The AHRS design shall ensure that "likely" aiding source faults and non-normal performance are mitigated as required for the intended use, This mitigation can be accomplished through fault detection and mitigation at the input, real time monitoring of the AHRS performance, controlling the design assurance of the aiding source, or other means. The extent of fault monitoring and mitigation needs to be commensurate with the intended application and criticality of the equipment. 

Note: The term "likely" is used to limit the possible number of undetected aiding source faults. The equipment should be analyzed in the context of 14 CFR part 23, 25, 27 or 
29.1309 
to identify how the aiding source is used and the resultant effects on performance. 

## 23 Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in this subsection are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under conditions representative of those which may be encountered in actual aeronautical operati Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in RTCA/ DO- 
160G, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment. General information on the use of RTCA/DO-160G is contained in Sections 
1 through 3 of that document. Also, a method of identifying which environmental tests were conducted and other amplifying information on the conduct of the tests is contained in Appendix A of RTCA/DO-160G. For additional guidance on RTCA/DO-160G, refer to AC 21-16G. 

Some of the performance requirements in Section 2.2 are not required to be tested to all of the conditions contained in RTCA/DO-160G. Table 2-5 shows the environmental tests which are required to meet this standard. 

When the physical test environment prevents normal determination of operational performance, manufacturer shall specify an acceptable alternative technique to determine performance to the maximum extent practical. For example, such a condition may exist when a magnetic sensing unit is placed near a source of significant magnetic fields, such as is commonly found with vibration tables, Requirements in this section are used to demonstrate that the performance requirements of Section 2.2 are met when subjected to environmental test conditions defined in RTCA/DO-160G. 

The AHRS performance requirements are defined for a system, equipment and associated functions. The manufacturer shall define the items of AHRS 
equipment and associated wiring that are required for the system that will undergo RTCA/DO-160G environmental tests The manufacturer need only test the functions that are supported by the system/ 
equipment. If a complete system is not tested, the untested subsystem errors shall be accounted for via analysis or other methods.

## 23.1 Performance Standard For Environmental Testing

'The test procedures specified in this section apply during environmental testing. 

Mount the AHRS in a fixed position and subject it to the test environment when DO-160 
requires validation of performance during exposure. Monitor the attitude, heading, turn, and slip (as applicable) and status indications. The attitude and heading shall not deviate from the initial reading by more than the amount specified in the Attitude Accuracy columns of Table 2-1 and the Heading Accuracy columns of Table 
2-2 
respectively. 

Depending on which DO-160 test is being performed use either the Static Conditions column or Dynamic and Flight Conditions column as directed in the Performance Requirement column of Table 2-5 
When DO-160 
requires validation of performance following exposure to the environment, the following tests shall be accomplished. 

1. 
24.2.1 Attitude Static Accuracy 
2.4.2.2 Attitude Scale Factor Static Accuracy 
2.4.3.1 Heading Static Accuracy 
2.4.3.3 Static Accuracy, DG Mode, Category H6 through H11 
2.4.5.1 Turn Rate Test Procedures 
2.4.5.2 Standard Turn Bank Angle Test Procedures 
4.5.3 Slip Skid Test Procedures 
Note: An Acceptance Test Procedure that validates hardware functionality following exposure may be adequate, as long as it tests any item that could be affected by the environmental test. 

The static and dynamic tolerances are defined in Table 2-1, and Table 2-2 for each category of equipment. The turn and slip shall not deviate by more than 150% of the limits specified in Section 2.2.5 for all environments, The status shall remain valid during all tests that require validation of performance during the exposure to the environment. 

Where 
"Static 
/ Dynamic" (DO-160G Section 20) is specified in Table 
2-5, if the attitude or heading deviates by more than the static requirement, the frequency at which the susceptibility occurred shall be dwelled for a minimum of 5 seconds and the attitude and heading output shall not deviate by more than the dynamic limit. 

For AHRS 
intended for helicopter applications it is recommended that the dwell be extended to 15 seconds and documented in the environmental qualification document. 

It is understood that the mounting of the AHRS in a fixed position does not test all of the functionality that affects the accuracy of the AHRS system. For example, rate sensor scale factor performance could vary over temperature to an extent that the unit would no longer meet the performance requirements. AHRS performance characteristics that are not tested by being mounted in a fixed position shall be validated by the manufacturer through other means such as analysis, design, calibration, or informal testing, For units with a DG mode, the unit shall meet the DG requirements over the environments, The manufacturer may verify the unit meets these requirements by analysis, test or a combination of both.

## 2.4.2.3 Multi-Axis Dynamic Accuracy Flight Evaluation 2.4.2.3.1 Categories A1, A2, A3 And Ad

The dynamic accuracy of the attitude outputs is tested using a flight evaluation that conforms to the requirements specified in Section 2.4.8. The flight evaluation is conducted using a truth reference device. Record the output of the AHRS and the output of the truth reference simultaneously during the flight to allow for analysis of the difference between the two outputs. Compare the output of the equipment with the output of the truth reference and calculate the RMS error as described in Section 2.4.8. This calculated RMS output error multiplied by two shall not exceed the flight condition accuracy specification defined in Table 2-1 for the performance category. 

Note: The accuracy requirements for flight are defined as 2*RMS limits. For example, if the flight evaluation analysis gives an RMS error of 1.1°, then the 2*RMS error for the flight is 2.2°. 

This value of 2.2° must be less than or equal to the flight evaluation accuracy specification defined in Table 2-1. 

## Category As

The dynamic accuracy of the attitude outputs is tested using a flight evaluation that conforms to the requirements specified in Section 2.4.8.

2*RMS values measured against a truth reference. 

Perform the test using a flight evaluation with a truth reference device. Section 2.4.8 contains a description of the flight evaluation profile. 

Note: The AHRS under test may output magnetic and/or true heading. If available, both should be tested. The truth reference data should be converted to either magnetic or true, whichever is being evaluated. 

## 2.4.3.2.2 Category Hs

Test the dynamic accuracy of the heading output using a flight evaluation that conforms to the requirements specified in Section 2.4.8. Conduct the flight evaluation using a truth reference device.

## 2.48 Flight Evaluation For Declared Performance Categories

Perform a flight evaluation to ensure compliance with the dynamic performance requirements which are shown in the Dynamic and Flight Conditions columns of Table 
2+1 and Table 
2-2. 

Although testing in a single aircraft type cannot guarantee performance in all aircraft types, the flight evaluation is intended to exercise the equipment under dynamic conditions that cannot be mechanically simulated with static ground testing, The flight evaluation shall include shallow, standard and steep turns in both the left and right directions, extended periods of acceleration and deceleration, significant changes in altitude, straight and level flight, and uncoordinated maneuvers with lateral acceleration in both right and left directions (such as side slips). Table 2-9 
shows a recommended flight profile which exercises the AHRS with all the dyna conditions described above. 

During the actual flight evaluation, the profile may be modified as needed to accommodate air traffic, logistics and local conditions provided equivalent maneuvers are performed. 

It is intended that this evaluation be accomplished in a single flight. For DG mode, categories H6 through H9 (if included), the flight evaluation shall be a minimum of one hour. 

Throughout the flight evaluation collect data 
(¢.g., computer acquisition, video, or manual) from the AHRS and the reference system. For Categories AI through Ad and HI 
through H4, the flight evaluation results shall be determined by measuring twice the RMS difference of the AHRS and the truth reference system. The data used to calculate the RMS should include all maneuvers and a portion of each straight and level flight immediately following the maneuver. The total time of straight and level flight following the maneuvers, included in the RMS calculation, shall not exceed the total time of the maneuvers. Maneuver number 2, in particular, should be counted as maneuver time and not part of the straight and level time. 

The manufacturer shall provide the actual flight test profile used to meet the requirements of this section. This profile will include the speed range through which the flight test was conducted. 

For categories Al through A4, at any time during the flight evaluation, the one second averages of the differences between the truth system and the AHRS pitch and roll shall not exceed two times the value specified in the Dynamic and Flight Conditions column of Table 2-1 
For categories HI through H4, at any time during the flight evaluation, the one second averages of the differences between the truth system and the AHRS heading shall not exceed two times the value specified in the Dynamic and Flight Conditions column of Table 2-2, Note: 

1. 
Before the data between the truth system and AHRS are compared, minor 
adjustments may be made to the data to account for the mounting alignment, 
timing and filtering differences between the truth system and the AHRS being 
tested. 
2. 
Note: 
The following flight evaluation maneuvers may not be adequate to ensure 
proper operation 
in an aircraft other than the one 
in which testing was 
performed. For example, helicopters may operate at low speeds and in an 
uncoordinated manner (See Table 3-1).

## Appendix A: Validation Of Equipment Performance Using Simulation Al Simulation Fidelity

In lieu of flight evaluation, the AHRS dynamic heading and attitude performance may be verified through the use of a high fidelity simulation. A very high level of confidence in the simulation results should be attained to bypass the flight evaluation activity. The importance of achieving accurate results with the simulation cannot be overstated. The simulation should account for all significant sources of error including: 

1. 
Sensor misalignment (gyro, accelerometer) 
Sensor scale 
factor (gyro, accelerometer, MSU, barometric altitude) 
Sensor bias (gyro, accelerometer, MSU, barometric altitude, TAS) 
Sensor noise (gyro, accelerometer, MSU) 
Sensor range limit (gyro, accelerometer) 
Speed-dependent noise (barometric altitude, TAS) 
Other known sensitivity factors to sensor error if any (e.g. g-sensitivity of gyro) 
AHRU installation alignment 
eer away 
Algorithm estimations 
10. Environmental variables including 
a. 
Temperature ramps 
b. 
Vibration (including acoustically induced vibration) 
Weather induced actions such as horizontal and vertical wind gusts 
d. 
Air Data 
e. 
GPS Errors 

## A2 Simulation Validation

The simulation should be validated to ensure it accurately predicts real-world measurement error characteristics produced by the in-service equipment under a flight profile with the characteristics similar to the one described in Section 2.4. This validation process should demonstrate the following: 

1, 
Validate that 
the 
simulated input 
signals are represented appropriately. A 
successful validation should demonstrate that: 
a, 
The simulated trajectory of the vehicle 
is 
as expected. 
This should 
include all relevant trajectory parameters not only including body rates 
and body 
accelerations (or increments), but also attitudes, velocities, 
accelerations, position, and altitude. The simulated trajectory can be 
verified by comparing the desired trajectory to the attitudes, position, 
altitude, and velocities that are physically expected, and, as a crosscheck, 
those that are generated from the simulated sensor data (body rates and 
body accelerations or increments). A canonical way of checking the
