## Foreword

This document was prepared by RTCA Special Committee 163 
(SC-163). 

It was approved by the RTCA Technical Management Committee on April 23, 1992. 

RTCA is an association of aeronautical organizations of the United States from both government and industry. Dedicated to the advancement of aeronautics, RTCA 
seeks sound technical solutions to problems involving the application of electronics and telecommunications to aeronautical operations. 

Its objective is the resolution of such problems by mutual agreement of its member organizations. The findings of RTCA are in the nature of recommendations to all organizations concerned. 

Since RTCA 
is not an official agency of the U. 

S. 

government, its recommendations may not be regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the U. 

S. 

government organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations relate. 

Coordination of these standards was accomplished by RTCA 
SC-163 with the European Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment 
(EUROCAE) WG-38.

## Simultaneous Voice Transmissions Purpose And Scope 1.0 Introduction 1.1

This document sets forth minimum operational performance standards for systems that minimize blocked transmissions used in Air traffic Control (ATC) two-way radio voice communications due to simultaneous transmissions. 

Incorporated within these standards are system characteristics that should be beneficial to users of the systems as well as to designers, manufacturers and installers. 

Compliance with these standards is recommended as a means of assuring that the equipment will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in routine operations. 

Any regulatory application of this document is the sole responsibility of appropriate government agencies. 

Because the measured values of equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the measurement method, standard test conditions and methods of test are recommended in this document. 

This document considers an equipment configuration consisting of: 
transmitter, receiver, power supply, microphone, control panels, antenna, interconnecting cables, and related accessories. 

It should not be inferred that all equipment will necessarily include all of the foregoing components as separate units. 

This will depend on the specific design configuration chosen by the manufacturer. 

Additional functions and components that may refer to expanded equipment capabilities that exceed the stated minimum requirements are identified as optional features. Equipment features that are beyond the scope of this document may be developed in future RTCA activities. 

If the equipment implementation includes a computer software package, the guidelines contained in RTCA/DO-178A, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, shall be considered. 

## System Overview 1.2

The aviation communications system includes ground-based and airborne receiving and transmitting equipment which provides air-to-ground, ground-to-air, air-to-air and ground-to-ground voice and data communications. The equipment addressed in this document provides the means for reducing simultaneous transmissions that adversely affect two-way voice radio communications. 

Disruption to voice communications in the ATC system presents the potential for degrading flight safety. Although these communication disruptions may occur in areas where traffic density is low, the growth of air traffic (and communications) 
has increased the number of disruption incidents. 

The FAA has concluded, as early as 1968, that the occurrence of communication disruptions presented serious problems, e.g., the loss of separation standards between aircraft, near mid-air collisions, delays, and potentially disastrous disruptions of traffic flow. 

Various educational programs and advisory material issued by the FAA have not reduced the problem. 

In fact, subsequent surveys have indicated that the problem has intensified. 

In 1984, the FAA was petitioned to enact rulemaking requiring two-way radio communication systems employing anti-blocking and stuck microphone protection circuitry. The FAA subsequently published the petition for rulemaking for public comment. 

The majority of responses to the petition for rulemaking were favorable. 

Because an industry standard for such devices was not available, the FAA deferred further action on the petition for rulemaking and requested that RTCA, Incorporated, establish a Special Committee to develop appropriate guidance and equipment standards. As a result of the FAA's request, RTCA established Special Committee 163 to develop design criteria and guidance information pertaining to unintentional or simultaneous transmissions that adversely affect two-way radio communications and to develop minimum operational performance standards 
(MOPS) 
for devices that minimize unintentional and/or simultaneous voice transmissions. 

This MOPS only addresses simultaneous transmissions. 

This is defined as the occurrence of two or more operators transmitting on the same frequency at the same time. 

## 1,3 Operational Application

This specification is applicable to ground-based, ground-mobile and airborne twoway UHF and VHF radio voice communications equipment used for control of air traffic. 

These standards apply to three different methods of incorporation: 
retrofit, modification and new designs. 

## 1.4 Operational Goals

These devices are intended to minimize communication disruptions caused by simultaneous voice transmissions that are detrimental to the safety and efficiency of flight operations. 

Equipment designers, manufacturers and installers are encouraged to provide indications or annunciations to the pilot of transmitter operation, or of impending or existing actions by the equipment to inhibit transmitter operation. 

Refer to Appendix A for an analysis of the effectiveness of the devices intended to minimize communication disruptions caused by simultaneous voice transmission. 

## Assumptions Simultaneous Transmissions

Simultaneous voice transmissions are generally considered detrimental to communication. 

Thus the initiation of a voice transmission on an occupied frequency is undesirable and should be inhibited. 

However, there are environments or conditions when simultaneous transmissions are normal operational occurrences, for example: 

a. 
UNICOM 
b. 
MULTICOM 
C. 
Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) 
d. 
Flight Service Station Frequencies 
e. 
Flight Watch Frequency 
These environments exist because a single frequency is assigned to several facilities in the same geographical area. 

## Normal Atc Communications 1.5.1.1

When human monitoring is used to determine channel availability, simultaneous voice transmissions are inevitable, even when proper radio communication procedures are followed by all users. 

This situation creates a potential to adversely affect flight safety. 

Furthermore, this potential is increased by frequency congestion caused by a large demand for a specific frequency, especially in areas of high traffic density. 

## Emergency Communications 1.5.1.2

An emergency condition may require unrestrained radio operation, therefore, provisions must be made to override transceiver-inhibiting circuits. 

## Offset Carrier Communications 1.5.1.3

The devices described in this document may be less effective in preventing conflict between an aircraft and an offset carrier ground station than in preventing conflict between an aircraft and a single carrier ground station. The effectiveness of the device is dependent on the design of the activity detector. 

## Activity Detector 1.5.2

In the context of this specification, receiver activity is defined as response to a signal strength normally associated with reception of voice transmissions from ATC or other aircraft. 

Any circuitry that inhibits transmissions should not be activated by reception of insufficient signal power to 
"lift squelch" 
of the associated receiver. 

Activity detectors which measure AGC voltage are likely to inhibit transmission 
~ 
more often than necessary if set for weak signals. 

Those which measure noise level may fail to inhibit the transmitter when multiple carriers are present in the passband. 

Operationally, and with any means of simultaneous voice transmission prevention, it is acceptable to ignore weaker received signals and to respond only to those levels of signal normally found in radio communication exchanges. In reality, any device that does this will prevent those simultaneous voice transmissions that may be disruptive and, therefore, hazardous to communication. 

The time required for the detection of activity on the frequency is an important factor in determining the probability of conflict transmission prevention. The time required to detect inactivity on the frequency is important in preventing unwanted or spurious inhibition of the transmitter. 

## 1.5.3 Transmitter Delay Time

The longer the delay time between keying the transmitter and RF output the greater the likelihood of conflicting with other transmissions. 

Transmitters with shorter delay times produce fewer conflicts for their operators, because they are more likely to be in the process of transmitting when other radios test for activity. 

## 1.6 Test Procedures

The test procedures specified in this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the performance requirements. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred. 

These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information. 

In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one Criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. 

The order of test specified suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design and design qualification into operational use. 

For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2.0 
shall have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section 3.0. 

Three types of test procedures are specified. 

These include: 

## A. Environmental Tests

Environmental test requirements are specified in Subsection 2.3. 

The procedures and their associated limit requirements are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations. 

Unless otherwise specified, the environmental conditions and test procedures contained in RTCA/DO-160C, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, will be used to demonstrate equipment compliance. 

## B. Bench Tests

Bench test procedures are specified in Subsection 2.4. These tests provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Subsection 2.2. 

Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design. 

## Cc. Installed-Equipment Tests

The installed-equipment test procedures and their associated limits are specified in Section 
3.0. 

Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included in the installed-equipment tests, their successful completion is a precondition to completion of the installedequipment tests. 

In certain instances, however, installed-equipment tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from or to other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc. 

Installed-equipment tests are normally performed under two conditions: 

(1) 
with the aircraft on the ground and using simulated or operational 
system inputs, and 
(2) 
with 
the 
aircraft 
in 
flight 
using 
operational 
system 
inputs 
appropriate to the equipment under test. 
Test results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the intended operational environment. 

## Definitions Of Terms 1.7

Activity Detector Decay Time - The time required for an activity detector to detect the termination of a signal. 

Activity Detector Response Time - The time required for activity detector to 
indicate the onset of a signal. 
Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) - A frequency assigned for the purpose of carrying out airport advisory practices while operating to or from an uncontrolled airport. 

## Lru - Line Replaceable Unit

MULTICOM - A mobile service, not open to public correspondence, used to provide communications essential to conduct the activity being performed by or directed from private aircraft. 

Offset Carrier System —- Ground radio stations that transmit two or more signals, each with a different carrier frequency, on the same channel. This system is used in Alaska and in the United Kingdom (Climax), among other locations, for en route air traffic control. By this technique, it is possible to provide coverage over large geographical areas by only one frequency assignment that may otherwise require several. 

## Ptt - Push-To-Talk

PTT Response Time - The time for operator activation of PTT 
after a transmission has ended. 

Queue Jumping - To deliberately make and maintain a PTT action during a period of reception that results in the associated transmitter operating at receiver activity conclusion. 

Simultaneous Transmission(s) - Disruption(s) to voice communication caused by transmitters on a common frequency operating at the same time. 

This is commonly referred to as a stepped-on or blocked transmission. 

Transmitter Rise Time —- The time after operator activation of PTT for the transmitter to reach sufficient power for recognition by activity detectors in other receivers. 

UNICOM - A non-government communication facility which may provide airport information at certain airports. 

Unintentional Transmission(s) - Transmitter operation when such operation is not intended. 

This is commonly referred to as a "stuck mike" condition. 

## Equipment Performance Requirements And Test Procedures 2.0 General Requirements 2.1

The following general requirements shall be met by all simultaneous voice transmission prevention equipment. 

Equipment designed to prevent conflicting simultaneous transmissions shall include the capability of automatically inhibiting transmitter operation. 

## Airworthiness 2.1.1

In the design and manufacture of the equipment, the manufacturer shall provide for installation so as not to impair the airworthiness of the aircraft. 

## Intended Function 2.1.2

The equipment shall perform its intended function(s), as defined by the manufacturer, and its proper use shall not create a hazard to other users of the National Airspace System. 

## Federal Communications Commission Rules 2.1.3

All equipment shall comply with the applicable rules of the Federal Communications Commission.' 

## Fire Protection 2.1.4

All materials used shall be self-extinguishing except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire. 

NOTE: 
One means of showing compliance is contained in Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Part 25, Appendix F. 

## Operation Of Controls 2.1.5

The equipment shall be designed so that controls intended for use during flight cannot be operated in any position, combination or sequence that would result in a condition detrimental to the reliability of the equipment or operation of the aircraft. 

## 2.1.6 Accessibility Of Controls

Controls that do not require adjustment during flight shall not be readily accessible to flight personnel. 

## 2.1.7 Effects Of Test

The equipment shall be designed so that the application of specified test procedures shall not be detrimental to equipment performance following the application of these tests, except as specifically allowed. 

## Equipment Performance - Standard Conditions 2.2 Automatic Inhibition Of Voice Transmissions 2.2.1

When a selected frequency is occupied by a received signal, the equipment shall inhibit operation of the transmitter, except as provided by paragraph 2.2.3. 

The transmitter-inhibit-threshold shall be between 0 and 10 dB above the received signal level required to open the associated receiver squelch. 

When a test signal at the level of -75 dBm (measured at the input of the associated receiver) is applied, the equipment shall have the following response and decay characteristics. 

a. 
Response time: 
< 60 ms (the goal 
is 
to make this time 
as short as 
possible, 
and 
20 ms 
is 
the 
recommended 
maximum. 
Refer 
to 
Appendix A). 
Decay time: 
< 60 ms (for devices using random time delay only). 

NOTE: 
The specified threshold of actuation of this function is intended to 
provide simultaneous voice transmission protection over nearly the 
entire communication range in the location of the station. 
It is 
noted 
that 
due 
to 
the 
resulting 
low 
threshold 
level, 
noncommunication-related signals in the environment may occasionally 
activate this function and require override of this function in order 
to maintain normal communications. 
The occasional need for 
override 
is acceptable 
in order to maintain simultaneous voice 
transmission protection over the entire communication range. 

## Prevention Of Queue Jumping 2.2.2

The equipment shall include a means for prevention of queue jumping. 

The means shall include either a or b below. 

A PTT action made prior to the decay of a received signal shall maintain the associated transceiver in the receive mode until PTT action is reinitiated with no receiver activity present (see Figure 2-1). 

That is, operators initiating PTT action prior to cessation of receiver activity will continue to be inhibited from transmitting. 

A PTT action made within 0.5 second prior to the decay of a received signal shall maintain the associated transceiver in the receive mode until the received signal is no longer detected and a random time elapses during which period no other received signal is detected. The random time delay shall be initiated when a received signal is no longer detected. The delay shall vary randomly from 
0 
to 200 milliseconds in approximately a rectangular distribution. Two operators initiating PTT action prior to RF 
decay will result in the probability of one operator transmitting at RF 
termination and the other being inhibited (see Figure 2-2). 

A PTT action made more than 0.5 second prior to the decay of receiver activity will cause the system to function in the same way as the basic queue jumping prevention technique described in paragraph 2.3.3 a. Refer to Figure 2-3. 

## 2.2.3 Operator Override

A means of operator override of the transmitter inhibit function shall be provided. 

Such means of override shall be either: 
incapable of being left in the override position or be equipped to restore the inhibit function within 35 seconds of override activation. 

## 2.2.4 Control Of Associated Audio Systems

In the event that an attempted transmission is automatically inhibited, a means shall be provided to ensure continuous reception at flight crew audio stations.

## Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions 2.3

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in this subsection provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics for the equipment under conditions representative of those which may be encountered in actual aeronautical operations. 

Some of the environmental tests contained in this subsection do not have to be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition. These tests are identified by the phrase "When Required." 
If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment under any of these additional environmental conditions, then the appropriate "When Required" 
tests shall be performed. 

Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in RTCA/DO-160C, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment. 

Some of the performance requirements in Subsection 2.2 are not required to be tested to all of the conditions contained in RTCA/DO-160C.

## Simultaneous Voice Transmissions Introduction 1.0

Many aspects of the problem of simultaneous voice transmissions were considered. 

in developing the minimum operational performance standards. 

It was recognized that there are basically two different types of simultaneous voice transmissions: 

Type A: 
This type occurs when an operator activates a transmitter on a 
frequency that already has activity. 
One example 
is when an 
operator misinterprets 
a momentary voice pause by a controller as 
the end of a transmission. 
The devices specified in this document are expected to provide nearly complete protection from Type A simultaneous voice transmissions. 

Type B: 
This 
type occurs when two 
or more operators activate 
their 
transmitters at essentially the same time, on what they perceive to 
be a clear frequency; for example, in a busy terminal area when a 
transmission has ended, and two operators begin transmitting at 
almost the same time.

## 2.0 Analysis Of Effectiveness Of Devices To Prevent Type B Simultaneous Voice Transmissions

This analysis assumes that all users of a given frequency are equipped with a device as described in this document. 

## 2.1 Types Of Delays

There are four time delays that determine the operational effectiveness of devices to prevent Type B 
simultaneous voice transmissions: 
PTT response time, transmitter rise time, activity detector response time and activity detector decay time. The time for RF propagation is negligible compared to the other delays and is ignored. 

## 2.2 Time Delay Effects

Time delays affect the operation of a device to prevent Type B simultaneous voice transmissions (where no signal is present at the beginning of the sequence) in the following manner: 
Until transmitter #1 has caused operation of the activity detector of transceiver #2, a PTT action by operator #2 will result in a conflict. 

## 2.3 Determination Of Time Delays 2.3.1 Ptt Response Time

A test was conducted to determine nominal values for PTT response time. 

A subject, wearing headphones, adjusted the level of a continuous 1000 Hz tone to a comfortable level. The subject was instructed to press the PTT switch on a standard aircraft-type hand microphone as soon as the 1000 Hz tone was removed. 

The tone was on for random periods of 10 to 20 seconds. 

The time from tone removal until activation of the PTT by the subject was measured by means of a digital storage oscilloscope triggered by the tone removal. Five different subjects were tested, with each subject performing the test 10 times. 

The fastest response time was 200 milliseconds with the slowest 420 milliseconds. 

Each subject had responses in that range with no subject consistently fast or slow. 

Based on these tests, it was concluded that the time difference between activation of two PTT circuits by two operators, concentrating on activating the PTT 
following cessation of an on-going transmission, would range from near zero to 
220 milliseconds. 

NOTE: 
In other tests using pilots in a simulated flight environment and with random transmission background traffic, approximately 
50 percent of the measured PTT response times fall between 
340 ms and 740 ms, i.e., a PIT response time spread of about 
400 ms. 

In this 400-ms time span, the data more closely approximates a uniform distribution. 

## 2.3.2 Transmitter Rise Time

SC-163 surveyed RTCA members who manufacture avionics equipment for data on transmitter rise time. 

This data was requested for transmitters considered representative of those currently in use by the aviation community. 

Responses were received from 
10 manufacturers covering 
13 
different models. 

The transmitter rise times ranged from 2 to 70 milliseconds. 

It was noted that there are no transmitter rise time limits specified in RTCA or EUROCAE VHF transceiver MOPS. 

## 2.3.3 Activity Detector Response Time

The operation of an activity detector was viewed as very similar to voice squelch circuits in use in most aircraft receivers. 

In order to determine a minimum and maximum response time that would be practical and yet still provide immunity from false operation, the committee surveyed RTCA members who manufacture avionics equipment. This survey was for data on squelch attack and decay times, at 10 microvolt and 1000 microvolt levels for receivers considered representative of those currently in use by the aviation community. 

The attack times ranged from 2 to 75 milliseconds. Shorter activity detector response times will improve the effectiveness; however, too short a response time may produce unreliable operation. 

## Activity Detector Decay Time 2.3.4

The survey described in paragraph 2.3.3 above indicated values from 4 to 108 
milliseconds for squelch decay times. 

Activity detector decay time has the following effects on simultaneous voice transmission prevention: 
Type A conflicts - Activity detector decay time is not a factor in Type A conflicts. 

Type B conflicts - Activity detector decay time is not a factor in effectiveness as long as the decay time is less than the PTT response time. 

If the decay time is longer than the PTT response time, it becomes a modified Type B conflict (with a random clock). 

Type B conflicts (with a random clock) - The decay time determines when the random clock timer begins and influences conflict prevention effectiveness. 

Excessive decay times can result in first-syllable clipping due to delays in transmitter activation after a PTT action.

## 2.4 Analysis Of Effectiveness For Type A And B Simultaneous Voice Transmissions Using Surveyed Transceiver Data 2.4.1 Type A

The devices specified in this document are expected to provide nearly complete protection from Type A simultaneous voice transmissions. 

## 2.4.2 Type B

The committee performed a computer simulation of Type B simultaneous voice transmissions. The simulation was based on the situation described in Subsection 
2.2. 

The following uniformly distributed time values were used and it was assumed that two operators decided to transmit at the same instant. 

1. 
PTT response time - 0 to 220 milliseconds. 
2. 
Transmitter rise time - 2 to 70 milliseconds. 
3. 
Activity detector response time - 2 to 60 milliseconds. 
4. 
Activity detector decay time - not applicable. 
Based on 1000 trials, 485 conflicts were prevented, for an effectiveness of 
49 percent. 

## 2.4.3 Type B (With A Random Clock)

The committee performed a computer simulation of Type B (with a random clock) 
simultaneous voice transmissions. 

The simulation was based on the situation described in Subsection 2.2 for a random clock delay system. 

The following randomly distributed time values were used: 

1. 
PTT response time - Key activated before transmission ended. 
2. 
Random clock delay - 0 to 200 milliseconds. 
3. 
Transmitter rise time - 2 to 70 milliseconds. 
4, 
Activity detector response time - 2 to 60 milliseconds. 
5. 
Activity detector decay time - 4 to 60 milliseconds. 
Based on 1000 trials, 534 conflicts were prevented, for an effectiveness of 
53 percent.

15 milliseconds, based on 1000 trials, 860 conflicts were prevented, for an effectiveness of 86 percent. 

3.3.2 
Type B Simultaneous Voice Transmission (with a random clock)

## 3.4 Analysis Summaries

The results of the analyses taken are listed in Tables A-1 
and A-2. 

The distribution reflected is approximately uniform, and the applicable paragraphs are noted below each simulation number. As a result of additional tests to determine PTT response times that more closely simulate actual cockpit conditions during the flight, take-off, en route and landing phases (see Appendix A, paragraph 
2.3.1), Table A-1 was reanalyzed, and the results are depicted in Table A-3. 

## Effectiveness Summary

The analysis of the effectiveness of devices to prevent simultaneous voice transmissions in this MOPS deals only with Type B conflicts and, therefore, does not provide overall effectiveness rates that can be expected if the devices are implemented in air traffic control communications. 

Even though good radio discipline is maintained and operators wait for frequencies to clear, conflicts can occur. 

Timing has a major influence on effectiveness such that any two transmitters that are activated at exactly the same time with the same response times cannot be kept from interfering with each other. 

However, because there are variations in the inherent time delays of various radios and operator PTT reaction times, a measure of protection can be obtained from Type B simultaneous voice transmissions. 

A uniform distribution was Chosen because it was not expected that a different distribution would give widely varying results. 

However, for example, in Appendix A paragraph 2.4.2, use of a Gaussian distribution yielded 18 percent as opposed to an effectiveness of 48 percent when uniformly distributed time values were used. Similarly, a PTT 
response time difference of 220 ms was assumed, but a broader spread of PTT 
response time when applied to the analysis (see NOTE to Appendix A, paragraph 
2.3.1) resulted in a higher predicted effectiveness (see Table A-3). 

Limited information on response times, equipment delay times and an accurate knowledge of the number and types of communication conflicts which have occurred and the number of different types of equipment in the field have made it impossible to accurately determine overall effectiveness. 

However, the devices in this document provide nearly complete protection from Type A simultaneous voice transmissions. Therefore, the total effectiveness of the devices will increase in direct proportion to the number of Type A conflicts. The greater the number of Type A conflicts, the greater the overall effectiveness of the devices. 

Use of new generation transmitters, with improved rise time, is anticipated to increase combined effectiveness. 

Further improvement may be achieved by reducing the activity detector response time. 

The efficiency of the ATC voice communication system will improve because the number of conflicting messages will be minimized, thus reducing the need for retransmissions.
