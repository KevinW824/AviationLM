## Minimum Design And Performance Of Airplane Galley Insert Equipment, Electrical/Pressurized Rationale

Galley Insert Equipment (GAIN) is electrical equipment, used in conjunction with aircraft food service. GAIN (e.g., beverage maker, oven) is not an integral part of the galley and is removable from the galley without tools or with the use of simple tools. The design and operation of GAIN has a significant impact on cabin service, cabin safety and workload of the crew members. Most types of GAIN have significant electrical power consumption, are connected to the aircraft potable water system, and are controlled by electronic devices. This AS specifies criteria to assure safe GAIN design and function. 

## Foreword

This SAE Aerospace Standard (AS) and the SAE AS8056 "Minimum Design and Performance of Airplane Galley In-Flight Carts, Containers, and Associated Components" establish minimum design and performance requirements for galley insert equipment. The content of both standards is harmonized. SAE is an international not-for-profit organization, formed to advance the art and science of aviation and aviation electronic systems for the benefit of the public. Since SAE is not an official agency of the U.S. government, its recommendations may not be regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the U.S. government organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations relate.

If the number of terminals is too large to allow them to be tested at once connected together, the test may be performed with several individual tests. The leakage current between any mutually insulated parts of equipment shall not exceed 2.0 mA and there shall be no arcing, sparking, smoke or fire. For equipment without voltage spike protection devices, the test voltage shall be 1500V rms, 50 to 60 Hz, for AC circuits and 1500 V DC for DC circuits. If the equipment includes a device(s) that protects against voltage spikes, the test voltage may be reduced downstream of the device to only 2.5 times the maximum foreseeable voltage spike allowed by the protective device. The leakage current should be measured while the test voltage is applied at a uniform rate not exceeding 500 volts per second until the maximum voltage is reached and held for one minute, before removing the test voltage at a uniform rate not exceeding 500 volts per second 
b. Resistance between any mutually insulated parts of equipment shall not be less than 200 MÎ© when a DC test voltage

A maximum gross weight placard shall be placed on equipment. An empty weight should also be marked. Refrigerators, freezers, and wine chillers installed in the airplane shall include a maximum capacity placard that is visible to the user. 

## 3.11.3 Placards For Fire Safety

a. Per 14 CFR 25.791, "No Cigarette Disposal" shall be placed on or near each waste receptacle disposal door (e.g., the 
waste disposal flap of a trash compactor). 
b. "No Cigarette Disposal" and "Close When Not In Use" markings shall be visible on manually-operated waste flaps 
when the flap is open. 
c. A graphic symbol for "No Cigarette Disposal", per AC 25-17, appendix 2, figure 5, may be used in lieu of text. 

## 3.11.4 Placards For Loose Equipment/Loose Components/Associated Components

a. Loose equipment (e.g., toasters and skillets) should be placarded with "This item must be stowed in its compartment 
for taxi, take off, turbulence, and landing", or equivalent. 
b. Equipment that uses retention devices to hold loose and/or associated components (e.g., beverage server, brew cup) 
in place during flight and crash conditions shall be placarded with special stowage instructions (e.g.: "Brew handle must be down for taxi, take off, turbulence and landing"). 
c. Equipment without provisions to hold loose and/or associated components in place during flight and crash conditions 
shall be placarded with instructions to stow these components in the galley monument (e.g., "Beverage server must 
be stowed in the galley for taxi, take off, turbulence, and landing").  

## 3.12 Acoustics - Noise Generated By The Equipment

The maximum A-weighted sound pressure level emitted from equipment during the operating cycle shall not exceed 
70 db(A). 

## 3.13 Ovens

a. Heating elements in ovens shall be installed such that spills of food or liquid will not directly contact them. b. No single failure of a steam oven's water dispensing system shall allow an uncontrolled release of water into the 
oven's cavity. An uncontrolled release of water could potentially flood the galley work area. 

## 3.14 Interchangeability / Installation/Removal/Replacement

a. Equipment having the same part number shall be directly and completely interchangeable with respect to fit, form, 
and function, without any need for adjustment.  
b. Any modification to equipment affecting its interchangeability shall require a new part number. c. Means shall be provided to preclude incorrect installation of equipment and improper engagement of restraint 
devices. 
d. Equipment shall have means for carrying (e.g., handle, grab points, etc.), with the exception of equipment with wheels 
(e.g., trash compactors). 

## 3.15 Software

a. Software for equipment with a microprocessor(s) shall be designed, developed, and documented according RTCA-
DOâ178B, Cat. D, or higher, using RTCA-DO-248 for clarification, where applicable.  
b. Software shall not be used alone to prevent the occurrence of an unsafe condition that would have an effect on 
airplane operational capability or crew workload. 

## 3.16 Electronic Hardware

SAE-AS8057-164-1 
Electronic hardware of equipment with microprocessor(s) shall be designed, developed, and documented according RTCA-DO- 254 Cat. D, or higher. 

## 3.17 Environmental Design Requirements

Equipment shall comply with the environmental conditions and applicable categories in RTCA-DO160F, as listed in Table 2:
