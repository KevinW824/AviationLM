## Technical Standard Order Subject: *Aircraft Circuit Breakers*

 1. 

PURPOSE.  This technical standard order (TSO) is for manufacturers applying for a TSO 
authorization (TSOA) or letter of TSO design approval (LODA).  In it, we (the Federal Aviation Administration, (FAA)) tell you what minimum performance standards (MPS) your aircraft circuit breaker must meet for approval and identification with the applicable TSO marking. 

2. 

APPLICABILITY.  This TSO affects new applications submitted after its effective date. 

   
a. TSO-C178 will also remain effective until 18 months after publication date.  After this date, we will no longer accept applications for TSO-C178. 

 
b. Aircraft circuit breakers approved under a previous TSOA may still be manufactured under the provisions of its original approval. 

 

3. 
REQUIREMENTS.  New models of aircraft circuit breakers identified and manufactured 
on or after the effective date of this TSO must meet the requirements in Table 1 for the 
intended equipment class.

a. Functionality.  This TSO's standards apply to equipment intended to provide: 
 

- Equipment Class 1 - Arc Fault and thermal protection for VAC applications - Equipment Class 2 - Arc Fault and thermal protection for VDC applications - Equipment Class 3 - Thermal protection for VAC or VDC applications 
 
b. There is no standard minimum failure condition classification for this TSO.  The failure condition classification appropriate for the equipment will depend on the intended use of the equipment in a specific aircraft.  Document the loss of function and malfunction failure condition classification for which the equipment is designed.  
 
c. Functional Qualification.  Demonstrate the required functional performance under the test conditions specified in Table 2 for each included equipment class.

Sections 4.5 and 4.7 of SAE AS 6019 
3 
AC or DC Thermal Circuit Breakers 
Sections 4.5 and 4.7 of SAE AS 58091A 

 
d. Environmental Qualification. Demonstrate the required performance under the test conditions specified in SAE AS 5692A, sections 4.5 and 4.7, SAE AS 6019, sections 4.5 and 4.7, or SAE AS 58091A, sections 4.5 and 4.7 using standard environmental conditions and test procedures appropriate for airborne equipment.  You may use a different standard environmental condition and test procedure than described in SAE AS 5692A, AS 6019, or AS 58091A 
provided the standard is appropriate for the aircraft circuit breaker equipment. 

 
 
Note:  The use of RTCA/DO-160D (with Changes 1 and 2 only, without Change 3 incorporated) or earlier versions is generally not considered appropriate and will require substantiation via the deviation process as discussed in paragraph **3.g** of this TSO. 

 
e. Software Qualification.  If the article includes software, develop the software according to RTCA, Inc., document RTCA/DO-178C, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, dated December 13, 2011, including referenced supplements as applicable, to at least the software level consistent with the failure condition classification defined in paragraph **3.b** of this TSO.  You may also develop the software according to RTCA, Inc., document RTCA/DO-178B, dated December 1, 1992, if you follow the guidance in AC 20- 115D, Airborne Software Development Assurance Using EUROCAE ED- 12() and RTCA DO-178(), dated July 21, 2017, or latest revision. 

 
f. Electronic Hardware Qualification.  If the article includes complex custom airborne electronic hardware, then develop the component according to RTCA, Inc., Document RTCA/DO-254*, Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware*, dated April 19, 
2000, to at least the design assurance level consistent with the failure condition classification defined in paragraph **3.b** of this TSO.  For custom airborne electronic hardware determined to be simple, RTCA/DO-254, paragraph 1.6 applies.  
 
g. Deviations.  We have provisions for using alternate or equivalent means of compliance with the criteria in the MPS of this TSO.  If you invoke these provisions, you must show that your equipment maintains an equivalent level of safety.  Apply for a deviation pursuant to Title 
14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21.618. 4. 

MARKING. 

 
a. Mark at least one major component permanently and legibly with all of the information in 14 CFR 45.15(b).  Mark the Equipment Class from Table 1 above on each article. 

b. If the article includes software and/or airborne electronic hardware, then the article part numbering scheme must identify the software and airborne electronic hardware configuration.  The part numbering scheme can use separate, unique part numbers for software, hardware, and airborne electronic hardware. 

 
c. You may use electronic part marking to identify software or airborne electronic hardware components by embedding the identification within the hardware component itself (using software) rather than marking it on the equipment nameplate.  If electronic marking is used, it must be readily accessible without the use of special tools or equipment. 

 
5. 

APPLICATION DATA REQUIREMENTS.  You must give the FAA Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) branch manager responsible for your facility a statement of conformance, pursuant to 14 CFR 21.603(a)(1) and one copy each of the following technical data to support your design and production approval.
