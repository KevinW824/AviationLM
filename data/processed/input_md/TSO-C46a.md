3.4 Humidity. 

The instrument must perform its intended function and must not be adversely affected following exposure to the extreme condition of relative humidity in the range from 0 to 95 percent at a temperature of approximately 70°C 
for a period of 10 hours. 

4. 

Compliance tests. 

As evidence of compliance with this standard, the manufacturer must perform evaluation tests on prototype instruments to demonstrate proper design, reliability in performance of its intended functions, and conformity with the performance standards of section 
2. 

Tests must also be performed to demonstrate compliance with the environmental condition requirements specified in section 3. 

5. 
Individual performance 
tests. 

The manufacturer must conduct such tests as may be necessary on each instrument to assure that it will meet the minimum performance requirements of sections 2.3(b) 
through 2.3(h).
