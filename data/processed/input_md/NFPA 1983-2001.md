# Nfpa 1983 Standard On Fire Service Life Safety Rope And System Components

## 2001 Edition

   This edition of 
                  NFPA 1983, Standard on Fire Service Life Safety Rope and System Components, 
was prepared by the Technical Committee on Special Operations Protective Clothing and 
Equipment, released by the Technical Correlating Committee on Fire and Emergency Ser­
vices Protective Clothing and Equipment, and acted on by the 
                                                              National Fire Protection Asso­
ciation, Inc., at its 
                  November Meeting held 
                                             November 12-15, 2000, in Orlando, FL. It was 
issued by the Standards Council on January 13, 2001, with an effective date of February 9, 
2001, and supersedes all previous editions. 
   This edition ofNFPA 1983 was approved as an American National Standard on February 9, 
2001. 

## Origin And Development Of Nfp A 1983

The Technical Committee on Protective Equipment for Fire Fighters (then renamed as the Technical Committee on Fire Service Protective Clothing and Equipment) began work on this standard in 1982 in answer to requests from the fire service to establish requirements for rope used by the fire service to perform rescues. During the development of this standard, it became necessary to include harnesses and hardware that are used with the rope in rescue operations. The work was completed in the spring of 1984 and submitted to NFPA for official adoption. The first edition was issued on June 6, 1985. 

The Subcommittee on Life Safety Ropes began the revision to the 1985 edition in late 1987 
and turned over its proposals to the Technical Committee in December 1988. The Technical Committee completed its work on the document in April 1989, and it was submitted for the Annual Meeting 1990 cycle. The second edition was issued on July 20, 1990. 

   During 1993, 
               NFPA restructured the manner in which committees were organized, and all 
standing subcommittees were eliminated. Within the Technical Committee on Fire Service 
Protective Clothing and Equipment, the former standing subcommittees were reorganized as 
task groups to address specific technical issues, and the Technical Committee assumed the 
entire responsibility for 
                      NFPA 1983. 

   In October 1994, just after the revisions for the third edition were completed, the Stan­
dards Council appointed the Technical Correlating Committee on Fire and Emergency Ser­
vices Protective Clothing and Equipment to oversee all fire and emergency services protective 
clothing and equipment issues. The existing Technical Committee on Fire Service Protective 
Clothing and Equipment ceased to exist in May 1995, and seven new technical committees, 
each responsible for a different segment of the fire and emergency services protective cloth­
ing and equipment spectrum, are now in place. The future responsibility for 
                                                                           NFPA 1983 now 
rests with the new Technical Committee on Special Operations Protective Clothing and 
Equipment, operating under the Technical Correlating Committee on Fire and Emergency 
Services Protective Clothing and Equipment. 

  The third edition ofNFPA 1983 was a complete revision to the document. The document 
was reformatted to present the certification requirements, the product labeling and user 
information requirements, the design requirements, the performance requirements, and the 
testing requirements each in separate chapters. A different approach was taken to life safety 
rope and the various items used in conjunction with the rope. While the life safety rope 
remained as the key subject of the document, other items used in conjunction with the rope 
were addressed as system components. 

  New criteria for personal escape rope were included to cover a type of life safety rope 
that is carried by fire fighters/ 
                             rescuers and used only for fire fighter/ 
                                                                    rescuer escape or self­
rescue in critical entrapment situations where the rope would provide the only viable means 
of escape. There also was new criteria, in addition to the harness requirements, for three 
types of belts: one intended for use to position a fire fighter on a ladder, a second type for 
escape/self-rescue using a life safety rope, or a third type for both applications. Definitions 
were expanded to provide better understanding of terms. The testing requirements were 

greatly expanded to provide the criteria with which to evaluate the performance and deter­
mine pass/fail. 

The third edition was acted on by the membership of the Association at the Annual Meeting in Denver, Colorado, on May 24, 1995, and was issued with an effective date of August 11, 1995. 

This fourth edition of NFPA 1983 adds a new type of rope - a throwline - a floating rope that is intended to be thrown to a person in water, or used as a tether for rescuers dur­
ing water rescue incidents. New requirements for pulleys and portable anchors were also added to the fourth edition as new items of system components. The former terminology for one- and two-person load classifications has been changed to a simpler load classification based on the weight that the rope or system is designed to support. 

Testing methods for descent control devices were modified to provide more accurate test­
ing for the three types of descenders. Other testing modifications were made throughout Chapter 6 to clarify testing methods and improve reproducibility of testing results. 

New requirements for improved product quality assurance through manufacturer's being registered as compliant with ISO, and certification laboratory accreditation have been added. 

Annual product evaluation, testing, and recertification were also added. All three of these new criteria are directed to raise the bar for product and certification quality and to provide a better level of safety for the end users. 

Throughout the document, modifications to existing text were made in the continuing attempt to make the document clearer, less ambiguous, and easier to use by both manufactur­
ers and the certification organizations. This process continues during every revision cycle, and the input received from document users has been very helpful in fixing many of these issues. 

This fourth edition was acted on by the Association membership at the Fall Meeting in Orlando, Florida, on November 15, 2000, and was issued with an effective date of February 9, 
2001.

cabl.e text paragraphs. 

A.1.1.4 Fall factors (as illustrated in Figure A.1 . 1.4) are cal­
culated by dividing the distance the person attached to the 
rope will fall by the length of the rope between him and the 
rope anchor or belay. Thus, a 305-mm (1-ft) fall on a 150-mm 
(½-ft) rope would be a fall factor of 2.0; a 305-mm ( 1-ft) fall 
on a 305-mm ( 1-ft) rope would be a 1.0-fall factor, a 305-mm 
(1-ft) fall on a 1.12-m (4-ft) rope would be a 0.25-fall factor, 
and a 305-mm ( 1-ft) fall on a 12.2-m (40-ft) rope would be a 
0.025-fall factor. Note as well that a 7.6-m (25-ft) fall on a 
30.5-m ( 100-ft) rope is also a 0.25-fall factor. This formula 
assumes the fall takes place in free air without rope drag 
across building edges or through intermediate equipment. 
   When fall factors of 
                       greater than 0.25 are anticipated, such 
as are possible in lead climbing, dynamic ropes specifically 
designed for climbing should be considered. Only ropes cer­
tified to an appropriate climbing rope standard (i.e., UIAA, 
CE, etc.) are appropriate for this use. Dynamic climbing ropes 
should be stored, maintained, inspected and use-logged in a 
manner similar to that required for static/low stretch rope. 
Such operations are outside the scope of this document. 

A.1.2.1 Fire fighting and rescue are hazardous activities. It is 
the responsibility of the fire department to obtain expert 
instruction and to take adequate safety precautions based 
upon manufacturer's recommendations. Fire department 
training should include use techniques; maintenance proce­
dures, including properties of escape rope, life safety harness, 
belts, and auxiliary equipment; and deployment techniques of 
this equipment. 

A.1.3.2 Approved. The National Fire Protection Association 
does not approve, inspect, or certify any installations, proce­
dures, equipment, or materials; nor does it approve or evalu­
ate testing laboratories. In determining the acceptability of 
installations, procedures, equipment, or materials, the author­
ity having jurisdiction may base acceptance on compliance 
with NFPA or other appropriate standards. In the absence of 
such standards, said authority 
                           may require evidence of proper 

installation, procedure, or use. The authority having 
                                                     jurisdic­
tion may also refer to the listings or labeling practices of an 
organization that is concerned with product evaluations and is 
thus in a position to determine compliance with appropriate 
standards for the current production of listed items. 

A.1.3.4 Authority Having 
                        Jurisdiction. The phrase "authority 
havingjurisdiction" is used in NFPA documents in a broad man­
ner, since jurisdictions and approval agencies vary, as do their 
responsibilities. Where public safety is primary, the authority 
having jurisdiction may be a federal, state, local, or other 
regional department or individual such as a fire chief; fire mar­
shal; chief of a fire prevention bureau, labor department, or 
health department; building official; electrical inspector; or oth­
ers having statutory authority. For insurance purposes, an insur­
ance inspection department, rating bureau, or other insurance 
company representative may be the authority having jurisdic­
tion. In many circumstances, the property owner or his or her 
designated agent assumes the role of the authority having 
                                                       juris­
diction; at government installations, the commanding officer or 
departmental official may be the authority having 
                                               jurisdiction. 

A.1.3.6.1 Escape Belt. The intended use of the escape belt is 
to provide emergency escape capability to a fire fighter from 
an immediate life-threatening emergency above the ground 
floor of a structure. Escape belts do not have leg loops to pre­
vent the belt from rising up the torso of the user. The fire 
fighter using an escape belt should always be able to maintain 
foot contact with the surface of the structure during descent 
or use a life safety harness. 

A.1.3.7 **Block Creel Construction.** Unavoidable knots could be present in individual fibers as received from the fiber producer. 

A.1.3.16 Design **Load.** The design load used in developing the minimum performance requirement of a component to this standard is only applicable when the forces are applied to the component in a direct linear fashion. The loads placed on a component through rigging and creation of a system can be increased due to the vectors used in the rigging. Loads can be amplified substantially when forces are applied in differing directions. Users should develop processes to identify loads placed on each component when creating systems and to determine whether or not they are acceptable. For example, a rope used in a highline system as the main line could be loaded (tensioned) with more than ten times the actual load being carried across on the highline system depending on the angles involved in the rigging of the highline system. 

A.1.3.23 Fall Factor. See A.1.1.4. A.1.3.28 Impact Load. For the purposes of this document, fall factors greater than 0.25 generate unacceptable impact loads. 

A.1.3.35 Listed. The means for identifying listed equipment may vary for each organization concerned with product evalu­
ation; some organizations do not recognize equipment as listed unless it is also labeled. The authority havingjurisdiction should utilize the system employed by the listing organization to identify a listed product. 

A.1.3.42 Portable Anchor. Examples include but are not lim­
ited to davits, A-frame, tripods, quadpods, and cantilever devices. 

A.1.3.43 Product Label. This product label is not a certifica­
tion organizations' label, symbol, or identifying mark; however, the certification organizations' label, symbol, or identifying mark can be attached to it or be part of it. 

A.1.3.45 Proof Load. The applied proof load is usually well above the allowable service load, but low enough so as not to damage the product being tested. 

A.1.3.55 Standard Deviation. In this standard, standard deviation is calculated using the formulas in 6.1.1.2, 6.2.1.2, and 6.6.1.2. 

A.2.2.1 The certification organization should have sufficient breadth of interest and activity so that the loss or award of a specific business contract would not be a determining factor in the financial well-being of the agency. 

A.2.2.3 The contractual provisions covering certification pro­
grams should contain clauses advising the manufacturer that if requirements change, the product should be brought into compliance with the new requirements by a stated effective date through a compliance review program involving all cur­
rently listed products. Without the clauses, certifiers would not be able to move quickly to protect their name, marks, or reputation. A product safety certification program would be deficient without these contractual provisions and the admin­
istrative means to back them up. 

A.2.2.4 Investigative procedures are important elements of an effective and meaningful product safety certification program. 

A preliminary review should be carried out on products sub­
mitted to the agency before any ma jor testing is undertaken. 

A.2.2.7 Such inspections should include, in most instances, witnessing of production tests. With certain products, the certi­
fication organization inspectors should select samples from the production line and submit them to the main laboratory for countercheck testing. With other products, it could be desir­
able to purchase samples in the open market for test purposes. 

A.3.1.1 Information could be added to the tape that applies to a particular rope, such as date of manufacture or any perti­ nent information useful to the purchaser. 

A.3.1.2.1 When life safety rope is purchased, the authority having jurisdiction should assure that the product label(s) 
with the information as specified in 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.2.1 is attached and remains with the rope until placed in service. 

When the product label is removed from the rope, the label should be retained in the authority's permanent rope records. 

It is very important that the information on the product label(s) and the information required in 3.2.1 to be supplied by the manufacturer reach the persons who will actually be using the rope. It is useless for the supply personnel or equip­
ment officer to remove the product label and other pertinent information and simply retain them in the rope record file. 

The persons who potentially will be using the rope need to be provided with all the information that could be available. 

Copies of the product label(s) and other pertinent informa­
tion should be maintained with the rope wherever the rope is in-service awaiting use so that the potential users can consult the information. 

Where life safety or escape rope is purchased in long lengths, and then cut by the end user agency to make several life safety ropes or escape ropes, the product label(s) should be photocopied or otherwise reproduced and attached to each life safety rope when it is sent into service. The end user person or persons (in a fire department it probably would be a fire company) should keep the copy of the product label(s) and any other pertinent information for reference and have the product label and other information readily available so that they can be reviewed by all potential users whenever necessary. 

Ropes can be damaged in use by high stresses, impact load­
ing situations, abrasion, kinking, heat, and exposure to chem­
icals and other products. 

Ropes should be inspected by a qualified person before and after every operation and carefully stored between each use. Records should provide a history of each rope and should call for regular inspection and replacement as necessary. Any rope that fails to pass inspection or has been impact loaded should be destroyed immediately. 

It is recommended that departments establish an inspec­
tion program and shelf life criteria for their ropes based on the conditions and environments encountered in their respec­ tive operations. 

It is recommended that training ropes and rescue ropes be separate ropes. 

The destruction of rope means that it should be removed from service and altered in such a manner that it could not mistakenly be used as a life safety rope. This could include dis­
posal or removal of the label and cutting the rope into short lengths to be used for utility purposes. 

A.3.1.3.1 When escape rope is purchased, the purchaser or the authority havingjurisdiction should ensure that a product label with the information as specified in 3.1.1, 3.1.3, and 3.2.2 
is attached and remains with the rope until placed in service. 

This label should be retained either in the authority's rope records or with the user of the rope for reference. 

Escape rope is in tended only f or emergency self-rescue situations and cannot be used for other rope rescue situations. Escape rope is designed for one use only and destroyed after any use. 

Escape rope is intended to be carried by a fire fighter or other emergency services personnel, so that it will be available in unanticipated situations from which self
-rescue using the rope is the only option. Therefore, the escape rope should be carefully stored and periodically inspected by a qualified per­ son to ensure status and condition of the rope. During inspec­
tion, if there is any doubt as to the suitability of the escape rope for use, it should be destroyed immediately and replaced. 

A.3.1.3.3 Information useful to the purchaser that applies to a particular rope could be added to the tape. 

A.3.1.4.2 For calculating the "fit height," it will be assumed the wearer has a 1015-mm ( 
40- in.) chest. 

A.3.1.7.1 Throwlines that are provided to the potential user in water rescue throwbags should include proper instructions of use for the throwbag in accordance with ASTM F 1730, Guide f or Throwing a Water Rescue Throwbag. 

A.3.2.1 When life safety rope is purchased, the authority hav­
ingjurisdiction should assure that the product label(s) with the information as specified in 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.2.1 is attached and remains with the rope until placed in service. When the product label is removed from the rope, the label should be retained in the authority's permanent rope records. 

It is very important that the information on the product label (s) and the information required in 3.2.1 to be supplied by the manufacturer reach the persons who will actually be using the rope. It is useless for the supply personnel or equip­
ment officer to remove the product label and other pertinent information and simply retain them in the rope record file. 

The persons who potentially will be using the rope need to be provided with all the information that could be available. 

Copies of the product label(s) and other pertinent informa­
tion should be maintained with the rope wherever the rope is in-service awaiting use so that the potential users can consult the information. 

Where life safety or escape rope is purchased in long lengths, and then cut by the end user agency to make several life safety ropes or escape ropes, the product label(s) should be photocopied or otherwise reproduced and attached to each life safety rope when it is sent into service. The end user person or persons (in a fire department it probably would be a fire company) should keep the copy of the product label(s) and any other pertinent information for reference and have the product label and other information readily available so that they can be reviewed by all potential users whenever necessary. 

A.3.2.1.3(1) To avoid possible damage, and possible reduc­
tion and loss of strength of the life safety rope or harness, the manufacturer should be contacted prior to disinfecting or cleaning by a method not prescribed in the maintenance pro­ cedures and retirement criteria. 

Generic inspection information for some types oflife safety ropes can be found in ASTM F 1740, Guide f or Inspection o f
 
N
ylon, Polyester and/or N
ylon/Polyester Blend Kernmantle Rope. 

A.3.2.2.2(3) The term *destroy* for the escape rope means that it should be removed from service and destroyed by cutting it into less than 305-mm (1-ft) pieces, burning it, or otherwise ruining the rope to prevent reuse. 

A.3.2.5.5 Many portable anchor auxiliary equipment devices 
(such as tripods) have several height or length ad justments at which they can be set up. The strength rating of such devices can be different at each setting. As a minimum, the lowest strength set-up configuration of the device, as recommended by the manufacturer in the user instructions, should be tested and labeled on each device. 

A.4.1.1 If a finish is applied to rope fiber during production, it should not interfere with safe usage of the rope due to exces­
sive slipperiness; this characteristic should be evaluated by the purchasing organization before the rope is purchased. 

## A.4.2.1 See A.4.1.1.

A.4.3.2 The purchaser should ensure that proper sizes are available to accommodate on-duty personnel. 

A.4.3.3 Many life safety harness and system components that meet the requirements of this standard might not interface effectively with all systems of use and all types of life safety rope. Evaluation should be done before purchase to ensure compatibility. 

Load-bearing textile materials should have strength, aging, ultraviolet resistance, abrasion resistance, and heat and cold resistance characteristics equivalent or superior to polyamides. 

A.4.3.4 Alternative methods for finishing and securing webbing ends can be hardware capping, tucking and sewing, and coating the webbing ends with an air-drying solvent base sealant. 

A.4.3.5 To aid the visual inspection of thread, it is recom­
mended that the manufacturer use a thread that is of contrast­
ing color to the webbing. 

A.4.4.2 See A.4.3.2. A.4.4.3 See A.4.3.3. 

A.4.4.4 See A.4.3.4. 

A.4.4.5 See A.4.3.5. 

A.4.5.2.2 It is recommended that rescue personnel use gen­
eral use instead of light-use auxiliary equipment in those one­
person load situations where the victim is the load, and in any situations where unusual or extreme forces could be placed on the system. 

A.4.5.2.3 See A.4.5.2.2. A.4.5.6 Locking designs can include screw and spring collars that are designed to prevent gates from opening accidentally during use. 

A.4.5.9 See A.4.3.5. A.5.1 Even properly stored rope can lose strength over a period of time. Life safety ropes should be stored in a manner to avoid degradation from the environment. Examples include but are not limited to sunlight, fluorescent light, heat, exhaust fumes, battery acid, and fumes. 

Any rope can be severely damaged and can fail when cut by a sharp edge or when sub jected to abrasion over rough sur­
faces. Rope should be protected from such hazards with appropriate abrasion protection. Many constructions of rope that meet the requirements of this standard could pose diffi­
culties with knotting or splicing easily or interfacing effectively with all systems of use and all types of life safety harness and associated equipment. Evaluation should be done by the fire department before purchase to ensure compatibility. Rope end terminations such as knots and splices should be made in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. 

A.5.1.3 Rope elongation is related to the amount of energy a rope can safely absorb when used to arrest a fall. For all ropes, and especially when impact loading of greater than a fall factor 

of 
  0.25, manufacturers should be consulted to assure that rope 
with appropriate elongation and energy absorption is selected 
for each application.

  When selecting the size of rope to purchase, a systems 
approach should be considered. Evaluation should be done 
while wearing gloves with the selected ascender and descen­
der auxiliary equipment before purchase to ensure the rope 
size works.

A.5.1.7 The thermal requirement is 
                                     intended to limit melting 
of rope, harness, and certain other system components due to 
friction caused by activities such as rappelling. The thermal 
requirement is NOT intended to qualify these items for use 
during fire-fighting operations or other operations where 
high temperature exposures are encountered. 

   Many life safety ropes have thermoplastic materials as all or 
part of their construction because of the material's excellent 
stretch and resilient properties. However, thermoplastic mate­
rials are not highly resistant to elevated temperatures and can 
lose strength at temperatures common during fire-fighting 
operations. If life safety rope is carried by fire fighters during 
fire-fighting operations, it should be shielded or protected 
from flame or high temperature exposures. Repeat exposures 
of the life safety rope to flame or high temperatures can cause 
degradation of the rope over time and could result in failure 
during use. Exposure of the life safety rope to flame or high 
temperatures during use can cause melting of thermoplastic 
materials of the rope and result in failure.

A.5.2.4 The thermal requirement is intended to limit melting 
of rope, harness, and certain other system components due to 
friction caused by activities such as rappelling. The thermal 
requirement is NOT intended to qualify these items for use

  Many escape ropes have thermoplastic materials as all or 
part of their construction because of the material's excellent 
stretch and resilient properties. However, thermoplastic mate­
rials are not highly resistant to elevated temperatures and can 
lose strength at temperatures common during fire-fighting 
operations. If escape rope is carried by fire fighters during fire­
fighting operations, it should be shielded or protected from 
flame or high temperature exposures and falling hot debris. 
The rope can be carried in the pocket of 
                                       the protective coat or 
inside a thermally protective pouch or storage bag. Repeat 
exposures of the escape rope to flame or high temperatures 
can cause degradation of the rope over time and could result 
in failure during use. Exposure of the escape rope to flame or 
high temperatures during use can cause melting of thermo­
plastic materials of the rope and result in failure. 

A.5.3.5 The thermal requirement is intended to limit melting 
of rope, harness, and certain other system components due to 
friction caused by activities such as rappelling. The thermal 
requirement is NOT intended to qualify these items for use 
during fire-fighting operations or other operations where

   Many life safety harness have thermoplastic materials as all 
or part of their construction because of the material's excel­
lent strength and resilient properties. However, thermoplastic 
materials are not highly resistant to elevated temperatures and 
can lose strength at temperatures common during fire-fighting 
operations. If life safety harness is carried or used by fire fight­
ers during fire-fighting operations, it should be shielded or 
protected from flame or high temperature exposures. Repeat 
exposures of the life safety rope to flame or high temperatures 
can cause degradation of the harness over time and could 
result in failure during use. Exposure of the life safety harness 
to flame or high temperatures during use can cause melting of 
thermoplastic materials of the harness and result in failure. 

A.5.4.4 The thermal requirement is intended to limit melting 
of rope, harness, and certain other system components due to 
friction caused by activities such as rappelling. The thermal 
requirement is NOT intended to qualify these items for use 
during fire-fighting operations or other operations where 
high temperature exposures are encountered. 

   Many belts have thermoplastic materials as all or part of 
                                                            the 
construction because of the excellent strength and resilient 
properties. However, thermoplastic materials are not highly 
resistant to elevated temperatures and can lose strength at 
temperatures common during fire-fighting operations. If 
                                                           belts 
are carried or used by fire fighters during fire-fighting opera­
tions, they should be shielded or protected from flame or high 
temperature exposures. Repeat exposures of belts to flame or 
high temperatures can cause degradation of 
                                              the belt over time 
and could result in failure during use. Exposure of the belt to 
flame or high temperatures during use can cause melting of 
thermoplastic materials of the belt and result in failure. 

A.5.5.6.5 The thermal requirement is intended to limit melt­
ing of rope, harness, and certain other system components 
due to friction caused by activities such as rappelling. The 
thermal requirement is NOT intended to qualify these items 

for use during fire fighting operations or other operations where high temperature exposures are encountered. 

Many auxiliary equipment software items have thermoplas­
tic materials as all or part of the construction because of the excellent strength and resilient properties. However, thermo­
plastic materials are not highly resistant to elevated tempera­
tures and can lose strength at temperatures common during fire fighting operations. If auxiliary equipment software items are carried by fire fighters during fire fighting operations, they should be shielded or protected from flame or high tempera­
ture exposures. Repeat exposures of the auxiliary equipment software to flame or high temperatures can cause degradation of the item (s) over time and could result in failure during use. Exposure of the auxiliary equipment software to flame or high temperatures during use can cause melting of thermoplastic materials of the item(s) and result in failure. 

A.6.1.1.1 NFPA 1983 does not preclude a variety of rope con­
struction so long as the construction types meet the perfor­
mance requirements of the standard. The title of CI 
1801, Low Stretch and Static Kernmantle Life Safety Rope, indicates a type of rope construction; however, the elongation and breaking strength test methods contained in CI 1801 can be utilized for other types of rope construction. 

The reference is not intended to limit the rope construction to any single type of rope construction or to the construction type mentioned in the title of CI 1801. The reference is only intended to reference the testing methods for elongation and breaking strength specified in Sections 8 and 9 of CI 1801 for evaluating any rope construction type for compliance with NFPA 1983. 

A.6.3.1.1 The intent is to test three samples of each model per test. At the manufacturers' discretion, a new, unused sample from one test series can be used for one or more of the other test series. For example, a sample used in harness test 6.3.2 can be used to conduct harness test 6.3.3, or a new unused sample can be used. 

A.6.3.2.3 The 16.01-k/N (3600-lbf) test value selected for this static test, which employs a rigid test torso, equates to having a dynamic force exerted on the body greatly exceeding that which is considered reasonable to survive. 

A.6.3.3.3 The force selected for this test is less than that selected for the previous test because, in realistic emergency operations, a fire fighter falling headfirst will impact the har­
ness with less force in the head-down position, and then be inverted and arrested, thus producing the maximum force in the upright position. 

A.6.4.1.1 See A.6.3.1.1. A.6.4.2.3 A lesser force is used in this test than in the rescue harness test due to the personal protective application of belts. 

The indicated test force of 13 k/N (2923 lbf) is compliant with the requirements for escape rope. 

A.6.5.1.2.1 AISI SAE Type 01 tool steel is commonly pur­
chased as 01 Drill Rod. 

A.6.5.4.1.4 For example, portable anchors designed to be attached to flanged rims of vessel openings would require a test base to simulate the flanged portal to which the device is designed to be affixed. 

A.6.5.4.1.6 In most cases, the portable anchor device will be weakest at its greatest (or highest) extension.
