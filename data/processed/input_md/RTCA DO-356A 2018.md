## Introduction

This document is the joint product of two industry committees: the EUROCAE Working Group WG-72, titled "Aeronautical Systems Security" and the RTCA Special Committee SC-216, also titled "Aeronautical Systems Security". WG-72 was formed to address information security for the overall Aeronautical Information System Security (AISS) of airborne systems with related ground systems and environment, while SC-216 was formed more specifically to address information security for certification of aircraft and its systems. 

## 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a set of methods and guidelines that may be used within the airworthiness security process defined in RTCA DO-326A / EUROCAE ED-202A, Airworthiness Security Process Specification. It is recognized that alternative methods to the processes described or referenced in this document may be available to an organization desiring to obtain certification. This document does not provide guidelines concerning the structure of an individual organization or how the responsibilities for certification activities are divided. No such guidance should be inferred from the descriptions provided. 

## 1.2 Scope

Airworthiness security is the protection of the airworthiness of an aircraft from intentional unauthorized electronic interaction. Existing safety processes have not had to consider intentional disruption. 

Intentional unauthorized electronic interaction (also known as "unauthorized interaction" within the scope of this document) is defined as a circumstance or event with the potential to affect the aircraft due to human action resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, denial, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and/or aircraft system interfaces. This includes the consequences of malware and forged data and the effects of external systems on aircraft systems but does not include physical attacks or electromagnetic disturbance. This document provides methods and considerations for showing compliance for airworthiness security during the aircraft design and development life cycle. It was developed as a companion document to DO-326A / ED-202A which addresses security process aspects of aircraft certification. Guidance for airworthiness security during the complete aircraft life cycle is provided through the additional companion document RTCA 
DO-355 / EUROCAE ED-204, Information Security Guidance for Continuing Airworthiness, which addresses the airworthiness security for the continued airworthiness outside of design and development. This document assumes that its readers are knowledgeable of applicable guidance material. The guidelines in this document were developed in the context of 14 CFR Part 25 and EASA CS-25. It may be applicable to other regulations, such as Parts 23, 27, 29, 33, and 35 (CS- 23, CS-27, CS-29, CS-E, CS-P). It does not assume that applicants are in compliance with the guidance materials referenced in this document but does assume that the applicant has in place a comprehensive flight safety program as part of development and continued airworthiness which is compliant with regulation, and an applicant may tailor this guidance appropriately in negotiation with regulatory authorities. The methods and considerations of this document provide guidance for accomplishing the airworthiness security process activities identified in DO-326A / ED-202A. See section 1.3 
DO-356A

for a discussion of the guidance provided. Appendix C lists the DO-326A / ED-202A activities and references that are addressed in this version of the document. The scope of this document is limited to protection of airworthiness security - the aspects of information security which could compromise the safety of the aircraft. The safety aspects of physical attacks - known as Aviation Security - are out of scope of the document and can be found in documents such as ICAO Convention Annex 17. Any use of this document for aspects of information security outside of airworthiness security - e.g. security of business interests - is considered out of scope of this document. Figure 1-1 illustrates these uses of security.

## 1.4 Conventions Of This Document

This document addresses audiences of two possible backgrounds, airworthiness certification and information security management. This results in difficulties in terminology, as the two audiences share technical terms that have different meanings and usages. Since the primary impact of this document is within the area of airworthiness certification, the following practice has been followed: 
•
If a term with a suitable definition is available from the area of airworthiness certification, that term is used. 

•
If there is no suitable term in airworthiness certification, but there is a term with a suitable definition in information security management and use of that term will not conflict with a similar-sounding term in airworthiness certification, that term is used. 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc. 

- 
If there is no suitable term in either area, or if an available term has different meanings in the two areas, an alternate term that does not conflict is defined in section 1.6 of the Glossary and used. 
- 
Terms intended to have a specific technical meaning are defined in section 1.6 of the Glossary regardless of the origin of the term. Terms that are not defined in the Glossary are intended to have their common dictionary meaning. 
This document recognizes that the guidance herein is not mandated by law but represents a consensus of the aviation community. It also recognizes that alternative methods to the methods described herein may be available to the applicant. For these reasons, the use of words such as "shall" and "must" is avoided. The words "shall and must" will be used in examples which include system requirements since most of these requirements use them. 

## 1.5 Relationship To Other Documents

This document provides additional guidance for the airworthiness security process and is referenced by DO-326A / ED-202A. A list of other documents that are cited for information only is found in Appendix J. The cited documents are commonly used in the development and airworthiness certification of aircraft or in the assessment of information security risks. 

## 1.6 Definition Of Terms And Acronyms

An extended version of the Glossary is published as EUROCAE report ER-013 and serves as the centralized and normative definition of terms to be shared by all EUROCAE documents addressing aeronautical information systems security. Note:

no 
Refutation 
Refutation acts as an independent set of assurance activities beyond analysis and requirements. As an alternative to exhaustive testing, refutation can be used to provide evidence that an unwanted behavior has been precluded to an acceptable level of confidence. 
Note: 
Refutation is also known as Security Evaluation in some contexts. 
yes 
Reliability 
Security usage: The ability of a system to perform a required function under specified conditions for a specified period of time. [Source: IETF RFC 2828, IETF RFC 4949] Safety use: The probability that an item will perform a required function under specified conditions, without failure, for a specified period of time. [Source: ED-79A / ARP4754A]

## Regulatory Considerations

The material in this chapter is intended to guide the applicant in issues that relate to certification of their equipment. It does not contain methods but does provide information and considerations useful to the applicant for the certification process. This chapter includes the ASISP final report recommendations and concerns that relate to the methods and considerations for certification aspects. See Appendix K for the history of the ASISP final report. Although the ARAC ASISP was tasked by the FAA, representatives of ANAC, EASA, Transport Canada and their related industries also participated in the final report, so this material supports globally harmonized rules, advisory material and guidance material. 

## 2.1 Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction

This section aims at providing a detailed definition and scope for what is and what is not considered Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction (IUEI). 

For purposes of this document, IUEI, its presence, absence, and impact, is the underlying scope of the subject area that is meant when the term "Security" is used. 

## 2.1.1 Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction - Definition And Meaning

Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction (IUEI) is defined as "[a] circumstance or event with the potential to affect the aircraft due to human action resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, denial, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and/or aircraft system interfaces. This includes the consequences of malware and forged data and the effects of external systems but does not include physical attacks or electromagnetic disturbance." To fully understand the term, the reader should consider the meaning of its individual parts in the context of a typical cyber-event: 
•
The word "intentional" clarifies that the event originates with an intentional act from a human to separate it from other adverse events covered under ED-79A / ARP4754A and ARP4761, such as equipment failures, software logic errors, or human input or decision errors. To clarify, a person who writes a piece of malware defines the intention, not a person who unintentionally installs the malware, for example by inserting an infected USB device into a system.

•
The word "unauthorized" specifies that the event is not defined as permitted within the system definition/function or operational policies. Any aspect regarding functionality, person or timing that has not been authorized is considered as an unauthorized interaction. Referring back to the example above, malware operating on a system conducts unauthorized activity that was not planned by the original system designer.
•
The word "electronic" differentiates the interaction from physical attacks and is more easily thought of in the context of being digital in nature. Malware which results in a failed function is an electronic interaction whereas a hammer is not. It also differentiates the interaction from electrical attacks, such as overvoltage, Electro Magnetic Pulse, or disturbance through overpowering the transmitter.
•
The word "interaction" specifies that the event occurs when the attacker and system act on each other. Note that this refers to both, the state of the system and the state of
its security attributes. So, while eavesdropping may physically be only a one-way
transmission, it also violates the confidentiality attribute of the transmitted information and is thus an interaction between the attacker and the security attributes of the system. 

## 2.1.2 Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction - Some Principles

While it can be difficult to distinguish what is and what is not considered to be unauthorized interaction, it is easier to conceptualize with the understanding that the ultimate purpose is to cover malicious attacks that occur through digital means. Below are some principles to consider in determining whether an event falls within the scope of IUEI. These principles are based on the ARAC ASISP report [6]. 

•
The event is not the result of a purely physical attack, human error, or equipment failure. 

•
Analog attacks on digital hardware are not electronic interaction, but digital attacks through analog connections are ("electronic means digital, not electrical"). 
•
The event can include digital read (unauthorized access to private data) or write operations (unauthorized modification of system configuration or function). 
•
It should be understood that cyberattacks can originate from anywhere in the world.
•
The event originates with a human actor's intentional act, such as a programmer writing malware, or a malicious hacker trying to gain access to connected aircraft systems.
•
The attack is not necessarily restricted to installed systems that are physically or wirelessly connected to other systems. USB flash drives or connections to an
accessible data port are a common means for attacking isolated networks. Portable systems can be connected to multiple networks at different times and provide a further method bridging isolations in the aircraft.
•
Any and all events attributed to malware, because malicious software has been developed with the intent to cause harm. Malware is by definition created with malicious intent and never part of the authorized system behavior. Even if the actual interaction is difficult to analyze, any event involving the intentional change of system configuration to an unauthorized configuration has to be regarded as intentionally unauthorized. Malware is a subset of possible unauthorized configuration changes.
•
An event does not constitute IUEI if it results only from accidental introduction of a
vulnerability through configuration error or software defect. But an event resulting from an attack misusing such vulnerability does constitute IUEI.
•
An attempt to utilize a system vulnerability to modify the availability, integrity, confidentiality or other relevant security attribute of a system is IUEI.

## 2.1.3 Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction - Some Examples

Some specific examples based on the ARAC ASISP report [6] are provided below to assist in developing a comprehensive understanding of IUEI. 
•
Misuse of designed system functionality to avert change or modify system operation to cause harm or danger. 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
•
Personnel with privileged access accidentally introducing malware into a system. Note that although the access by privileged personnel is authorized and the accidental introduction of malware is unintentional, the whole interaction needs to be regarded 
as intentional and unauthorized due to the malware that takes the system out of its authorized configuration. 

- 
Use of a communication device to corrupt data communication (by interception, insertion or destruction, etc.) or test the access possibilities until a way of corruption is found. 
- 
Capturing information in an undetected manner (passively) and worse to subsequently use it for malicious purpose 
- 
Rate-based attacks which saturate the systems resources or communication buses to 
inhibit function. 
- 
Unauthorized use of another user's identification characteristics to obtain access rights and privileges. 
- 
Execution of forbidden operations that damage system functions, or corrupt the data handled by the functions, causing misuses and unrecoverable reactions. 
- 
Misuse of a provided functionality to damage or alter data in a manner to impact normal operation. 
- 
System delivery or installation in a manner that intentionally undermines security. 
- 
Use of properly authorized rights to perform actions contrary to the user's authorized activities such as modification of privileges contrary to the operational policies of the owner or authorized operator. 
- 
Hidden software installed by a malicious person, including trojans, viruses, worms, bots, etc. 
- 
Malware that waits for a specific event (often referred to as a time-bomb) after which 
it executes its payload. 
- 
Mimicking the behavior of a real system (referred to as spoofing) to deceive an authorized user. 
- 
Gaining access to a system by encroaching on someone else's privilege or identity 
for bypassing access controls (a form of man-in-the-middle attack). 
- 
Gaining access to a system from outside a protected domain by impersonating or spoofing a trusted machine inside the protected domain. Once accepted as a trusted machine, the user may be able to corrupt function or data. 
- 
Port scans and other interrogation techniques which identify networked systems for the purpose of identifying available services and possible system vulnerabilities. 
- 
A memory resident virus which is incorporated into operational software code in order to corrupt a function. 
- 
Malware on a maintenance computer that ends up on the computer because the user of the computer has access to the internet and downloads an inappropriate file. The "intent" is captured in the development of the malware. 
- 
An Electro Magnetic Pulse event is excluded as outside the scope of IUEI and ASISP. 

## 2.2 Asset Protection Scope

This section discusses the topic of what logical or physical resources should be protected against intentional unauthorized electronic interaction from a safety hazard classification viewpoint. Assets with a safety hazard classification of Major and above should be protected and this guidance should be used to address those assets. Assets, by the definition used in this DO-356A  
 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc. 

 
document (see section 1.6) "contribute to the airworthiness of the aircraft". Logical and physical resources with a safety hazard classification of No Safety Effect are normally excluded from further consideration and placed outside of security scope. However, their interfaces to other assets should be considered as an untrusted attack vector. Protecting a system or an equipment with a safety hazard classification of No Safety Effect or even Minor may be unnecessary in some implementations. These systems generally do not need protection for the sake of aircraft airworthiness due to their limited impact to the aircraft, although they may require protection for their own sake in order to function in their anticipated environment. In any event, even for these systems an initial assessment is needed to determine: 
- 
The effect on hazard classification considering safety effect caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction 

- 
The potential impact on surrounding systems, no matter the hazard classification. Corruption of a system with No Safety Effect or Minor Safety Effect may lead to a 
propagation attack to surrounding systems with Major or higher Safety Effect 
- 
The existing mitigations 
The following subsections address the determination of when a logical or physical resource becomes an asset that requires protection, and also provide criteria to verify those concepts. A list of equipment is not provided, as it would become outdated before it could be published. Considerations for security controls at safety hazard classification of Minor and No Safety Effect are also addressed. The content of the following subsections is based on the ARAC ASISP report [6].

## 2.2.1 Determination Of Hazard Classification Considering Safety Effect Caused By Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction

It would be impossible to determine the hazard classification considering safety effect caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction of an asset without some level of assessment of the asset and its security environment. For a system with a Minor or No Safety Effect hazard classification, the assessment should focus on what connectivity it would have and therefore what vulnerabilities might be introduced to the aircraft and if a threat could be propagated through that connectivity. This assessment should consider assets that are part of the Type Certificate (TC), amended TCs, and as far as practical, that are part of Supplemental TCs (STCs) or amended STCs (the TC holder can take into consideration the STC changes only if notified by the Operator). Further guidance for STCs is provided in section 2.3. The initial assessment can be very brief; it is dependent on the level of connectivity required by the system or equipment under assessment. If the system or equipment has connectivity in one or more ways with other systems on the aircraft and/or off the aircraft, this needs further examination to determine the type of connectivity. Some regulators may exclude connectivity with external trusted systems as those systems have a level of security that is accepted through other means. The connectivity can be important even in non-flight modes since during maintenance it could be used to update other systems. In the trivial case, the system or equipment has no internal connectivity and it is a Minor or No Safety Effect hazard classification, therefore the assessment would end here. The initial assessment can be brief but should answer the following questions at a minimum: 
- 
What electrical and RF interfaces exist between the asset and the remainder of the aircraft (internal connectivity)? 

•
What electrical and RF interfaces exist between the asset and external systems
outside the aircraft (external trusted services connectivity)?
•
What electrical and RF interfaces exist between the asset and untrusted systems outside the aircraft (external untrusted services connectivity)?
•
In what phases of development, operations, and maintenance is the asset and its interfaces used?
•
If connectivity defined by the above questions is positive, can digital data be exchanged and in what directions can logical data flows be established?
The answers to these and any similar questions should be documented and, when relevant, used for discussion between regulator and applicant. The goal of this assessment is to determine and document the potential for unexpected safety effect caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction on the asset in its intended environment and the potential safety effect caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction on other systems on the aircraft. 

## 2.2.2 Analyzing Potential Impact On Surrounding Systems

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
In the case that an asset has connectivity with another aircraft system, the level of connectivity with other systems and the possible interactions has to be examined. Simple connectivity such as a power bus not transmitting data is not the same concern as a bidirectional connection exchanging digital data. A bidirectional connection to a Major or higher asset is a significant concern, but even a connection to another Minor or No Safety Effect system will require assessment since it also may not be designed or cannot be relied upon to protect itself and may have connectivity to other systems. With a Minor or lower system or equipment, the connectivity and propagation of safety effects caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction is the airworthiness regulatory concern. Additionally, external connectivity utilized during non-flight modes can create safety effects caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction through Field Loadable Software (FLS). Connectivity to power busses common to other equipment is addressed through other regulations so additional comments are not needed here. Some questions may help to identify systems that require closer examination to determine potential impacts. The objective of these questions is to identify systems that could propagate safety effects caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction to Major or higher assets, creating an attack path from the attacker to the target, including: 
•
Does the system have write access through internal connections to one or more onboard systems?

•
Does the system have external untrusted services connectivity, including airline operations centers, maintenance equipment, or wireless connections?
•
Does the system have bidirectional internal connections to other Minor or lower systems?
•
Does the system have write access through internal connections during modes other than flight?
With additional connectivity comes the need to understand the operation of connected systems. The connectivity should be understood well enough to determine the behavior of the connected systems considering safety effects caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction occurring in the system under assessment. This is more difficult when the system is being deployed under an STC but does not relieve the applicant of the burden DO-356A 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc. 

of proof when there is connectivity present with capability to interfere with the connected assets. Further guidance for STCs is provided in section 2.3. 

## 2.2.3 Summary Of Asset Protection

Assets with hazard classification of Major or higher should be protected consistent with their security assessments. The applicant performs an initial evaluation for systems with Minor or lower hazard classification to determine connectivity and possible impact to other aircraft systems. Minor and lower hazard classification systems may or may not require protection based on the context of a specific aircraft and system under assessment. Security protection is not required for systems with hazard classification of Minor or lower, whether or not they possess external connections, if they have no internal direct or indirect connectivity to systems with Major or higher hazard classification. 

The list below summarizes the concerns with systems or equipment with Minor or No Safety Effect hazard classification that has connectivity with other systems and may propagate safety effects caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction to other systems. This list does not direct the applicant how to protect the asset, but only identifies when protection may be required. 

1. 

Additional security protection of Major or higher hazard classification assets is not needed when systems with hazard classification of Minor or lower have internal connectivity to the Major or higher asset(s) that can be shown to be read only and the read only enforcement is resistant to attack, such as enforced by simple hardware. 

2. 
Assets with hazard classification of Major or higher need protection at the aircraft level or within themselves (by design or by procedure) when systems of Minor or 
lower have internal connectivity (write access) to the Major or higher asset(s) based on the security assessment of the asset and the asset they are connecting to. 
3. 
Assets with hazard classification of Major or higher need protection at the aircraft level or within themselves (by design or by procedure) when systems of Minor or lower have connectivity to the Major or higher asset(s), through one or more other systems no matter the hazard classification of those intermediate systems, based on the security assessment of the asset and the asset they are connecting to. 
4. 
Assets with hazard classification of Major or higher need protection at the aircraft level or within themselves (by design or by procedure) when systems of Minor or lower have external untrusted services connectivity and have connectivity to Major or higher assets. 

## 2.3 Type Design Changes And Stc Considerations

Prior to every modification to the type certification basis, the applicant determines that the interrelationships between this modification and any other previous modifications and/or technical adaptations will not introduce any adverse effect upon the security and airworthiness of the product. The type certification basis may be an original TC plus one or more other STCs. If by the analysis of the modifications it is determined that the change does not impact any existing systems or interfaces, the scope of the classification of the change to type design can be limited to the modified, removed or newly installed components. Otherwise, the impact to the interfacing systems needs to also be considered, and the classification of the change to type design need also to consider those interfacing systems. 

The following cases should be considered: 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc.  
 
DO-356A 
 

1.
The STC applicant justifies that the system/function is completely isolated from the
aircraft systems within the security perimeter (no dataflow) or only able to receive data from the aircraft systems within the security perimeter (unidirectional dataflow) and cannot interfere with aircraft systems within the security perimeter. The STC applicant should justify that the system/function data-flow constraint characteristics (unidirectional, isolated, ...) is resistant to attack, such as enforced by simple hardware. See also section 2.2.3.
2.
The STC applicant justifies that the change remains outside the security perimeter already certified by the TC holder with unchanged logical and physical interface. Examples include adding connectivity or other passenger systems outside the security perimeter.
3.
If not covered by 1) or 2), e.g., the STC applicant installs or modifies a system/function which is able to send data to the aircraft system, or changes the aircraft systems interfaces (logical or physical), or creates a new access point (e.g.,
new or increased connectivity, new Field Loadable Software (FLS) importation means): a.
On a case-by-case basis, the STC applicant obtains the relevant OEM security
data packages and the STC applicant should provide evidence using an acceptable process compatible with the existing type certification basis (such
as those processes described in ED-202A / DO-326A) that the aircraft security
level is or remains acceptable when embodying the STC change. The STC applicant may make a specific arrangement to obtain the necessary data packages from the OEM, or with the involvement of the OEM, or a third party if necessary.
b.
Without OEM (TC holder) involvement or without OEM data, the STC applicant justifies that the aircraft systems are protected (including from threat propagation) via a security risk assessment to be approved by the relevant airworthiness authority. The security risk assessment should be completed using acceptable processes and methods compatible with the existing type
certification basis (such as those processes in ED-202A / DO-326A).
Additional information for the comparability of risk assessments can be found
in ED-201.
In order to protect the new or modified system to be approved by STC, the STC applicant should carry out a security risk assessment at system level to be approved by the relevant airworthiness authority. The security risk assessment should be completed using acceptable methods compatible with existing aircraft security analysis of the aircraft (such as those methods in ED-203A / DO-356A). If such an aircraft security analysis does not already exist, the appropriate SC or CRI will be applied. Additional information for the comparability of risk assessments can be found in ED-201. The security risk assessment should consider the possible threats from the aircraft systems in addition to the security environment. The STC applicant should show compliance to all SC or CRI requirements, which involves more than a security risk assessment. 

## 2.4 Acceptable Compliance Demonstration Evidence Considerations

Appropriate guidance for compliance demonstration evidence is contained in RTCA / 
EUROCAE documents. This statement is supported by the involvement of OEM, regulators, and suppliers in the development of DO-326A / ED-202A, helping assure that a comprehensive set of compliance demonstration evidence was defined. Compliance demonstration evidence can be in the form of compliance data or substantiation data. 

DO-356A 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc. 

Compliance data is required by the regulatory authorities to show compliance to security regulations. Substantiation data is produced to enhance the required compliance data, and it is only provided at applicant's discretion or upon request by authorities. DO-326A / ED- 202A define the required content for compliance demonstration evidence compliance data, however it does not define specific documents and there are multiple options on how to package this content into certification documents. The data content from DO-326A / ED- 202A Table 4-1 is as follows: 
- 
Aircraft Level 
- 
Plan for Security Aspects of Certification (PSecAC) 

- 
Aircraft Security Scope Definition (ASSD) 
- 
Preliminary Aircraft Security Risk Assessment (PASRA) 
- 
Aircraft Security Risk Assessment (ASRA) 
- 
PSecAC Summary 
- 
Aircraft Security Operator Guidance (ASOG) - dependent on certification project 
- 
Aircraft Security Verification (ASV) - dependent on certification project 
- 
System Level 
- 
PSecAC (tailored to the system) 
- 
System Security Scope Definition (SSSD) 
- 
Preliminary System Security Risk Assessment (PSSRA) 
- 
System Security Risk Assessment (SSRA) 
- 
PSecAC Summary (tailored to the system) 
- 
System Security Operator Guidance (SSOG) - dependent on certification project 
- 
System Security Integrator Guidance (SSIG) - dependent on certification project 
- 
System Security Verification (SSV) - dependent on certification project 
Note:  
If an applicant has to produce aircraft level compliance demonstration 
evidence, the compliance demonstration evidence includes but does not need 
to reproduce the system level compliance demonstration evidence. 
DO-326A / ED-202A Table 4-1 does not list the ASOG, ASV, SSIG, or SSV data contents, therefore their inclusion is dependent on the certification project. For example, the ASOG is only required for compliance demonstration evidence if the system or aircraft change drives a change to operator guidance. Otherwise, the existing ASOG does not need to be updated and is still applicable. There is no requirement to create a separate document for each item from the DO-326A / ED-202A list (i.e. there does not need to be a one-to-one ratio) or to define document structure in RTCA / EUROCAE documents. This list of required content may be grouped or consolidated in any manner deemed appropriate by the applicant. 

## 2.4.1 Certification

Prepared at the beginning of the certification process, the purpose of the Plan for Security Aspects of Certification (PSecAC) is to identify means for demonstrating compliance with airworthiness regulations relative to security concerns. This includes determining the 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
certification data package and ensuring that all the applicable elements of the certification basis are covered in the certification documents. Tying it together at the end of the certification process, the purpose of the Plan for Security Aspects of Certification Summary (PSecAC Summary) is to produce compliance demonstration evidence relative to security concerns. This summary provides or points to evidence on activities which have been performed in compliance with their assigned objective as well as identifies and justifies deviations from the PSecAC. The Figure 2-1 below is Figure 2-1 from DO-326A / ED-202A. It outlines the security risk assessment and security development related activities that occur between the certification related activities of the PSecAC and the PSecAC Summary. The figure below is a generic representation of the process and refers to aircraft and system level architectures.

## 2.5 Considerations For Continued Airworthiness Security

Certification regulations contain requirements for the manufacturer to develop Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA). Manufacturers also provide non-ICA information to operators to support the security of the aircraft electronic systems. Manufacturers support the safe operation of aircraft through Continued Operational Safety (COS) activities. These COS programs involve the on-going monitoring of the safety of the fleet including regulated reporting under 14 CFR 21.3 (and equivalent regulatory requirements such as EASA Part 21.A.3) reporting of failure, malfunctions, and defects. Reports about security attacks which result in system failure or malfunction fall under current COS criteria for reporting requirements for failures, malfunctions and defects that result in an unsafe condition as outlined above. Security attacks are not considered to be DO-356A  
 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc. 

 
improper usage; therefore, they are not exempt from this reporting requirement (In particular even though improper usage may be exempt from reporting, security attacks are not considered to be improper usage.) In addition to the text in this document, DO-355 / ED-204 provide instructions and guidance for the Design Approval Holder (DAH) and operators for aircraft operations to maintain the security of the aircraft. When a system is being developed and provided to an integrator as part of a development program, the airworthiness security process suggests that the system developer should provide security instructions and guidance to the integrator. This should include conditions, limitations and procedures required to install, configure and maintain the provided equipment in secure condition. It should include all system-relevant information necessary for the DAH to develop the security instructions and guidance for the operator (see DO-355 / ED-204). 

Note: 
These considerations apply to TC, ATC, STC, ASTC and certificate changes and TSO/ETSO/CTSO/etc. authorizations and changes and PMA. 

The purpose of Continuing Airworthiness Security is to ensure that the aircraft continues to be protected from IUEI. The main activities of Continuing Airworthiness Security are to provide the instructions and guidance necessary to maintain the security posture of the aircraft as it was defined at the time of certification. 

## 2.5.1 Vulnerability And Threat Management

A security notification is timely information involving the reporting of vulnerabilities, threat intelligence, or changes in the security environment, which can harm or has harmed the airworthiness security protection. Analysis of security notifications may result in identification of a security issue. Security incidents resulting in a unsafe condition are covered by the occurrence reporting rules of 14 CFR 21.3 / 21.A.3. Security notifications can originate from the operators of the DAH equipment, but they can also originate from other operators, aviation organizations, and other industrial sectors, through the discovery of vulnerabilities, threats, or changes in the security environment having common attributes or components with the DAH equipment, such as similar software, transferrable threats, or a general change in operational practices. All design approval holders should: 
- 
Receive reports of changes in the security environment (deviation from security guidance requirements and assumptions) from the operator. 

- 
Receive security notifications of vulnerabilities, threat intelligence, and changes in the security environment (common vulnerabilities, threats, and operations) from an authoritative source such as security response centers. 
- 
Track security notifications to those products which potentially impact the airworthiness due to common use of: 
- 
Re-used or Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) and other externally sourced software parts/components/libraries, 
- 
Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware parts, 
- 
Qualified tools, 
- 
Security environment requirements and assumptions. 
•
Report and investigate security notifications to determine if there are security issues
that require a response, so safety impacts can be properly understood, and security
can be improved in the future.
•
Notify the operator of security issues that impact its operation and distribute updates of parts and security guidance as needed
•
Forward relevant threat information to Regulatory Authorities and security response centers.

## 2.6 Trust Considerations In The Security Environment

A trust relation is a binary relation ("trusted" or "untrusted") about the confidence in the interaction between an external entity and a class of assets. Trustworthiness assumptions are trust relations ("trusted" or "untrusted") about external entities and assets and those assumptions are used to exclude trusted elements from the security risk assessments. Trust relations in the security environment are defined by the assumptions and requirements about the persons, organizations, and external systems that interact with the assets under consideration. Additional threat considerations are required as part of the system architecture analysis to cover any aspects or interactions that are designated as "untrusted". Note: 
If there is ambiguity in whether something is trustworthy, it is recommended to designate it as "untrusted" and then confirm that the resulting security risk is acceptable through the security risk assessment. 

Defining a security environment may include a set of trustworthiness assumptions. Once defined, the security environment should be submitted to the airworthiness authority for agreement. This agreement remains in effect for any further security risk analysis on a dedicated aircraft model, as long as the security environment remains unchanged. The example given here can be considered as an acceptable method for defining a security environment. See section 3.1.3.1 "Validation of Trustworthiness" for further details. 

Trustworthiness assumptions about trusted and untrusted entities may include but are not limited to the following areas: 
•
Physical Access Restrictions
○
Airport Facilities Security Zones

○
Aircraft Security Zones
○
Access to physical ports or equipment

## 2.7 Risk Acceptability 2.7.1 Introduction

Risk acceptability is a key element of risk management, and a framework should be established for regulatory authorities and applicants to negotiate risk acceptability criteria for airworthiness security. Risk acceptability is the ultimate decision gate to be made in the context of the Airworthiness Security Risk Management Framework, identified in DO-326A / ED-202A Figure 2-1. As risks can never be completely avoided, and civil aviation is no exception to this rule, the purpose of this framework is to show the airworthiness authorities that the residual security risks are acceptable according to the criteria in the negotiated basis of certification. As stated in DO-326A / ED-202A section 3.2, the security risk of a threat scenario is defined by: 
- 
Level of threat of the threat scenario, and 

- 
Severity of the effect of the threat condition caused by or contributed to by the threat scenario. 
Consequently, risk acceptance is based on a two-dimensional assessment. One dimension is the severity of the threat condition on the airworthiness of the aircraft, i.e. the impact. The other dimension is the level of threat, which is determined through evaluation of the attack paths through a given architecture, the threat scenarios, and the security measures to mitigate the attacks. 

## 2.7.2 Criteria For Communicating And Accepting Risk

DO-326A / ED-202A defines security risk assessment activities that represent areas of agreement for criteria for communicating risk from the applicant to the airworthiness authority. Table 2-1 identifies these criteria which are described in more detail below. 

| DO-326A / ED-202A Activity                            | Criteria                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Impact Criteria                                       |                          |
| Security Risk Assessment / Threat Condition           |                          |
| Identification and Evaluation                         |                          |
| Security Risk Assessment / Level of Threat Evaluation | Level of Threat Criteria |
| Are security risks acceptable? (Risk Acceptability)   | Risk Acceptance Criteria |

 

## 2.7.2.1 Impact Criteria

Impact criteria define how the severity of security threats to the safety of the aircraft/system will be classified. These criteria are measured for the safety effect caused by Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction in the Airworthiness Security Process as standard safety severity (Catastrophic, Severe/Hazardous, Major, and Minor). 

## 2.7.2.2 Level Of Threat Criteria

Level of threat criteria defines how to evaluate the expectation that the threat will materialize. The term "Level of Threat" is defined in DO-326A / ED-202A as "A qualitative evaluation of the possibility that a Threat Condition might occur." Different organizations and standards have defined different criteria for the level of threat. Recognized criteria include but are not limited to qualitative event likelihood, and effectiveness of protection. A general description of level of threat criteria is found in section 3.6. Various methods may be used to assess a level of threat. Some of them are provided for information in Appendices. 

## 2.7.2.3 Risk Acceptance Criteria

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The association of severity of impact with a level of threat defines two levels of risk, "acceptable" and "not acceptable". The level of risk is the considered risk acceptance criteria. Note:  
Risk acceptability may include conditions to limit the exposure in time according to a negotiated risk treatment plan. 

The level of threat criteria should be associated with the impact criteria showing the acceptable range for the combination of both criteria. 

## 2.7.3 Risk Acceptability Statement

The primary objective of this section is to establish a clear communication of what risks are acceptable. Table 2-2 provides the maximum acceptable level of risk for security related safety risks. The presentation of Table 2-2 is in keeping with the DO-326A / ED-202A 
notion of an airworthiness acceptability matrix, in line with ISO 27005 [47]. The information provided in Table 2-2 shows the boundary of acceptable versus unacceptable security risk in relation to both level of threat and threat condition severity scales. The risk acceptability is established for each threat scenario. The risk acceptability is determined based on threat condition severity and level of threat of a complete end to end threat scenario. Whether assets are in scope of the airworthiness security process is described in section 2.2 and not the subject of this risk acceptability matrix.

For the purposes of this table, the Severity of the Threat Condition Effect values and whether the risk is acceptable pertain to the target system in the security risk assessment, not an access point or system through which the attack can propagate. With reference to the above table, note the following: 
- 
The risk acceptability for threat scenarios with an assessed impact severity of catastrophic (denoted by *), shall include at least two independent, diverse and isolated security measures 
- 
The level of threat reduction is associated with the security assurance for the security 
measures and other elements of the threat scenario 
- 
Acceptable risks do not need additional security measures implemented 
- 
All unacceptable risks need to be treated, for example through the implementation of additional security measures, until the risk is acceptable 
The acceptable means of compliance for demonstrating risk acceptability are found in the relevant chapters of this document. 

## 2.7.4 Regulatory View Of Continued Level Of Threat Protection

As the security environment can change over time, risk assessments performed at any point in time can only provide a statement about the risks at that specific time. The assessment does not provide a statement about development of risks in the future, as this is an impossible exercise for the whole life-cycle of an aircraft fleet of one type. Any risk assessment that is conducted during the lifecycle that results in impacts that would result in unacceptable risk according to Table 2-2 and would result in an unsafe condition, needs to be communicated to the airworthiness authorities in accordance with 14 CFR Part 21.3 / EASA Part 21.A.3A. DO-355 / ED-204 contains guidance for continuing airworthiness. 

## 2.8 Considerations In The Use Of Commercial Off The Shelf (Cots) And Previously Certified Products

This section addresses a range of topics related to, but not necessarily limited to, the use of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) products and previously certified systems in airworthiness security certification. These include the following topics: 
- 
Use of previously certified systems 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc.  
 
DO-356A 
 

- 
Use of commercial hardware parts 
- 
Use of parts without Development Assurance data 

## 2.8.1 Use Of Previously Certified Systems

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Legacy aerospace systems are those that have been subject to type certification and safety assessment with no change to the functionality. They may or may not have been subject to an airworthiness security assessment process. In general, existing considerations for the use of such systems for airworthiness should be applied and the requirement for a change impact analysis should include airworthiness security considerations. Applicants proposing to use legacy systems for airworthiness should determine if there is a security impact based on how the legacy system is integrated and connected to the overall airplane (see section 2.3 for further details). 

In many cases, previously certified systems may have not been subject to a security assessment because they did not involve any external dependencies for which airworthiness security is an issue. Initially, the change in the security scope for the installation should be established and analyzed as part of the change impact analysis of the previously certified system. If the change impact analysis shows security relevance, then the applicant should conduct a preliminary system security risk assessment and other activities, as required by the process in DO-326A / ED-202A chapter 4. All aircraft airworthiness security risks from the use of the previously certified items should be addressed by the architecture, operator's guidance, and external agreements. If the system was previously certified to a particular set of development assurance requirements and the technical security requirements of the previous certification satisfies the requirements of the intended application, that assurance may be used in the assessment. The change impact analysis will determine the difference between environments from the existing development lifecycle and the current development to show retroactive compliance. Modifications to the system will need a change impact analysis to assess the proposed changes as described in DO-326A / ED-202A section 4.2.1. 

In some cases, a system may have been previously certified to an assurance level lower than that required by the intended application, or the security requirements of the previous certification do not satisfy the intended application. In these cases, a change impact analysis should determine what qualities may be extracted from the existing development life cycle data and applied to the current development in order to show compliance. Service history may be used to help demonstrate compliance, but should include a current vulnerability analysis for the item. Note that hostile environments change largely through the addition or augmentation of threats. As a result, use of the service history is limited to providing evidence of effectiveness against the threats that were in place during the service history. Additional security risk assessment analysis should document the threats that were not in place during the service history. Any security vulnerability associated with COTS parts should be mitigated by the overall integration of the COTS parts in the architecture of the system. 

## 2.8.2 Use Of Commercial Hardware Parts

Existing considerations for the use of commercial hardware parts for airworthiness in general should be applied to the use of commercial hardware parts for airworthiness security. Additional consideration should be given that mitigation and isolation of the DO-356A  
 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc. 

 
effects of airworthiness security events can require properties unique to security for isolating failures. Intentionally corrupted parts should be managed similar to counterfeit parts through a comprehensive Electronic Component Management Plan (ECMP). This approach will help to minimize the risk of intentionally corrupted parts. The ECMP should include the implementation of controls in the supply chain and development processes to monitor, control, and protect the integrity of commercial parts. The techniques discussed here have been used successfully over the last several years and should be used to mitigate the security risks associated with commercial hardware items. However, as threats evolve, the methods and techniques should evolve too. They should be flexible enough to allow change. Developers have typically used architectural mitigation on many critical and hazardous systems to protect against a common cause failure. Examples of such mitigation include using similar parts from different manufacturers, dissimilar parts to perform the same function, or adding asynchronous clock mechanisms to further mitigate the common mode or common cause effect. Multiple techniques and mitigation strategies should be used to achieve an acceptable level of protection with the additional consideration that mitigation and isolation of the effects of airworthiness security events can require properties unique to security for isolating failures. Most large developers have the equivalent of an ECMP. This plan identifies each commercial hardware part. It can identify multiple trusted suppliers/sources for the part. It can also specify alternate equivalent parts and their sources should the procurement from the primary sources cease. There are other standards that define the requirements for developing an ECMP. Manufacturers routinely announce changes to their product and errata information via their web pages on the internet. As a result, developers should review product changes and errata in a timely manner. If such information is not publicly available, developers should negotiate access to product and errata information with the manufacturer. 

## 2.8.3 Use Of Parts Without Security Data

Applicants may choose to use software or hardware that does not have the appropriate development assurance data. This includes parts that have lifecycle data determined to be inadequate or do not satisfy the objectives of this document. This guidance is intended to aid in satisfying the objectives of this document when applied to: 
- 
COTS software 

- 
Open Source software 
- 
Systems, software or hardware developed to other guidance 
Guidance for parts developed prior to the existence of this document is provided in section 2.8.1 and guidance for COTS hardware is provided in section 2.8.2. Activities for demonstrating the acceptability of the part includes: 
1. 
The objectives of this document should be satisfied while taking advantage of existing life cycle data that satisfy the objectives of the current application. 
2. 
Security aspects of certification should be based on the threat conditions and security assurance level(s) as determined by the security risk assessment process. Comparison to threat conditions of the previous application will determine areas that may need to be upgraded. 
3.
Security life cycle data from a previous development should be evaluated to ensure
that the security verification process objectives of the security assurance level are satisfied for the current application to the necessary level of rigor and independence.
4.
Reverse engineering may be used to regenerate security life cycle data that is inadequate or missing in satisfying the objectives of this document.
5.
Refutation testing appropriate to the desired application intended use and environment should be performed.
6.
Product service history should be used to support satisfying the objectives of this
document. This should include vulnerability and threat monitoring guidance in section 2.5.1 and, for COTS hardware, an ECMP described in section 2.8.2.
7.
The applicant should specify the strategy for accomplishing compliance with this document in the Plan for Security Aspects of Certification. Justification should be provided for any security assurance objectives that cannot be satisfied.
In some circumstances, necessary design documentation can be insufficient for security as a vendor or developer will not provide design data to protect intellectual property or maintain competitive advantage for proprietary or security sensitive purposes. If this design data cannot be regenerated through reverse engineering and testing (points 4 and 5 above), 
two options are available. 1.
Use of non-airborne security-related development assurance with consideration of existing security product guidance. These should include a.
Use of applicable validated Protection Profiles (e.g. Common Criteria [18]) for standard security products to define requirements, and
b.
The use of published security product configuration guides for installation, administration and user guidance.
An accredited institution should be used to perform validation to the achieved levels agreed with the authorities. 

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

2.
All airworthiness security risks associated with the use of the product are addressed outside of that product. The aircraft or system design should prevent any potential adverse impact of products without development assurance by appropriate measures from the airplane and system elements which are in contact with the product including operator's guidance and external agreements.

## Risk Assessment 3.1 Security Scope

This section discusses the security scope (assets, security perimeter and security environment) of an aircraft or system (a single system or collection of subsystems) as referenced in section 3.1 of DO-326A / ED-202A. Scope analysis may be an iterative process depending at what level the process is started and how deep it reaches, from aircraft, to system, to item; each level has its own security scope and can and should result in different layers of security scope, perimeter, and environments (refer to section 5.3, Figure 5-3). The DO-326A / ED-202A Airworthiness Security Process Specification does not differentiate between process activities related to assets, security perimeter and security environment. To provide more detail than in DO-326A / ED-202A, this document describes steps that can be applied at aircraft and system level. The term "element under analysis" is used as a generalization for aircraft and system and is inclusive of hardware, AEH, and software all of which are within the security scope. Note: 
The term "airborne software" includes Hardware Controlled Software - see glossary. 

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
There are three steps to the security scope definition: The first step is to describe the security scope of the element under analysis and consists of the identification of assets that are its components. For help determining assets for the purpose of this process, refer the guidance in section 2.2 and to the definition of assets in section 1.6. At the aircraft level, interfaces to external systems that exist in the security environment should be identified. These interfaces could include: 
•
Wired interfaces, such as USB, Serial, or Ethernet ports, that connect to PEDs, GSE, EFBs, ground systems for maintenance or test equipment, JTAG

•
RF (Wireless) interfaces, such as radios, HF, UHF, VHF, WiFi, Bluetooth, SATCOM, GSM, ZigBee [58]
•
Data Entry devices, such as keypads, touch screens, displays
•
Mechanical devices, such as switches, levers, buttons that control modes of the equipment under assessment
More considerations are present in section 3.1.1.1. At the system level, identify interfaces to the security environment and other systems that can be reached by or be used to reach the system during an attack. The second step is the specification of the security perimeter of physical assets that are part of the element under analysis. At aircraft level these assets are systems and at system level are subsystems or LRUs. Both activities may be conducted without information on attackers or safety assessment. Needed inputs are the functional architecture and the aircraft/system interface specifications. No expert security knowledge is required to conduct this step. The third step is the creation of the security environment description with all relevant assumptions and elements identified during the asset identification that access the interfaces. List and classify the external entities that may be a threat source if untrusted, the purpose of interaction, and agreements that already exist and assumptions about them. For other supporting organizations who are part of the overall global aeronautical system, such as Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) services, or aeronautical data providers, trust is defined through regulatory means or applicable international standards or negotiated with airworthiness authorities. Figure 3-1 is an example of a security scope. In this figure, the security perimeter is the edges of the box containing the assets and its boundary separates the assets from the security environment. Additional details on these steps are provided in the following subsections. A detailed example of how to define a security scope is found in Appendix D.1. 

Another method that may be used to define the security scope (including security perimeter and environment) is using System-Theoretic Process Analysis for Security (STPA-Sec). The process starts by establishing the Systems Engineering foundation, which defines the essential services and functions of system of interest (e.g. aircraft, electrical system) that require protection. A preliminary functional control structure is created, which delimitates the system boundaries (security perimeter and security environment) to be analyzed. An example method for the security scope definition based on STPA-Sec is further detailed in Appendix G. 

## 3.1.1 Asset Identification

Asset(s) are the logical and physical resources of the aircraft which contribute to the airworthiness of the aircraft, including functions, systems, items, data, interfaces, processes and information. An attack is conducted against the system to gain access to the asset(s) and successful attacks that allow access to the asset(s) can compromise the safety of the aircraft. Assets are addressed in various contexts throughout this document. While some sections apply to all assets in general, other considerations apply only to a specific kind of asset. Not all assets require protection and so need not be within the security scope but any interfaces from those systems should be considered as untrusted attack vectors. See section 2.2 for information on what assets need protection. 

Asset identification is interrelated to the determination of the security perimeter. Asset identification should include a suitable level of detail to facilitate the risk assessment. Considering a development process, which may be based on ED-79A / ARP4754A (see DO-326A / ED-202A Figure 3-4: "Security Activities in ED-79A / ARP4754A Aircraft Development Process Model"), the assets may be identified as outputs of development process activities. These activities will mainly identify function, system and item assets. Item assets may range from an LRU to a binary stream loaded in a Programmable Logic Device. All aircraft and system specifications available at this time should be used as inputs to this activity. Typical output from this activity include: 
•
Asset type and owner

## 3.1.1.1 Asset Identification Considerations

An applicant may use the following considerations to identify potential assets, that is, logical and physical resources of the aircraft or system under analysis. An example survey may include the following questions for elements that have a safety effect: 1.

Does the element under analysis use field-loadable software or reprogrammable hardware (FLS)?

2.
Is the element under analysis configurable by the end user? A configurable system may use a configuration file or a database.
3.
Does the element under analysis use network interfaces to shared media or resources? A networked connection and any resource used to communicate, or store data should be considered.
4.
Does the element under analysis use wired network interfaces to access ground resources?
5.
Does the element under analysis use wireless network interfaces to access ground resources?
6.
Does the element under analysis provide interfaces to removable media and electronic devices like Electronic Flight Bags, external hard disks, CD-ROMs or USB sticks?
7.
Does the element under analysis provide interfaces to Ground Support Equipment?
8.
Does the element under analysis have a communication connection, directly or via other systems, with a system in the list above?
Note: 
These questions may help to identify assets and they may be verified via interviews with the system owner to assure the correct understanding of the question and answer contexts. 

## 3.1.2 Security Perimeter

The security perimeter catalogues the elements of the aircraft or system architecture that have an interface with external systems or persons. These are the elements by which an aircraft or system can be affected or interacted with. Of note are interfaces, software parts, configuration management, and data load processes, and any process which is used to operate or manage a system. External systems and persons are avenues for off-board threats, such as threats from airline business information systems. 

The security perimeter description includes: 
•
Physical interfaces i.e. interfaces that require a physical presence in or near the aircraft, for example Ethernet ports, USB plugs, displays, keyboards,

•
Wireless interfaces, e.g. 802.11, GSM/3G/4G
- 
Logical connections i.e. interfaces that can be used remotely, often without any distance restriction, for example network connections, serial links, application interfaces. Useful details include: 
- 
Network protocols (e.g., IP, ICMP, ARINC664P7, ARINC429) 
- 
Network services (e.g., DNS, webserver, monitoring/logging service, database server, IPSEC client), and 
- 
Information flows (e.g., unidirectional or bidirectional connection, data source/sink or forwarded data, connection endpoints). 
- 
Accessibility Requirements, such as: 
- 
Interface location by domain or zone (e.g., cockpit, cabin, galley, etc.), define organizations, policies and roles 
- 
Interfaces within the aircraft for use by passenger devices, 
- 
Interfaces within the aircraft for use by cabin and flight crew devices, 
- 
Interfaces within the aircraft for use by maintenance and product support devices. 
- 
Interfaces with ground systems, 
- 
Interfaces to other aircraft systems. 
- 
Field-Loadable Software (FLS) including User Modifiable Software (UMS), 
Aeronautical Databases (ADB), Flight Operations Software (FOS), and any Airline Support Data (ASD) are external data that are transmitted through the aircraft dataloading functions from the external interfaces that support maintenance. These external interfaces should be assessed for security and added to the security perimeter and threat identification. 
The amount of detail should be appropriate to the phase of the development. During preliminary design, the security perimeter does not need to specify the protocol or technical design of the external interface (unless they are already known) but needs only to specify the general nature of the interface and the external persons that can contact that part through that interface. Whereas during final integration the protocol or technical design of the external interface should be specified. Typical inputs to this activity include: 
- 
Aircraft and system specifications,  

- 
Previous aircraft and system security perimeter. 
Typical outputs from this activity include: 
- 
Point(s) of entry (logical and physical) to asset, 
- 
Updated security perimeter, 
- 
Possible interactions, and information exchanges with the environment, including listing the types of information exchanged and what it can impact, 
- 
Description of information exchange path through the architecture. 

## 3.1.3 Security Environment And Trust

The security environment describes the assumptions and requirements about the persons, organizations, and external systems outside the security perimeter that interact with the assets under consideration. This includes all the different phases of operation and maintenance applicable to aircraft and system under assessment. 

Note:  
Assumptions are environmental conditions beyond the control of an operational authority. Assumptions should be negotiated with the 
Airworthiness authority or validated. External requirements should be documented in the security guidance documentation, see section 4.1.4. 
External requirements for dependent systems within the control of the operational authority should be propagated as requirements to systems inside the security scope. 
Considerations that may affect the risk assessment are relevant and should be expressed as assumptions in the security environment, including: 
- 
Classification of persons and organizations by their authorization and trust relationships, typically by defining roles. Example: If flight plans prepared by ground personnel are part of a security perimeter, then assumptions about the trustworthiness of the ground personnel role should be 
added to the security environment. 
- 
Classification of the interfaces of the security perimeter by the roles and entities that have access to them.  
- 
Consideration of the potential types of attack that can be applied to an interface of the security perimeter (man-in-the-middle, DoS on WiFi, etc.). 
- 
Classification of threat sources. 
- 
Consideration of any protection outside the aircraft/system that is given in the risk 
assessment. Examples: Security measures within the ground IT networks to which the aircraft 
connects, Airport physical security, access policies such as in air (e.g. avionics bay), on ground in airport environment or on ground in MRO operations 
- 
Consideration of relevant operational and maintenance policies 
Typical inputs to this activity may include all aircraft and system specifications, existing 
security documents, roles and responsibilities. Typical outputs from this activity include: 
- 
Role descriptions of persons, organizations, or external systems that interact with the aircraft; 
- 
A description of expected interactions with aircraft for each role 
- 
List of persons, organizations, or external systems that interface the system 
- 
Assumptions about the roles (references for security environment assumptions are found in Appendix D of ARINC Technical Application Bulletin ABN-035A "Considerations for the Incorporation of Cyber Security in the Development of Industry Standards" [15], and ISO Guide 73:2009 [46]) 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

- 
Responsibilities of the roles, tools, systems and security measures 
- 
External dependencies regarding regulations and national laws Example: Regulations governing physical security for airports  
- 
External agreements (contracts and requirements to embedded system to establish connection with external systems) 
- 
Classification of threat sources (An example classification is found in ARINC 811 
[12], Attachment 3, 3-4.2.1.) 

## 3.1.3.1 Validation Of Trustworthiness

Trust relations in the security environment are defined by the assumptions and requirements about the persons, organizations, and external systems that interact with the assets under consideration, and the practices that assure or validate that the assumptions/requirements are met. Trustworthiness can be viewed as a binary relationship between an external entity and an asset. If the external entity has access to the asset, is the security risk acceptable? If not, then access to the asset should either not be possible, or blocked by effective security measures, or the trust relationships needs to be changed. An entity that is trustworthy is not considered to be a threat source. The trustworthiness assumptions include those assets with which the external entity is intended to be trusted. An external entity can be considered as trusted to interact with assets whose risks were communicated to the entity, and so are part of the external entity's requirements, policies, and procedures, or with assets which they value consistently with the safety effects caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction of the asset on the aircraft. Trust relations include assets which the external entity is instructed/required/assumed to leave untouched and unmodified. In this way, the possibility of unintended access to an asset is included in the trust relationship. For operators, owners, and support organizations, the trust relationship is defined through the security instructions and guidance (see section 4.1.4) or applicable regulations which documents what is required to be able to operate the aircraft or product securely. For other supporting organizations who are part of the overall global Aeronautical System, such as Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) services, or aeronautical data providers, trust is defined through regulatory means or applicable international standards. These organizations should be part of the trustworthiness assumptions negotiated with the regulatory authorities (see section 2.6). For a trusted entity, validation may not be required. 

Passengers, the non-traveling public and their devices are assumed to be untrusted entities for the purpose of airworthiness security risk assessments. 

## 3.1.4 Changes In The Security Environment

The airworthiness security process should reflect changes in security risks due to external evolution of threats, vulnerabilities or attacks as part of life-cycle security risk management. 

The security environment is monitored and updated to capture the changing security environment of an aircraft/system. During development, it is updated as part of the development activities. During operation (see section 2.5), it is updated as part of the continuing airworthiness activities. Updates to the security environment can affect threats and security risks for assets. A reassessment of the threat identification, threat scenarios and security risks should be done if the updated security environment is not yet covered by the existing threats, threat scenarios and security risks. If modified security risks for assets are found to become unacceptable then risk reducing actions should be initiated. Another iteration of all relevant steps of the process has to be conducted until the updated security environment is completely addressed by the airworthiness security process.

## 3.1.5 Considerations On Decomposition Of Assets, Security Perimeter And Environment

Assets, security perimeters, and security environments are determined to the same detail as other related architectural features during development. That is, there are aircraft level assets, system level assets, subsystem level assets, item level assets, and so on, down to the lowest level. See section 5.3 for details on decomposition of assets in a security architecture. 

## 3.2 Risk Assessment Method Framework

The risk assessment method framework involves the four activities discussed in sections 3.3 through 3.6. First, threat conditions are identified and evaluated. Then, threat scenarios are identified. Security measures are characterized and finally the level of threat is evaluated. Examples of how to perform a security risk assessment are found in Appendices D, E, F, G, and H. DO-326A / ED-202A Figure 3-2 is reproduced below to show the relationship between Security risk assessment activities. Note that the numbers in the figure below refer to the sections in this document. 

## 3.2.1 Core Principles For Risk Assessment Methodology

The risk assessment methodology used by the applicant should adhere to the following core principles. These principles are the foundations of the risk assessment methodology presented in DO-356A / ED-203A and allow it to be used as an Acceptable Means of Compliance. 

•
Core Principle #1: Airworthiness security is its own discipline, needing unique expertise, and requires its own analysis techniques and assurance considerations. 

DO-356A 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc. 

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

- 
Core Principle #2: The degree to which the airworthiness security is integrated into the overall system safety and development life-cycle is a variable dependent on program/project and organization factors. 
Rationale: Safety and security are not the same thing, however there is a strong overlap. There can be safety effects caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction, which is the focus of current regulations. Before airplane security was well understood, safety regulations were used for security. Safety and security have their own techniques. The security process is integral to the overall system development, so safety and security processes should be coordinated. Security requirements should be implemented in the design in a way so that safety and security processes are coordinated. This aligns with DO-326A / ED-202A section 2.2.2 
Integration of Security Development Activities in the Development Process and DO-326A 
/ ED-202A Figure 2-4: Security Development as Part of Aircraft Certification Process. 

 
- 
Core Principle #3: Security has methodologies that are evolving and, for this reason, accommodates a considerable range of means (quantitative, qualitative) to measure the risks that are accepted by airworthiness authorities. 

- 
Different numerical scales have been developed to which the security effectiveness and the likelihood of a successful attack are measured. 

- 
Security assurance considerations have been proposed both without-regard-to and also in-conjunction-with safety assurances. 
Rationale: Industry standards are supposed to help the applicant and regulator, not cause tedious rework. There should be flexibility to allow for the applicant's method and expertise. 
- 
Core Principle #4: Airworthiness security evaluation methodology is a work in progress and will continue to evolve. 
Rationale: While revisions to industry standards are anticipated, the methodology should be agnostic 
to changes in technology. Particular assessments may need to be updated for such changes. Also, the methodology should account for changes in the attacker's skill level and changes in the availability of tools. 
- 
Core Principle #5: Similar to the safety assessment, airworthiness security assessment is a systematic evaluation of an aircraft or system architecture, based on the Functional Hazard Assessment and the severity of failure conditions, to identify security needs that will be translated by the security development process into requirements for architecture. 
Rationale: The security risk assessment identifies weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in the architecture without prescribing a solution. The security development activities are responsible for the identification of appropriate security measures to mitigate the risk. This is performed by the definition of security requirements to specify the security measures. Note: 
Security requirements are often analogous to derived requirements since there 
often are no higher-level requirements or aircraft/system security functions to 
be linked to it. "Security functions" can be developed for both safety and business reasons. 

The following are high level recommendations and guidance that will be discussed in detail throughout the document. Note that an applicant's methodology may already be following some or all of these: 
•
Due to the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and ever-changing cybersecurity landscape, the methodology should be process oriented, not a checklist.

•
The methodology should apply security expertise and experience of the applicant stakeholders, e.g. security analyst, AR, DOA. Note:  
Training guidance is out of scope for this document.

•
Ensure the methodology identifies all external interfaces and data flows. These should be analyzed for identification of security risk, and security requirements should be developed to mitigate unacceptable security risk.
•
Likewise, internal interfaces should be analyzed to determine if there is an attack path, and the appropriate requirements should be established to mitigate the unacceptable security risks found in that analysis.
•
Consider using security architecture and developing good use and misuse cases at an appropriate level. This is at the discretion of the applicant.
•
Methodology and particular assessments should be agnostic to changes in technology.

## 3.3 Threat Condition Identification And Effect Evaluation

The purpose of the activity of threat condition identification and evaluation of severity of effects is to generate a list of threat conditions and associate each with an evaluation of the severity of the effects to safety that the threat condition imposes. This activity is performed in coordination with the safety assessment process and intended to be initially conducted on a high level early in the development process, and after the Functional Hazard Assessment has identified failure conditions with their severity. However, the activity should be repeated to identify additional threat conditions whenever architectural changes occur, aircraft/system requirements are added or changed. 

## 3.3.1 Characterization Of Threat Conditions And Their Effects

The effects of an attack on safety is due to the changes in the condition of the assets caused by the attack. These changed conditions of assets are the threat conditions and are classified similarly to those for failure conditions. The effects are those defined in 14 CFR Part 25.1309 and EASA CS 25.1309. Note 1: 
"Threat condition" is analogous to "failure condition" defined in 14 CFR Part 25.1309 and EASA CS 25.1309. However, where "failure conditions" result from unintentional causes (e.g. a part failure), "threat conditions" result from intentional unauthorized electronic interaction. See definitions in the Glossary in section 1.6. 

The severity of effect classifications are Catastrophic, Hazardous, Major, Minor, or No 
Effect as defined in the acceptable means of compliance 25.1309 extended to include the "No Safety Effect" classification. Note 2: 
A threat condition which reduces the effectiveness of a security measure is effectively a reduction in safety margin and has the corresponding severity.

| (ii) Physical distress or excessive workload such               |

| Threat Conditions, which would result in multiple               |
| fatalities, usually with the loss of the aeroplane.             |

 
Each threat condition evaluated as part of the security risk assessment can result from different threat scenarios. Likewise, a security measure can be applied in several threat scenarios to protect against multiple threat conditions. The most severe of the threat 
                                                     
 
 
conditions in the different threat scenarios should determine the security needs for the security measures in these threat scenarios. The effect of a threat condition to an asset is typically categorized in terms of the loss of one or more of the security attributes of integrity, availability, or confidentiality. These attributes should be considered independently and may result in loss of multiple attributes with differing effects. For example, the effect due to loss of availability may be different than loss of confidentiality. Note that there may be justifiable cases to categorize threat conditions in terms of other attributes such as authenticity, non-repudiation, and accountability that may be composed of the typical attributes, but all categorizations should be able to be related to or expressed in terms of the severity of the safety effect. Note that this categorization is only concerned with maintaining a security attribute where loss of that attribute can affect the airworthiness of the aircraft. For example, maintaining confidentiality for other operational aspects such as credit card access may be a desirable outcome from a business standpoint but if the safety of the aircraft is not affected then this process need not consider it. This categorization in terms of loss of security attributes can be useful in developing external assumptions and agreements and in working with other industry standards, which use this categorization to define security requirements. The severity of a threat condition accounts for the effects imposed on the aircraft, flight and occupants in terms of the definitions of effects described in Table 3-1. 

## 3.3.2 Relationship Of Threat Conditions To Failure Conditions

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The security risk assessment is based on judging the severity of attacks on the safety of the aircraft. However, the complexity of an aircraft, or even of a common aircraft system or item, is high enough that it is not a simple task to judge the safety of an aircraft. The standard approach is to classify the final conditions that immediately contribute to the airworthiness of the aircraft, and to classify the severity of the effects of all other events in terms of these top-level conditions. An example is when the severities of the failure of the components of the braking system are determined based on how they contribute to the overall loss of braking function of the aircraft. See ARP4761 for further details. In a safety analysis that considers natural events, failures and defects, a safety hazard occurs through a chain of adverse events and conditions. The effects (on aircraft, crew and occupants) of an adverse event is caused by a failure condition. In the case of a complex system such as an aircraft, there will generally be a top-level failure condition of interest, which is the consequence of one or more aircraft or system failure conditions. This in turn is ultimately composed of some combination of item defects or item failure conditions along with other operational conditions or events. Similarly, an attack on a defense-in-depth architecture (section 5.5) also involves a chain of adverse events and conditions caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction. The effect (on aircraft, crew and occupants) of a successful attack is called a threat condition. Thus, threat conditions may overlap with failure conditions. Any list of threat conditions can start with a list of failure conditions (as shown in Appendix D). Note that the final condition (safety effect of a chain of events) may be identical. In fact, it may not be possible at the time of the event to determine whether a specific event is a failure condition or a threat condition. For this reason, root cause analysis of events in service which could be failure conditions or threat conditions should consider both until one cause is ruled out. 

## 3.3.3 Threat Condition And Severity Effects Evaluation Method

When conducting the activity of identifying threat conditions and evaluating their effects, it is important that all relevant threats are identified. Pre-existing standard lists of threats can be used as a baseline, but they are not a substitute for expert consideration of the threats at the time of the assessment. The inputs to the activity of threat condition identification and severity of threat generally include: 
- 
Functional Hazard Assessment (including failure conditions and their severity) 

- 
Inputs from the initial stage of the security design process: 
- 
Security Environment 
- 
Security Perimeter 
- 
Other documents (as appropriate, and when available depending on the 
maturity 
of 
the 
aircraft/system 
implementation) 
e.g. 
Preliminary 
Aircraft/System Safety Assessment, Common Cause Analysis, FMEA 
- 
Standard list of threats relevant to the specific environment under assessment (as an aid) 
- 
Outputs of the aircraft/system design phase 
- 
Aircraft/system architecture (both initial and during development) 
- 
Aircraft/system requirements (both initial and during development) 
The analysis itself involves using the input information and generally comprises the following activities: 
- 
Identify a threat condition by considering the total or partial loss of a security attribute (see Step 1, Step 2a and Step 2b) 
- 
Determine the effects that a threat condition has on aircraft, flight crew and occupants 
(see Step 3) 
- 
Determine the severity of the threat condition effects, maintaining consistency between aircraft, system, and item levels (see Step 4) 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The following steps are an example sequence for deriving threat conditions for each function of an aircraft/system being considered. Step 1: Identify those threat conditions that are based on failure conditions of the assets that can be caused by a total or partial loss of security attributes to an asset. Threat conditions are based on failure conditions when an attack path exists from outside the security perimeter to the asset in question. Step 2a: Identify additional threat conditions from a consideration of total or partial loss of security attributes to an asset by determining the effects of known or obvious attacks. Step 2b: Identify additional threat conditions from a consideration of total or partial loss of security attributes due to vulnerabilities inherent in the dataflow and interfaces involving an asset. Consider all assets with data flows or interfaces, physical or logical, to entities that are in a different security domain. Each such dataflow represents an inherent vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker. Note that all network layers should be considered in this analysis. For example, a TCP/IP stack is exposed to network packets even if there are no applications accepting connections. Remember that non-critical functions can use OS layers to manage different functions. These layers are also exposed and are often based on Operating System modules (especially network stacks, file or memory management and threads or process management). 

Step 3: For all threat conditions identified, identify the specific effect on aircraft, flight crew or occupants, and the flight phases in which the effects occur. Note that the effects can be different between aircraft, flight crew or occupants, which affects the severity of the threat condition effects. For example, a threat condition that can affect passengers but not flight crew may have a lower severity of the effects than a threat condition that has an effect on flight crew. Step 4: Determine the severity of each threat condition effect. This determination should be consistent with the different levels (e.g. aircraft, system, item) of the security risk assessment. The steps above imply an ordering whereby the threat conditions on all potentially affected assets are identified first, then effects determined, and only subsequently are severities determined. However, this is just an example that breaks down the elements of the analysis activity into steps. In reality the analysis is more flexible in that there is no specific ordering to the activities. The analysis may iterate several times on threat condition identification, the severity may be determined as each threat condition is identified, the analysis may consider all assets affected by one threat condition or may consider all threat conditions affecting a single asset at a time, and a final review can revise the severity of one or more threat conditions after a more complete understanding emerges. Moreover, some of the steps may be omitted entirely, and only performed after a more complete understanding of the security environment is achieved. Figure 3-3 depicts one possible way that the analysis can be performed when working one asset at a time. 

 

The output of the activity is a list of identified threat conditions, where the following information may be included for each: 
- 
A unique identification for each threat condition 
- 
The asset(s) associated 
- 
The security attribute(s) that are totally or partially lost 
- 
A description of the threat condition 
- 
The flight phase(s) / exposure time in which the threat condition may occur 
- 
The nature of the effect of the threat condition on aircraft, flight crew, cabin crew, occupant 
•
The severity classification
•
Identification of a corresponding failure condition (applicable for a threat condition evaluated from an assessed failure condition)
Appendix E.3 illustrates an example of a template for capturing the required information of threat condition evaluation. 

## 3.4 Threat Scenario Identification

This section discusses the identification of threat scenarios as referenced in section 3.2.2 of DO-326A / ED-202A. Airworthiness Security Risk Assessment is organized per the threat scenarios, each of which classifies the pertinent information about potential successful attacks. A complete listing of threat scenarios is intended to provide a known list of potential attack paths for which assessment can be made and mitigations performed as needed. Each threat condition being evaluated as part of the security risk assessment can result from different threat scenarios. 

## 3.4.1 Threat Scenario Structure

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

The structure of a threat scenario contains multiple elements (see Figure 3-4): 
•
Threat sources: a list of threat sources (attacker and attack vector selected from the security environment) that may perform such a threat scenario 
○
Attacker; whether human or automated (bots, worms, etc.) and
•
Attack Path: a path, interface and actions used to reach the target, including the target
itself, and including the assets of the preventive/deterrent security measures that have been by-passed or tampered to get through the attack path
○
Vulnerabilities that allow an attack to succeed with the result of a threat condition
•
Security measures: a list of the security measures that could mitigate or prevent the attack at each stage of the attack path
•
Threat condition: threat condition triggered by the threat scenario
Note:  
An asset may appear in multiple threat scenarios, either as part of an 
intermediate stage or as the final target. 
Multiple threat scenarios, each with a different attack path, could result in the same threat condition such as illustrated in Figure 3-5 and Figure 3-6. In these cases, the attack paths may have some assets in common or may not, except for the target asset, which is common to all attack paths for a threat condition. 

## 3.4.1.1 Threat Sources And Threat Catalog Considerations

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
One means of generating threat scenarios is through reference to a threat catalog which documents potential threat sources and methods of attack. Threat catalogs change as the security environment changes, so it is important to use threat catalogs from a source which actively maintains and updates its threat catalog. Additionally, see ARINC 811 [12], Attachment 3, 3-4.2.1 for more information on developing a catalog of threats. 

However, a catalog of threat scenarios that requires updates to remain valid raises additional issues related to catalog-driven changes to aircraft in service for purposes of continuing airworthiness. This continuing airworthiness issue is not addressed for this method in this document. While threat catalogs can be used to generate threat scenarios, they are not a substitute for expert consideration of the threats at the time of assessment. Examples include attacks on the LRU interfaces, man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, spoofing and introduction of coherently corrupted messages, and other tampering attacks. In addition to attacks on LRU interfaces, other threats should be considered likely during product development lifecycle or during product delivery process such as COTS malware or specific malware intentionally or unintentionally added to the product. 

## 3.4.1.2 Attack Path Considerations

Attack paths are used to describe the possible ways that an attacker might attempt to attack a target. An attack path includes the relevant elements at and inside the security perimeter that an attacker will face while conducting the attack. The attack path description is not limited to security measures, intermediate assets and targets, but these should be included because they will influence the level of threat. Multiple attack paths may be combined in a single threat scenario if the targets are similar or identical. 

## 3.4.1.3 Considerations Of Inherent Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities occur in many forms:  
- 
Design flaws,  
- 
Implementation errors,  
- 
Configuration issues, or  
- 
Exposed system functions. 
In each of these cases it is when a vulnerability becomes accessible to an attacker and provides access to an asset (is part of a threat scenario) that risk is elevated. The first three forms of a vulnerability are typical. They result from common errors and are mitigated through enhancements to the design and development processes which enable the designer to identify and remove the defects. The last form of vulnerability is called an inherent vulnerability. Inherent vulnerabilities are characterized by intended system function which is accessible (or has become accessible) in a threat scenario. In these cases, the function is required to be present and intended to be utilized by trusted personnel or in a specific manner. Inherent vulnerabilities exist when an interface provides functions intended for access by authorized entities (people or systems), but which can be misused to cause harm. It is impossible to provide a function with the necessary authority to accomplish something potentially harmful and at the same time prevent all harm from its misuse. Rather, the entity that interacts with such a function is depended on (or "trusted") not to misuse the function. Functions with such dependencies on external systems or people possess inherent vulnerabilities in that the dependency on the external entity is inherent in the design. At the same time, it is explicit, and intended, in the design. 

## 3.4.1.4 Threat Scenario Structure And Detail

Threat Scenario structure and degree of detail is largely left to the applicant. However, the structure and degree of detail of the threat scenarios can have a significant impact on the downstream development processes and the eventual level of threat evaluation and risk acceptability. As an objective of threat scenario development, the specific security protections that prevent specific threat scenarios can be used to generate traceable security requirements (including functional, architectural and assurance requirements). These requirements (also subject to validation/completeness and correctness and refutation) spawn verifications in accordance with the assigned assurance level. These verifications are traceable back to the original requirements which in turn relate back to originating threat scenarios. The advantage is that the entire downstream development process is now traceable to the assertions and assumptions made in the threat scenarios and risk assessment. This has the advantage of reducing ambiguity in the level of threat evaluation. The security requirements are closely connected to the threat scenarios that it has to protect against. The threat scenarios show the attacks that are handled by the security measure itself, so may be allocated to the functional requirements for the security measure, depending on the type of the security measure. For example, a technical measure may have functional system/subsystem/item requirements allocated while an organizational measure has security guidance. Interactions that were not considered in the threat scenarios may be prevented by placement of the assets in the security architecture so that protection and separation requirements are imposed and by allocation of security requirements and assurance actions to prevent unintended function. Chapter 5 provides more detail about security architectures. There are probably as many ways to view the various threat scenarios involving a firewall as there are engineers, but consider the following example breakdown of individually considered threat scenarios: 
•
Attacker reconfigures the firewall configuration

•
Attacker attempts to bypass and tamper with firewall
•
Attacker uses services allowed by the firewall to attack
•
Attacker attacks the firewall software directly seeking vulnerabilities
•
Attacker attacks using known attacks not related to firewall functionality
Notice that the threat scenarios are not developed based on attack vector, although that does play a role. Neither are they developed by asset, although the asset is also important. In the above example they are developed in order to reduce the ambiguity in analyzing the scenarios. By constructing the threat scenarios properly, the level of threat evaluation effort can be reduced into something less ambiguous and more deterministic. 

## 3.4.2 Threat Scenario Consistency And Completeness

To ensure that all risks identified at aircraft level are covered, it has to be ensured that threat scenarios from one development level are linked to threat scenarios from the level above. For example, all threat scenarios in a system level risk assessment should be linked to threat scenarios in the aircraft level risk assessment. Note: 
Threat scenarios on different levels are not expected to be equivalent. Typically there will be a one-to-many relationship, because a parent level threat scenario will cover the same threats as several lower level threat scenarios. 
If a threat scenario is newly introduced at a specific development level and cannot be linked to a parent threat scenario, a new threat scenario is created in the parent levels so the risk at aircraft level is clearly identified. 

New threat scenarios might appear at a specific development level (e.g. TS 2.1.1 in the case of Figure 3-7 above) due to the following reasons: 
•
Allocation of functions to platforms (shared resources) might uncover new ways of attacking them. Example:  
Function A has a wireless interface. Functionally speaking, threats are identified from this wireless interface against function A. At a different development level, decision is made to allocate function B to the 
platform where function A is hosted. Because of this decision, function B is also potentially reachable via wireless (although not functionally specified). A new threat scenario is then created from wireless interface against function B (through a compromised function A). 

•
Implementation decisions: The specific implementation of the functions might also introduce new ways of attacking them. Example:  
Function A is supposed to forward passenger private information to a crew device. An implementation decision is made to store the information in a temporary file to be able to retransmit the information if a communication error occurs. Because of this decision, the storage device hosting the file becomes a new target and therefore new threat scenarios might need to be created. 
In addition, it should be ensured that all applicable threat scenarios from a parent level risk 
assessment have been considered in the lower level risk assessments. Threat scenarios from the parent level are applicable if they affect the assets in scope of the lower level risk assessment. Example:  
Three threat scenarios TS1, TS2 and TS3 have been identified for function A in the aircraft risk assessment. The risk assessment for the system that will implement function A needs to include threat scenarios that cover at least the same threats as TS1, TS2 and TS3. 
An attack path for a specific target can cross multiple systems and/or devices. Risk assessments on a specific level (e.g. system) may identify threat scenarios that cover only parts of the complete attack path. In such cases a threat scenario for the complete attack path should be identified in a parent level risk assessment. Together with the above rules this ensures that the risk is properly considered in all affected systems. 

## 3.5 Security Measure Characterization

This section describes how security measures are characterized during the risk assessment and during the security development activities. Security measure characterization is a continuous process - from first identification of needs for security measures in risk assessment to ensuring correct implementation of the measures during development to providing evidence that security measures have achieved the required effectiveness at the end of development. Security measures are not limited to but include functions designated for security. It is possible for any functions and procedures to be taken into account if their effectiveness in a specific threat scenario can be justified (also see section 3.5.1). Examples of different security measures include security functions, i.e. execution of a firewall, preventative actions without a function, i.e. removal of all applications, services, etc. from an OS/kernel that are not required for airplane operations, implementation rules and coding procedures. All identified security measures need to be characterized to be applicable in a threat scenario. Note: 
Security measures may include organizational requirements or operational instructions to crew (documented in security guidance per DO-326A / ED- 202A) that help prevent attacks. Human factors are not detailed in this version of the document but may be included in a future document. 

The following information is required to be able to perform security risk assessment and elaboration of security requirements: 1.

Known vulnerabilities in the security measures.

2. 
Required effectiveness of the security measures in order to demonstrate acceptable security risk of the threat scenarios. Security measures are characterized by their protection capability against unauthorized interactions. The effectiveness of a security measure is the evaluation of its capabilities against the attack(s) of a specific threat scenario, considering only the threat conditions of this threat scenario. This is established by performing the following steps: 
- 
Establishing effectiveness of the security architecture through validation of the correctness of the security architecture (see section 5.2 "Concepts and Characteristics of Security Architectures"). 
- 
Determining the limitations or vulnerabilities of the security measures and assessing their impact on effectiveness (See section 4.1.2 "Vulnerability 
Identification Objectives"). 
- 
Establish the effectiveness of the security measures by validating the security 
requirements against the environment. 
- 
Establish the effectiveness of the security measures through verification of the security measures within the environment. 
- 
Establishing an appropriate level for effectiveness (See section 4.1.1 "Security 
Risk Assessment Objectives"). 
3. 
Sufficient interface and functional requirements (or reference/summaries to design data) about the security measures and the targets to build the attack paths and threat scenarios, and to allocate design requirements to systems/subsystem/items to conform with the threat scenarios and not introduce new unacceptable threat scenarios. Again, the level of detail (system/subsystem/item) will depend on the current level of development. Section 3.3.3 provides additional information on how this data is used when constructing threat scenarios. Relevant information includes: 
- 
What are the data flows? What security measures block unauthorized data flows? 
- 
When is the security measure applicable? E.g. what targets does it protect? And what threat scenarios does it mitigate? When does it need to be effective? How is it bypassed? 
- 
When is the security measure exposed? E.g. what threat scenarios involve its assets? What are its interfaces and modes? How is it administered/maintained? 
The information gathered to perform security risk assessment and elaboration of security requirements also results in the security measure characteristics, which are summarized in Table 3-2 below.

* Optional information may be included in the risk assessment but is not required for demonstrating compliance. This information may aid the organization in development tasks and program management. The "Security Measure Characterization" activity provides information to the "Threat Scenario Identification" and the "Level of Threat Evaluation" activities. Outputs for the "Threat Scenario Identification" are used to determine whether a security measure exists on an attack path or may apply to a threat scenario. Required information are  
- 
A description of its location in the architecture 

- 
The assets being protected by the security measure 
-

- 
The protection capabilities offered by the security measures 
- 
The dependencies the security measures has for functioning 
Information that may be useful to development and for program management reasons, but 
not mandatory for demonstrating compliance, are:

The attack type coverage provided by the security measure 
Outputs for the "Level of Threat Evaluation" are used to evaluate the dependencies between security measures, their specific and combined effectiveness and their robustness against attacks on the security measures. In addition to the "Threat Scenario Identification" information, security measure characteristics should include:

A description with further details (including available architectural, functional and technical details)
•
Vulnerabilities in security measures that are limitations of security measures and that need to be characterized accordingly against the capabilities
•
The Security Assurance Level (see chapter 4), if already determined (e.g. due to a specific architecture)
The known vulnerabilities within the security measures, including those that do not limit the capabilities of the security measure, may be listed to aid the identification of limitations as well as supporting reuse of security measures in other use cases. The implementation status may be useful for tracking development of the security measures including addressing any found vulnerabilities limiting capabilities. The implementation status is not required at any time for demonstrating compliance. 

## 3.5.1 Security Measure Common Mode Analysis

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Care should be taken to analyze the relation between security measures involved in a threat scenario. Similar to how safety considers common modes between ANDed events - see ED-
79A / ARP4754A Chapter 5.1.4 - the relationship between security measures, and between security measures and non-security functionality or the measure's operating environment, needs to be analyzed to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed and implemented security architecture. The analysis needs to consider the common modes that can result in compromises (bypassing, tampering or other reductions) in the security measure's performance and effectiveness. Within information security, these common modes are typically grouped under the heading of Independence, Diversity and Isolation. The common mode analysis should be performed exhaustively to consider all means that form a common mode for failure of the security measure including resources such as shared power sources, shared memory, shared processing, common languages or language frameworks, physical or logical proximity. The analysis should cover all reasonable means for common modes with justifications for any common modes that exist. The justifications may include considerations such as potential impact on the security attributes of the security measures. This analysis is similar in principle to the approach of ARP4761, Appendix K that provides an exhaustive list of potential common modes for safety, of which some always exist, and rationales provided for acceptance. The common modes may be grouped into the information security headings of Independence, Diversity, and Isolation for ease of assessing combined protection - see section 3.6.3. 

•
Independence A security measure is independent from other security measures if it is able to provide full functionality and effectiveness without inputs or other support from another security measure. A security measure that is independent from other security measures presents an additional barrier to the attacker in the specific threat scenario. A security measure that depends completely on another security measure will not reduce the level of threat for the specific threat scenario. For a security measure that requires shared resources or its environment to operate correctly, the potential vulnerabilities and failures of the shared resources and environment need to be considered in the level of threat evaluation. 

•
Diversity Diversity is the measure of commonality of design and implementation of security measures (or applicable shared resources). Security measures are more diverse if they have less 

functionality, technology and code in common. A security measure that is vulnerable to the same attacks as other security measures has a low diversity.  
- 
Isolation 
Isolation is the existence of physical and/or logical boundaries between security measures that prevent compromise or failures from propagating. For a security measure that requires shared resources or its environment to operate correctly, the potential vulnerabilities and failures of the shared resources and environment need to be considered in the level of threat evaluation. Examples for an exhaustive table of common mode failures can be found in Appendix I.2. This appendix also includes some practical examples to illustrate the three major groups of common modes and how to use the common mode analysis for assessing when potential common modes may be acceptable. 

## 3.6 Level Of Threat Evaluation

The Level of Threat Evaluation is part of the Security Risk Assessment. In DO-326A / ED- 202A process figure 3.2, every security risk assessment (preliminary and final) consists of four activities: threat condition identification/evaluation, threat scenario identification, security measure characterization and level of threat evaluation. As the required minimum, the applicant needs to evaluate threat scenarios and provide substantiation of the appropriateness of the security measures. The substantiation should consider the following evaluation criteria: protection, exposure reduction and attack attempt; as well as checking the independence, diversity and isolation of measures from each other for actual combined protection. This document contains examples of Level of Threat Evaluation methods that are currently being used to show risk acceptability. The reader should not assume that the methods included in Appendices are the only methods that could be used. Other methods are possible, and equally acceptable as long as they cover the required minimum identified in the previous paragraph and/or are negotiated with and accepted by the airworthiness authority. 

## 3.6.1 Relation Of Effectiveness And Likelihood

Level of Threat is the general concept to describe the evaluation of a threat scenario independent from the specific approaches and perspectives used in the analysis of the threat scenario. The level of threat can be expressed by different approaches and perspectives, including the defender perspective focusing on the robustness of security measures protecting the target and the attacker perspective focusing on ways to attack the target which have the best chance of success. An Effectiveness based approach measures the level of threat by the degree to which the protection succeeds in stopping the attacker. A Likelihood based approach measures the level of threat by the degree to which the protection fails to stop the attacker. 

Hence, effectiveness and likelihood can be interpreted as two perspectives of the same subject. 

## 3.6.2 Evaluation Criteria Considerations

Different methods can be employed to evaluate the level of threat. Each method will apply multiple criteria. The criteria used by the evaluation method to determine the level of threat should be specified in the security plan. 

The level of threat evaluation takes into account the combined protection effect that considers the characterization and evaluation of all security measures in the threat scenario, as detailed in section 3.6.3. 

Note: 
The level of threat evaluation may take into account the time to respond to 
changes in the effectiveness of protection, caused by a change in the security environment, in the aircraft/systems/items or in their vulnerabilities. This consideration is not meant to negotiate the time to respond, but to consider the time in the risk evaluation. Example: A security measure is based on COTS software for which vulnerabilities are published often. If the development process to change the security measure takes longer than the time until new vulnerabilities are identified, this relation will make it difficult to maintain the security measure effectiveness during operation. One way to account for this in the evaluation would be to consider a reduced security measure 
effectiveness in the risk assessment. 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Level of Threat evaluation criteria can be assigned to one of three categories: 
•
Protection
•
Exposure reduction
•
Attack attempt
Protection criteria are all aspects that provide protection against attack. These consider technical and operational security measures within (and including) the security perimeter. Criteria from this category typically contribute the most to the Level of Threat reduction. Exposure reduction criteria are aspects that may restrict the circumstances and demand more capabilities to perform an attack. These typically consider security measures (operational, technical or management) that exist in the security environment including for example, trust assumptions (see section 3.1.3 "Security Environment and Trust"). Criteria from this category can be outside the control of the applicant and may be more difficult to verify, demonstrate and take credit for. Therefore, the contribution of such exposure reductions to the Level of Threat reduction may be low but should be documented in the Security Integrator/Operator Guidance. Other exposure reductions may be achieved by security measures added within the system security perimeter, such as a switch that limits the possible attack time (e.g. a maintenance mode switch). These may provide a greater reduction to the level of threat and may be easier to verify, demonstrate and take credit for. 

Attack attempt criteria are aspects that may limit which kind of attacks and attackers are considered. If no limits are established, then all credible attacks and attackers should be considered (see section 3.6.2.3 for further details) in the level of threat evaluation (worst case assumption). If the nature of a system (target or security measure) justifies that certain threat source profiles (attacker capabilities, intent or "risk appetite") can be excluded, these criteria influence the evaluation of attempted attacks, rather than executed attacks. 

## 3.6.2.1 Protection Criteria

Protection depends very directly on the Security Architecture and Measures. Like Exposure, it is concerned with control of access, but the access connections are all internal and subject to the design requirements. There are three metrics that can be considered in Protection. Evaluation of level of threat based on Protection criteria can be done by combining the three Protection metrics identified below: 

- 
Security measures and architecture that deny access to assets: the degree to which an asset is open to access from compromised systems 
- 
Access to security measures: the degree to which a security measure prevents access/attack to itself from compromised systems 
- 
Failure of Mechanism: the degree to which the known implementation of a security measure will fail to prevent an attack. 
An evaluation of Failure of Mechanism is primarily an evaluation of technical limitations of the security measure. The full level of threat reduction effect of a security mechanism can only be claimed once the appropriate level of assurance has been achieved. One of the most important cases considers the strength of mechanism of cryptographic measures. Issues such as strength of passwords to cracking or guessing, hash algorithm choice, key length, can in some cases justify a non-binary grading. Other cases where a nonbinary grading can be justified include the performance of incident detection mechanisms, or payload scanners. Such an analysis also needs to consider that an attacker can launch multiple attempts. 

## 3.6.2.2 Exposure Reduction Criteria

Exposure Reduction is closely related to Attack Attempts but is focused on those aspects of the security environment that affect the ability of attackers. These include:  
- 
Conditions under which an external access connection can be used by a user or attacker 
- 
Limits on the functionality of an external access connection 
- 
Organizational policies that control the time-to-feasibility for developing attack tools 
specific to the product 
There are many factors that may limit the exposure: 
- 
Operational modes, such as maintenance mode, or flight mode 
- 
Nature of the electronic interactions, such as data download or GUI interaction 
- 
Organizational policies, procedures, and practices Exposure is about access, the ability to manipulate assets and their attributes. There are several factors involved with defining access and exposure. An important part is any measure that blocks untrusted threat sources from using all or part of the external access connections to manipulate assets and their attributes. 
- 
Access Connection is the logical set of electronic interactions that allow a user or attacker to modify asset attributes, manipulate data, and change the condition of equipment. It may involve multiple intermediaries and multiple network layers. 
- 
Access Conditions are 
- 
The conditions required for an access connection to be enabled. It may include access control policies, authorizations, and authentication mechanisms. 
- 
The functionality enabled by the connection. It includes the range of assets and their attributes that can be manipulated or modified through an access connection, the range of data manipulations, and the degree of control offered by the access connection to change equipment conditions. 
- 
Intended Access are access conditions that are entrusted to authorized classes of users. 
- 
Denied Access are access conditions that are actively denied to unauthorized classes of users by the security measures, where otherwise the access conditions could be exposed to the attackers (unintended access). 

## 3.6.2.3 Attack Attempt Criteria

An attack is a pairing of attacker capability with a product vulnerability, but the focus in this section is on the attacker capability. The capability of attackers is determined by the capability and maturity of their attack tools. There are three categories of maturity of attacks considered here, all classified according to the view of the development program itself. Feasible Attacks are defined as those attacks, tools, and enabling vulnerabilities which have established credibility as potential attacks in the judgment of experts, with enough technical specificity to determine that a system or product is vulnerable and how to protect it. As a result, it can be considered as a specific threat and vulnerability to be evaluated in the Level Of Threat evaluation as part of the Protection criteria (see below). Currently Infeasible Attacks are defined as those attacks, tools, and enabling vulnerabilities which have theoretical justification, but either lack specificity ("it is a computer, it can be hacked") or will require resources or access that are assumed to be beyond the attacker capability in the defined security scope. An example for infeasible attacks would be an attack that requires user interaction against a system that has no interactive functions. The third category is Undiscovered Attacks, which include most Zero-Day vulnerabilities. These are attacks that exist in the field, but are yet not known by the development program to be feasible. However, by definition the development program will be unable to specifically consider these attacks within the Level Of Threat evaluation, but can only respond generically as part of the Protection criteria (see below), or through Vulnerability Management (see section 4.1.2 and B.2.2) seek to discover such attacks. 

While three categories of maturity of attacks are described here, the applicant can categorize attacks according to their understanding of current and anticipated attacker skill level and/or availability of attack tools. There are two metrics to be considered in Attack Attempt: 
- 
Degree of Attempts: The limiting factors on which kind of attacks and attackers will be considered 

- 
Capability of Attempts: The degree of capability that the attacker has to successfully attack 
Attack Attempts may exclude infeasible attacks on assets that have safety effect or which support security measures. The currently infeasible attacks which are expected to become feasible within the time it would take to develop and upgrade the security measures or assets should be considered. An example would be a cryptographic algorithm that is broken in theory but for which no executable attack is known in practice. 

## 3.6.3 Combined Protection Assessment

For an overall assessment of the combined protection effect of two or more security measures, special care needs to be taken so that in the specific case analyzed, effects are not inflated. An assessment ignoring potential "common modes" between security measures may result in an underestimation of risks. The following Figure 3-8 shows how to establish the combined protection effect of related security measures. This considers the security measure characterization in section 3.5, 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
which considers their independence, diversity and isolation, and the effectiveness of protection of each individual security measure, as established using section 3.6. The figure can be used to identify situations where the effectiveness of protection of individual security measures can be: added; the maximum effectiveness of a single security measure taken as the overall effectiveness; the minimum effectiveness of a single security measure taken as the overall effectiveness; or, the rules to apply to determine the combined protection effect need to be given by the level of threat evaluation method being used (identified by 
"Particular assessment with justification"). 

When evaluating the combined protection effect for a threat scenario, the relation of security measures and their effectiveness only under certain circumstances (e.g. specific cases of the general scenario) have to be taken into account. It is invalid to presume that the level of threat can be reduced more than once through what is effectively the same security measure. If two or more security measures are only in effect alternatively (e.g. when different attack paths are possible), they should be evaluated within two separate threat scenarios for level of threat, because the designer/evaluator does not dictate the attack path chosen by an attacker. When independence, diversity or isolation are not asserted, the worst case combination (i.e. full dependence and lack of any diversity and isolation) has to be assumed by default. Only if a valid rationale is provided, a partial applicability of the additional protection effect can be considered. The more security measures are applied to a threat scenario the less the combined protection will typically increase. For threat scenarios with many security measures, the addition of even more security measures may not lead to a noticeable increase of the combined protection. Such a limit to the number of security measures and their total combined protection should be taken into account. 

## 3.6.4 Risk Evaluation

The risk evaluation of a threat scenario is a combination of the evaluated level of threat and the evaluated severity of the threat condition effects for the specific threat scenario. It allows for a statement about the risk for a specific threat scenario as defined in DO-326A / ED-202A section 3.2. The acceptance of the evaluated risk is determined according to the acceptance criteria described in section 2.7. The severity of a threat condition associated to a specific threat scenario provides the severity of the specific threat scenario on a scale of five effect classes as defined in section 3.3.1 (denoted here as "Catastrophic", "Hazardous", "Major", "Minor", "No Safety Effect"). The level of threat is an evaluation of the possibility of a successful attack considering the protection provided by security measure(s) in a specific threat scenario. Different level of threat evaluation methods may express this result in different ways (e.g. using scoring schemes as in the example Level of Threat Evaluation methods in Appendix E and Appendix F). However, in order to correspond to the scale used for risk acceptance in section 2.7.3, a Level of Threat scale is introduced in Table 3-3. Specific Level of Threat Evaluation methods used by applicants should be able to translate their level of threat evaluation into this scale. 

 

Very High High Moderate Low Extremely Low 

Using the severity of effect and the level of threat with Table 2-2, the applicant should determine whether the risk is acceptable. 

## 3.7 Risk Consistency Check

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Both the severity of the threat condition effects and the level of threat should be checked for consistency between different levels of assessment (aircraft, system). The severity of threat conditions on aircraft level needs to be consistent with the severity of threat conditions on system level of assessment. The threat condition consistency check is closely related to the functional breakdown of the assets. The threat conditions of an aircraft level function are related to the threat conditions of the system functions that are allocated to this aircraft function. Therefore, the severity of a system level threat condition cannot be higher than the severity of its corresponding aircraft function threat condition. If an aircraft level function is directly allocated to exactly one system level function, the severity of the system level threat conditions should be the same as the severity of the corresponding aircraft level threat conditions. If a system level function only contributes to an aircraft level function (for example a backup system), its system level threat conditions may have a lower severity than the corresponding aircraft level threat conditions. 

Level of threat consistency issues can occur due to the different development levels and the information details that are known by the time the level of threat evaluation is performed. At aircraft level there is a lack of architecture information, nature of interfaces, etc. Therefore, the level of threat (or the protection effects of security measures) needs to be approximated. The further the asset breakdown is followed to lower development levels; the more information is available to incorporate in the security risk assessment process and therefore a check is performed to ensure that the level of threat and therefore the risk levels are consistent among all the development levels. At each level in the development process, the level of threat is assessed with the available information and corresponding assumptions at that level of development. Since the amount of information increases per decreasing development level, the visibility of the architecture, protocols used, and technology becomes clearer and therefore the level of threat estimation becomes more precise. The level of threat consistency is ensured by checking the consistency of security measures between different levels of development. 

If one zooms in the levels of the pyramid in the search for threat scenarios, one would find the threat scenario tree shown in Figure 3-7 in section 3.4.2. At each level of the development tree, the contribution of all security measures to the level of threat evaluation DO-356A 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc. 

is checked against the corresponding security measures in the level of threat evaluation of the development levels above. The security measure contribution to the parent threat scenario's level of threat evaluation is adjusted with the minimum-security measure contribution to the level of threat evaluation of all the children's threat scenarios. The adjustment is propagated all the way up until aircraft level. Figure 3-10 shows a simple example of such a consistency check where only one system and one security measure is involved in all levels of development. This allows to display the security measures consistency directly by the level of threat values. Typical aircraft level threat scenarios are too complex to visualize here because they involve multiple security measures and systems. Effects such as combined protection of security measures and the relation of security measures on multiple systems would need to be considered. As shown, TS 1.3 is more clear, and the level of threat was revised to high (see red cross mark 'X'). It implies that the trace up needs to be revised (moving from moderate to very high - see red cross mark 'X' in TS 1). 

## 3.8 Risk Assessment For Change Management

Throughout the product lifecycle, different modifications or results from verifications or changes in the security environment (see section 3.1.4) can trigger an update of the risk assessment. The following chapters are not meant to describe the process of change management, but which parts of this method have to be performed depending on the event that occurs. 

## 3.8.1 New Vulnerability In Design

The following circumstance may result in the discovery of new vulnerabilities in the design:  
- 
Environment changes (new attacking techniques new discoveries of design 
vulnerabilities, etc.) make the design vulnerable. 
- 
Actions: the environment changes can cause a decrease in the effectiveness of security measures used for risk mitigation. 
- 
The list of the applicable threat scenarios has to be re-checked. New threat scenarios might have become relevant. 
- 
The impacted security measures have to be reassessed in order to evaluate the new level of threat and identify whether the updated risk 
(vulnerability) is acceptable. 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

- 
Moreover, the environment changes trigger the existence of new threat 
scenarios. In this case the analyst creates new threat scenarios (see section 3.4), evaluates their level of threat and determines whether their 
risk is acceptable. 
- 
In-service security evaluation discovers a vulnerability due to a design flaw: 
- 
Action: trigger the existence of new threat scenarios. 
- 
In this case the analyst creates new threat scenarios (see section 3.4) and, 
possibly, new threat condition and, evaluates their level of threat and 
determines whether their risk is acceptable. 

## 3.8.2 New Vulnerability In A Security Measure

The following circumstance may result in the discovery of new vulnerabilities in the security measures: 
- 
During the product verification or refutation, it is realized that security requirements 
are not correctly implemented. There is a deviation from the security requirement. 
- 
Action: the security requirements deviation has an impact on one or more security measures that are used to mitigate risks. In case it is not possible to correct the implemented security requirement, the characteristics (see section 3.5) of the impacted security measures have to be updated with the deviation 
in mind, in order to evaluate the level of threat of affected threat scenarios and determine whether the updated risk is acceptable according to Table 2-2. 
- 
Public known vulnerability in COTS used by a security measure is reported. 
- 
Action: the vulnerability impacts one or more security measures that are used to mitigate risks. In case it is not possible to correct the implemented security requirement, the characteristics (see section 3.5) of the impacted security measures have to be updated with the vulnerability assessment in mind, in 
order to evaluate the level of threat of affected threat scenarios and determine 
whether the updated risk is acceptable according to Table 2-2. 
- 
In-service security evaluation discovers a finding in a security measure. 
- 
Action: the finding has an impact on one or more security measures that are used to mitigate risks. In case it is not possible to correct the implemented security requirement, the characteristics (see section 3.5) of the impacted security measures have to be updated with the criticality of the finding in mind, 
in order to evaluate the level of threat of affected threat scenarios and determine 
whether the updated risk is acceptable according to Table 2-2. 

## 3.8.3 Architecture / Implementation Change

As the architecture and the implementation change, the functions and therefore the functional product breakdown do not need to be updated. However, the architecture or implementation decisions are modified. Due to the broad events that would fit in this section it is complicated to list and define actions for every single one of them. In this case, the risk assessment process is started from section 3.4 to identify if the change: 
- 
Creates new threat scenarios, or 

- 
Modifies the level of threat by changing the assessment or the applicability of security measures 
- 
Then check for potential impact inconsistencies (see section 3.7). 

## 3.8.4 Functional Change

If there are functional changes, a function already identified in a threat condition evaluation may be modified or a new function created, or an existing function removed. 
- 
Update of a function already existing in an impact analysis: 
- 
The corresponding threat condition evaluation is updated (i.e. the change is reflected in the threat condition evaluation for the specific element of the 
development level). 
- 
The risk assessments of the corresponding threat scenarios are modified according to the new impacts. 
- 
The list of the applicable threat scenarios has to be re-checked. New threat scenarios might have become relevant. 
- 
New function: 
- 
Supported by an existing development level element:  
- 
The security scope need to be updated (see section 3.1) 
- 
The new element is given new impacts  
- 
Identify new threat scenarios for the new asset 
- 
Threat scenarios that already target the element 
- 
The risk assessments of the threat scenarios have to be updated with the new impacts 
- 
Assessment if the new function requires a re-assessment of the effectiveness or applicability of security measures 
- 
Supported by a new development level element: start the process from the impact analysis (see section 3.3). 

## 3.9 Considerations On Comparability Of Risk Assessments

Risks may need to be shared between multiple organizations. But risk sharing is only possible if the underlying risk assessment processes and methods are compatible. If risk sharing is deemed necessary, the following risk assessment inputs should also be established and shared to ensure compatible risk assessments: 
- 
Scope and boundaries: The security scope as described in section 3.1 should be used to identify shared connections, interfaces and information exchanges with partner organizations. While the security scope does not need to be in a standardized format, the relevant parts need to be shared and understood between partner organizations. 
- 
Impact criteria: Severity as defined by existing regulatory material (AMC / AMJ 
25.1309) ensures comparability for threat conditions 
- 
Level of Threat evaluation criteria: The level of threat should be expressed or mapped to a scale consistent with 5 levels of threat as addressed in section 3.6 to ensure comparability of threat scenarios. 
- 
Risk acceptance criteria: This is addressed by section 2.7 of this document. 
Note:  
No separate risk evaluation criteria are needed due to the direct association of risk acceptance criteria to the severity and level of threat. This simplification applies only if the risk management scope is limited to safety consequences where the risk is either acceptable or unacceptable but does not need definition of risk levels. 
Risk assessment outputs that may need to be shared are: 
- 
Scenarios: Threat scenarios as described in section 3.4 
- 
Risks: Evaluated threat scenarios including threat condition evaluation and level of threat evaluation using the criteria established above. 
Note:  
Not all risk assessment outputs need to be shared with partner organizations. Only scenarios and risks that are related to shared connections, interfaces and information exchanges may be relevant for partner organizations. ED-201 describes the common process activities, inputs and outputs that enable the sharing of risk information.

## Security Assurance

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
DO-326A / ED-202A define the requirements for a complete security risk management and development program for aircraft with security requirements. This section is concerned primarily with determining which aircraft, system and item level assurance objectives are needed. Section 3 notes that safety assessment and security risk assessment are concerned with different causal factors in safety effect. These are performed using the aircraft/system requirements, design, and product, with results of impact severity to be expressed in or related to common safety impact severity terms. For most aspects of security, the development assurance actions from integral processes can be used if appropriate considerations relating to the security discipline are addressed as described in this section. 

Security assurance is necessary to assure that security measures perform as intended and that the final product is acceptably free of known and exploitable vulnerabilities, which may be introduced during development. Security assurance is conducted for requirements that address security measures of the aircraft. Security measures are defined by these requirements that result from the security assessment of the aircraft and its systems. The security assessment identifies vulnerabilities in the architecture that have to be mitigated. The security assurance to be performed is similar to that performed in the safety assurance processes with differences resulting from the additional concern for security. In performing the security assessment, intentional unauthorized electronic interaction (IUEI) may point out additional functionality (security measures) and therefore new requirements that are needed to mitigate vulnerabilities and thus mitigate safety effects caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction or credit existing functionality. Aircraft type certification relies on an existing, well-established systems development process used to develop digital systems and equipment. However, this process, described in multiple safety development standards, does not address IUEI. This document describes security assurance objectives, activities and considerations that address IUEI in aircraft systems in the context that recognizes some applicant's desire to augment the existing aircraft system/equipment development processes with IUEI considerations, and also other applicant's desire to address IUEI development with a higher degree of separation from the existing development process standards. Security assurance does not address safety effects not caused by IUEI. Therefore, all security assurance objectives are described in this chapter, even though many of them are stated as part of existing safety development assurance objectives. This complete list allows evaluation against this document alone without reliance on the safety standards. However, it is noted that many applicants may benefit from other published standards or recommended practices such as ED-79A / ARP4754A, DO-178C / ED-12C or DO-254 / 
ED-80, when applicable. Applicants could benefit from (safety) development assurance activities that have been performed, by considering security specific additions or modifications. Development Assurance Augmentation Considerations are provided in the following subsections where this is deemed beneficial. The required assurance of the technical security measure should be compared against the development assurance of the assigned system/item. This will assure awareness to assist in the decision-making of whether new requirements for independence and isolation of the DO-356A 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc. 

security measure from the surrounding system/item would need to be added or whether an increase in security or development assurance activities for the entire system/item might be required. In the event the technical security measure is intended for inclusion in a system/item classified as no safety effect, the hazard associated with the loss or malfunction of the technical security measure should be clearly identified and considered in the aircraft/system safety assessment associated with the initial design or change to type design. The security assurance objectives described in this document are separated into 2 sections. Section 4.1 describes Security Specific Assurances, a name for those assurance objectives that are not related to other development assurance standards. Section 4.2 describes Security Development Assurances which are grouped together because of the likelihood that these assurance objectives overlap significantly with safety process objectives. This document provides no mapping of security assurance objectives to Development Assurance Levels (DAL). However, because threat conditions are expressed in terms of the common five impact severity levels as described in section 3.3.1, appropriate Development Assurance Levels may also be assigned to security measures that protect against threat conditions in order to address the development assurance objectives. Because impact severity is an attribute of the role a system or function plays relative to aircraft safety - the cause of loss or malfunction does not change the severity; therefore, hazards described by the security assessment should also be consistent with the safety assessments. 

The objectives stated in sections 4.1 and 4.2 are the assurance objectives necessary to provide the maximum confidence (that is, at the highest security assurance level) associated with addressing IUEI. Assurance objectives subsets for lesser confidence (i.e. lower security assurance levels) are described in Appendix A. Security assurance levels are defined in section 4.4 and assignment principles specified in section 4.4.1. 

## 4.1 Security Specific Assurance

Security specific assurance is a name for those assurance objectives that are not related to other safety development assurance standards. These objectives address security topics that are not covered by quality, reliability, safety or other development assurance activities. These objectives require new effort for compliance regardless of the integration of security assurance activities with other assurance processes and activities. 

## 4.1.1 Security Risk Assessment Objectives

The purpose of the Security Risk Assessment process is to identify unacceptable security risks (using the security scope and threat conditions/scenarios) according the methodology defined in the security plan and to define requirements for security measures to mitigate them. Security risk assessment objectives aim to identify security issues with safety impacts. All other security issues related to Business and not related to Safety are not part of the airworthiness considerations. The security risk assessment process is expected to be continuous, iterative and closed-loop during the development life-cycle phase. The security risk assessment objectives are: O1.1 
The security scope is established and validated. 

O1.2 
The Threat Condition Identification and Evaluation is complete and validated. 
O1.3 
The Preliminary Aircraft/System Security Risk Assessments and Aircraft/System Security Risk Assessments are performed and consistent with related aircraft/system safety assessments. 
O1.4 
Preliminary Aircraft/System Security Risk Assessment results have been processed to define aircraft/system security architecture and identify the need for security measures. 
O1.5 
Aircraft/System Security Risk Assessment is consistent and complete with respect to security scope, security guidance, security requirements, security verification, 
security refutation and vulnerability identification. 

## 4.1.2 Vulnerability Identification Objectives

The purpose of vulnerability identification is to provide confidence that the product 
(including COTS used for the product) is free of exploitable vulnerabilities that can lead to safety effects caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction. Additional information about vulnerability identification is found in Appendix B.2.2. As vulnerabilities are discovered, they are analyzed for their impact and recorded in the vulnerability dossier. 

The vulnerability identification objectives are: O2.1 
Vulnerabilities in security measures and assets (including COTS) are identified and evaluated for their potential impact on safety. 

Note: 
The situation that a vulnerability may be known as "bug" or defect for a long time before being recognized as a vulnerability should be considered. There are known cases where a vulnerability has been known for years as a defect without realizing the potential attacks. There are also cases where a vulnerability was considered "fixed" (by mitigation or prevention of known attacks) but shown by new attacks to still exist several years later.  
O2.2 
Vulnerabilities are treated according to their evaluation. 

## 4.1.3 Security Refutation Objectives

For the purposes of this section, refutation acts as an independent set of assurance activities beyond analysis and requirements. As an alternative to exhaustive testing, refutation can be used to provide evidence that an unwanted behavior has been precluded to an acceptable level of confidence. Refutation encompasses testing and analysis activities such as security penetration testing, fuzzing, static and dynamic code analysis, formal proofs. Additional information about refutation is found in Appendix B.2.4. Some new problems may be discovered during such testing, and if so, should be evaluated whether they present acceptable risk or not. Refutation tests may be partially replaced by the use of formal methods tools that formally prove some of the intended security properties 

The security refutation objectives are: O3.1 
Refutation analyses are performed to identify new vulnerabilities. 
O3.2 
Refutation tests are performed to evaluate the exposure of vulnerabilities in the security environment and to challenge the vulnerability evaluation. 
O3.3 
Refutation test plans are available. Refutation test results cover refutation test plans 
and performed tests. Refutation test results are analyzed, and discrepancies are justified and traced. 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Note: 

1.
Verification and refutation activities should be performed separately because they follow different concepts. Verification activities are requirements-based while refutation activities need to be performed from an attacker perspective. Separation of
DO-356A 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc. 

verification and refutation test activities - for example by different test personnel - is needed to avoid negative influences between verification and refutation activities. Completely independent test organizations are not required. 

2. The effort to achieve each objective is dependent on the product and its SAL and will 
be negotiated with the Airworthiness Authorities. 

## 4.1.4 Security Deployment Objectives

The purpose of security in operation is to guarantee the secure operation and maintenance of aircraft systems. Security guidance is used to ensure that the aircraft or system is deployed and operated in accordance with the operational requirements. The security deployment objectives are: O4.1 
Security guidance is correct, complete and validated against technical and operational security measures and requirements. 

Note: 

1. The security guidance is identified in section 2.4 and relevant security guidance should 
be listed in the PSecAC. 
2. All security measures which have an operational element, should be covered in the 
security guidance. 

## 4.1.5 Continued Security Effectiveness Objectives

The purpose of continuous security effectiveness is to ensure that security measures remain effective after certification in line with continued airworthiness. It encompasses monitoring of vulnerabilities, management of security incidents, management of changes in the environment and in risk assessment, exchange of information. The continued security effectiveness objectives are: O5.1 
A vulnerability management process is established. 

O5.2 
Security environment monitoring means, including threat monitoring, are established. 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

O5.3 
A security incident response process is established. 
O5.4 
A security risk assessment process for security environment changes is established. 

## 4.2 Security Development Assurance

Security Development Assurance activities apply to each security measure's implementation and are necessary to assure all security measures in the attack path perform as intended. The focus of these assurance activities is to provide confidence in the elimination of "errors having a potential security issue" (i.e. vulnerabilities) that might be introduced during the development processes. This section describes the security assurance objectives that may be met by safety development assurance standard objectives with consideration of the increased threat environment from IUEI. These objectives can be further divided into two categories.  
- 
"Augmented" security development assurance objectives are similar to safety process objectives but have additional security considerations. Even if compliance with similar objectives in a safety development process is achieved, it should be expected that some additional security-specific evidence may need to be established to comply with such objectives. 

- 
"Regular" security development assurance objectives are those that are also satisfied by a safety development process compliant with e.g. ED-79A / ARP4754A, DO-
 
178C / ED-12C, DO-254 / ED-80. Such objectives do not add any security-specific activities, but only address the case that no development assurance is assigned to a security measure from other development processes. If compliance with such objectives in a safety development process (for example based on DO-178C / ED-
12C for software) is achieved with a sufficient assurance level, no additional evidence may need to be established. 

Note that each of the subsections in this section provides a complete list of security development assurance objectives to allow security compliance evaluation without reliance on the safety process standards. Also, for an applicant that has an existing safety process, DEVELOPMENT ASSURANCE AUGMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS are included to summarize how an existing safety process could be augmented to meet the objectives. These considerations are also summarized in Appendix B. The distinction between "augmented" and "regular" security development assurance objectives and security-specific assurance objectives is provided in Appendix A. 

## 4.2.1 Requirements Objectives

The security requirements activities use the output of the security risk assessment to define security functionality by the characterization of security measures. The aircraft/system level security needs are functionally decomposed to the item level in a hierarchical structure. At aircraft/system level, security requirements are those generated by a security risk assessment of the aircraft/system security architecture. Item security requirements activities use the outputs of the system life cycle processes. The aircraft/system level security needs are functionally decomposed to the item level in a hierarchical structure: Aircraft requirements, System requirements, High level requirements at item level, Low level requirements at item level. The requirements objectives are applicable to each level of requirements. Note: 
"Higher level requirements" are with respect to the level of requirements under development. 

Derived requirements are those technical requirements produced by the development processes which (a) are not directly traceable to higher level requirements, and/or (b) specify behavior beyond that specified by the higher-level requirements. Security considerations for derived requirements should address the possibility of introducing additional vulnerabilities through derived requirements. This can be checked by validating the derived requirement against the security risk assessment. The derived requirements that have or may have an impact on the security risk assessments, or security requirements are sent to the airworthiness security process for review and evaluation to determine what is the security impact at a higher level. The complete list of security requirements objectives are: 
O6.1 
Security requirements, security measure interfaces and assumptions are defined. 

Note: 
Security requirements may be handled slightly differently from regular functional requirements. For example, rules for negative expressions 
may not apply, because some security requirements may not be verifiable by test, but refutable by test/demonstration/analysis. It is 
recommended to tag security requirements as such to simplify dedicated tracing of security requirements. 
O6.2 
Security requirements are validated. Assumptions are negotiated with the Authority 
or validated. 
O6.3 
Derived requirements are defined and justified. 
O6.4 
Security requirements comply with higher level requirements. 
O6.5 
Derived requirements are validated against security risk assessments. 
Note: 
Low level requirements are only required for SAL 3 
DEVELOPMENT ASSURANCE AUGMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS: In an existing safety development process at the highest design assurance, the above objectives are satisfied when the security assessment is used to generate security requirements for security measures and derived requirements are compared to the security risk assessment. 

## 4.2.2 Design Objectives

The security design uses the outputs of the security requirements activities to develop needed security architecture and design identified as part of the security measures selected to mitigate the unacceptable security risks. The aircraft/system security architecture (as defined in chapter 5) and design are developed from the aircraft/system security requirements. The item security architecture and design are developed from the item security requirements. The security design process objectives aim at defining interfaces between systems, items and low-level internal functions. The security design objectives are: O7.1 
Security architecture is defined and checked consistent with higher-level security requirements and is designed to prevent bypassing and tampering of security measures. 

O7.2 
Security architecture conforms to security design standards, if any. 
O7.3 
Security measure interfaces are defined and validated. 
DEVELOPMENT ASSURANCE AUGMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS: In an existing safety development process at the highest design assurance, the above objectives are satisfied when the security architecture is included with the aircraft/system architecture and considers a complete implementation of the security requirements to also prevent tamper and bypass of the security measures. The security architecture should also define the interfaces of the security measures and validate them against the expected performance of the security measure. 

## 4.2.3 Implementation Objectives

The objective is to implement the software and hardware from security architecture and security requirements. The set of standards used by an applicant can vary. The use of a relevant set of coding standards used by the applicant to reduce vulnerabilities during the coding phase is a key element of the security process and development of effective security measures and targets. The security implementation objectives are: O8.1 
Source code and/or hardware description complies with security requirements. 

O8.2 
Source code and/or hardware description conforms to security coding standards. 
O8.3 
Source code and/or hardware description complies with item security architecture. 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- DEVELOPMENT ASSURANCE AUGMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS: In an existing safety development process at the highest design assurance, the above objectives are satisfied when security coding standards are included, and the security architecture is included in the safety development process. 

## 4.2.4 Security Verification Objectives

Security verification is performed through security functional verification and security robustness verification. Security functional verification ensures that system hardware and 
© 2018 RTCA, Inc.  
 
DO-356A 
software implementations meet security requirements and function as intended under normal inputs and conditions. Security robustness verification is used to demonstrate that the hardware and software implementations function as intended under abnormal inputs and conditions. The security verification objectives are: O9.1 
Security functional and robustness verification elements are developed, validated and performed. 

O9.2 
Security functional and robustness verification results are complete and correct, and discrepancies are justified and traced. 
O9.3 
Test coverage of software and/or hardware implementation is achieved. 
DEVELOPMENT ASSURANCE AUGMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS: In an existing safety development process at the highest design assurance, the above objectives are satisfied when IUEI is considered in the generation of the development verification activities including test case generation, robustness test generation and development process reviews. 

## 4.2.5 Security Planning Objectives

The purpose of the security planning process is to define the means of achieving security that will satisfy the security requirements and provide the level of confidence that is consistent with the assigned security assurance. The certification process already includes a number of planning data items at the aircraft, system, and item level. These data items should either include the additional security aspects (described in section 4.1) or the applicant should provide additional security related data items that trace to the existing data items. Security assessments, security requirements generation, refutation testing, security standards and other security related processes should be addressed in these data items including their tie to the other development processes. Per DO-326A / ED-202A, the planning data item should discuss how the security process ties into and provides inputs to the overall systems development process. The security planning objectives are: O10.1 Security processes, activities and transition criteria are defined and coordinated with 

other planning processes. 
O10.2 Relevant standards relative to security aspects are established. Note: 
Each applicant is expected to have development standards and justify how these standards will address vulnerabilities depending on development criteria (technologies, programming language, ...). Security coding rules (for SAL3 only) and methods for risk assessment and vulnerability management should be considered at a minimum. 
Security expertise is needed to address these issues just as safety, reliability and other expertise is necessary to the development of the aircraft. The expertise may vary with the level of security necessary for a specific system but needs to be sufficient to perform the security assessment and mitigate vulnerabilities. DEVELOPMENT ASSURANCE AUGMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS: In an existing safety development process at the highest design assurance, the above objectives are satisfied when security aspects are included in development plans and standards.

## 4.2.6 Security Configuration Management Objectives

Configuration management is used to provide a stable and controlled environment for the development process. 

Configuration management in light of security poses only a small additional consideration, that of access control. Dependent on the criticality of the system and/or item, the developmental and SCM systems may need access controls. Configuration items that comprise or contain security measures which form a significant part of the architecture, should maintain access controls to prevent IUEI. Physical access to a building or server may be sufficient for some cases, but access control lists for the server itself are typically necessary. All outputs considered in this chapter 4 can be assigned to one of two configuration management control categories: Control Category 1 (CC1) and Control Category 2 (CC2). Table 4-2 in section 4.3 defines the set of SCM process activities associated with each control category. The complete list of security configuration management objectives are: O11.1 Configuration items are identified, including for security measures, and their 

consistency managed through a baseline. 
O11.2 Authenticity and integrity of airborne software is established. O11.3  The problem reporting, change review and change control process is established 
with problems and changes being evaluated for potential vulnerabilities and security effects. 
O11.4 Access control policy for configuration management is established. Note: 
1. "Airborne software" is used consistent with ARINC standards and includes firmware 
that is managed within hardware parts. See glossary for exact definition. 
2. Objective O11.2 follows from the ARAC ASISP report [6] recommendation 25A. It 
addresses, at a high level, the need for protecting loadable software parts and other aeronautical data from end-to-end, that is from generation through delivery to 
installation on aircraft. 
- 
Protect data parts from intentional corruption during transmission, storage, off-aircraft handling, and on-aircraft handling; 
- 
Confirm that received and stored data parts are uncorrupted in all stages; 
- 
Protect the system and its configuration information from intentional corruption of the data parts during field loading; 
- 
More specifically, developers should: 
- 
Protect data parts from intentional corruption during development, storage, and; 
- 
Protect the system and its configuration information from intentional corruption of the data parts during field loading; 
- 
And operators (e.g. airlines and MROs) should: 
- 
Protect data parts from intentional corruption during generation, processing, transmission, storage, off-aircraft handling, and onaircraft handling; 
- 
Confirm that received data parts are authentic (come from a trusted source) and uncorrupted (not corrupted during transmission from the source). 
This full lifecycle protection extends beyond the scope of this document. Within the scope of this document and specifically this objective, the aspects relevant to a design organization need to be considered: 
- 
Technical or other means included in the products to allow verifying of authenticity and integrity of loadable software parts and other aeronautical data 
- 
Technical or other means of verifying authenticity and integrity included with loadable software parts and other aeronautical data 
- 
Means for transmitting or delivering loadable software parts and other aeronautical data are available 
Out of scope of this document are the aspects in-service: 
- 
Controlling secure transmission, storage, on- and off-aircraft handling of loadable software parts and other aeronautical data 
- 
Verifying loadable software parts and other aeronautical data upon delivery and installation 
Guidance for these aspects may be found in other standards such as ED-76A / DO-200B for aeronautical data, ARINC 835-1 [13] for digital signatures on loadable software parts and DO-355 / ED-204 for information security for design organizations and operators. Future standards and regulatory material may cover other aspects. 

3. The Authenticity and integrity of on-aircraft software may be mitigated by one or more 
centralized aircraft functions instead of, or in addition to, individual system mitigations. 
DEVELOPMENT ASSURANCE AUGMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS: In an existing safety development process at the highest design assurance, the above objectives are satisfied when the configuration management process also includes authenticity, integrity, and access control considerations for all configuration items including security measures. 

## 4.2.7 Security Certification Liaison Objectives

Security certification liaison activities are similar to certification liaison activities from other development assurance standards. Only some security-specific additions or modifications will be needed to comply with the objectives in this section if another development assurance standard is applied. The security certification liaison objectives are: O12.1 PSecAC for compliance is provided and agreed. 

Note: 
The applicant can provide a specific plan for security certification liaison activities or include these activities in an existing plan. 

O12.2 Substantiation evidence is provided. 

As required by DO-326A / ED-202A, section 2.1, the compliance statement (supported by the substantiation evidence) should show that all risks are identified, assessed, mitigated as needed and acceptable. DEVELOPMENT ASSURANCE AUGMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS: In an existing safety development process at the highest design assurance, the above objectives are satisfied when security aspects are included in certification plans and substantiation evidence. 

## 4.2.8 Tool Security Objectives

Tools are to be considered regarding their possible impact: 
- 
Tool whose output is part of the airborne software/airborne electronic hardware and thus could insert a vulnerability 
- 
Relevant tools are the ones that can introduce vulnerabilities on the product under development. 
- 
Such tools are qualified according to the guidance given in ED-215 / DO-330 
or DO-254 / ED-80. When considering the impact of known problems and 
functional limitations of tools as part of the ED-215 / DO-330 objectives, these 
considerations should also include vulnerabilities. Note: 
FAA AC 20-115D / EASA AMC 20-115D drive the applicant's choice to use DO-178C / ED-12C, DO-178B / ED-12B or alternative means 
- 
Tool that is used to detect vulnerabilities 
- 
Such tools may be qualified according to ED-215 / DO-330 TQL-5. 
- 
Relevant tools are the ones that can fail to detect vulnerabilities on the product under development, such as static code analysis. Such tools may be qualified according to ED-215 / DO-330 or DO-254 / ED-80. 
- 
Such tools, scripts and supporting data that are only used within refutation testing to execute attacks are not subject to security tool qualification. 
Note: 
TQL-5 qualification objectives may be satisfied without any tool qualification data from the tool developer, as described in ED-215 / DO-330 section 11.3. 
Any scripts, supporting data and not qualified tools for the attacks and scans that are not 
subject to tool qualification are subject to: 
- 
Configuration control for identification, integrity, traceability, retrieval, retention, and protection from unauthorized change. 
The scripts and supporting data for the attacks and scans are also considered part of the baseline for security environment and well-known vulnerabilities. They are subject to: 
- 
Updating as part of the updated baseline for the security verification and test plan data immediately prior to vulnerability testing, 
- 
Updating as part of the updated baseline for the final security risk assessment data, 
and 
- 
Being passed on as part of the initial baseline for continuing airworthiness security. 
 The security tool management objectives are: O13.1 Vulnerabilities are identified in relevant tools whose output is part of the airborne 

software or airborne electronic hardware and thus could insert a vulnerability. 
O13.2 All relevant tools are identified in the security planning data. The security tool management objectives in this section apply in addition to the objectives of ED-215 / DO-330. 

Note: 
Tools used in the development of COTS software and hardware integrated in the product are out of scope of these objectives. 

DEVELOPMENT ASSURANCE AUGMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS: In an existing safety development process at the highest design assurance, the above objectives are satisfied when vulnerability identification is included in tool management. 

## 4.3 Configuration Management Control Categories

There are two general classes of control categories, the basic category and the more rigorous category. The basic category CC2 is used for verification and validation results, activity records, and problem reports. It protects the integrity and identification of the configuration items, and provides for archiving, retrieval, and data retention. The more rigorous category CC1 is used for all design and implementation data, assessments, certification plans and artifacts, and the configuration index itself. It starts with the basic category and adds tracking of the history of changes of the configuration item along with controls of when changes are allowed, a problem reporting and correction process, and provides for integrity and authenticity when artifacts are duplicated and released.

## 4.4 Security Assurance Levels

The Security Assurance Level (SAL) is a classification for the confidence in the protection and resilience of the aircraft and aircraft systems against attacks. The Security Assurance Level determines the rigor applied to the product and the development process to avoid vulnerabilities and to demonstrate the effectiveness of security measures and the security architecture as evaluated in the security risk assessments. 

A Security Assurance Level is assigned to security measures and assets2 that have been identified in the security scope (see section 3.1) and risk assessment (see section 3.2) process activities. The Security Assurance Level is typically assigned early in the process, after threat conditions, severity levels and security measures have been identified in preliminary security risk assessments. But Security Assurance Levels can also be assigned during the security architecture determination, even if this precedes the risk assessment 
                                                     
 
 
2 Only SAL 0 is assigned to assets that are not security measures activities. 

Although security measures can be aircraft/system functions or hardware/software items, they are often "smaller" components, for example only one software module within a software item. Additionally, a security measure may be a function such as executing a firewall, or it may be a design activity such as removing ports, processes, applications, and services from software, operating system, and/or kernel. Regardless of what the security measure is, its implementation or design activity requires assurance. The security assurance level is assigned to a security measure itself and its dependencies and does not need to be extended to whole partitions, parts, equipment or systems if independence and isolation of the measure from those can be established. (See component in section 5.2). 

Security Assurance Level 
(SAL) 
Definition 
3 
Strongest security assurance for security measures. All security assurance objectives defined in this document are applicable. 
2 
Advanced security assurance for security measures. SAL 2 is similar to SAL3 on security specific assurance objectives, but significantly less demanding on security development assurance objectives. 
1 
Minimum security assurance for security measures. Appropriate for additional protection or hardening/resilience. 
0 
No protective effect. This level is limited to the initial assessment of the protection needs (as detailed in section 2.2) and is applicable for systems and items that have no higher SAL assigned. 

Note: 
Several different numbering schemes for assurance and integrity levels have been defined in other documents, but none of them is specifically addressing assurance of security in a safety context. The numbering scheme in this document is derived from the Common Criteria [18] packaging of assurance objectives into Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL). The numbering is extended with the special case SAL 0 to indicate a "No protective effect" classification similar to the "No Safety Effect" classification in AMC 25.1309. 
 

## 4.4.1 Security Assurance Level Assignment

Security measures are designed to mitigate a cybersecurity exposure or vulnerability. Security measures help to reduce the level of threat. The level of threat is part of the determination of the risk acceptability for a threat scenario, as explained in section 2.7.3. Security measures protect themselves as well as other assets of the aircraft/system from cyber security threats. Therefore, security measures require a level of security assurance that is specific to what they are designed to protect. Security assurance objectives for security measures should ensure that security measure development and operation is commensurate with the anticipated effectiveness required to protect against a defined threat DO-356A

condition. There are further objectives to ensure that security measures remain effective 
over time. The SAL assignment principles for security measures are: 
1. 
Every aircraft-level threat scenario that leads to a threat condition effect with 
Catastrophic severity requires at least two independent, diverse and isolated security measures, with SAL 3 assigned to one security measure and at least SAL 2 assigned to another security measure. 
2. 
Every aircraft-level threat scenario that leads to a threat condition effect with 
Hazardous severity requires SAL 3 assigned to at least one security measure. 
3. 
Every aircraft-level threat scenario that leads to a threat condition effect with Major 
severity requires SAL 2 assigned to at least one security measure. 
4. 
SAL 1 or higher is assigned to every security measure. 
5. 
SAL 0 is assigned to all other systems and items within the security scope. These 
assets are not security measures and do not contribute to the security protection of the aircraft for the purposes of certification. As such, for these assets no other security assurance activities are required for airworthiness security. 
Principles 1, 2 and 3 apply to threat scenarios in aircraft security risk assessments. Security measures in system-level threat scenarios have to contribute to the aircraft-level threat scenarios. There is, however, no obligation to apply principles 1, 2 and 3 within one system unless the complete threat scenario is contained in one system or the aircraft-level threat scenarios are not available. Security Assurance Levels are additive, such that a higher SAL includes all objectives of a lower SAL. Note:  
Specific SAL allocations beyond these principles may be applied depending on the security architecture. 

## 

| Threat Condition Effect Severity    | Minimum Security Assurance    |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Catastrophic                        | SAL 3 + SAL 2                 |
| Hazardous                           | SAL 3                         |
| Major                               | SAL 2                         |
| Minor                               | SAL 0                         |
| No Safety Effect                    | SAL 0                         |

 The concept of SAL is introduced in this document as a means to vary the assurance effort based on security effectiveness alone. But the applicant is free to comply with the objectives of Table A-1 and apply normative section 4.2 Security DEVELOPMENT ASSURANCE AUGMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS (4.2.1-4.2.8) to an existing approved safety development process, at the DAL required by the safety impact severity, as long as the additional applied objectives for each security measure correspond to the required security assurance level per the assignment principles in section 4.4.1. Note:  
A future revision of this document or additional documents may offer a mapping of objectives that are additional or changed for each development assurance level, for example ED-79A / ARP4754A, DO-178C / ED-12C, DO- 254 / ED-80 or otherwise against each SAL. 

## 4.4.2 Security Assurance Level Assignment For Products Already Certified Without Security Requirements

Assets that have been developed prior to cybersecurity regulations may or may not need to be updated for security. Many of the safety design objectives and activities coincide with security considerations and result in architectures that provide a measure of security. For example, the practice of implementing partitions to limit and constrain resources is a practice that is also used by security developers. In many cases a thorough review of the development artifacts of a previously certified system with a DAL can be supplemented with a few additional activities to obtain a SAL. How much is required to be done largely depends on the assessment of the associated threat scenarios and threat conditions that determine the required SAL. Dedicated tailored security demonstrations and evaluations can fulfill SAL objectives compliance. When some SAL objectives are not fully covered, complementary activities may be negotiated to reach the required SAL. It is clear that for legacy systems/items that were developed without security considerations, the security effectiveness and SAL need to be established and not just assumed. For example, assume that there is a system that was previously developed and certified to DAL B. Also, assume that after a thorough review and documented security assessment of the system, it was determined that no additional security measures or items need to be added to the system design. This results in no new design requirements. Then the applicant only needs to supplement that by performing the analysis and testing that is needed to complete the security specific assurance activities in section 4.1, which the safety design assurance process did not cover, such as security penetration and refutation testing. Another example could be that a newly developed connectivity system comes with several security measures developed according to the required SAL. But some threat scenarios rely on legacy elements' contribution to achieve the required protection level. Here a tailored demonstration based on an evaluation of the legacy system for the limited required functionality could be chosen to achieve a best effort assurance of legacy elements. In the end, a combination of strong new security measures and a dedicated tailored demonstration of a few legacy elements provides the required security architecture.

## Development Of Security Architecture And Measures

 The security architecture shows how the aircraft systems and security measures are organized to meet the security needs. It defines architectural elements and their roles, responsibilities, and interrelationships. The elements of the aircraft security architecture organize the systems of the aircraft along with applicable policies and procedures. Likewise, the elements of the system security architecture organize the items of the system along with applicable policies and procedures. A security architecture includes technical features, security policies and procedures, and the interactions between the internal systems, external systems, and users (including crew, maintenance, operators, and air traffic controllers), passengers, if such capability is present, and external organizations who interact with the aircraft networks directly or indirectly. 

Security measures may be composed of systems, items, policies, and procedures. They are defined at each architectural level, so that there may be aircraft level security measures, system level security measures, subsystem level security measures, and so on. Further, the security architecture can take on a defense-in-depth approach to meet the security needs. Assumptions about this chapter include: 
- 
Leave design decisions up to the applicant. 

- 
Though safety is mentioned, the main focus of this chapter is security. 

## 5.1 Purposes Of Architecture

In the Systems Engineering discipline, the purpose of developing an architecture is to enable the construction of large complex systems. Within the Aerospace Safety Process, 
architectures are also important to enable the analysis of large complex systems. Further, the resulting Aircraft Security Architecture and Measures: 
- 
Decompose the aircraft functions necessary to implement the aircraft security measures and to define the systems necessary to implement the system security measures, 
- 
Document the affected interfaces and dependencies between systems, and 
- 
Provide a consistent overall level of protection by allocation of system security requirements according to each system's needs. 

## 5.2 Concepts And Characteristics Of Security Architectures

Computer-based security architectures are often complex. However, when aircraft system designs are developed, the resulting systems should be able to be analyzed to meet safety and security objectives. Development and assessment guidance requires the development of a system which can be shown to satisfy its objectives, as it proceeds through the development process. The basic security architecture concepts, which will be used in this chapter, are: 
- 
Security Architecture: Defines architectural elements, together with their roles, responsibilities and interrelationships, which will implement and support the security measures. 

- 
Security Implementation Architecture: A mapping between the security architecture 
and those requirements of the aircraft/system architecture which are concerned with the concepts and basic methods for satisfying the airworthiness security requirements

and guidelines. The implementation view of the security architecture defines architectural elements, together with their roles, responsibilities, and interrelationships that will support the airworthiness security requirements and guidelines. 

•
System: An item or collection of items arranged to perform a specific function(s) which has a well-defined security environment. A system can be classified as:
○
Multi-System: A system made up of multiple systems and LRUs. A network together with its hosts and gateways would be an example of a big multisystem.
○
Basic-System: A system is a construct or collection of different items that together produce results not obtainable by the items alone.
○
Sub-System: A system that is part of a larger system.
•
Item: A hardware or software element having bounded and well-defined interfaces
(as defined by ED-79A / ARP4754A).
○
Multi-Item: An item that includes more than one item (e.g. a
software/hardware package which includes multiple software/hardware components with potentially differing assurance levels)
○
Component: A hardware or software element that has a different security assurance level assigned than other hardware or software elements of the same item. Different security assurance levels can only be assigned within an item if independence and isolation between components is established. A security
measure implementation cannot have a different security assurance level than its dependencies.
•
Security Barrier: One or multiple combined security measures that functioning together provide a protection against one or several threat scenarios. It is not necessarily limited to one system as another system's security measures might contribute. The security measures that add up to a security barrier are usually dependent with regards to their protection. They need to function all together to be effective.
•
Attack Path Refinement: Activity to refine the generic attack paths (at the macro level) to detailed attack paths (at a lower level). This activity is in each refinement step. Aircraft attack paths are to be refined to (multi-)system attack paths. System
attack paths need to be refined to item attack paths.
The basic characteristics of a sound security architecture are: 
•
Non-bypass: The architecture does not allow its security measures to be bypassed
and the measures will always be invoked when they are intended to be invoked.
•
Protection: The architecture does not allow the security measures or assets to be tampered with.
•
Independence/Diversity/Isolation: The relation between security measures as detailed in section 3.5.1.
•
Detection and Restoration: The architecture provides means for detecting threat conditions and provides, as far as possible, restorative means for establishing (or reestablishing) the correct configuration of the architecture in the event that security measures fail or are defeated. If restoration is not possible, the architecture should be
at least fail-secure, however the dedicated fail secure behavior should not add
unnecessary complexity to the security solution as this might decrease the robustness
of the solution. More importantly, fail secure should not impact airworthiness, i.e. fail safe takes precedence over fail secure. 

See section 3.5 "Security Measure Characterization" for additional information. 

## 5.3 Decomposition Of Assets In A Security Architecture

At the aircraft level, the security perimeter deals with external interfaces and security environment primarily address off-board systems, persons and interactions, while at the lowest levels, the security perimeters and security environments primarily address the interactions between systems and localized effects on systems with internal and external airplane interfaces by which a security threat could be propagated. Note: 
In the following diagrams, data and control flows are intentionally not represented to simplify the information presented. These diagrams do not represent a design or architecture but are only an abstract visualization of the concepts presented in this chapter. 

Assets can contain other assets (called "nested assets" hereafter). A higher-level asset will typically be logically or physically broken down to a number of lower level assets, each with their own or shared lower level security perimeters. See Figure 5-1. 

Security perimeters can contain other security perimeters and/or assets. And multiple assets can share a single common security perimeter, as shown in Figure 5-2. 

A system can simultaneously share a perimeter with the aircraft external perimeter (e.g., a wireless system) and with internal perimeters. The security environment of a nested asset is composed of the security environment of the parent security perimeter and the effects of any security measure within the parent security perimeter. In this definition, the "parent security perimeter" is the security perimeter of the next higher level in the design (i.e. the aircraft level for the system level). See Figure 5-3. 

In the next illustration, Figure 5-4, asset F embodies a security measure (e.g. a firewall) as a protection mechanism for the assets contained in security perimeters 2 and 3 (note the interfaces shown in this figure as dashed lines). During the definition of a security perimeter or security environment, it may occur that the definition of a parent security perimeter or parent security environment is found to be incomplete or lacks detail. In such a case, the parent security scope should be updated to ensure consistency of security scopes in the security architecture. 


## 5.3.1 Considerations On Security Assurance Allocation Within The Aircraft

A defense-in-depth architecture organizes the security measures, so the resulting layered protection is more effective than the individual measures by forcing an attacker to defeat multiple measures in order to reach an aircraft asset. However, there are limits to the degree to which less effective measures can be combined into more effective layered architectures. These may be considered when allocating security assurance levels to individual systems and functions, and to individual subsystems and items within a system. The need for a methodical allocation of assurance levels for security occurs in two different situations, specifically, when considering composition of security assurance hierarchically, or "vertically", from function to function or from item to system to aircraft and "horizontally" for a chain of protection or an attack path security assurance assignment. 

Note that the primary focus of these methods is the relationship of assurance levels among related elements. The specific type of assurance, DAL or SAL is relatively unimportant. However, it is important that all elements under consideration be assured using the same objectives. ED-79A / ARP4754A addresses guidance for full decomposition of DAL and its applicability from aircraft to item. Defense-in-depth is explained in section 5.5. 

## 5.4 Security Architecture Considerations

As the aircraft becomes a larger part of the world-wide information technology (IT) architecture that is facilitated through the Internet, the aircraft gets progressively more interesting as a target or facilitator for cyber-attacks. Focusing on an IT architecture, there are possible attack entry points and protective measures that are implemented to a certain robustness. As one line of defense is normally not sufficient to protect against current and future threats, several lines of defense are utilized to protect high profile targets. The aircraft information security architecture describes how information technology-based systems of certain types are interconnected. Due to the way these systems are interconnected and due to the protection capabilities of each individual system, the aircraft information security architecture is a key element of the overall protection level. The aircraft design should define architecture at each level of the development process. At the aircraft level, a system/multi-system arrangement needs to be found and general characteristics (top level requirements) need to be allocated to each block (system/multisystem). The same is true for systems in a multi-system. 

At the system level, the system architecture is to be developed by defining system parts (i.e. items) and their cooperation. Even at the item level, there are software architectures and virtualization techniques that refer to components that interact with each other. Security design of each system may potentially reduce exposure to some attacks. Each system may participate in reducing the risk of a successful end-to-end attack. The attack path from an entry point to a target should consist of several components that bring certain robustness against potential attacks. This becomes more complex with several targets and when several entry points exist. In a complex architecture, the communication interfaces and the robustness demand for each building block are key to ensure that the risk of any successful attack against the targets is acceptable. When designing an architecture, whether it is a security architecture or for general purposes, the architect and integration team should ask and answer the following questions: 
•
What is the entity being architected?

•
What is the boundary of the entity being architected?
•
What are the elements of the architecture?
•
What are the attributes of the elements to be considered in the architecture?
•
What is the organization of the elements?
•
What are the interconnections between or among the elements of the architecture?
•
What are the dependencies between the elements of the architecture?
•
What are the principles guiding its design and operation?
•
How is the architecture mapped to the implemented system architecture?
•
How do the "-ilities", e.g. reliability, maintainability, etc. fit into the architecture?
Note: 
This is not meant to be a checklist as designing an architecture is a much more intensive process. 

The next section examines threat scenarios for further consideration in the security architecture of an aircraft. 

## 5.5 Threat Scenarios And Defense-In-Depth

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Threat scenarios (described in section 3.4) are an important consideration in a security architecture, especially once the management and administration interfaces are included. Defense-in-depth is important as multiple lines of defense are the preferred means to defend against multiple threats of varying complexity. Single lines can fail and thus independent lines are utilized to be prepared for single failures and to reinforce the robustness when under attack. As attacks can be of numerous types, and to be prepared for unknown attack techniques, different technological concepts are to be used in different layers when defending against threats. Furthermore, bypassing security measures needs to be actively assessed and further security measures might be utilized to make an effective security barrier. 

Defense-in-depth is an approach in which multiple layers of security measures are placed throughout a system's architecture to provide redundancy in the event that a security measure fails. Technical security measures in a defense-in-depth architecture may include, but are not limited to: anti-malware, firewalls, functional partitions, hardened Operating Systems (OS), application jails, encryption, and proprietary security measures. Physical barriers and procedural security can also contribute to the layered defense. Separate technical and/or procedural controls may be utilized in parallel to provide one layer of defense. The key objective is to keep assets secured even in case of a breach of one security measure, relying on other consecutive security measures. A security barrier consists of one or multiple security measures. If a security barrier is used to protect against several attack paths, the contained security measures need to be designed such that they protect against all threat scenarios for all applicable attack paths. Security barriers may be used but are not mandatory to demonstrate protection of the aircraft. Security barriers are a concept to abstract from the complexity and simplify the aircraft level demonstration involving many security measures. Objectives should only apply to security measures not on security barriers to avoid being design prescriptive. Best practices for defense-in-depth include: 
- 
Consider all interfaces through which data is transferred within a system or item as possible stages in an attack path and provide protection at those interfaces.  

- 
Security measures should be independent, diverse, and isolated from one another. 
- 
While physical security is out of scope for this document, the architect should state his/her assumptions about physical security as it relates to the protection against IUEI. Physical security protections are typically considered in the security environment assumptions about trusted zones and access. 

## 5.6 Security Architecture Principles At Aircraft Level

The Security Architecture Principles are a set of principles to support first architectural considerations. They aim to support early architecture definitions to prevent risk assessments from identifying new risks late in the development process. However, the principles are generic and are based on experience and security best practices. Their strict application cannot guarantee that the risk assessment (that assesses each case individually) will assess all risk as being acceptable. The risk assessment is the material for decision making. 

This document defines architecture principles at the aircraft, (multi-) system and item levels addressing aircraft information security needs. The assumption is that aircraft level principles propagate down to the system level, and system level principles propagate down to the item level. This section examines security architecture principles at the aircraft level. 

## 5.6.1 Principle 1 - Defense-In-Depth

Architecture Principle 1: The aircraft security architecture should be based upon layered protection capabilities (defense-in-depth concept). Every aircraft-level threat scenario that leads to a threat condition with Hazardous or higher severity should include at least two independent, diverse and isolated security measures. Rationale: Defense-in-depth, i.e. layered defense, addresses more than one threat scenario and ties them all together. A layered security approach provides robustness against threats. The defense-in-depth architecture should provide the protection that multiple consecutive security measures cannot be defeated by a single attack. Additional Information: Adding on to the defense-in-depth best practices mentioned in section 5.5: 
In a security architecture, consider the impact of the compromise of any one of the assets to include security measures and apply additional security measures to mitigate these if required. To be counted as separate layers of defense, the security measures should employ independence, diversity, and isolation (see section 3.5.1 "Security Measure Common Mode Analysis"), that is, use different technological concepts for the two or more security measures to ensure that attackers need to apply different attack techniques. In other words, the attacker should not be able to defeat two measures with one attack. The rationale is that if two security measures are dependent, non-diverse, and/or nonisolated and the attacker defeats one, then the attacker can easily defeat the other. Focusing specifically on diversity in security measures, such diversity can also be achieved by having some layers managed by a COTS security measure and some with a dedicated proprietary security measure specially developed for the aircraft protection (at least with threat scenarios to "catastrophic threat conditions"). For example, when implementing firewalls, they should be combined with an authentication service (independent), have different filter rules and implementations (diverse), and/or be hosted on different physical devices (isolated). Otherwise, if the attacker defeats one firewall, then the attacker can easily defeat the other. This should not count as two layers of defense, only one. For another example, focusing on security barriers, one barrier can be realized in a Linux system, if it contains several security measures: An iptables firewall (that allows only a very few ports to communicate), authentication (e.g. using SSH) and content filtering (XML grammars or a logic inside the application). As this is all implemented inside one Linux system, there is a certain dependency and maybe there are single vulnerabilities (Linux vulnerability allowing privilege escalation exploitable by an external interface) that allow a bypass of all this. The second barrier can be implemented on a system behind which only very few communication protocols are identified and permitted with each filtered and checked in detail. If this second barrier also contains security measures based on a Linux system, then the same vulnerability could allow breaking through both barriers at once. Even if it is not just one vulnerability, the attackers' expertise can be quite limited. If this second line of defense is implemented in a real-time OS with FPGA as filter components, it can be considered a diverse barrier. 

Security barriers rely on technical security measures and might need to be complemented by operational security measures. 

Based on different impacts and likelihood of threat scenarios, the risk assessment concludes the risk to be acceptable or not (see Table 2-2). Based on that, security barriers / security measures will be proposed to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. This should be anticipated by defining architecture so that security barriers can be established in front of the asset (where possible). 

## 5.6.2 Principle 2 - Integrity Of Connected Equipment

Architecture Principle 2: The production organization, maintenance organization, and operator should have some means to check the integrity of the Loadable Software Airplane Part (LSAP) or data loadable equipment prior to the dataload. Rationale: Ensure basic trust assumptions. Additional Information: The integrity check should consider intentional attacks as well as errors. This can be achieved through technical and/or procedural security measures. If a digital signature is implemented, the supplier of the data loadable equipment should conform to the certificate policy and particularly should ensure that the digital signature private key for data loading is not compromised. 

## 5.6.3 Principle 3 - Continued Airworthiness

Architecture Principle 3: The architecture should support continuing airworthiness and allow for ease of maintainability. Further, OEMs should provide procedures to allow the operator to maintain the aircraft in an airworthy state. Rationale: Support continued airworthiness. 

Additional Information: 
See section 5.9.2. 

## 5.6.4 Principle 4 - Prevent Bypass Of Security Barriers

Architecture Principle 4: The architecture should prevent a bypass of the security barriers. 

Rationale: Ensure that security barriers are effective. Additional Information: The architecture should be developed such that security barriers cannot be bypassed using a dedicated threat attack path. Architecture changes should ensure that they do not introduce any bypass of security measures. For example, prevent the inclusion of software "backdoors", particularly those intended to be used only during development. 

## 5.6.5 Principle 5 - Keep Security Architectures As Simple As Possible

Architecture Principle 5: A simple architecture has fewer interactions and is easier to model which reduces unintended effects. Rationale: The more complex an architecture, the more difficult it is to model and understand all the potential interactions it may have. Any ambiguity can lead to potential security vulnerabilities. Additional Information: Some may assume that if an architecture is more complex, it will be difficult for a potential attacker to understand it enough to launch a successful attack. Unfortunately, an architecture designed this way often results in unforeseen interactions. Since these interactions are not fully understood, they cannot be properly secured from an attack. For this reason, the architecture should be designed to be as simple as possible. This makes it easier to model and test so that unintended interactions can be identified and mitigated to the greatest extent possible. 

## 5.6.6 Principle 6 - Detection And Restoration

Architecture Principle 6: The architecture provides means for detecting threat conditions, and provides, as far as possible, restorative means for establishing (or re-establishing) the correct configuration of the architecture in the event that security measures fail or are defeated. If restoration is not possible, the architecture should be at least fail-secure, however, the dedicated fail secure behavior must not add unnecessary complexity to the security solution as this might decrease the robustness of the solution. More importantly, fail secure should not impact airworthiness, i.e. fail safe takes precedence over fail secure. 

Rationale: This capability would be beneficial in the event that security measures fail or are defeated. 

## 5.7 Security Architecture Principles At (Multi-)System Level

This section examines security architecture principles at the (multi-) system level. 

At the aircraft level, one or more security barriers are defined to prevent attack paths from being exploited. At the system/multi-system level, a security barrier should be decomposed into several security measures. Thus, the (multi-) system architecture should consider the security measures used for achieving the security barrier effectiveness. In this section and its requirements, the term system is used - in case of a multi-system, this requirement applies analogously. 

## 5.7.1 Principle 7 - Attack Path Refinement At System Level

Architecture Principle 7: 
Based on the attack path refinement to be performed for each security barrier, security measures should be defined so that the security measure objectives are allocated to systems. 

Rationale: 
Ensure that security barriers are effective. 

Additional Information: 
Security measures should be defined so that the combinations of the security measures of one security barrier fulfil the required robustness for each threat scenario of the applicable attack path(s). The required strength of security measures is to be defined by the risk assessment. 

## 5.7.2 Principle 8 - Consider Security Process Specifics

Architecture Principle 8: 
When designing the system architecture, the ability to perform security testing and implement fixes should be considered for all systems that embed security measures. The ability to perform security testing should not introduce vulnerabilities or ease the access for an actual attacker. Rationale: 
Ensure that the trade-offs of section 5.9 are taken into consideration during the system architecture phase. Additional Information: See section 5.9. 

## 5.7.3 Principle 9 - Minimize External Interfaces

Architecture Principle 9: 
Systems should be designed with the fewest number of external interfaces possible. Rationale: By reducing the number of external interfaces, a system relies on for its operation, the attack surface available for exploitation is also reduced. Additional Information: A system should be designed with the fewest number of external interfaces required to accomplish its intended function. This minimizes the system's attack surface. Each interface should be controlled to ensure that a system's interaction with another system is as intended. Because of this, minimizing interfaces on a system reduces the security measures required to secure that item from attack. 

## 5.7.4 Principle 10 - Disable All Unused Interfaces

Architecture Principle 10: 
Any interfaces (e.g. ports and protocols) of a system that are not needed to provide the required functionality should be disabled. Rationale: Unused ports and protocols on a system increase the potential attack surface that has to be defended without any benefit to the function of the aircraft. Additional Information: Systems are often produced to meet the needs of multiple implementation scenarios and as such often have more ports or protocols available than are needed by any one implementation. If these unused ports and protocols are left accessible, they increase the available attack surface for an attacker to exploit. Because they are not used by an implementation and provide no function to the aircraft, they also may not be monitored effectively to ensure proper behavior. 

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
For the security of the system, these unused ports and protocols should be disabled to eliminate risks associated with unused functionality. Regarding ports or protocols that are only used on the ground, one should consider disabling such ports or protocol in flight, e.g. by using the Weight on Wheels (WoW) to deactivate services or functions. 

## 5.7.5 Principle 11 - Independence And Isolation

Architecture Principle 11: 
Systems should share resources (software/complex hardware) only with other systems that share the same security attributes (CIA) and security assurance level; otherwise, security measures should be employed to reduce risk between systems of differing security assurance levels. Rationale: If resources are shared between systems that have different security assurance levels, an opportunity exists for a system of a higher security assurance level to be exposed to the vulnerabilities of the lower security assurance level connected system. 

Additional Information: In the case of security measures implemented in no safety effect systems for the purposes of preventing propagation of threats via those no safety effect systems, independence and isolation of the security measure from the no safety effect system functions may be implemented. For further consideration and requirements for independence and isolation of security measures, see section 3.5.1. ED-124 / DO-297 and ARINC 653 [8] describe possible technical methods that may be able to provide independence and isolation for security measures from other aircraft functions. 

## 5.8 Security Architecture At Item Level

This section examines security architecture principles at the item level. Before system development can start, an item architecture is to be developed. This is on the one hand the arrangement of physical components (hardware) and its interfaces, and on the other hand the software architecture (software components and its interfaces). For the physical architecture, decisions with regards to electronic components (e.g. Programmable Logical Devices, power sources, etc.) and their interfaces should be made. For the software aspects, operating systems, middleware, application concepts, virtualization techniques and their interfaces need to be defined. When defining the architecture, an attack path refinement should be performed to ensure that the security measures defined at the system level are adequately represented by the implementation choices. 

## 5.8.1 Principle 12 - Ensure Proper Error Handling

Architecture Principle 12: 
The item's software should account for and properly handle input/output exceptions. Rationale: Exceptions that are not properly handled can result in an item restart or halt in execution. Additional Information: Effort should be made to ensure software is designed to properly handle exceptions caused by out-of-bounds inputs/outputs as well as rate errors. A simple input error, whether that input is from a malicious source or from user error, can result in undesired item behavior. In some cases, the undesired behavior can be a forced restart or halt in execution which may impact safety. 

Many security vulnerabilities result from improper exception handling. When software is properly designed to handle exceptions, it leads to an item that is more secure. 

## 5.8.2 Principle 13 - Least Privilege

Architecture Principle 13: 
Roles and permissions should be assigned at the minimum level required to accomplish the required tasks. Rationale: By implementing least privilege, potential damage that may be caused by errors, accidents or unauthorized access is limited. Additional Information: Wherever possible, items should be designed to allow for different levels of permissions to limit access, i.e. no one item should have access to read, write, edit or execute within the same role. Privileges should be granted based on need and time. Therefore, assigned privileges should be the minimum required to accomplish the functionally assigned tasks only when needed. By implementing this principle, the potential impact of any errors, accidents or unauthorized access to the item is minimized. This leads to a more secure item. 

## 5.8.3 Principle 14 - Control Access To Connections

Architecture Principle 14: 
Connections that are accessible to unauthorized users should be eliminated or they should be access-controlled. Authorized connections should be robust against interference attacks (such as Man-In-The-Middle). 

Rationale: If connections to items are accessible to unauthorized users, one should assume the item can be exploited. Additional Information: Once directly connected, one should assume that an attacker can then take advantage of any trust relationships that item has to others in the system, easing an attacker's propagation through the system. This can potentially magnify the effects of a security vulnerability. All efforts should be made to eliminate or enforce and protect access controls to these connections. 

## 5.9 Security Considerations In Aircraft Development

Information security introduces challenges in the aircraft development and in-service processes. Special precautions need to be applied during the development process, to address security demands. The principles in this document aim to also address these challenges. 

## 5.9.1 Reaction Time

Security measures need to be effective. However, security measures might weaken over time. This can be due to a hardware or software vulnerability of the security measure itself or in an independent object. In this case, a security patch for a security vulnerability should be available very quickly. 

Security assurance levels call for activities that demonstrate that the security patch is mature. Additional testing and documentation to ensure other functionality is not impacted 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
and that new vulnerabilities are not introduced, this might very well delay the implementation of a security patch. Intelligent architectures rely on security measures of both higher and lower assurance levels so that security patches can be applied to security measures with lower assurance levels without losing the end-to-end security level that are ensured by the combination of all security measures. 

## 5.9.2 Security In Service

Security of components does not stop at its end of development. The ability of an attacker to access traditional ground-based IT systems as well as aircraft systems is increasing over time, because new attack techniques are invented, and vulnerabilities become known by the public. What is assumed to be secure today is not necessarily secure tomorrow. This needs to be anticipated during aircraft development and architecture definitions. The security architecture needs to be adaptable to a certain extent. Different security measures with different properties need to be developed so that a vulnerability in one can be compensated by another. This needs to be done in an intelligent manner so that it is applicable for each threat scenario. 

## 5.9.3 Verification, Validation And Refutation Of Security Requirements

Requirements-based engineering defines the requirements a product should comply with. 

Verification of requirements, e.g. by testing ensures the product works as expected. 

Hidden functionality that is not required can pose additional security threats. Firewalls, for example, should block all ports that are not needed. For security requirements, tests need to ensure that no bypass is possible, e.g. for a password check, it needs to be verified that there is no other password that gives access. For other security measures, more sophisticated tests and/or analyses need to be carried out to verify the absence of software vulnerabilities. Most of the vulnerabilities that get published are software vulnerabilities. Even if the architecture and its design are acceptably robust against potential attacks, the implementation might bring in hidden vulnerabilities that are not identified in functional tests. These vulnerabilities often allow for a bypass of security measures, sometimes even security barriers. Traditional functional design and product verification methods are not sufficient to identify these vulnerabilities. Thus, it should be noted that during the development process, security requirements need to be treated with care as a very specific design and product verification process is applied. 

## 5.9.4 Fail Secure Considerations

Fail secure is different from fail safe. Fail secure is the capacity of still being secure even in case of failure. For example, if a firewall fails, it should close the connections instead of opening all of them. The demand of being fail secure can conflict with the demand of being fail safe, especially in cases of emergency operations. The system architecture can help to prevent these conflicts (e.g. if there is a potential security breach, do not shut down a safety critical system while the aircraft is in flight). If a system is designed to be fail secure, the fail secure behavior should not add unnecessary complexity to the security solution as this might decrease the robustness of the solution. More importantly, fail secure should not impact airworthiness, i.e. fail safe takes precedence over fail secure. 

Whereas critical aircraft functions should not be shut down, it may be permissible to shut down commercial communication interfaces when attacks are detected. Thus, failure treatment could affect allocating security measures in the architecture. 

A further design objective for security measures is their behavior in failure cases. A security weakness could occur in failure cases of complete systems or inside the functionality of the security measures. Thus, security failure cases need to be studied and a dedicated behavior needs to be defined. The system architecture can enable certain behaviors and reduce negative impacts of failure behaviors. 

## Security Event Logging 6.1 Security Logging And Notifications

Monitoring of the condition of the security measures is essential to ensuring that aircraft will continue to be secure. Monitoring includes: 
•
Security notifications,

•
Security logging of events.
Security attacks can be complex and frequently attempt to mimic intended functions. When there are positive indications of a possible attack, security logging is required to provide necessary additional information to establish the nature and extent of the attack and its effects. In an office or similar IT environment, the failure of a security measure would result in audit logging of the event. At some future point in time, the audit log would be reviewed, and action taken to repair the failure. During that time, the failure response is usually to disable the security measure capability. In the IT environment, the security of the system is paramount. However, in the aircraft environment, the response is not as simple. Architectures that separate domains of the aircraft such as flight controls from passengers can tolerate this response since they are designed so that passengers have no potential effect on the flight controls. But failures that prevent necessary systems from communicating with other systems, such as navigation and flight controls cannot be as easily accepted. In addition, maintenance messages may help maintenance personnel to determine what actions they should perform to fix abnormal system conditions. 

## 6.1.1 Security Notifications

The design of the system should account for possible failures in security measures and the associated responses. In all cases, the safety of the aircraft should be designed into the system, such that safety is never compromised by a response to an attack. Failures of security measures should not be allowed to impede the communication of important systems, such as navigation and flight controls. Security events that cause a safety effect should alert flight crews in accordance with guidance provided by AC 25.1322-1 and related documents. If a security event or malfunction occur, the flight crew should be alerted to the safety effect and should be made aware of what resources and/or assets remain to maintain the safety of flight. Maintenance messages may be issued when a system fails or when some maintenance action may be necessary, in response to security events. 

## 6.1.2 Security Logging

Security logging is one component of the larger incident management activities which may include other processes, procedures and information to manage security events (See section 2.5 on Continuing Airworthiness). Further, incident management is a sub component of a larger activity to "Maintain Product Security" which may include activities such as technical and procedural change management, vulnerability management and others. 

Security log entries, information, and their interpretation are highly dependent on the design particulars of the aircraft. The DAH should, in the security guidance, define the different types of security log events and entries and their interpretation, to enable operators to periodically audit and analyze the security logs for possible security events and incidents (see section 6.2). The events should cover airworthiness-related event investigations, with the possibility of extending their purpose to include support for maintaining the security of a product during the product's life and for facilitating operational security approval.

For further information, standards, such as ARINC 852 [14] provide guidance on security log contents, data formats and log analysis considerations for aircraft manufacturers, equipment suppliers, and operators. 

## 6.2 Concept Of Operations For Logging And Audit 6.2.1 Goals And Objectives Of Security Event Logging 6.2.1.1 Primary Objective

Even if an aircraft has been demonstrated as airworthy at the time of Type Certification, the Design Approval Holder has to support the safe operation of the aircraft through Continued Operational Safety (COS) activities. For the purpose of Continued Operational Safety, a Design Approval Holder has obligations: 
- 
To support the investigation of, and in some cases report, failures, malfunctions, and defects identified in 14 CFR Part 21.3 / EASA Part 21. A.3A that result or may result in an unsafe condition. 

- 
To make Instruction for Continued Airworthiness (including changes) available to each aircraft, aircraft engine or propeller owner and any other person required by 14 CFR Part 21.50, to comply with those instructions. 
Since intentional unauthorized electronic interactions may be the cause or a factor that result in an unsafe condition on an "e-enabled" aircraft, the DAH should provide means, such as security event logging, to allow forensic analysis or investigation in order to determine whether one or more aircraft systems have been compromised by an intentional unauthorized electronic interaction. Recommendation #1: The primary objective of security event logging is to support unsafe conditions investigations which may be required to comply with 14 CFR Part 21.3 / EASA Part 21. A.3A. Security logs by themselves should not be considered to be an appropriate source of data for determining airworthiness of an aircraft. 

## 6.2.1.2 Additional Objectives 6.2.1.2.1        Maintaining Continuing Airworthiness

In addition to supporting compliance with applicable airworthiness certification requirements, the security logging function is not the only means, but part of an overall and holistic "Maintain Continuing Airworthiness" capability as illustrated by Figure 6-1. Note:  
Maintaining Continuing Airworthiness may be a certification requirement defined in a security-related Special Condition. 
In the frame of this "Maintain Continuing Airworthiness" concept, security event logging can contribute to the secure operation of the aircraft and for updates to the security protections when needed. Recommendation #2: Security event logging supports the secure operation of the aircraft in-service (continued security protection). Recommendation #3: Security event logging is not a preventive security measure but has only a detective effect for forensic analysis. 

## 6.2.1.2.2        Supporting Security Operational Approval

Design of the security event logging by the DAH should consider operational security regulatory material (e.g., FAA AC 119-1) in order to allow and facilitate the operational approval process which is under the operator responsibility (see sections 6.2.3.2 and 6.2.4). 

## 6.2.2 Strategies, Tactics, Policies, And Constraints Affecting The Security Events Logging

Security event logging implementation is architecture dependent and implemented per the specific design of the aircraft. Generally, security event logging is implemented on "eenabled" aircraft certified with a security Special Condition (SC). The means of compliance associated with the Special Condition may require security event logging to be implemented. Conditions for establishment of Special Conditions for Security is given in the FAA policy statement PS-AIR-21.16-02 [41]. The title and a generic description of the security Special Conditions are provided in the FAA "Transport Airplane Issues List" document. This list, together with the current part 25 policy memorandums on Regulatory Guidance Library (RGL), constitutes the Generic Validation Items List for the purposes of transport airplane FAA/EASA/JAA validation programs (ref. FAA Order 8110.52A). Note: 
For systems not required to implement security event logging, an applicant may choose to implement security event logging to support their business needs. 

Recommendation #4: Implementation of security event logging may be required by applicable security airworthiness certification requirements. 

For security event logging required by security airworthiness certification requirements (e.g., security Special Condition), the 14 CFR parts 121, 121/135, 125, and 129 operators, seeking an operational authorization, should comply with the DAH ICA and with operational security regulatory material if any (e.g., FAA AC 119-1 "Airworthiness and Operational authorization of Aircraft Network Security Program (ANSP)"). Recommendation #5: Whenever security event logging is required by an airworthiness certification requirement (e.g., security Special Condition), the operator should manage and process the security log files in accordance with the ICA provided by DAH and with applicable operational security regulatory material (e.g., FAA AC 119-1). 

## 6.2.3 Allocation Of Responsibility Among Stakeholders

Responsibilities for security event logging are allocated between the DAH, the operator (or maintainer or MRO when relevant) and the Regulatory Authorities. The DAH defines and installs the security event logging function in compliance with the applicable airworthiness security regulations (e.g. a Security Special Condition) and applies to the Authority for an airworthiness approval. The DAH provides ICA to the operator. In case of a reportable event or service difficulty reported by the operator (e.g., system failure or malfunction, maintenance message, security event detection, …), the DAH may request security logs from the operator for further investigation. In case of an unsafe condition addressed by 14 CFR Part 21.3 / EASA Part 21. A.3A, the DAH may include the results of the security investigation in the report submitted to the Airworthiness Authority. The operator applies to the Authority for an operational approval in accordance with applicable operational security regulatory material (e.g. FAA AC 119-1). The operator operates and maintains security event logging in accordance with the DAH ICA. In case of a reportable event or service difficulty reported by the operator to the DAH, the operator may have to transmit security logs to the DAH upon request. The Authority grants an airworthiness approval of the security event logging function to the DAH and an operational approval for security event logging to the operator. In the case of an unsafe condition addressed by 14 CFR Part 21.3 / EASA Part 21.A.3A, the Airworthiness Authority may retain the outcome of the security log analysis, if included in the DAH investigations report, for agreement. 

## 6.2.3.1 Dah Responsibilities

The security events to be logged are a DAH responsibility because the DAH is responsible of the design of the aircraft security protections and responsible for the necessary means and instructions to the operator in order to maintain the security of the product and to comply with 14 CFR Part 21.3 / EASA Part 21. A.3A. Note:  
STC and TSO/ETSO/CTSO holders are also the DAH in the context of this section. 

Since they strongly depend on aircraft architectures, the minimum required security data types to be logged cannot be standardized through an international aeronautical standard. However, for easier management and use of common tools by the operators, the format of the security logs can and may be standardized by an international aeronautical standard and therefore, may generally comply with the section 3 of the ARINC 852 [14] standard. Recommendation #6: The Security events to be logged should be defined only by the DAH 
and should be described in the security guidance (ICA and non-ICA) provided by the DAH to the operator. The security events to be logged are dependent on: 
- 
The aircraft architecture. 

- 
The security measures. 
- 
The security risk analysis outcomes. 
Recommendation #7: The format of the security logs may comply with section 3 of the ARINC 852 [14] standard. 

The security guidance about security events logging, transmitted by the DAH to the operator, should give necessary technical information about security log files in accordance with DO-355 / ED-204 section 8.2.2 ("Monitoring and Detection"). 

Recommendation #8: Necessary technical information about security log files and associated tools should be described in the security guidance and should be compliant with DO-355 / ED-204 section 8.2.2 ("Monitoring and Detection"). 

## 6.2.3.2 Operator Responsibilities

For obtaining an operational authorization for an aircraft certified with airworthiness security regulations (e.g., a security Special Condition), the operator may be required to set up an Aircraft Network Security Program (ANSP) or equivalent which considers the security logs if they are generated. This ANSP should comply with the DAH security guidance. Recommendation #9: The operator should comply with the DAH instructions for security logs aspects. Recommendation #10: The operator should define a process for managing and processing the security logs. In addition to the DAH security guidance, the operator may have to comply with operational security regulations which may require additional security activities (e.g., FAA AC 119-1 - section 13). Considerations for management and processing security logs are given in section 6.2.4. 

## 6.2.4 Operational Process

Sections 6 and 7 of ARINC 852 [14] provide guidance which can support the operator and/or DAH in defining the process for managing and processing the security logs.

Objectives This column lists the objectives associated to the process. Scope AC = Aircraft, S = System, I = Item This column defines to which levels of development an objective applies. Example: An objective with "AC, S" applies to Aircraft and System development but not to the "I" item level of development. 

SAL These columns define for which Security Assurance Levels (SAL) an objective is applied: R* = Objective is recommended for certification with independence R = Objective is recommended for certification A = As negotiated Note 1: 
SAL1 objectives listed 'as negotiated' apply to SAL1 security measures that contribute to the risk mitigation of a threat scenario with a threat condition with Major or higher severity. See section 4.4.1 for SAL assignment information. 
N = Objective is not required for certification Note 2: 
Security assurance levels are defined in section 4.4 
To determine which objectives, apply to an aircraft or system, the SAL assigned to all security measures within the aircraft or system need to be taken into account. For the Security Risk Assessment objectives O1.1 to O1.5, the threat conditions identified within the aircraft or system need to be taken into account because security measure may not be identified yet. If justified, a SAL can be assigned to individual components. 

Security specific 
This column indicates the kind of objective, as described in chapter 4: yes  
=  This is a security specific assurance objective (see section 4.1) 
augmented  =  This is a security development assurance objective with additional security 
considerations (see section 4.2) 
no  
=  This is a security development assurance objective that may be also 
satisfied by a safety development process compliant with e.g. ED-79A / ARP4754A and/or DO-178C / ED-12C and/or DO-254 / ED-80 (see section 4.2)

## B.2.2 Vulnerability Identification Introduction B.2.2.1 Assessment Of Test Results

Vulnerability and penetration testing will develop a list of unintended behavior, including program bugs and a list of well-known attack techniques that result in anomalous system behavior. Additionally, all problem reports on security measures may hide vulnerabilities. 
The security vulnerability assessment should: 
- 
Take each report of unintended behavior on security measures;
 
- 
Determine for each report whether an anomaly that represents a vulnerability; and  
- 
Determine the impact of each identified vulnerability. 
Vulnerabilities should be recorded, classified, and managed in accordance with the current problem report guidance. 

## B.2.2.2 Assessment Of Well-Known Vulnerabilities

The vulnerability assessment should include an assessment of well-known vulnerabilities: 
- 
Use one or more established repositories for well-known vulnerabilities;  
- 
Assess any previously-developed parts of the system against established repository for well-known vulnerabilities; and  
- 
Classify all documented vulnerabilities that are applicable to the system. 
The well-known vulnerabilities are those vulnerabilities that have been documented in previous use of items within the system. A repository of these should be established prior to the final security vulnerability assessment as part of the certification security assessment baseline. Available public databases may be used, along with vendor notifications. Opensource attack tools and proprietary attack tools also serve to document well-known attack techniques and the condition of being vulnerable to one is considered to be a well-known vulnerability. The set of classification attributes should be defined to support risk analysis proceeding at higher levels of the development. The identification and classification include a description of the resulting effects on the system if the vulnerability is exploited by attack along with a classification of the attributes of the vulnerability related to exposure, exploitability, and scope. Several industrial standards have been developed that are used by well-known vulnerability databases. An industrial standard that is compatible with well-known vulnerability databases may be used as part of the assessment. Classification standards that may be considered include CVSS, the "Common Vulnerability Scoring System", Version 3.0 [20]. Databases that use this standard include the US National Vulnerability Database [56], the US National Cyber Awareness System [55], and many more. Note:  
Information from these sources is most likely to address software that is commercially marketed for uses unrelated to airborne systems (e.g., COTS). In the absence of databases that specifically accommodate airborne systems it is important to understand the methods used in any vulnerability identification and classification system before applying it to aircraft systems. 

Regardless of how vulnerabilities are identified and classified relative to non-airborne systems use, vulnerabilities should be evaluated within the aircraft systems architecture to determine both exposure characteristics and airplane level impact. Exposure and severity will be unique to each aircraft type. Databases for COTS products will assume typical IT architectures, exposure and usage, which can make the assessment results inaccurate for airborne uses. 

## B.2.2.3 Vulnerability Reporting And Management

Vulnerabilities should be traced in vulnerability problem reports whatever their impact and independent from the fact that they will be judged acceptable or not. The process for creating and managing Vulnerability problem reports should resemble the same processes used for Complex Electronic Hardware and Software Problem Reports today. One difference is that in addition to designers and testers creating Problem Reports, Vulnerability Problem Reports may be created by independent security teams or third-party assessors. Those parties (suppliers and sub-tier suppliers) responsible for the tracking and remediation of vulnerabilities will likely stay the same. 

## B.2.2.4 Vulnerability Dossier

The vulnerability dossier contains the vulnerabilities discovered during security behavior assurance activities and the resulting system's response. The vulnerability dossier is part of the supporting evidence for Aircraft or System Security Risk Assessment. An analysis should be conducted to identify the vulnerabilities. Each Vulnerability Problem Report created following this analysis should in turn be analyzed to determine the severity of the effect resulting from triggering this vulnerability. The analysis will be part of the vulnerability dossier.

## B.2.4 Security Refutation Introduction

As a generalization, when a set of requirements are generated in response to a negative requirement/objective (specifying the absence of specific behaviors), then even though a set of requirements are correct and complete (may meet ED-79A / ARP4754A) and properly developed (per item level standards), this does not mean that the resultant assurances necessarily provides confidence in the absence of specific behaviors beyond what is called process assurance. For security, the set of positive requirements generated in response to a security risk analysis can be determined to be "correct and complete" (as possible). But unfortunately, it is this set of correct and complete (validated) requirements that "drive" all the forth coming (down-stream) assurances (verifications, etc.), not the higher-level security risk assessment and higher-level security objectives. Further, the "attacks" considered in the security risk assessment cannot be captured as a precise set of input conditions because they are a product of (unspecified, unstructured and malicious) human behavior. Consequently, it is desirable to produce assurances outside those assurances (verifications) generated by the set of (validated, usually positive) requirements to gain confidence of system response to human malicious actions. 

DO-356A / ED-203A introduces the term "Refutation" to describe and collect assurance activities as a method for airworthiness security. This term is new because current versions of DO-326A / ED-202A do not use the term, nor do other published aviation industry documents (ED-79A / ARP4754A, DO-178C / ED-12C, DO-254 / ED-80, etc.). Even though these standards do not use the term "refutation", these standards do discuss many refutation activities as part of activities associated with safety/security assurance objectives. Introducing the term Refutation helps focus the assurance activities into an Airworthiness Security assurance method. The term "Refutation" can be used in the sense of demonstrating the absence of a theoretical problem, as in refuting the allegation of vulnerabilities. Hence, security refutation is demonstrating the absence of security problems. Refutation activities challenge the hypothesis that the formalized requirements will or have produced, a design and implementation that is sufficiently faithful to the higher-level objectives, from which the requirements were derived. Refutation activities act as an independent set of assurance activities beyond those assurance activities driven from the formalized analysis and requirements. Anytime system complexity precludes exhaustive testing that an unwanted behavior never occurs, refutation can be used to formally demonstrate that an unwanted behavior has been precluded to an acceptable level of confidence. In the case of security, the role of attacker can be assumed to be independent of any assumption made by the developer and then captured by requirements. When refutation assurance activities focus on the role of the attacker, these assurances can augment the assurances spawned by the requirements. In practice refutation is typically achieved through "representative" testing. That is to say because the requirements which need to be verified by refutation are typically in the negative context (for example: "the system shall not") it requires a high volume of test cases to provide confidence that in all cases the system would not respond or behave in a particular way. Likewise, it also stands to reason that in many cases not all possible test vectors can be achieved. As an example: A system has a requirement that a function shall be resilient to invalid input over an Ethernet link using IP datagrams. If the protocol permits the use of any conceivable data value and length, the number of possible test iterations is not manageable. In this case the system verifier should analyze the invalid input space and develop a testing application which auto generates and sends invalid data into the system and monitors the function for a failure result. This approach allows the system verifier to exercise the system with hundreds of thousands or even millions of tests as part of the verification activity. This approach 
(sometimes referred to as fuzzing or robustness testing) allows the system verifier to develop a high degree of confidence in the design of the system. As with all testing it is important for the tester to ensure the testing is designed correctly to support the need so careful consideration should be given to the test design to ensure the parts of the system which are under test are being properly exercised. For example, if one is attempting to test an application hosted on a device by altering the IP header in the packets sent to the system, one may not be properly exercising the application if the packets are discarded by the network stack before reaching the application. Care should be taken that test results are not due to insufficient test preparation and execution, but actually reveal behavior of the tested system. Many formal proof tools construct their proofs by seeking counter-examples and structuring a failure to find counter-examples as the final proof. So, a formal proof tool may be used as a refutation analysis method. Such analysis uses a representation model of the system under test to find counter-examples that can be used as a refutation of the security properties of the representation.

## B.2.9 Design Activities

The security design activities capture the security architecture at aircraft/system and item levels and, when necessary, the development of low-level requirements that allow proceeding to the implementation phase. Interfaces between systems, items and lower levels components have to be thoroughly defined and verified as per the security design standards to ensure a secured behavior of the implemented security measures. The development of security measures and their supporting functions should be fully comprised into the security architecture. Any interface vulnerability in a supporting function of a security measure may alter the effectiveness of a security measure. The security design activities include:

## B.2.10 Implementation Activities

Typical security implementation activities consist of developing the software source code and hardware description from the security requirements and architecture. Reviews of the implemented code or description should rely on security standards that will allow early detection of vulnerabilities that may have been introduced during the implementation phase. The security implementation activities include:

## Common Method Examples D.1 Security Perimeter Example

This example shows the security perimeter determination for an In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) system. The process of refining the security perimeter as development proceeds from defining the systems to defining the subsystems that comprise the systems is shown in Figure D-1, Figure D-2 and Figure D-3. 

 

## D.2 Risk Management Example D.2.1 Example Context

In this example, an update process of Air Management System (AMS) of the hypothetical aircraft shown in DO-326A / ED-202A partial architecture is analyzed. In this update, two controllers will replace the old AMS (Temperature Controller and Pressurization Controller in Figure D-4) and a GSE will be used for maintenance activities. The previous system was connected to the aircraft using ARINC 429 busses. It could be used in aircraft with different cabin configurations and needed to be configured by the operator's maintenance personnel for replacement of damaged LRU. The new AMS system should maintain the same functionality and maintenance operational capabilities. Both controllers contain a microprocessor and Programmable Logic Device (PLD) that may be updated via the Ground Support Equipment (GSE) or Ethernet router connection. The new software and firmware update may be downloaded from a secure server provided by the aircraft manufacturer. The automatic update is optional and the manual update may be performed at a MRO or by the operator's maintenance personnel. They are connected to other aircraft systems via ARINC 664 bus. 

## D.2.2 Security Scope

This section provides an example for security scope definition which is presented in section 3.1. The Figure D-5 shows the Aircraft Security Scope for this example with aircraft interfaces passing the security perimeter, which is the line between security assets and security environment. The items inside the orange shading are inside the security perimeter, items not within the shaded boundary are part of the security environment. The Aircraft

Security Scope is important information to identify attack paths to the new system that may contain assets with Safety effects (see section 3.1.1 for definition of asset). 

Figure D-6 depicts the AMS Security Scope with emphasis on its interfaces with aircraft security using the same method. The continuous lines represent permanent connections of AMS to aircraft while the dashed lines represent temporary connections. 

 

## D.2.2.1 Assets

This section presents an example of aircraft assets, which is presented in section 3.1.1. 

## D.2.2.1.1 Aircraft Functions

A search in the aircraft functions database will list functions where the AMS directly contributes to their implementation. In this example, these aircraft functions (AF) are: 
AF.1 
Provide Cabin acclimatization 

a. 
Heating 
b. 
Cooling 
c. 
Failure warning 
AF.2 
Provide in flight information 
a. 
External temperature 
b. 
Cabin temperature 
AF.3 
Provide Cabin pressurization 
a. 
Keep internal pressure between 6.000 feet and sea level

As stated in DO-326A / ED-202A, all elements inside the security perimeter are under the development control and should be subject to change to enhance security. All other elements outside the security perimeter cannot be modified or are difficultly changed. 

Figure D-8 presents a hierarchical view of the identified assets. The green boxes are functions and the other figure elements represent interfaces, data and resources.

## D.2.2.3 Security Environment

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
This section provides an example of the security environment definition, which is presented in section 3.1.3. Using the graph of the architectural elements (Figure D-7) the following assumptions can be listed: 
1. 

No attack originates from ARINC 664 switch due to its design 

2. 
No attack can succeed through ARINC 664 switch due to its design 
3. 
The MRO has no security training 
4. 
The manufacturer server implements cryptography, authentication and access controls 
5. 
The airline IT personnel are security aware but has no familiarity with aircraft security 
6. 
The airline crew personnel have no security awareness 
7. 
The airline allows personal usage of EFB by its employees 
8. 
Airline maintenance personnel can update the LRU data items 
9. 
The Pressurization controller can be updated via GSE or embedded Ethernet switch 
10. 
The Temperature controller can be updated via GSE or Pressurization controller 
 
Based on Figure D-7, it is possible to identify the persons and organizations that interact with the AMS; 

a. 
Avionic system via ARINC 664 
b. 
In-flight entertainment system via Ethernet switch 
c. 
Operator's maintenance personnel via GSE 
d. 
MRO personnel via GSE 
Analyzing only the AMS security environment, it is not possible to identify the external population that can exercise the interface with the entertainment system because they are behind the Ethernet switch. For the assessment completeness it is necessary, in this particular case, to analyze the aircraft security scope to identify the population. With this approach, it is possible to identify the following persons, organizations, and external systems: 

e. 
Pilot via EFB in cockpit 
f. 
First officer via EFB in cockpit 
g. 
Operator's maintenance personnel via QAR 
h. 
Operator's personnel via CSD EFB 
i. 
Airline ground infra-structure via fileserver 
j. 
Airline ground infra-structure via wireless bridge 
k. 
Manufacturer infra-structure via wireless bridge 
Using the Verizon Business 2009 Data Breach Investigations Supplemental Report [57] as reference, the most common types of attack are considered: 
1.

8. 
Packet sniffer: Monitors and captures data traversing a network. 
9. 
Unauthorized access via stolen credentials: Instances in which an attacker gains access to a protected system or device using valid but stolen credentials. 
10. 
Pretexting or social engineering: A social engineering technique in which the attacker invents a scenario to persuade, manipulate, or trick the target into performing an action or divulging information. 
11. 
Authentication bypass: Circumvention of normal authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to a system 
12. 
Physical theft of asset: Physically stealing an asset. 
13. 
Brute-force attack: An automated process of iterating through possible username/password combinations until one is successful. 
14.

ISO / IEC 27005:2011 [47], Annex C will be used in this example to classify the applicable threat sources: 
1.
Computer criminal for destruction of information or unauthorized data alteration (e.g. FLS and configuration files) 
2.
Terrorist for destruction or blackmail (e.g.: tampered FLS)
3.
Industrial espionage for competitive advantage
4.
Insiders due to lack of security awareness, intelligence, lack of training, monetary gain or revenge
The security measures implemented by the system manufacturer are the only ones being considered as existent. 

## D.2.2.4 Defining Nested Assets

Using the graph of the architectural elements (Figure D-7) it is possible to visualize that the AMS security environment is the aircraft security perimeter combined with the aircraft security environment. Using Figure D-8, the AMS system and its LRUs can be visualized as a nested asset of the aircraft. This concept is presented in section 5.3.

## D.2.3.2 Threat Scenario Identification

This example addresses the material presented in section 3.4 and subsections. 

## D.2.3.2.1 Identifying Threat Scenarios

The inputs for this activity are: 
- 
Security Environment 
- 
Threat condition list from previous activity 
Considering the FHA failure conditions identified in section D.2.3.1 and the security perimeter depicted by Figure D-7 of section D.2.2.2, it was prioritized to evaluate the attack paths related to "FC.3 Loss of pressurization for crew and passengers - Catastrophic". This threat scenario leads to the attack paths depicted in Figure D-9. 

 
Due to assumptions 1 and 2 (in section D.2.2.3), the attack path through ARINC 664 switch should be discarded or the assumption list modified. Continuing the analysis with the persons and organizations identified in the same section, it is possible to confirm that possible attackers with one stage scenario can reach: 
a. 

In-flight entertainment system via Ethernet switch 

b. 
Operator's maintenance personnel via GSE 
c. 
MRO personnel via GSE 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The Ethernet switch hides potential attackers that are using it to reach the target (Pressurization controller that implements the function AF.3 "Provide Cabin pressurization"). As this is a system update activity it is necessary to consider the guidance of DO-326A / ED-202A Chapter 4. 

At this point is it necessary to address the first design decision about the architecture: 
a. 

Remove the interface between Pressurization Controller and the Ethernet Switch reducing the system exposure and, consequently, the risk assessment effort 

b. 
Keep the interface and expand the analysis beyond Ethernet switch to completely identify the threat sources 
Assuming that, due to business objectives, the designer opts to keep the interface, it is necessary to expand the analysis to aircraft level as instructed by DO-326A / ED-202A. 

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Considering the interface purpose (LRU data update), it is possible to define some security requirements: SR1 "The Pressurization Controller shall only accept data download via Ethernet when the aircraft is on-ground and engine is off". SR2 "The pressurization Controller shall only accept external connections routed via Wireless Bridge when the aircraft is on-ground and engine is off". 

SR3 "The AMS system LRUs shall only allow data exchange via Ethernet and CAN interfaces when the aircraft is set to maintenance mode". These requirements are intended to reduce the window of opportunity by the threat sources and reduce the number of attack paths. Considering the section 3.4.1 contents and the attack path via the wireless interface, the threat scenario is identified as: 
- 
Asset: AF.3 "Provide Cabin pressurization" 

- 
Target: Pressurization controller 
- 
Victims: Wireless bridge and Ethernet switch

## D.3 Aircraft Airworthiness Security Process Example D.3.1 Scope

This appendix provides examples for the methods defined in the body of this document. 

## D.3.2 Document Description

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The examples described herein provide references to develop a product at the aircraft, system and item levels. It exercises the security process and methods using safety artifacts as recommended in S-18 reference document. The completeness of safety process is beyond the scope of this document (mistakes may be present) but the example should be a sound sand box. 

The aircraft is not just a product for transportation; it can "talk", provide services and is integrated to services. The architecture of e-enabled aircraft is becoming more and more complex. The aircraft is expected to provide value to customers in the life cycle including quality of flight to pilots, comfort to passengers, low emissions to environment, easy access to maintainers, profit to operators while maintaining safe flight to all. Due to these considerations, there may be new complex operational scenarios with multiples stakeholders and environments. A desired service like internet access provided to passengers on a large commercial transport, may be considered a required service on an executive aircraft. The following example is for a commercial aircraft configuration that has different versions that may invalidate previously defined assumptions and create new ones. It uses S-18 AIR-
6110 [3] as reference to best practices for safety processes and as it applies to this EUROCAE / RTCA fictional aircraft. 

## D.3.3 Aircraft Development Process

Figure D-11 depicts the partial flow of activities with references to sections of AIR-6110 
document. Only the aircraft and system level activities are present in the figure. The aircraft development process includes the development of the aircraft level functions, requirements, and architecture. It will produce a partial list of aircraft requirements and proposes an aircraft design that satisfies them and proposes system level requirements to be satisfied by aircraft systems. 

## D.3.4 Aircraft Introduction

This is a fictional aircraft that is created to provide an example of the security process described in DO-356A / ED-203A. The proposed aircraft shall be operated in three different contexts, civil commercial, military and executive operations, to exercise the impact of the different configurations and security environments in the analysis. The aircraft production may be considered to identify its risk to the product. The fantasy name of the company is: EUROCA Aircraft Industry. 

## D.3.5 Aircraft Concept

The EUROCA D1 aircraft is new generation of the multi-function Jet and encompasses the D1-C (commercial transport), D1-EX (executive), and D1-FF (fire fighter) configurations. 

The EUROCA D1 aircraft is a Transport Category airplane of conventional layout to be certified by Regulatory Agencies: 
- 
Two wing-mounted engines 

- 
Tricycle-type landing gear 
- 
Conventional tail design 
- 
Carry at 200 passengers at maximum 
- 
Flight range of 4000 nm 
- 
Flight range of 5000 nm at executive configuration 
- 
Maximum cargo capacity of 15 metric ton (cargo transport) 
- 
Cruise speed of 0.84 Mach 
The general guidance to its development is: 
1. 
The aircraft cabin shall be configured according with the usage (cargo, passenger, executive and fire fighter) in production line 
2. 
The civil configuration shall provide passenger entertainment 
3. 
The transport configuration shall be configured from cargo to fire fighter configuration by operator 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

4. 
All configurations shall provide enhanced ground communication for mission success (planning, performance and health monitoring) 
 
 A military version as a variation of the D1-FF configuration is considered with the following additional requirements: 
5. 

The aircraft cargo configuration shall allow cargo launch during flight 

6. 
The cargo door shall open in flight and ground 
Note:  
This description is just for a guide to the creation of scenarios. 


## D.3.6 Aircraft Planning

EUROCA Aircraft Industry has cybersecurity activities present in its ED-79A / ARP4754A based development process. A security risk analysis is being performed at the aircraft functions definition independent of the conceptual architecture. The security risk analysis will be updated after a conceptual architecture is defined but without a physical solution that considers actual implementation. The security risk assessment final phase will consider the implemented aircraft architecture. Note:  
The definition of security planning documents is out-of-scope since DO-326A / ED-202A just defines activities and data. 

## D.3.7 Aircraft Functions

From ED-79A / ARP4754A section 4.1.4, "Identification of Aircraft-Level Functions, 
Function Requirements and Function Interfaces": 
"This … Aircraft-level functions are high-level activities and are not necessarily 
associated with a single, physical system implementation. 
The output of this activity is a list of aircraft-level functions and the associated function 
requirements and interfaces for these functions."

## D.3.9.1 Identification Of Aircraft Assets

At this stage, it is possible to identify assets from AIR-6110 [3] section 2.4, and ED-79A / 
ARP4754A, section 4.1.4 activities. The aircraft functions, interfaces between the functions, interfaces between the aircraft and the environment and data exchanges through these interfaces are the first identified assets in the development process. These assets are presented in: 1.

Table D-6: Aircraft Function,

2.
Table D-7: Aircraft Functions Interfaces,
3.
Table D-8: Data Flows.
It is important to capture the support assets that are used by aircraft operation as recommended in ISO 27005:2011 [47] annex B, and presented in Figure D-12 "Aircraft User Interaction" and Figure D-13 "Aircraft External Interfaces".

| ASA-06 Passenger PED                | ACI-13, ACI-15    |

It is important to remember that security measures are assets and they should be identified in this step. In this case, there is only a planned security measure (SM) identified due to AC-Req-9.

| Aircraft Security Perimeter                                   |

Section 3.1.2 suggests a four steps procedure to define the security perimeter. These steps and the evidence are listed in the next table.

 Using Table D-7: Aircraft Functions Interfaces and Table D-8: Data Flows, it is possible to document the description required by section 3.1. The information about the architecture implementation, aircraft functions and their allocation to systems are still not defined at this stage of the development. This basic interface information is: 
1. 

Physical interfaces (those that require a physical presence in or near): based in, it is possible to list 

2. 
Logical connections (those that can be used remotely) 
3. 
Accessibility Requirements

## D.3.9.2.1 Aircraft Threat Identification

A classification of threats to assets is needed to perform the next activities. This can be done based on the asset types (generic) or as proposed in the ARINC-811 [12] document. At this stage, the asset type information is available for the high-level assets. Therefore, adopting the generic approach should be better. 

Threat Identifier 
Threat Description 
Asset attribute 
Confidentiality 
ABUS 
Abuse: the asset is compromised due to unauthorized operation by an authorized user. 
BACK 
Backdoor: the asset is compromised due to an unintended interface. Integrity 
COUN 
Counterfeit: the asset is compromised due to counterfeit part usage 
Integrity Availability 
DENI 
Denial of service: the asset is compromised due to destruction or unavailability. 
Integrity 
DEVL 
Development: the asset is compromised due to a development error. 
DISP 
Disposal: the asset is compromised due to improper disposal 
Confidentiality 
LEAK 
Leakage: the asset is compromised due to information leakage. 
Confidentiality 
MALW 
Malware: the asset is compromised due to malware 
Integrity 
Integrity 
MITM 
Man-In-The-Middle: the asset is compromised due to intercepted 
during its transfer. 
Confidentiality 
SNIF 
Sniffing: the asset is compromised due to monitoring during transfer. 
Integrity 
TAMP 
Tampering: the asset is compromised due to unauthorized modification. 
THEF 
Theft: the asset is compromised due to its theft. 
Confidentiality 
Confidentiality 
UNAU 
Unauthorized: the asset is compromised due to operation by an unauthorized user. 
USRC 
Untrusted: the asset is compromised due to untrusted source usage 
Integrity 

 Based on aircraft concept (Figure D-12: Aircraft User Interaction) and general threats 
(Table D-17: Example of Threats) it is possible to identify some unsecure interactions with the assets as shown in Figure D-16: Misuse Example, and specific threats to the assets as shown in Table D-18: Threats by Asset Types.

## D.3.9.2.2 Aircraft Vulnerability Identification

DO-326A / ED-202A requires the classification of the vulnerabilities at security environment identification but does not specify when the vulnerabilities should be identified. ED-201 Figure 7: Risk Assessment Stages, shows that threats and vulnerabilities can be identified together since a threat requires a vulnerability to compromise an asset. On the other hand, ISO 27005:2011 [47] section 8.2.5 "Identification of vulnerabilities" requires the identification of threats, assets and existing security measures. At this stage, this information is available, so it is possible to adopt a generic approach to describe them. As suggested by ED-201 Figure 7, the relationship between vulnerability and threat may help identifying requirements for future security measures implementation during further risk assessment activities. A vulnerability without an exposure to a threat (or a threat without access to a vulnerability) does not require a security measure to protect the asset. 

However, vulnerabilities should be monitored during the product operation to identify new threats that can exploit them.

## D.3.9.2.3 Threat Modeling

Threat Modeling consists of gathering information about the assets already listed by asset identification step, to define all entry and exit points, the information flow, components, integration and process involved. This information is used to identify the threats which the assets are exposed to. 

Threat Modeling supports defining the environment of a target asset. Threat Modeling will then map a target asset to an assigned malicious user target value. The value is then used to identify which kind of threat agents are of concern for the target asset. 

The assets have point of contact with external environment (attack surface). A threat agent will use such points to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. The next step is to determine the attack surfaces of interest and any vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Now it is possible to list the main attack scenarios that could affect an asset during operation. These attack scenarios will enable testing to target the main threat scenarios. Distinct threat scenarios could result in attacks that allow break in the integrity of aircraft, resulting in financial loss, image damage and harm to customers and employees. The threat risk level is classified according to the impact level to business against the probability of adverse event occurrence. The risk degree is classified as: High, Medium and Low. 

Damage potential 
- 
Reproducibility 

Exploitability 
- 
User impact solutions 
- 
Likelihood of attacker discovery 
Threat model starts with assets and their integration with other system, the attack vectors (or entry points), threat agents, and group threats or category of threats. Consider ED-12 / DO-178 DAL (such as Level A-B-C interacting with D-E equipment) and aircraft domains (such as PIESD components connected to AISD) to evaluate potential impact. 

## D.3.9.3 Aircraft Security Environment

This activity should identify assumptions and requirements of external elements that can have access to interact with aircraft interfaces. The security environment should consider threat sources, existing protections and trustworthiness of persons, organizations and external systems with the ability to access assets through the security perimeter.

## D.4 Aircraft Architecture

The analysis should cover the electronic interactions with the fictional aircraft excluding the physical interactions. It captures the aircraft interactions with its environment. The actors represent external systems that interact and should be described further (e.g.: OEM, Operator etc.). The humans that operate these systems are not depicted since they are incapable of interacting electronically with the aircraft (e.g. pilots should be behind the EFB, passengers behind the PED, etc.). There is a high level conceptual view provided by Figure D-17. It captures the interactions between aircraft and environment. The interactions between aircraft systems are in the following sections. Interactions with dashed lines are wireless and with continuous lines are wired. The architecture has been built using textbooks and attempts have been made to include various features that may or may not occur in real aircraft and that can present corner or special cases for security. No intellectual property of any manufacturer is included. The equipment presented should cover a range of DALs and locations in the current domain models. It also includes the various interfaces and topologies that may be found. Some intentional "defects" are included that should be shown to be covered by assessments and solutions provided by the methods in DO-356A / ED-203A. To gain a better sense of this sample aircraft's architecture, the following aircraft-level functions diagram is provided. This diagram was taken from SAE's AIR6110 [3] 
Contiguous Aircraft/System Development Process Example. As such, the original diagram has been redrawn and shaded to indicate the sample aircraft architectural analytical focus relative to the overall basic aircraft level functions. 

## D.4.1 Avionic System Architecture

Physical Architecture The intent of the following diagrams is to provide a basis of discussion on how best to configure the physical architecture of an example aircraft. The following first two diagrams cover the physical and logical interfaces to identify differences between the two levels - some physically unidirectional interfaces create logical bidirectional interfaces just as some bidirectional interfaces can be constrained to be unidirectional. The DCs in the images may be standard switches or a device that translates between data buses. It is possible that not all components will be used - the example has included many functions and items to enable dialogue in the committee. Unneeded parts for the example appendix may be removed to simplify it.

## Security Effectiveness Method And Examples (Informative)

The material introduced in this appendix is for information only and does not constitute a mandatory part of this document. The example methods included in this appendix provide one possibility to assess risk in the context of an aircraft or system. These example methods may require adaptation (by addition, alteration or subtraction) to be used for any given project. Further, these methods may not comply with all objectives listed in the body of the document. Applicants should ensure that the methods selected for a given project are appropriate for their project and obtain early concurrence from airworthiness authorities. 

## E.1 Effectiveness Risk Assessment Method

This section presents a method to evaluate the level of threat by the "effectiveness of protection" required to prevent successful execution of an attack. Effectiveness of protection is a metric for the resistance of security measures against attacks, expressed in terms of an attacker's expertise, resources and time expended in attacking the target of the threat scenario. Note:  
This definition is similar but not identical to the definition of "Attack Potential" in Common Criteria [18]. The attacker motivation is not taken into 
account for effectiveness of protection. 
The level of threat of a threat scenario is evaluated on a scale of 5 levels to enable comparability of risk assessments with the risk acceptability criteria in section 2.7. Another reason is to ensure consistency with existing airworthiness regulations and standards. Accordingly, the effectiveness of protection in a threat scenario is measured with five levels. The effectiveness levels "None", "Basic", "Moderate", "High" and "Very High" as defined in Table E-1 are used to evaluate the effectiveness of protection. 

Effectiveness Definition 
None 
Protection does not exist or is not effective against the specific threat 
Basic 
Basic protection against intentional unauthorized electronic interactions with elements of the threat scenario assessed. 
Moderate 
Adequate to protect against a Major safety effect by intentional unauthorized electronic interactions with elements of the threat scenario assessed 
High 
Adequate to protect against a Hazardous safety effect by intentional unauthorized electronic interactions with elements of the threat scenario assessed 
Very High 
Adequate to protect against a Catastrophic safety effect by intentional unauthorized electronic interactions with elements of the threat scenario assessed 

Note:  
The terms "effectiveness" and "effectiveness of protection" will be used interchangeably in this method. 
The effectiveness levels are reversed with regard to the Level of Threat scale. That means that for example a threat scenario evaluated with a "Very High" effectiveness of the security measures corresponds to a "Very High" effectiveness level and to an "Extremely Low" level of threat, as shown in Table E-2. 

| Level of Threat scale    | Effectiveness scale    |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Very High                | None                   |
| High                     | Basic                  |
| Moderate                 | Moderate               |
| Low                      | High                   |
| Extremely Low            | Very High              |
|                          |                        |

The evaluation scale for a level of threat evaluation using effectiveness is based on the security measure characteristics that provide protection in the specific threat scenario. The security measure characterization in section 3.5 provides the protection capabilities of security measures. The level of threat evaluation determines the specific effectiveness of a security measure against one threat. While a security measure will not be more effective than its protection capabilities, its effectiveness may be limited against certain threats. And there can be threat scenarios where a security measure provides no protection at all. For example, if the specific threat targets another security attribute (i.e. availability) than the security measure protects. The level of threat evaluation also considers the dependencies and influences between security measures by evaluating the combined effectiveness of security measures in a threat scenario. The effectiveness evaluation is not limited to technical security measures but can be used for any security measure, including operational security measures. 

## E.1.1 Effectiveness Of Protection Scale

To make the effectiveness of protection calculation mathematically stable and avoiding inaccuracies resulting from rounding, the evaluation of security measures will be conducted on a finer grained scale. The advantage is that this allows showing combined effects more accurately before scaling back to the overall scale of the threat scenario. This method will use a scale of 30 calculation points for security measures. Note that the grey levels used in the graphical scale are not supposed to represent risk levels but represent the overall effectiveness level in the threat scenario, as defined in Table E-3 below. 

|      |       |          | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18    | 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30    |
|------|-------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| None | Basic | Moderate | High                                              | Very High                              |

 Each evaluation starts with the highest possible level of threat. This corresponds to nonexistent protection or 0 effectiveness points on the calculation scale. Security measures applied to the threat scenario will reduce the level of threat. Each identified security measure increases the protection against a specific attack, measured in points on the calculation scale. The effectiveness level for a threat scenario is determined by the combined effectiveness points for all identified security measures. In this regard, anything that is able to reduce the level of threat (or provides some protection) should be regarded as a security measure. The effectiveness points assigned to a security measure are specific to the evaluated threat scenario and its combination of multiple security measures. A security measure may already have a basic capability identified in the security measure characterization activity. The effectiveness with regard to the specific circumstances of the threat scenario needs to be determined based on the basic capability of the security measure. Example: A security measure may be designed to prevent against attacks on the confidentiality of a target. Such a security measure may have a high capability of protection against eavesdropping attacks but may be easily by-passed in the threat scenario and therefore would be evaluated with no effectiveness for attacks on the integrity of the target. 

## E.1.2 Effectiveness Evaluation Order

Mind that in this method, the order in which the steps are applied is not relevant for the overall effectiveness evaluation. 

## E.1.3 Effectiveness Evaluation Criteria

The overall effectiveness of protection in a threat scenario is calculated by considering the effectiveness that individual security measures may have and the evaluation of their combined effectiveness by considering relations between security measures. This method applies the evaluation categories from section 3.6.2 as evaluation steps. Protection and Exposure reduction are directly shown in the evaluation table, because they can be represented through the evaluation of security measures. Attack attempt is applied as another reduction to the overall level of threat after all security measures have been evaluated. If used at all, the attack attempt effect should not contribute more than 6 points to the overall evaluation. The effectiveness of each security measure protecting against an attack in the specific threat scenario is determined by three evaluation criteria: 
•
Preparation Means

•
Window of Opportunity
•
Execution Means
These criteria are based on the factors given in CEM [19] section B.4.2.2 to support comparability with Common Criteria Methodology where needed. CEM distinguishes the factors ""Elapsed Time", "Specialist Expertise", "Knowledge of the Target of Evaluation", "Window of opportunity" and "Equipment", but cautions that these factors are not independent from each other. The three effectiveness evaluation criteria increase the evaluation reliability by combining dependent CEM factors into clearly distinct considerations for the same evaluation criteria (for example the expertise to prepare an attack and the expertise to execute an attack). The separation of attack preparation and attack execution allows for a more accurate evaluation of threat scenarios in which attack preparation and attack execution are separated by distinct roles and persons or a significant amount of time. This is an adaptation to account for the longer development cycles in the aviation industry The Preparation phase includes all activities needed to enable the execution of an attack. It can include technical activities (creation of attack tools, availability of equipment, etc.), intelligence activities (target identification, knowledge acquirement, etc.) and others. Preparation activities have in common that they can be completed in time before an actual attack is executed. Preparation activities do not need to be independent time-wise from the attack execution but are only loosely coupled, so that attack preparation can make use of other resources than available for attack execution. Preparation activities only need to be done once and can often be re-used for multiple attacks on the same or different targets. Evaluation criteria that consider (protection against) such activities should be associated with the preparation phase. Preparation evaluation criteria are typically assigned to the Protection category. The Window of opportunity phase includes all activities that enable or limit access to a target for the execution of an attack. Targets are considered completely accessible by default, so that only limitations are considered in the window of opportunity. Typical limitations reduce the possibility for an attack to certain times and physical locations (for example as given by flight phases) or exclude certain trust relationships. 

Evaluation criteria that consider such limitations should be associated with the window of opportunity phase. This phase closely corresponds to the Exposure reduction category. The Execution phase includes all activities to execute an attack on a target, possibly using multiple steps. The attack execution ends with either success or failure, so that it will have a noticeable effect (at least for the attacker) on the target. Evaluation criteria that consider (protection against) such activities should be associated with the execution phase. Execution evaluation criteria are typically assigned to the Protection category. Execution means have a higher contribution to the effectiveness than preparation means (double/triple points), because everything falling in the preparation area only needs to be done once; it can be reused for subsequent attacks. Preparation means can also include weak security measures in the sense of security by obscurity (proprietary protocols, pinning, system design, etc.). The execution phase is the one for which security measures are designed that are actually supposed to stop the attacker. Window of opportunity security measures can be a bit more effective than preparation means, because they can make it more difficult to start an attack. But window of opportunity does not protect against the execution of an attack, making its contribution less significant that execution means. These criteria are often related to specific operational or technical security measures (including design and implementation quality of the target of evaluation). The effectiveness of such security measures should be evaluated with respect to these criteria with regard to the specific threat scenario. It is recommended creating one security measure per effectiveness criteria (if applicable) in order to be more specific and avoid having one security measure with effects in more than one criteria. For example: 
 
For the threat scenario in question, each security measure is attributed a number of effectiveness points which increase the overall effectiveness. The effectiveness points assigned to the three evaluation criteria are based on expert judgement using the guidance in the subsections E.1.3.1 to E.1.3.5. The subsequent evaluation steps in E.1.4 and E.1.5 only apply mathematical rules to calculate the overall result which is then expressed as a qualitative effectiveness of protection level. 

## E.1.3.1 Preparation Means

Is preparation (e.g. to find out about system specifics and how hard it is to come by this information or to come by the necessary preparation means) or previous knowledge of the target or special equipment/tools required? This effect type accounts for the fact that an attacker might already have previous knowledge (limits the number of potential attackers) or, alternatively, acquire this knowledge (equivalent).

 Evaluation rules: 
- 
The overall effect through this criteria class should usually be not above 6 points. 
- 
Any number of points in the given range 0-6 can be applied with an appropriate rationale. 
Definition of Equipment Categories: 
- 
None/Standard: No equipment or something commonly already found in the possession of an average person (e.g. a laptop). 
- 
Special COTS: Something which can be readily bought, but which is usually not yet in the possession of an average person. 
- 
Special: Something which cannot be readily bought, but which needs to be assembled/built. 
- 
Bespoke: Special equipment which requires a substantial amount of resources to assemble (time above half a year or money above $100000). 
Definition of Knowledge Categories: 
- 
None/Public information and no preparation time: Attack preparation requires no previous knowledge or only information that is retrievable from public sources. No 
relevant time is needed to collect information and prepare an attack. 
- 
Uncontrolled information and no significant preparation time: Some time is needed to retrieve information or to prepare an attack, but the preparation effort will not prevent most attackers to attempt the attack (for example a single attacker spending less than a month on attack preparation). Information needed for the attack may be more difficult to retrieve only from public sources but is not specially protected 
against disclosure (for example technical specifications that are classified for confidentiality). 
- 
Insider knowledge or significant preparation time: An attack requires either access to protected information that is not retrievable from public source or extensive preparation time. 

## E.1.3.2 Window Of Opportunity

When will it be possible to execute the attack? If the attack can happen at any time, there would be no additional robustness in this respect. This factor depends primarily on the system environment and design.

 Evaluation rules: 
- 
The overall effect through this criteria class should usually not be above 8 points. 
- 
Any number of points in the given range 0-8 can be applied with an appropriate rationale. 
- 
In the case of prepared attacks, the window of opportunity has to be evaluated taking into account how and when the malicious code can be passed onto the target (person or system), not when it is actually executed. 

## E.1.3.3 Execution Means

Which prerequisites will an attacker need to carry it out? This can be education, knowledge of a special subject (expertise) or also special equipment. Linked to this is the question of how long it will take this attacker to execute the attack. This is, however, inversely proportional to the attackers expertise or her equipment and therefore does not need to be considered individually. 

| Layman        | Proficient    | Expert    |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| Multiple      |               |           |
| Expert        |               |           |
| Expertise     |               |           |
| Equipment     |               |           |
| None/Standard | 0             | 4         |
| Special COTS  | 4             | 4         |
| Special       | n/a           | 6         |
| Bespoke       | n/a           | n/a       |

Note:  
The cases marked as not applicable (n/a) in the above table may be applicable if the equipment is built in a way that the interaction the attacker has to carry out is minimal. This implies that a person with more expertise has automated the attack during the preparation phase. Therefore, the effect should be considered in preparation means.

Evaluation rules: 
- 
The overall effect through this criteria class should only exceed 12 points if, having reached 12, additional security measures will at least significantly slow down even the assumed multiple expert attacker. Even then, it should usually not exceed 18 points. 
- 
Any number of points in the given range 0-18 can be applied with an appropriate rationale. For example, a technical security measure's basic effectiveness might be impaired by a vulnerability specific to this threat scenario, making an intermediate number of points appropriate. 
- 
Execution means can be assigned up to the double (or triple in the exceptional case above) amount of points compared with preparation means, because everything falling in the preparation area only needs to be done once; it can be reused for subsequent attacks. Preparation means can also include weak security measures in the sense of security by obscurity (proprietary protocols, pinning, system design, etc.). The execution phase is the one for which security measures are designed that are actually supposed to stop the attacker. 
Definition of Equipment Categories: 
- 
None/Standard: No equipment or something commonly already found in the possession of an average person (e.g. a laptop). 
- 
Special COTS: Something which can be readily bought, but which is usually not yet in the possession of an average person. 
- 
Special: Something which cannot be readily bought, but which needs to be assembled/built. 
- 
Bespoke: Special equipment which requires a substantial amount of resources to assemble (time above half a year or money above $100000). 
Definition of Expertise Categories: 
- 
Layman: Someone without specific expertise. 
- 
Proficient: Someone with basic IT/aircraft operations expertise (depending on the nature of the threat scenario). 
- 
Expert: Someone with security expertise specific to the attack (depending on the nature of the scenario). 
- 
Multiple Expert: Specific security expertise in more than one field (e.g. FPGA security expertise and WLAN security expertise or FPGA security expertise and aircraft security operations expertise). 

## E.1.3.4 Security Measure Types

Every security measure is either of "technical" or "non-technical" type. The type of a security measure should be clearly visible in its definition. A typical technical security measure should not exceed an effectiveness level of 10 points. Only in the case of simple devices whose security effect can be easily demonstrated for the specific case, it could be increased beyond this threshold. 

Non-technical security measures include operational, organizational and procedural security measures. For non-technical security measures, the possibility of human error has to be taken into account. Therefore, their individual effectiveness level should usually not exceed 6 points. 

| Security Measure Type    |   Maximum Effect  |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Technical                |               10  |
| Non-technical            |                6  |
| Simple Device            |               18  |

## E.1.3.5 Security Assurance Vs. Effectiveness

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Effectiveness, in the risk assessment context, is the ability to withstand a dedicated attack. Security assurance, on the other hand, describes (mainly) development process requirements. These include detailed documentation, testing, auditing as well as in-service monitoring (audits, vulnerability management). By themselves, such assurance requirements cannot have a risk reduction effect. Assurance requirements are however, needed to back up the effectiveness assessment of a security measure. A high level of assurance is supposed to ensure the correct functioning of a security measure. It therefore increases the confidence that a security measure will work as intended and cannot be bypassed. So, in mathematical terms, security assurance can be described as decreasing the level of uncertainty (fuzziness) about a security measure's effectiveness. Example: 
A firewall might be evaluated with a standard effectiveness of six effectiveness points. However, a badly configured firewall can be easily circumvented, or its rules can be broken. Without further information, the effect might be as low as a single point due to the high uncertainty. The following figure represents the uncertainty in the firewall's effectiveness assessment without taking assurance into account. Although the possibility of firewall vulnerability or failure is not ruled out completely, the confidence in the effect of the security measure is increased by the assurance activities. In this case, the actual effectiveness could vary as much as between 1 and 6 points on the scale. 

Applying security assurance requirements to the development, including extensive security testing, decreases the likelihood of bad configuration and use of vulnerable or unreliable software. The level of uncertainty therefore decreases. Although the possibility of failure is still there, the confidence in the effect of the security measure is increased. Security assurance activities help to narrow down the uncertainty in the actual effectiveness and possible effectiveness points to be assigned. In this case and as an example, thanks to security assurance activities the specific firewall can have an actual effectiveness in the range from 4 to 6 effectiveness points. The final security risk assessment will evaluate the firewall as a security measure with 4 effectiveness points. A higher effectiveness evaluation with 5 or 6 points would be possible but requires a higher confidence provided by additional security assurance requirements than assigned in this example. 

It is therefore important to back up effectiveness assessment with high levels of assurance whenever needed in order to ensure a high confidence level for the security measure. Basic system design with high development assurance levels, on the other hand, will usually not help to counter security threats unless functional restrictions are derived from the assurance process, that have a mitigating effect. In such a case, those derived security measures should be assessed as security measures (not the assurance process itself). The fact that the development process has a high assurance level will therefore not have a mitigating effect by itself. If this assurance level prescribes a security measure like input validation, for example, the effectiveness points are evaluated according to the effect of the validation (the derived security measure). 

## E.1.4 Combined Effectiveness Assessment

Figure 3-8 in section 3.6.3 shows which mathematical rules to apply in which case. When defining the effectiveness points, the relation between security measures or their effectiveness only under certain circumstances (e.g. specific cases of the general scenario) have to be taken into account. It has to be avoided that the effectiveness is increased more than once through what is effectively the same security measure. If two or more security measures are only in effect alternatively (e.g. when different attack paths are possible), the less effective one should be evaluated for the threat scenario effectiveness. While each individual security measure has an effectiveness on its own, the additional applicability of these effectiveness points (in combination with other security measures) 
needs to be evaluated with respect to the independence, diversity and isolation of the existing security measures. All relations other than full independence, diversity and isolation will reduce the combined effectiveness of security measures with regard to the sum of their separate effectiveness. The combined effectiveness needs to be taken into account for the threat scenario instead of the separate effectiveness of the related security measures. A justification is needed for the partial applicability of the added points. Otherwise the worst case has to be assumed (i.e. full dependence, lack of diversity and isolation, so that only the points of the least effective individual security measure are applied). A valid rationale should be given if the combined effect of all applicable security measures on the same effectiveness criterion (preparation means, window of opportunity, execution means) exceeds the criterion's maximum combined effect (given in the respective section and in Table E-8 below), even after considering independence, diversity and isolation. The reason is that, for example in the case of many security measures increasing the required level of expertise of the attacker, there is realistically a finite limit to the overall expertise that a person needs to have in order to breach even various technical barriers. Such an attacker has to be assumed to be able to break any additional security measure. However, these additional security measures may slow down the attack, therefore increasing the effectiveness a bit more.

Definition of abbreviations used in the evaluation table: 
- 
A: Overall effectiveness of protection taking into account all security measures. 
- 
AP: Overall combined effect of effectiveness of protection and attack attempt taking 
into account all security measures and the attacker profile. 
- 
Ax: Partial effectiveness of protection after taking into account only the security 
measures in the first x evaluation steps / columns (from left to right), with x = 1, 2, …, n. 
- 
Ec: Combined effect of security measures applicable in the respective column c, with 
c = 1, 2, …, n. 
- 
Ep/Ew/Ee: Combined effect of security measures applicable in the respective row (Ep 
= Preparation Means, Ew = Window of Opportunity, Ee = Execution Means) 
- 
cp/cw/ce: The amount of points capped compared to Ep/Ew/Ee (respective row sum). 
These points have to be subtracted from the overall effectiveness of protection again, 
because these points have been added before in the Ax calculation. This happens 
because addition occurs first based on columns, but capping is done per row. The capping ensures that the effect per criterion does not exceed the maximum credit allowed by Table E-8. 
- 
c: The total amount of points capped that has to be subtracted from the overall 
effectiveness of protection:  
c = cp + cw **+ c**e 
- 
o: Additional points due to attack attempt considerations based on a specified attacker 
profile. 
- 
max(a, b): The largest of the given numbers a and b (maximum function). 
- 
min(a, b): The smallest of the given numbers a and b (minimum function). 
 The columns of Table E-9 above show the evaluation criteria from section 3.6.2 as evaluation steps (as described in section E.1.3) whereas the table rows represent the three criteria described in sections E.1.3.1, E.1.3.2 and E.1.3.3. The last row is the effectiveness of protection assessment. Per cell, for example ("Protection" - "Technical" , Execution Means), the applicable individual or combined (see section E.1.4) of security measures are listed together with their corresponding points (see section E.1.3). 

In order to calculate Ax, the security measures´ points of the column are added up (column sum Ex) and added to the Ax-1 value (the column on the left). If the column X is already the leftmost column on the table (X=1), the column sum E1 is added to the initial effectiveness of protection (i.e. 0). 

Therefore, the effectiveness cells, Ax, show the robustness level when the security measures up to step X are taken into account. 

## E.1.5.2 Effectiveness Capping

As already mentioned in E.1.4 there are maximum combined effects for each of the three criteria (execution means, windows of opportunity and preparation means), represented by the rows in the calculation Table E-9. These maximum effects are represented by the rightmost column in the evaluation table called "Effectiveness Capping". This column shows the amount of points to be subtracted from the effectiveness of protection (A) because the points exceeding the maximum were already added to the column sum Ex in the evaluation of the corresponding column: 

- 
If the effectiveness points value per row (Ey, with y=p/w/e) is higher than the 
maximum allowed for the corresponding criteria (max_effecty), the difference (i.e. 
effectiveness capping, cy) is subtracted from the effectiveness of protection (A) 
- 
If not, the effectiveness capping is 0 
This is what the following formula shows where y represents each row: 

cy = max(Ey - max_effecty, 0) 
The above-mentioned procedure is performed per row (i.e. criteria) in the evaluation Table E-9. The total amount of points capped that has to be subtracted from the overall effectiveness of protection is: 

$$\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{c_{p}}+\mathbf{c_{w}}+\mathbf{c_{e}}$$

## E.1.5.3 Maximum Effectiveness

Even after applying the effectiveness capping, the effectiveness value may exceed 30 points. As shown in section E.1.4, there is a finite limit to the expertise and preparation time of an attacker that renders higher effectiveness values meaningless. Therefore the maximum effectiveness value is limited to the end of the scale at 30 points. 

A = min(An - c, 30) 

## E.1.5.4 Effectiveness Of Protection Level

Finally the overall effectiveness of protection for the threat scenario is determined according to the previously defined calculation scale.

Note:  
The value 0 for the effectiveness of protection has to be interpreted that there 
is no effectiveness or that no security measures have been applied in the threat scenario. While values 1 - 6 indicate that security measures are applied, their effectiveness is so marginal (or unreliable) that they are not sufficient to reach even a "Basic" effectiveness.  
 

## E.2 Risk Assessment Examples E.2.1 Effectiveness Of Protection Evaluation Example 1

This section will briefly show how to use the effectiveness of protection evaluation table to calculate the level of threat. It uses purely hypothetical threat scenarios. The security measure evaluation, details of the threat scenarios and other engineering judgment aspects of the risk assessment are neglected in this first example to concentrate just on the calculation aspects.

## E.2.2 Effectiveness Of Protection Evaluation Example 2

This example presents a security risk assessment of a hypothetical wireless system in the cabin. The security risk assessment has been simplified as much as possible to show mainly the relation of effectiveness evaluation and calculation. 

## E.2.2.1 Asset Identification

Cabin crew accesses applications (e.g. passenger list, manuals) on their mobile devices. Communication is done through HTTP. Attack vectors could be: 
•
Compromised wireless device used by actual cabin crew

•
Malicious passenger using her own mobile device

## E.2.2.2 Impact Analysis

Functional impact is evaluated as Loss of integrity which means a major impact severity. 

## E.2.2.3 Threat Scenario Identification

All possible threat scenarios are defined. Some are listed above: Scenario 1 Description: An attacker connects to the Wireless Access Point, circumvents the wireless authentication mechanism and uses this functional access to misuse functions or tamper with data. Scenario 2 Description: An attacker connects to the WAP, circumvents the authentication mechanism and uses the network-level access to misuse functions or tamper with data. Scenario 3 Description: An attacker compromises the WAP. Since an actual cabin crew device is already authenticated, the route is open. There, the attacker exploits a vulnerability to modify data or functions. Scenario 4 Description: An attacker steals a cabin crew device and uses it to access server functions, using the functional interface to corrupt data. 

## E.2.2.4 Level Of Threat Evaluation

For this example, only scenario 4 is considered. 

Description: An attacker steals a cabin crew device and uses it to access server functions, using the functional interface to corrupt data. 3 security measures are to be considered: On wireless device - SM01: Security recommendations for operators 
- 
Effect: 2  

- 
Type: execution means 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
- 
Rationale: Crew is asked through the Security Operator Guidance to respect good management and best practice aiming at hardening the mobile device. 
On access point - SM03: System availability 
- 
Effect: 1 
- 
Type: Window of opportunity 
- 
Rationale: The access point is active during the complete cruise flight. 
On server - SM08: Additional user authentication 
- 
Effect: 4 
- 
Type: execution means 
- 
Rationale: The user needs to enter a password in addition to the wireless authentication mechanism. This password can be manually regenerated by the crew at any time. Although the authentication mechanism itself may have a stronger effectiveness, the evaluation also considers human behavior that may expose the password to an attacker (password entry can be observed by an attacker, crewmembers speak the password to each other, social engineering). 
 
Security measures are put in the evaluation table below depending on the effect (Preparation means, windows of opportunity, execution means) and respecting the order of evaluation. 

 

| Exposure reduction    | Protection    |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Effectiveness         |               |
| Step                  |               |
| Criterion             | Capping       |
| Preparation           |               |
| Means                 |               |
|                       |               |
| Window of             |               |
| Opportunity           |               |
| SM03 (1)              |               |
| Execution             |               |
| Means                 |               |
|                       |               |
| Effectiveness         |               |
| of protection         |               |
| 1 = 0 + 1             | 1 = 1 + 0     |

 Note that in this case, no capping is used as the maximum combined effects for each of the three criteria (execution means, windows of opportunity and preparation means) are not reached. 

Appendix E E-18 The effectiveness of protection for threat scenario number 4 is evaluated to 7. 

## E.2.2.4.1 Effectiveness Of Protection Level

Finally, the overall effectiveness of protection level for the threat scenario is determined according to the following calculation scale. -> Effectiveness of protection level is "Basic". 

## E.2.2.4.2 Statement Of Adequate Level Of Protection

In this example, functional impact is evaluated as Loss of integrity which is major. According to Table 2-2: Airworthiness Risk Acceptability Matrix, the minimum acceptable level of threat for a major impact severity should be moderate. As the evaluated level of threat is basic, it means that only using the 3 security measures (SM01, SM03 and SM08) the risk is not acceptable and new security measures need to be added. 

## E.2.2.4.3 Identification And Assessment Of New Security Measures

In order to reach an acceptable effectiveness of protection level for this threat scenario, an additional security measure is implemented on the server. On server - SM11: Input plausibility checks 
- 
Effect: 4 

- 
Type: execution means 
- 
Rationale: All applications hosted on the server check cabin crew inputs against syntactical errors before further processing of inputs. 
SM8 and SM11 are two security measures considered as execution means. So, there is a need to determine the combined effectiveness assessment. As they are both implemented on the server, they are not completely isolated. Using the security measure composition assessment process, the combined effect of SM8 and SM11 is determined at 7. On server - SM12: User session timeout 
- 
Effect: 4 

•
Type: Window of opportunity
•
Rationale: The user session is started when a user authentication is successful and is terminated if no input is received from this user for 5 minutes.
SM03 and SM12 are two security measures considered as window of opportunity that are not independent. Because SM03 can be considered a subset of SM12, only the effect of SM12 is used for the combined effectiveness (SM03/12 = 4).

The effectiveness of protection for threat scenario number 4 is now evaluated to 13, and then the effectiveness of protection level is "Moderate". 

|      |       |          | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18    | 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30    |

The minimum acceptable level of threat is now moderate and the risk is acceptable assuming that the four security measures are implemented. 

## E.2.3 Effectiveness Of Protection Evaluation Example 3

This example continues the risk assessment example from Appendix D.2 using the Effectiveness method. 

## E.2.3.1.1 Security Measure Characterization

3 security measures have to be considered: SM01 is the protection provided by security requirement SR1 "The Pressurization Controller shall only accept data download via Ethernet when the aircraft is on-ground and engine is off". Type: Window of opportunity SM02 is the protection provided by security requirement SR2 "The pressurization Controller shall only accept external connections routed via Wireless Bridge when the aircraft is on-ground and engine is off". Type: Window of opportunity SM03 is the protection provided by security requirement SR3 "The AMS system LRUs shall only allow data exchange via Ethernet and CAN interfaces when the aircraft is set to maintenance mode". Type: Window of opportunity The security measures are mainly characterized by their level. In this example, all of them are windows of opportunity and are evaluated using as a guideline Table E-5 "Windows of Opportunity". 

SM01 and SM02 can be defined with an effect between 2 and 6 as they apply on ground when the engine is off. In this case, the effect is better than 2 in the Table E-5 requiring only that the aircraft is on ground but not as good as 6 in terms of a restricted time phase. The evaluation assigns them a 4 effect in this example. SM03 has an effect evaluated to 6 as it is the example provided for the restricted time phase.

| CAN interfaces when the aircraft is set       |
| to maintenance mode.                          |

 As SM01 and SM02 are used together, the combined effectiveness of these two security measures needs to be determined. In this case, as they apply in the same time frame, it is decided to define the combine effect as the same effect as the security measures themselves (4). 

| ID                     |

| Opportunity: 4         |
| SM01 and SM02 have the |
| same effect            |

 

## E.2.3.1.2 Level Of Threat Evaluation For Each Threat Scenario

The order of evaluation is not mandatory but interesting to separate security measures already existing and not related to security from the ones that are added for a security purpose. In the same way, technical security measures are distinguished from operational ones, the reason is that technical measures give the best confidence as they do not rely on human behaviors. Security measures are put in the evaluation table below depending on the effect (preparation means, windows of opportunity, execution means) and respecting the order of evaluation. TS.1 and TS.2 only use SM03 

| Exposure reduction    | Protection    |
|-----------------------|---------------|

| 0 = 0 + 0             | 0 = 0 + 0     |

 The effectiveness of protection for TS.1 and TS.2 is evaluated to 6. In the same way, TS.3 that only uses SM1/2 (combination of SM01 and SM02) is evaluated to 4. In the same way, TS.4 that only uses SM01 is evaluated to 4. 

## E.2.3.1.2.1 Effectiveness Of Protection Level

Finally the overall effectiveness of protection for each threat scenario is determined according to the following calculation scale. The evaluation result for TS.1 and TS.2 is: 

|                                                |                                     |          | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18    | 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30    |

| The evaluation result for TS.3 and TS.4 is:    |                                     |          |                                                   |                                        |

| None                                           | Basic                               | Moderate | High                                              | Very High                              |

 Result: For all for threat scenarios, the effectiveness of protection is "None". 

## E.2.3.1.2.2 Statement Of Adequate Level Of Protection

In our example, all threat scenarios lead to FC.3. "Loss of pressurization for crew and passengers" which is Catastrophic. According to the risk acceptability Table 2-2, the minimum acceptable level of threat for a major impact severity should be Very High. As the evaluated level of threat is None, it E-22 means that only using the 3 security measures (SR1, SR2, SR3) the risk is not acceptable and new security measures need to be added. 

## E.2.3.2 Additional Risk Assessment

For this example, other security measures are considered in order to evaluate the level of threat. 

## E.2.3.2.1 Identification Of Additional Security Measures

Table E-21 provides the security measures previously identified (SM01 to SM03) and the additional ones.

 Result: For TS.1, TS.2 and TS.3, effectiveness of protection level is "Very High". For TS.4, effectiveness of protection level is "High". 

## E.2.3.2.2.2 Statement Of Adequate Level Of Protection

The minimum acceptable level of threat for Catastrophic severity should be Very High. For TS.1, TS.2 and TS.3, level of threat is Very High, so therefore security measures proposed for these three threat scenarios are sufficient to protect against Catastrophic threat conditions. 

For TS.4, level of threat is only High. It means that there is a need to add other security measures to protect against Catastrophic threat conditions. For example, Data load signature verification may have an additional effect in preparation means and execution means for TS.4.

between this example and the example aircraft in Appendix D.4. It is assumed that the severity of the threat conditions above is consistent with the Aircraft FHA. 
2. For the purpose of keeping the example focused and avoiding content duplication, the 
PASRA will not include threat scenarios and their evaluation but should be understood to include a summary of all system level threat scenarios. 
3. A real PASRA (or other source of aircraft level development requirements that can be 
referenced in the PASRA) should include security architecture requirements to introduce e.g. a "two lines of defense" or other security architecture principle into the development process. In this example, the primary aspects of the architecture are defined by Figure D-19, Figure D-20, Figure D-21, Figure D-22 and Figure D-23. 
That changes the role of the preliminary security risk assessment from recommending a secure architecture to evaluating whether the chosen/existing architecture is sufficiently secure or not. 

## E.2.4.3 Preliminary System Security Risk Assessment For Communication Dc (Extract)

Asset: 
- 
Communication DC function, including 
- 
A.C1: Data transfer between Navigation DC and Display DC 
- 
A.C2: Data transfer from/to Communications Systems 
Security Environment: 
- 
EA.C1 = EA.1: Assumption that Passenger Entertainment Area is untrusted. All devices and resources in the Passenger Entertainment Area are assumed to be under attacker control. 
- 
EA.C2 = refinement of EA.2: Assumption that A/C external IP connections through Communications Systems are untrusted. 
- 
EA.C3 = refinement of EA.3: Assumption that government-controlled A/C external connections through Communications Systems are trusted (HF, VHF, TCAS, Approach aids). 
- 
EA.C4: Assumption that internal connections to Navigation DC and Display DC are trusted. 
- 
EA.C5: Assumption that all data between Navigation DC and Display DC is routed through Communication DC. 
Security Perimeter: 
- 
Bi-directional Internet connection through Communication System (via SatCom) 
- 
Bi-directional connections to Navigation DC and Display DC 
- 
Bi-directional connection to Passenger Entertainment Area  
Threat Condition Identification and Impact Evaluation: 

- 
TC1: Loss of availability of the Communication DC function -> Major (based on TC.AF2.1) 
- 
TC2: Loss of availability of Navigation data -> Major (based on TC.AF2.2) 
- 
TC3: TC1 and TC2 -> Catastrophic (based on TC.AF2) 
Threat Scenario identification: 
- 
TS1: DoS attack from the Passenger Entertainment Area on Communication DC (for example TCP flooding) 
- 
Threat sources: Onboard attacker from Passenger Entertainment Area 
- 
Attack path: from Passenger Entertainment Area devices to Communication DC LRUs 
- 
Vulnerabilities: Network protocol design and needed connection bandwidth 
enable attacks on target availability. No additional technical or procedural 
vulnerabilities are needed to start such attacks. 
- 
Security measures: none (due to assumption EA.C1 no security measures in Passenger Entertainment Area can be considered) 
- 
Threat Condition: TC3 
Security measure characterization: n/a Level of Threat evaluation: No protection effect -> 0 points -> "None" effectiveness -> "Very High" Level of Threat Risk statement: 
- 
TS1: Severity: Catastrophic, Level of Threat: Very High -> Risk: not acceptable 

## E.2.4.3.1 Risk Treatment For Ts1:

Note: 
The risk treatment evaluation does not only consider the risk itself but also the consequences for the development and operation. Not all options that would make the risk acceptable can be implemented. Risk treatment options are only included in this example to show the considerations that lead to the next iteration of a risk assessment. These risk treatment considerations do not need to be documented to comply with the DO-326A / ED-202A process (they are typically documented internally to show that no risk treatment option has been missed). 
•
Option 1: Traffic monitoring as additional security measure
•
Option 2:  
Cut the link between Communication DC and Passenger Entertainment
area
•
Option 3: Re-architect avionics network to route data through Flight Control DC
•
Option 4: Partitioning (separation and isolation) in the Communication DC
•
Option 5: Rate-limit the Passenger Entertainment area connection (Firewall?)
○
5a: add as additional LRU
○
5b: add in Communication DC
•
Option 6: Limit availability of PAX area Communication

## E.2.4.3.1.1 Option 1 Evaluation: Traffic Monitoring As Additional Security Measure

Traffic monitoring has no effect as it only logs traffic events on systems. The risk is unchanged. 

## E.2.4.3.1.2 Option 2 Evaluation: Cut The Link Between Communication Dc And Passenger Entertainment Area

Threat Condition re-evaluation: -> Impact severity reduced from CAT to NSE, because TC.1 and TC.2 can no longer be triggered in this threat scenario. Therefore, TS1 is no longer applicable. -> Option 2 avoids the risk. -> Functional implications: Communication functionality will not be available for PAX area. 

## E.2.4.3.1.3 Option 3 Evaluation: "Re-Architect Avionics Network To Route Data Through Flight Control Dc"

Threat Condition re-evaluation: 
•
Impact severity reduced from CAT to MAJ, because TC.2 can no longer be triggered in this threat scenario 
Risk re-evaluation: 
•
TS1-3: Severity: Major, Level of Threat: Very High -> Risk: not acceptable
Appendix E E-30 -> Option 1 reduces the risk significantly but is not sufficient. Additional security measures with "Moderate" combined effect are still required to protect A.C2. 

-> Functional implications: Design changes outside Communication DC needed 

E.2.4.3.1.4 
Option 4 Evaluation: Security partitioning (separation and isolation) in the Communication DC 
 
Security measure characterization: 
- 
SM4 Hardware isolation and separation (diode or 2 distinct DSP) is implemented to segregate communication flows. 
- 
Effectiveness: Hardware based implementation. Attack would require shared resources or technical vulnerabilities to break through the isolation. Isolation 
is not complete because electrical power is a shared resource at a minimum.

Risk re-evaluation: 
•
TS1-4: Severity: Catastrophic, Level of Threat: Moderate -> Risk: not acceptable
•
TS2: [not evaluated in this example]
-> Option 4 reduces the risk significantly but is not sufficient. Additional security measures are still required to provide the second line of defense and to increase the combined effectiveness by at least 9 points. -> Functional implications: Hardware changes in the Communication DC 

## E.2.4.3.1.5 Option 5A Evaluation: Rate-Limit The Passenger Entertainment Area Connection In Additional Lru

Security measure characterization: 
•
SM3: Rate-limit function in additional LRU between Communication DC and PAX area 
○
Effectiveness: Can prevent propagation of the attack to other devices and data flows (including A.C1 and partially A.C2) but will likely become unavailable itself during an attack. Cannot protect availability of data flow between PAX area and Communication DC. Needs fail-secure design (deactivate PAX area interface or block all traffic default behavior) to prevent propagation of repeated attacks.
- 
Vulnerabilities: If SM3 is implemented in hardware (or FPGA with secured firmware access) with self-monitoring, SM3 can be designed as a fail-andrestart measure that can mitigate attacks on itself to a certain extent. Table E-29: Identified Security Measures 

| Effect                                          |

| SM3 Rate-limit                                  |
| Execution                                       |
| means: 12                                       |

| LRU                                             |
| Even flooding attacks using bespoke equipment   |
| and expertise should not be able to cause more  |
| than a temporary unavailability of SM3 itself   |
| without propagation to Communication DC. Note:  |
| A pure COTS based software implementation (e.g. |
| iptables) is not sufficient to reach this       |
| effectiveness (see SM1).                        |

 Level of Threat evaluation: 
- 
12 points -> "Basic" effectiveness -> "High" Level of Threat 
Note: 
Although SM3 reduces the level of threat only by one level, the point scale helps to see that it is actually a strong "Basic" measure, so that even a less effective additional measure would lead to further level of threat reduction. 
Risk re-evaluation: 
- 
TS1-5a: Severity: Catastrophic, Level of Threat: High -> Risk: not acceptable 
-> Option 5a reduces the risk significantly but is not sufficient. Additional security measures are still required to provide the second line of defense and to increase the combined effectiveness by at least 13 points. -> Functional implications: Additional LRU needed 

## E.2.4.3.1.6 Option 5B Evaluation: Rate-Limit The Passenger Entertainment Area Connection In Communication Dc

Security measure characterization: 
- 
SM1: Rate-limit function in the Communication DC 
- 
Effectiveness: Can prevent propagation of the attack to other devices but will 
likely become unavailable itself during an attack. Unless strong isolation of 
hardware and software resources is implemented in the Communication DC, SM1 cannot prevent impacts on the Communication DC itself. Cannot protect availability of data flow between PAX area and Communication DC. Needs fail-secure design (deactivate PAX area interface or block all traffic default behavior) to prevent propagation of repeated attacks. 

○
Vulnerabilities: If SM1 is implemented using COTS network stacks and network filters (iptables), it is likely that implementation vulnerabilities can lead to deactivation or by-pass of the rate-limit function. 
•
SM2: Split passenger area and avionics data functions in the Communication DC
○
Effectiveness: Avoid that avionics data functions are directly accessible from Passenger Entertainment area connections. Cannot protect availability of data flow between PAX area and Communication DC. It cannot be assumed that shared software and hardware resources are isolated without further security
requirements. SM2 therefore cannot protect against attacks that saturate shared resources (e.g. network stack, OS scheduler).
○
Vulnerabilities:

| COTS-based implementation may not      |

| DC                                     |
| The effect is only minimal, because    |
| resource exhaustion may also effect    |
| the avionics data functions and may    |
| be triggerable without dedicated tools |
| or knowledge.                          |

Additional security measures are still required to provide the second line of defense (SM1 and SM2 are not independent) and to increase the combined effectiveness by at least 18 points. -> Functional implications: Software changes in the Communication DC 

## E.2.4.3.1.7 Option 6 Evaluation: Limit Availability Of Pax Area Communication

| SM4 and SM1 combine well, because SM4          |
| prevents propagation of effects if SM1 is      |
| defeated. Although SM4 and SM1 are not fully   |

| not contribute any additional effect.          |

SM3 and SM4 are completely independent, segregated and isolated.

 Acceptable risk treatment alternatives: Option 7, option 8 Option 7 requires either SM3 or SM4 to be assigned SAL3. It is strongly recommended to assign SAL3 to both SM3 and SM4 because there is no margin to accept a reduced effectiveness evaluation in the final risk assessment. Option 8 requires SM4 to be assigned at least SAL2. It is recommended to assign SAL3. All other security measures (SM1, SM5) need to be assigned SAL2.

## E.4 Order Of Evaluation

The order in which security measures are evaluated will not affect the overall result for the threat scenario. But it is often desirable to identify intermediate results in the assessment. The number and order of evaluation steps should be defined and documented according to the intermediate results deemed useful. One common order is the determination of an initial level of threat and a final level of threat to document the identified overall protection. Also common is a distinction between existing and proposed security measures to highlight a need for protection or the effect of added or modified security measures. Another useful order is the determination of an intermediate level of threat taking into account only some types of security measures, for example only technical or operational or management security measures. 

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Example: The final level of threat is the same in Figure E-13 and Figure E-14. That means that there is no difference for risk acceptance. But the different intermediate levels of threat may provide important considerations for the risk treatment strategy. The different representations of security measures in the figures are just a way to distinguish between measures security assessed in the first step from security measures assessed in the second step.

The material introduced in this appendix is for information only and does not constitute a mandatory part of this document. The example methods included in this appendix provide one possibility to assess risk in the context of an aircraft or system. These example methods may require adaptation (by addition, alteration or subtraction) to be used for any given project. Further, these methods may not comply with all objectives listed in the body of the document. Applicants should ensure that the methods selected for a given project are appropriate for their project and obtain early concurrence from airworthiness authorities. 

## F.1 Risk Scoring F.1.1 Severity, Threat, And Protection Scoring

This method applies a scoring for severity, level of threat, and layers of protection, along with simple formulas for combining protection scores for different security measures. All scoring is done on scales 0-10, with the avoidance of the values 0 and 10 except for some corner cases. Most scoring is from 1-9. Severity (SEV) measures the severity of the impact of the attack within a threat scenario, or the worst-case severity across a set of threat scenarios. The Severity scores should be calibrated to meet the following table: 

| Impact             |   Severity (SEV) Score  |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Catastrophic       |                      9  |
| Hazardous/Severe 7 |                         |
| Major              |                      5  |
| Minor              |                      3  |
| No Safety Effect   |                      1  |

The Level of Threat (LoT) is used to measure the threat at various points within a threat scenario. 

The Level of Threat is used in three ways: 1.
To measure the threat at a security perimeter or external interface e.g.: a.
The LoT of the Complete Untrusted Threat measures the attempts to attack the aircraft.
b.
The LoT of a cabin Ethernet port measures the attempts to attack the Cabin network from the port.
2.
To measure the threat to an asset with consideration for the security measures in place, e.g.
a.
The LoT of a flight plan displayed to a pilot by the FMS measures attacks that succeed in compromising the integrity of the flight plan and the FMS in spite of the security measures in place
b.
The LoT of a cabin data store measures attacks on the data store that managed to defeat the firewall isolating the data store from the passengers (and any other protections).
3.
To measure the threat at some intermediate access point with consideration for the security measures in place, e.g. a.
The LoT of a network gateway between an aircraft network and the cabin network measures attacks on the gateway that managed to defeat the firewall isolating the gateway from the passengers (and any other protections).
Trust is the basis for determining the Level of Threat of the external entities to the security perimeter (see point (1) above). As discussed in section 3.1.3.1 "Validation of Trustworthiness", trust is a binary relation ("trusted" or "untrusted") about the nature of the interaction between an entity and a class of assets, especially the class of assets to which the entity can have access, as identified in a Trustworthiness Assumption. The Level of Threat is determined by the class of assets for which the entity is untrusted. The larger the set of assets for which the threat source is untrusted, the higher the Level of Threat, as calibrated so that the LoT for a completely untrusted entity is 10, and the LoT for an entity trusted with the safety of the aircraft itself is 1. The Completely Untrusted Threat is defined as the set of all credible threats per the Aircraft Security Scope. (For considerations on determining credible threats, see section 3.6.2.3 "Attack Attempt Criteria"). 

For points (2) and (3), the Level of Threat scores should be calibrated linearly so that: 1.
The likelihood of an attack from the Complete Untrusted Threat if all of the security measures were disabled is Essentially Certain (LoT=10), 
2.
The occurrence of a Catastrophic safety event due to an attack will satisfy airworthiness requirements when the likelihood is Very Low (LoT=1).

The Level of Protection (LoP) measures the effectiveness of a security measure(s) to stop or mitigate attacks. As such, it looks at the reduction in the threat from the threat of attempts from an access point against the security measure and the assets it protects, and the threat of successful attacks from an access point against the assets. 

The Level of Protection score is subtracted from the Completely Untrusted Threat of 10 to yield the Level of Threat score. Level of Protection scores should be calibrated against the Completely Untrusted Threat and the Level of Threat, so that, e.g. a Completely Untrusted Threat of 10 guarded by a Level of Protection of 7 should result in a Level of Threat of 3. 

Level of Protection may be used in the following ways 1.
To measure the reduction in threat from the LoT of the Completely Untrusted Threat to the LoT of the critical assets. E.g. a.
The reduction in threat from the external Completely Untrusted Threat to the threat to the level A avionics. 
b.
The reduction in threat from the external Completely Untrusted Threat to the threat to Major assets. 
2.
Within the structure of a threat scenario, to measure the reduction in threat along a step of the attack path from one access point to an access point or assets, through a security measure. E.g. a.
The LoP of a firewall between an aircraft network and the cabin network
measures the reduction in the LoT of the threat to the aircraft network from the LoT of the threat to the cabin network due to the protection of the firewall. 
b.
The LoP of the organizational measures protecting a maintenance connection port measures the reduction of the LoT of the threat to the port from the LoT of the Completely Untrusted Threat due to the organizational security policies. 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

3.
Within the structure of a threat scenario, to measure the reduction from the threat of the threat source to the threat to the target asset, through all the security measures cited in the scenario. E.g. a.
The LoP of an attack scenario that uses the cabin SATCOM network to penetrate an ACARS session to the FMS in order to upload a malicious flight plan. 
4.
To measure the reduction in threat due to a specific security measure across those threat scenarios relevant to that security measure. E.g. a.
The reduction in threat across all attacks on the aircraft that go through a cabin network firewall. 
In some circumstances, the threat levels are more easily determined than the protection levels, such as during preliminary design when security measures are not defined, but acceptable threat levels are required. In other circumstances, the protection levels are more easily determined than the threat levels by analyzing the performance of the security measures in comparable conditions. The dependences between the LoT and the LoP falls into two cases, 
1) When Level of Threat is used to derive Level of Protection: LoP(security measure(s)) = LoT(before security measure(s)) - LoT (after security measure(s)) 2) When Level of Protection is used to derive Level of Threat: LoT(asset) = LoT(external access point) - LoP(security measure(s)) Level of Protection scores should be calibrated against the Completely Untrusted Threat and the Level of Threat, so that, e.g. a Completely Untrusted Threat of 10 guarded by a Level of Protection of 7 should result in a Level of Threat of 3.

## F.1.2 Risk Scoring

The Risk Score is then equal to Severity - Level of Protection Score, e.g. the basic criteria 
for acceptability is Risk<=0, or Severity <= Level Of Protection, with two exceptions, based 
on section 2.7.3 "Risk Acceptability Statement". Risk Acceptability: 
- 
When SEV <= 3, an LoP of 1 may be considered acceptable. 
- 
When SEV = 9, an LoP of 9 may be acceptable provided that there is no single point of security failure. 
- 
Otherwise, LoP >= SEV may be acceptable. 

|                           |    |       | Risk Score = Sev - Prot    |   Severity  |
|---------------------------|----|-------|----------------------------|-------------|
| 1                         | 3  | 5     | 7                          |          9  |

| 7                         | 3  | -2 0  | 2                          |          4  |
| 5                         | 5  | -4 -2 | 0                          |          2  |
| 3                         | 7  | -6 -4 | -2 0                       |          2  |
| 1                         | 9  | -8 -6 | -4 -2 0*                   |             |

Note: 
Each threat scenario will have its own SEV, LoT, and LoP See section F.1.4 "Risk Scoring"). The security risk for a system or aircraft is based on the worst-case risks of the threat scenarios. So a system or aircraft has an acceptable risk only if all the threat scenarios have acceptable risk scores. 

## F.1.3 Scoring Guidance

This document does not require a specific means of assigning LoT and LoP, other than the requirement that they be consistent across the stages of a threat scenario, i.e. that LoT (protected access point) - LoP(security measure) = LoT(access point with compromised protection). 

A useful method is to score in the following way: 1.
Assign a Level of Threat to the threat source to summarize the attacker population and the external organizational security policies. (This incorporates Attack Attempt with Exposure Reduction, see section 3.6.2.) Consideration should made for: 
•
The severity of any assets which the threat source is authorized to use - the Level of Threat should be commensurate with the SEV of the authorized assets as shown in Table F-4: Risk Scores. If the assessed LoT is higher than that, then an unacceptable risk may have been identified. 
•
Any limits on attacker capabilities and exposure.
Example 1: Flight Crew have been given authority to operate the aircraft, along with sufficient training and oversight to establish trustworthiness. However, that training and oversight is not as rigorous when it comes to preserving the security of the portable devices that flight crew are authorized to use for flight planning. Example 2: The Public Internet is unbounded on the scope of the attacks it propagates. Passengers are also uncontrolled by any cybersecurity policy, but they are limited as to the resources and bandwidth available in the cabin, which limits broad attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). 

| Threat Source                  |   Level Of Threat (LoT)  |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Flight Crew                    |                       1  |
| Flight Crew Portable Device  5 |                          |
| Cabin Passenger                |                       9  |
| Public Internet                |                      10  |

 
2. 
Assign a Level of Protection to each operational or technical security measure in the attack path. (This incorporates Exposure and Protection, see section 3.6.2.) Consideration should be made for: 
a. 
Consideration for the effectiveness of the security measure in stopping the attack within the context of the threat scenario if there is no failure in the security measure. If the threat scenario was chosen appropriately, this can be a binary decision - either it will stop the attack or not. If the measure will not stop the attack, then LoP = 0. If the measure would stop the attack, assignment of the LoP will be based on considerations (c) and (d). 
b. 
If the decision in (a) is not binary, then effectiveness may be based on the expected time until a repeated attack would succeed (for cryptographic measures, this can be determined through standard reference such as those published by NIST), or the conditional probability of stopping the attack. 
c. 
The LoP should be capped based on the known limitations and vulnerabilities in the security measure. It can be possible to make a binary decision for some vulnerabilities - if they fail the security measure in the threat scenario context 
then LoP = 0. If they do not affect the security measure in that context, then 
the known vulnerability need not be considered in the assignment. Otherwise, a vulnerability assessment such as the CVSS V3 [20] scoring, and the scoring mapped to a cap on the LoP (See table below). 
d. 
The LoP should be capped based on assurances that the security measure is free from defects and unknown vulnerabilities. 
 Example 1: A firewall is effective against black-listed services but is ineffective against attacks that use white-listed services. 

Example 2: Consider a user/password using 8-character user-chosen passwords. For a threat scenario in which the salted hashed password file has been obtained by the attacker, most passwords can be broken quite quickly, so LoP = 1 is reasonable. For a threat scenario in which the attacker is limited to guessing, and passwords are changed on a regular basis, LoP = 4 is reasonable. Example 3: Digital Certificates following the latest standards (e.g. SHA2, 256 bits at time of writing) are suitable for use for 5+ years. Effectiveness is limited by the quality of the implementations and the protection of the confidentiality of the private key. 

Example 4: Following the CVSS V3 [20] scoring, a vulnerability can be classified as Critical, High, Medium, Low, None. It would be appropriate to use the Table F-6: Example of Capping Level of Protection Based on Vulnerability Rating.

 Example 5: A large proportion of known security vulnerabilities as reported in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) [56] are caused by software defects. One approach is to use classic Aerospace Development Assurance Levels (DAL) supplemented by the considerations of the Security-Specific Objectives discussed in section 4.1 and A.1.1 "Security Specific Assurance". It would be appropriate to use the Table F-7: Example of Capping Level of Protection Based on Assurance.

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- Example 6: The firewall feature of a gateway is being used to only allow white-listed services from remote users. Attack through black-listed services is being considered in the threat scenario. The initial evaluation of the intended measure is that it will be effective in that scenario. A vulnerability search finds a vulnerability in the authentication implementation that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload. This vulnerability is rated High. It is determined that the threat scenario includes availability of the gateway as a target, so the vulnerability applies, and so the LoP can be no larger than 3. The development of the gateway satisfies DAL D criteria and conforms to the SSAO 2 objectives, so the LoP can be no larger than 4. Under all these considerations, the assigned LoP is 3. Note: 
For many cases, the LoP of a security measure will be the same in all threat scenarios for which the measure is effective according to consideration (2-a) above and will be 0 for all other threat scenarios. In those cases, a single LoP 
can be set for the security measure, along with the criteria for which threat scenarios apply to that measure. 

## F.1.4 Scoring A Linear Threat Scenario

A linear threat scenario is one with a single sequence of attack, so that the attacker needs to defeat all the security measures in the scenario to attack the target asset. A threat scenario which includes alternate attack paths can be scored by representing it by a set of linear threat scenarios, each characterizing a single sequence of attacks. Alternatively, a threat tree (See section F.2) can be used. To score the SEV of a scenario, take the maximum SEV of all the assets in the threat scenario. In many cases, this will be the same as the SEV of the target assets, but it can be the case that there are threat scenarios in which a high-impact compromised asset is used to attack a low-impact asset. E.g. if a FMS running malware is used to deny service to the cabin passenger network. (It is recommended that such threat scenarios be rewritten to include the high SEV asset as a target asset.) To score the LoP and LoT of the scenario, consider no more than the three security measures with the highest Levels Of Protection. Take the Level of Threat of the threat source and subtract each of the three LoPs to get the Level of Threat for the asset. Then the Level of Protection for the threat scenario will be 10 - LoT According to Table F-3 in section F.1.1. 

Mathematically: 

LoT(scenario) = LoT (threat source) - (LoP(SM1)+LoP(SM2)+LoP(SM3)); LoP(scenario) = 10 - LoT(scenario
 To score the risk of the scenario, compare the SEV of the threat scenario to the LoP of the Threat scenario, so that Risk = SEV-LoP To determine acceptability of a threat scenario, Take the SEV, LoP, and Risk Level of the scenario and apply section F.1.1 and Table F-4. 

## F.1.5 Illustration Of Risk Scoring A Threat Scenario

The following is an illustration to show the scoring guidance above. It is an excerpt from the example in section F.2. The system under analysis consists of three subnetworks, all running standard IP Ethernet: 
1. 

Passenger network - DAL E 

2. 
Maintenance services network - DAL D 
3. 
Avionics support network - DAL C 
Maintenance has some dataflows with the cabin, and Avionics support has some connections to the maintenance services, so there is a cabin-maintenance gateway and a maintenance-avionics gateway, but there are no direct communications between cabin and avionics. The cabin-maintenance gateway can be administered from the cabin network via an administration password. For further details see the Appendix F.3. 

An informal description of the threat scenario would be as follows (Cutset 24 in the Appendix F.2): 
"A passenger uses a weak password to reconfigure the cabin-maintenance gateway. Once in the maintenance network, they pivot through a poorly-hardened maintenance service to get access to a maintenance service to the avionics network. Once again they pivot through a poorly hardened maintenance service to compromise a poorly hardened avionics service." 
Furthermore, for this example it will be assumed that security testing has identified a Critical vulnerability in one of the Maintenance Services running on the Aircraft Network. (Note that this is a departure from the example in Appendix F.3.) Under the guidance of the second paragraph in section F.1.4, Cutset 24 has the highest severity aircraft avionics as its target assets. Cutsets 11, 12, and 42 include those parts of Cutset 24 that target the cabin assets, the maintenance assets, and the aircraft network gateway assets. 

## F.1.5.1 Risk Score For Threat Scenario On Cabin Assets

Scoring of Components of Threat Scenario (Cutset 11): 
Threat Source = A.Passenger LoT_Attack = 9 
Target Assets = I.cabin.net SEV_targ = 1 
Effective security Measures = None LoP_SM = 0 
Scoring of Threat Scenario (Cutset 11): 
Scen_LoT = LoT_attack - LoP_SM = 9 - 0 = 9 Scen_LoP = 10 - Scen_LoT = 10 - 9 = 1 Scen_Risk = SEV_targ - Scen_LoP = 1-1 = 0 
Risk Acceptability: GREEN There is a very high threat, but an acceptable risk to the Cabin Network being corrupted by a passenger. This assessment is moot if the asset is not considered a safety asset and hence may be removed from the security scope for certification reasons.

In this scenario, the attacker seeks to pivot on the white-listed
maintenance services, which will bypass the maintenance/aircraft gateway measures, in order to attack the aircraft avionics on the aircraft network.

## F.2 Threat Trees For Risk Assessment

This section discusses a specific method for identifying threat scenarios and detailed assessment of the level of threat as referenced in sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.4 of DO-326A / ED- 202A Threat trees are a method by which complex threat scenarios involving interdependent or alternate events can be managed and evaluated. They also provide a comprehensive methodology for allocating effectiveness requirements in complex security architectures. 

## F.2.1 Basic Threat Tree

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
A threat tree is a compact representation of all attack paths, modeled as paths between access points and threat conditions. An access path is a sequence of stages of blocked and unblocked access points. An access point is an established connection at a point in the system along with the conditions and permissions necessary for a specific set of functionality. The access points will include: 
•
An access point allowed by the access conditions and limits of the previous stages

- 
An access point that cannot be accessed (i.e. is blocked) blocked by a security measure that may be vulnerable/failed, in which case access will be possible 
- 
An access point that allows an attacker to fail a security measure as allowed by the access conditions and limits of the previous stages 
- 
That terminates 
- 
At the malicious modification of an asset and the creation of a threat condition according to the access conditions and limits of the previous stages The threat tree represents the logic of how events cause other events to occur. Four major classes of event logic are as follows: 
- 
An access point allowed by the conditions and limits of previous stages is modeled as logical "OR" gate, with inputs of all the conditions that allow that access point 
- 
An access point blocked by a security measure and the access point of a successful attempt to defeat the security measure is modeled as a logical "AND" "AND" gate, with two inputs: 
- 
The events that cause the security measure to fail 
- 
The access point that was blocked by the now failed measure 
- 
An access point which will cause a security measure to fail is modeled as a logical "OR" gate, with inputs of all the events that fail the measure. 
- 
The malicious modification of a target asset according to the conditions and limits of the previous stages is modeled as a top level logical "OR" gate, with inputs of all the events that allow that malicious modification. 
See section F.3.2.9 for detailed examples of threat trees. Within the airworthiness security risk assessment, threat trees can be used to manage complex contingent attack paths, establish levels of threat, and to generate compact sets of threat scenarios. They are complementary to the linear threat scenarios where each stage of attack in the threat scenario is an event in the threat tree. Threat trees are essentially event trees consisting of AND/OR gates, and basic events, in which failure events are replaced by events which indicate the presence of a vulnerability, the successful introduction of a threat condition, the action of an attacker, or other operational events which would enable an attack. In some cases, failures which introduce vulnerabilities may also be modeled. For more on the general use and structure of fault trees and event trees, see the NUREG Fault Tree Handbook [50]. Alternate methods of managing the event logic for attack paths include Markov chains and Petri nets. Note: 

1.  A threat tree is not a tree in the mathematical sense of the word. As defined in NUREG 
[50] and ARP4761, there can be common events that trigger multiple events. This is 
very normal in security analysis- attack paths and attackers represent common cause events that can trigger multiple threat scenarios. Standard fault tree software manages common events, but some simplistic fault tree packages, particularly those based on graphics programs, sometimes fail to provide that feature. 
2.  The difference between a threat tree and an attack tree as defined by various security 
assessment methods is that an attack tree focuses on attack events, whereas a threat tree focuses on the failures of the security protection that allow attacks to succeed, 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
allowing analysis of the system requirements, architecture, and design to be modeled directly in the events. 

Threat Trees are generalizations of fault trees to evaluate the potentiality of a threat based on a system architecture and relevant threat conditions and vulnerabilities. Threat trees are particularly useful for modeling those threats which involve more than a simple conjunction of threat conditions and vulnerabilities in complex systems. The seven general classes of events in the Threat Tree as shown in Table F-8 are used in the example in section F.3.2.9, but others can be added as required by the analysis.

Event trees in their origin were used as fault trees, and focused on the frequency of failures, and the frequency interpretation of probability measures. While a frequency of security is possible, it is considered problematic by many analysts. While many methods have been proposed, there is one common factor - all attempt to determine the magnitude of the threat through some measure. And while it is true that all probabilities are measures, it is also true that not all measures are probabilities. None-the-less, well-defined measures all have common properties, which are exploited by event tree tools to evaluate the complex logic of events. In order to take advantage of threat trees, it is necessary to translate the linear scoring of section F.1 into a multiplicative measure. This measure will focus on the failures caused by an intentional attack on a system. Level of Threat determine the qualitative measure of the threat, and Level of Protection determines the qualitative measure of the failure of protection against threats.

 From the model of the threat tree, event tree analysis software can generate the cutsets. Each cutset is a minimal set of basic events that are sufficient to cause the target threat condition. Thus, each cutset is itself a linear threat scenario, consisting of: 
- 
Target threat condition caused by the attack, 

- 
Threat Source(s) that conducted the attack, 
- 
The minimum set of vulnerabilities that had to be present to enable the attack, and 
- 
The minimum set of operational events that had to be present to expose the vulnerabilities. 
By generating the cutsets from the threat tree, the threat scenarios can be managed and determined. The logic of failures and events in the unmitigated system depends on the system architecture. Guidelines can be found in ARP4761 and NUREG-0492 [50]. 

 

## F.3 Example Security Risk Assessment

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The following is an example of the security risk assessment of an installed system. It has been simplified by considering only the threat of having an accessible Ethernet port in the passenger cabin. 

## F.3.1 Security Scope F.3.1.1 Simple Network Description Summary

The Simple Network is intended for use in a commercial transport aircraft. 

The Simple Network consists of three networks, the cabin network dedicated to providing passenger services, the maintenance network dedicated to providing maintenance services and providing some limited data for the cabin services, and the non-critical aircraft network dedicated to providing DAL C services and providing maintenance connectivity for the maintenance services. There is a maintenance gateway between the cabin network and the maintenance network, and an aircraft gateway between the maintenance network and the aircraft network. The maintenance gateway includes an administration account for updating the maintenance gateway, protected by an administration password.  
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
To limit the scope of this example to the cabin connections, the following is also true of the Simple Network: There are no external connections to the aircraft network or the maintenance network other than the gateways. The cabin network allows passengers and administrators to connect to itself with no other authentication. All equipment is in an electronics closet which is physically secured except during heavy maintenance of the aircraft, which is also the only time that software updates are performed. The aircraft gateway is not administered through the Simple Network, but only through shop load. All connections from other aircraft equipment to the aircraft network are point-to-point serial cables. 

## F.3.1.2 Security Environment

Access to the cabin is controlled. During maintenance activities only, authorized crew and authorized support personnel are allowed in the cabin; during boarding, preflight, and embarking only ticketed passengers, authorized crew and support personnel are allowed in the cabin; during taxiing, and all flight phases only ticketed passengers, and authorized crew are allowed in the cabin, in compliance with ICAO airport physical security requirements. Ticketed passengers can access the cabin network and to use the cabin network services anytime that they are allowed in the cabin itself. The gateway administrator is a support person, is authorized by the operator to conduct maintenance on the cabin gateway, and his training, authorization, and actions are the responsibility of the operator for compliance to all applicable regulations. 

## F.3.1.3 Security Perimeter

The cabin network equipment includes multiple Ethernet ports in the passenger cabin, intended for use by passengers and the maintenance gateway administrator. 

## F.3.1.4 Security Assets

The assets consist of the cabin network and its data and services, the maintenance network and its data and services, and the aircraft network and its services. The cabin network and its data and services are all No_Safety_Effect. The maintenance network and its data and services are a mix of Minor and No_Safety_Effect. The aircraft network and its services are a mix of Major and Minor. 

## F.3.1.5 High-Level Security Requirements

The following high-level security requirements have been put in place: 1.
Network packets must not be routed from the cabin network to the aircraft network, and vice-versa. 
2.
The maintenance network administration account must use a strong password.
3.
All services in the Simple Network must be hardened against IUEI.
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

4.
The Maintenance network and the aircraft network must be protected against Denial of Service attacks.
5.
The Gateway Administrators are included in the operator's Security Policies and Procedures and are qualified to maintain the maintenance gateway securely.

## F.3.1.6 Risk Summary And Security Assurance Objectives

Analysis of the cutsets below show that all residual risks are 0 and lower and therefore are acceptable. The Simple Network itself is Major, and allows the propagation of security events, so it is considered a Major severity under IUEI criteria. So, it is subject to the following systemlevel objectives:  
•
Plan for Security Aspects of Certification (PSecAC)

•
System Security Scope Definition (SSSD)
•
Preliminary System Security Risk Assessment (PSSRA)
•
System Security Architecture and Measures (SSAM)
- 
System Security Integrator Guidance (SSIG) 
- 
System Security Verification (SSV) 
- 
System Security Risk Assessment (SSRA) 
- 
PSecAC Summary 
See section F.3.2.1 for a discussion of security assurance assignments for the subsystems and items. 

## F.3.2 Modeling The Security Architecture F.3.2.1 Connectivity

Onboard External Connections There are multiple Ethernet ports connecting to the Cabin network, all accessible for anyone in the passenger cabin. There are no wireless connections to the cabin. There are no other wired connections in the cabin connected to the Simple Network Ground Connections There are no virtual connections from the Simple Network to ground systems. Equipment Connections The cabin network is connected to the maintenance network through the Maintenance Gateway and Filter. The maintenance network is connected to the limited aircraft network through the Aircraft Gateway and Filter. 

## F.3.2.2 Security Control Descriptions 1. Maintenance Gateway Administrative Password

The maintenance gateway administration interface can only be accessed form the cabin network using a password and a user name with the tail number of the aircraft. A strong password policy is a security requirement. 2. 

Maintenance Gateway Packet Filter and Rate Limit The maintenance gateway uses a whitelist of allowed maintenance host and ports, and of allowed cabin hosts and ports. It discards any packet between the maintenance network and cabin network that is not on both lists. It discards any packet to or from the aircraft network. All allowed packets are rate-limited. 3. 

Maintenance Service Hardening There are technical and assurance requirements to ensure that maintenance services are all intended and are effective at protecting against attacks that go beyond the intended services. 4. 

Aircraft Gateway Packet Filter and Rate Limit The aircraft gateway uses a whitelist of allowed aircraft host and ports, and of allowed maintenance hosts and ports. It discards any packet between the aircraft network and maintenance network that is not on both lists. It discards any packet to or from the cabin network. All allowed packets are rate-limited. 

5. 

Aircraft Service Hardening There are technical and assurance requirements to ensure that aircraft services are all intended and are effective at protecting against attacks that go beyond the intended services. 

## F.3.2.3 Attacker Model

The following table is the formal definition of the attacker populations, including Level Of Threat scoring representing the level of organizational control over the attacker population.

## F.3.2.5 Access Path Model

The following table is the formal definition of the attack vectors, internal connectivity, and the access control policies, including severity scoring, the security measures enforcing the access control policies, and which access conditions or threat conditions are blocked or allowed. The combination of access status and connection point is called an Access Condition. Note that ALLOWS/BLOCKED is a binary relationship- either a measure is considered effective at blocking, or it is considered to allow the attacker access with certainty. So, the effectiveness as a security measure is based on the worst case scenario in which it is a blocking measure. This model also assumes that unless there is a security measure controlling access, any access control policy is unenforceable and will be ignored.

## F.3.2.6 Access Path Model For Threat Conditions

The following table is the formal definition of the threat conditions, their internal connectivity, and any applicable access control policy, including severity scoring, the security measures enforcing the access control policies, and which access conditions or threat conditions are blocked or allowed from establishing the threat condition. In this model, threat conditions behave similarly to access conditions, the distinction being access conditions are intended and threat conditions are not. Note that this includes threat conditions which are intermediate in an attack and are not associated with the target. As a result, the list here is longer than the list of threat conditions associated with the information assets in Table F-12.

## F.3.2.7 Defeat Model For Security Measures And Independence Of Measures

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Security measures are defeated through one of three mechanisms: 1.
The presence of a Vulnerability which is exploited by the attacker during the attack. Designated as a Failure in the table below (e.g. F.aircraft.aircraft.services.hardening, where the aircraft services interface has an exploitable software defect). 
2.
The ability of the attacker to tamper with the security measure. Designated as a Threat Condition in the table below (e.g. T.maint.cabin.gateway.misconfig, where the attacker is able to corrupt the configuration file for the gateway through its administration interface) 
3.
The ability to bypass a security measure, which is not designated explicitly in the table below, but is implicitly in the access path models above as an alternate access path to an asset that is not blocked by the security measure. 
 Independence of security measures is shown through the lack of the presence of a failure or threat condition that is common to both. An example below would be T.maint.cabin.gateway.misconfig, in which the deliberate misconfiguration of the gateway can compromise both the filter and the rate-limiting functions. The following table is the formal definition of the security measures, and the threat conditions and classes of defects that can cause them to fail. The defects are modeled separately from the measures to allow the consideration of multiple types of vulnerabilities that can affect a single security measure, and to allow the modeling of common sources of vulnerabilities when there is a failure of independence. The Level of Protection for a security measure depends on the worst-case effect of the different vulnerabilities as expressed in the threat scenarios. Since different vulnerabilities may be expressed in different threat scenarios, this means that the actual Level Of Protection of a specific security measure may differ in different threat scenarios.

The following table is the formal definition of the vulnerability classes, and an appropriate LoP for that vulnerability. When a vulnerability is known to be present, the LoP used in the vulnerability modeling is the LoP of the affected security measures considering that vulnerability. When modeling the possibility of a vulnerability, the LoP is modeled to be consistent with the required assurance level for the asset harboring the vulnerability.

The following is a graphical depiction of the security architecture model defined in sections F.3.2.1 through F.3.2.7. 

## F.3.2.9 Threat Tree For Security Architecture

The following figures illustrate a threat tree which conforms to the security architecture model above. Note that the page number references in the figures are references to the other figures, and not to the pages of this document. The figure page numbers are noted in the figure titles. 

## F.3.2.10 Raw Threat Scenarios

The following are the threat scenarios directly represented from the cutsets generated from the threat tree. Note that there are alternate methods to organize and characterize the threat scenarios, this is only an example. It includes: Cutset A unique label associated with the cutset. 

## Attackers

The users/attackers, source of the attack 

## Exploited Vulnerabilities

Pre-existing exposed defects or weaknesses which were exploited by the attack 

## Compromised Assets And Security Measures

The set of the assets, threat conditions, and security measures which were compromised or involved in the course of the attack. Note: 
that cutsets with the identical set of compromised assets and measures are grouped with a common merged entry here to conserve space. 

## Basic Events

Reference to the basic events in the threat tree in section F.3.2.9 that defined this cutset. 

## Sevs

List of the severities for the Compromised Assets within the threat scenario (same order as in the asset listing) as recorded in section F.3.2.4. 

## Level Of Threat

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Level of Threat of the attackers as recorded in section F.3.2.3. 

## Level Of Protection Of Directly Involved Measures

Level of Protection of the threat scenario based on the directly involved measures and section F.3.2.7. The directly involved measures are those that are part of the cutset (hence were not bypassed) but were not defeated by a threat condition of the attack as identified by the T.* entries in section F.3.2.7 (hence were not tampered with). 

## Target Event Evaluation

Measure of the Threat of the Threat Scenario as evaluated by the Threat Tree in section F.3.2.9 according to section F.2.1. Note that translating this into a Total Level of Threat according to F.2.1 will match the Total Level of Threat computed according to F.1.4. 

Max SEV 
Severity of the Threat Scenario as determined by the worst-case severity (SEVs) of the compromised assets 
Total LoP 
Measure of the total Level of Protection for the threat scenario, based on the LoP of the Measures and the Level of Threat of Attackers according to section F.2.1. 
Residual Risk 
Measure of Security Risk according to section F.1.2.

## F.3.2.11 Validation Of Assigned Level Of Protection For Security Measures

In order to validate that in a preliminary design, an adequate Level of Protection has been assigned to the security measures, the following table can be useful. Each vulnerability caps the LoP of the corresponding security measures. The table has rows for each vulnerability capping the LoP of the corresponding security measure and columns for the classes of assets under protection. In this case, the assets are separated into Minor assets (SEV = 3) and Major assets (SEV = 5). For each class of assets, the set of cutsets is shown which involve one of the security measures and the asset. For example, O.maint.gateway.passwd protects a minor asset in CU02, while it helps protect a major asset in cutsets CU11, CU12, CU24, and CU31 (see section F.3.2.10 for details on the cutsets). The Major Risk Score is then the maximum risk among the four cutsets CU11, CU12, CU24, and CU31, and similarly for the Minor Risk Score. The LoP margin is the maximum of the different risk scores for the row and represents how much the LoP could be decreased and still result in an acceptable risk level for the overall system. For example, O.maint.gateway.passwd has an LoP of 3, and an LoP Margin of 0, which means that it is not possible to decrease the LoP without unacceptable security risk 
(in this case, against a Minor asset.) Considering the discussion in section F.1.2, this also means that if a new vulnerability in the gateway password is found that would materially reduce its LoP, that vulnerability should be mitigated in order to retain acceptable security risk. On the other hand, O.aircraft.maint.gateway.ratelimit has an LoP margin of -3, which means that some decrease in the LoP of the maintenance gateway ratelimit is tolerable.

## Alternate Method Using Stpa-Sec (Informative)

The material introduced in this appendix is for information only and does not constitute a mandatory part of this document. The example methods included in this appendix provide one possibility to assess risk in the context of an aircraft or system. These example methods may require adaptation (by addition, alteration or subtraction) to be used for any given project. Further, these methods may not comply with all objectives listed in the body of the document. Applicants should ensure that the methods selected for a given project are appropriate for their project and obtain early concurrence from airworthiness authorities. 

## G.1 Aircraft Airworthiness Security Process Example Using Stpa-Sec G.1.1 Scope

The scope of this document is to present means of compliance for DO-326A / ED-202A 
activities using the STPA-Sec method as mapped by Table G-1. In this analysis, the usual aircraft functions were considered. The security analysis (STPA-Sec) uses the "Provide maintenance support" function as the Case Study. 

## G.1.2 Document Description

The security process described herein is based on the STPA-Sec method [52]. The full security process is exercised in order to show compliance with DO-326A / ED-202A. A 
compliance table is presented to demonstrate the equivalency between the STPA-Sec steps and the DO-326A / ED-202A activities. 

## G.2 Background

System-Theoretic Process Analysis - Security (STPA-Sec) is a method of Systems- Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP), a methodology based on Systems and Control Theory. The STPA-Sec uses a top-down approach method that consists of some activities: 1 - use Systems Engineering and control theory foundations, 2- identify types of unsecure control, and 3 - identify causes of unsecure control and eliminate or control them. The main parts and defined steps were adapted to the aeronautical industry in order to meet the data requirements and compliance objectives established by DO-326A / ED-202A 
covered activities. The Airworthiness Security Risk Management Framework (DO-326A / ED-202A - Figure 2-1) is composed of three major parts; first dedicated Certification related Activities (Steps 1 and 7) to manage the certification process itself, second the Security Risk Assessment Related Activities (Steps 2, 3 and Decision Gate 4) to evaluate risk based upon identified threat scenarios to determine acceptability and to assess the implemented security. Finally, the acceptability of the risk (Decision Gate 4) will determine the role of third part, the Security Development Related Activities (Step 5 and 6) to implement the required security measures [33]. 

Table G-1 presents the relationship between DO-326A / ED-202A activities and STPA-Sec steps. Each STPA-Sec method's activities are further explained in this section. STPA-Sec method covers the security scope definition and security risk assessment defined the aeronautical standard.

(a) In this level of analysis, asset is considered the system under analysis and its functions. For STPA-Sec activity 1, "use Systems Engineering and control theory foundations", this activity consists of identifying the STPA-Sec losses and accidents, and STPA-Sec hazards according to customer, government agencies and other stakeholders. The list of STPA-Sec losses and accidents, and STPA-Sec hazards should be limited to the development or modification of aircraft systems and the effects of intentional unauthorized electronic interaction that can affect aircraft safety. STPA-Sec Losses and accidents, and STPA-Sec Hazard are defined together with the system owner/stakeholders. The goal is to understand what losses and accidents the system owner/stakeholders care about so one can help prevent them. The STPA-Sec Hazards are a set of high-level mission functional hazards that are linked to the losses and accidents identified previously. The model function control structure is a hierarchical structure where each level imposes constraints on the activity of the level beneath it. On the highest level, the actors are the external entities, systems and personnel that interact with the aircraft. The commands issued by the actor to the aircraft (e.g. STPA-Sec Control Actions) and the responses provided by the controller (e.g. STPA-Sec Feedback) capture the external information flow and entry points required by the security perimeter activity. Going deeper one level, the sensors, the actuators, and controlled process are identified providing the internal information flow and aircraft systems that have interface with the system providing the aircraft's external interface with the security environment. Drawing the model function control structure allows identifies the system boundaries obtaining the security perimeter and security scope of system of interest. STPA-Sec method considers four ways that the system could be lead to a hazardous state such as (i) not providing commands causes a hazard; (ii) providing wrong commands causes a hazard; (iii) providing commands with incorrect timing or order causes a hazard; and (iv) 
commands stopped too soon or applied too long causes a hazard. For STPA-Sec activity 2, "identify types of unsecure control", actions starts the threat condition identification and evaluation as per DO-326A / ED-202A. For STPA-Sec activity 3, "identify causes of unsecure control and provide recommendations to eliminate or control them", this activity is similar to threat Scenario Identification of DO-326A / ED-202A. Each unsecure control action is contextualized in scenarios that created the conditions to the attacker to compromise the asset. The logical and physical (if available at the development stage) architectures are used to create the threat scenarios. Using the scenarios and unsecure control actions (UCA) it is possible the define security goals or requirements to prevent the UCAs. Figure G-1 shows possible security causal factors to be considering during generation of scenarios. Right side concerns to identify inappropriate, ineffective, malformed, or missing control actions while in the left side is interested in to identify the inadequate, malformed or missing feedbacks. 

 
 
Performing a security analysis using STPA-Sec that generates the model function control structure, which contains physical aspects, social aspects, logical and information aspects, operations and management aspects, allows a broad perspective on potential causes for a loss. Besides that, the traceability among the generated artifacts is easier for human reviewers to find any incompleteness. The activities "Security Measure Characterization" (DO-326A / ED-202A section 3.2.3), and "Level of Threat Evaluation" (DO-326A / ED-202A section 3.2.4) should be performed as indicated by DO-356A / ED-203A. 

The next sections present an example using the "Provide maintenance support" function showing the application of STPA-Sec in order to meet the DO-326A / ED-202A activities at aircraft function level. 

## G.3 Use Systems Engineering And Control Theory Foundations G.3.1 System Purpose And Goal

System purpose and goal defines the problem domain through discourse with stakeholders (& documents). The statement explicitly describes the problem, the STPA-Sec preferred approach and the overall goal that will normally be a set of high-level activities representing stakeholders' essential tasks/activities. For this example, the system purpose and goal is "a system for civil aviation to provide secure flight through aircraft maintenance and flight operation in order to support the airline mission". 

## G.3.2 Stpa-Sec Losses And Accidents

STPA-Sec defines loss as an undesired or unplanned event that results in a loss, including loss of human life or human injury, property damage, environmental pollution, mission loss, etc. These are the losses the system owner/stakeholders want to prevent. For the purposes of STPA-Sec as applied to aircraft safety, losses should include any impact to aircraft safety or crew workload, categorized using severity of safety effects. A loss is a specific, highlevel outcome which will impact how a mission is conducted. Table G-2 shows the safety related STPA-Sec losses and accidents considered for the analysis. 

| #ID    | STPA-Sec Losses and accidents                  |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| L01    | Multiple fatalities                            |
| L02    | Violation of operational limits for navigation |
| L03    | Violation of aircraft operational limits       |
| L04    | Loss of integrity of communication             |

 

## G.3.3 Stpa-Sec Hazard

According to STPA-Sec definition, hazard is a system state or set of conditions that, together with a particular set of worst-case environment conditions, will lead to an accident (loss). A set of high-level mission functional vulnerabilities that are linked to the losses identified in section G.4.1.

| H05 Inadvertently load data to aircraft                     | L01, L02, L03, L04   |

## G.3.4 Asset

The system of interest is the aircraft. At this level of analysis, the asset is considered to be the system of interest and its functions. This is a functional analysis, so physical assets are not considered in this level. 

## G.4 Aircraft Security Scope Definition

The security scope establishes the intended operational environment relative to information security, which comprises the security environment and security perimeter (DO-326A / ED- 202A). Figure G-2 provides an operational view and Figure G-3 details the aircraft interfaces and relationship between entities through model functional control structure. 

## G.4.1 Security Environment

The security environment is everything outside the security perimeter that is relevant to the security of the aircraft or system under consideration (DO-326A / ED-202A). Figure G-2 
presents an overview of the environment and its entities. This is part of STPA-Sec - Activity 1 to define and frame the problem; it should consider DO-326A / ED-202A section 3.1.2. Table G-4 provides the assumptions to be considered during the security analysis for this example. 

| #ID                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AS.01 The following items are out of scope of this analysis according to DO-326A / |
| ED-202A:                                                                           |
| Physical security or physical attacks on the aircraft (or ground element),         |
| Airport, Airline or Air Traffic Service Provider security (e.g., access to         |
| airplanes, ground control facilities, data centers),                               |
| Communication, navigation, and surveillance services managed by national           |
| agencies or their international equivalents (e.g., GPS, SBAS, GBAS, ATC            |
| communications, ADS-B).                                                            |

## G.4.2 Security Perimeter

The security perimeter establishes the boundary between an internal security context and the external security environment of the system under consideration - in this case the aircraft. The internal security context is comprised of the assets contained in the security perimeter and the relevant security measures (DO-326A / ED-202A). 

The functional control model structure presented in Figure G-3 (called by DO-326A / ED- 202A as security environment and security perimeter) represents how each entity is related to each other. As a control model, an entity sends a control action to the other and receives a feedback. Black arrows are the Control Actions (CA) and the blue arrows are the Feedback (FB). Arrows are identified as A to Z and "*-FB" is used to identify the feedback related to its CA. Table G-5 shows the highlighted control actions in Figure G-3 between the maintenance and aircraft. Each CA and FB are identified using a number indicating how many CAs or FBs there are for each communication between Controller and Controlled Process (e.g.: embedded in figure flow "C" from ATC to "Cockpit Crew" there are CAs C1 and C2). 

| #ID                                   | Controller    | Communication                |

## G.5 Aircraft Security Risk Assessment

The activities "Security Measure Characterization" (DO-326A / ED-202A section 3.2.3), and "Level of Threat Evaluation" (DO-326A / ED-202A section 3.2.4), shown in Figure G-4, should be performed as indicated by DO-356A / ED-203A. Threat Condition Identification and Evaluation (DO-326A / ED-202A section 3.2.1), and Threat Scenario Identification (DO-326A / ED-202A section 3.2.2) are covered in section G.5.1. 


## G.5.1 Threat Condition And Threat Scenario Identification

STPA-Sec uses the term "Unsecure Control Action" (UCA) to determine the potential for inadequate control leading to a STPA-Sec Hazard. The threat conditions are generated from the UCA together with the effect on system. The assessment of the UCA uses the fact that control actions can happens in four ways: 
1. 

Control commands required for security are not given; 

2. 
Unsecure commands are given; 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

3. 
Potentially secure commands but given too early or too late; 
4. 
Control action stops too soon or is applied too long. 
This analysis focuses on when an action could be unsafe, disregarding how and why the controller could act in such a way; it is important to map the contexts. Table G-6 shows the assessment of control action K2 "CA: Updates load data (e.g. database, software ...)" as an example. Three UCAs are identified in Table G-6 and have associated STPA-Sec Hazards. 

| ID                         |
|----------------------------|
| Too                        |
| Late,                      |
| Too                        |
| Early,                     |
| Wrong                      |
| Order                      |
| K2 Updates load data (e.g. |

| [2] Maintenance provides   |
| the "Updates load data"    |
| command when he/she is     |
| not authorized [H4, H5]    |

STPA-Sec Activity 3 consists of identifying the Causal Factors that may lead to the threat conditions identified in STPA-Sec Activity 2. The Causal Factors are the vulnerabilities used in the attack. So, first of all, scenarios are identified and then the causal factors. Table G-7 shows the analysis of unsecure control action 1 (U.C.A. 1) as an example. 

Security design recommendations, called by DO-326A / ED-202A as security measures, are generated along with the threat scenarios. Other relevant information about threat scenarios is presented in Table G-8.

 This appendix provides an example; as such, it addresses the assessment of only one Unsecure Control Action. Similar analysis should be performed for all others. The goal of this step is to generate design recommendations that will be translated to security requirements. The STPA-Sec analysis is completed when the security design recommendations are generated. To conclude; a security environment and perimeter were generated (see Figure G-3) which guides STPA-Sec aircraft security risk assessment to identify the threat conditions and threat scenarios. The description of threat scenarios along with the functional control model structure (see Figure G-3) should be enough to assist in scoring the threat scenarios as per DO-326A / ED-202A.

In order to tie the STPA-Sec result together to DO-326A / ED-202A, Table G-8 shows Threat Condition (effect), TS Causal factors, Attack vector, Attack path, Threat Condition Classification, Security Category, and Security Attribute. Security attribute column shows how an asset can be affected by threat condition. Security category column shows the threats leading to violate the security attributes - it is important to classify each threat condition as affecting Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability (CIA) because these properties have to be preserved. Threat Condition Classification added is based on DO-326A / ED-202A (it is out of scope of STPA-Sec). 

## Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Methodology (Informative)

The material introduced in this appendix is for information only and does not constitute a mandatory part of this document. The example methods included in this appendix provide one possibility to assess risk in the context of an aircraft or system. These example methods may require adaptation (by addition, alteration or subtraction) to be used for any given project. Further, these methods may not comply with all objectives listed in the body of the document. Applicants should ensure that the methods selected for a given project are appropriate for their project and obtain early concurrence from airworthiness authorities. 

The Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Methodology (CRAM) follows the core principles for risk assessment methodology described in section 3.2 Risk Assessment Method Framework and provides a simple, repeatable method that utilizes inputs developed in the main body of this document. 

## H.1 Process Overview

The process steps are as follows: 
1.
System/Airplane Characterization - Performed at system level then at the airplane level. This is covered by section 3.1 Security Scope. 
2.
Vulnerability Identification - Based on available interfaces, protocols, and software. This is covered by section 3.4 Threat Scenario Identification. 
3.
Threat Identification & Assumptions - Based on security environment and assumptions. This is covered by section 3.4 Threat Scenario Identification. 
4.
Security Measures Analysis - Are the controls effective against the threat? Are there any gaps? This is covered by section 3.5 Security Measure Characterization. 
5.
Misuse Cases & Chains of Protection - What are the possible threat scenarios/attack vectors/paths? This is covered by section 3.4 Threat Scenario Identification. 
6.
Ease-of-Execution - How likely is it for an attacker to successfully carry out an attack
based on the possible threat scenarios, the attacker's skill level, availability of tools, 
time to attack, etc. Determine the Level of Threat (Likelihood). 
7.
Security Based Fault Hazard Assessment - Determine the Severity of Threat Condition Effect (Impact) for the asset. This is covered by section 3.3 Threat Condition Identification and Effect Evaluation. 
8.
Required SAL - This is covered by section 4.4 Security Assurance Levels (SAL).
9.
Initial Risk Determination - Determine if the risk is acceptable or if more work needs
to be done. This is covered by section 2.7 Risk Acceptability.
10.
Operator Guidance - Analyze design, procedures, and possible threat scenarios to determine if an update to operator guidance is needed to mitigate risk.
11.
Residual Risk Determination -> Risk acceptance - Has to be acceptable, based on risk acceptability matrix. This is covered by section 2.7 Risk Acceptability.
The figure below shows the process overview. 

## H.2 Methodology In Detail

As previously stated, the method actually begins at step 6 of the process, Ease-of-Execution.

## H.2.1 Ease-Of-Execution

Analyze possible threat scenarios and threat actors, and determine how likely is it for an attacker to successfully carry out an attack based on the possible threat scenarios, the attacker's skill level, availability of tools, time to attack, etc. Ease-of-Execution is defined and mapped to a level of threat in the table below. 

Ease-of-Execution Level 
Ease-of-Execution Definition 
Level of Threat 
Very High 
Routine 
Comparable to what is required for an infection of personal computers through common internet, open source, and malware tools 
High 
Non-Trivial 
Comparable to what is required for an attack of a well-defended corporate network 
Moderate 
Challenging 
Proof of concept demonstrated in lab or simulation, but has not yet been seen in the wild and does not seem possible in real life airplane environment 
Implausible 
No apparent weakness or vulnerability 
Low Extremely Low 
No Path 
No physical connection, or a connection that is restrained by a physical control, i.e. data diode 

Routine definition was borrowed from traditional ground-based IT systems. It means the tools and/or skills required to carry out such an attack are similar to those required for an attack on personal computers, e.g. common internet, open source, and malware tools. Nonetheless, there are further constraints on the attacker such as physical accessibility and procedures. Non-Trivial definition was also borrowed from traditional ground-based IT systems. It means the tools and/or skills required to carry out such an attack are similar to those required for an attack on a well-defended corporate network. Nonetheless, there are further constraints on the attacker such as physical accessibility and procedures. "Well-defended corporate network" means the network of a company with name brand recognition that has the capital to invest in a security infrastructure, so more sophisticated tools and/or skills would be needed to defeat that. 

Challenging means proof of concept demonstrated in a lab or simulation but has not yet been seen in the wild and does not seem possible in a real life airplane environment. For example, someone could demonstrate an attack in a computer lab or at a hacker conference, but the reality is that it has not been (or currently cannot be) demonstrated on an airplane due to physical accessibility to the system, procedures, security measures, the differences between airplane systems and simulations, etc. Implausible means no apparent weakness or vulnerability. While there is a path, there are appropriate technical and procedural security measures in place where such an attack would be implausible even for an attacker with special tools and/or skills. No Path means there is literally no physical connection that an attacker can use in a threat scenario. It can also mean the use of a physical control, i.e. data diode, which results in no path for the threat scenario in question. The level of threat is Extremely Low as there is no such thing as zero risk. The advantage of using ease-of-execution as a measurement is that it is specific to security whereas many other measurements are borrowed or derived from safety. This aligns with Execution Means from the Security Effectiveness Method in Appendix E which assigns points based on the attacker's knowledge mapped to equipment needed to carry out an attack. The disadvantage is that ease-of-execution can potentially change over time with the availability of tools. For this reason, ease-of-execution is one of several considerations in this risk assessment methodology with the others being security requirements, security measures, threat condition assessment, and operator guidance. Further, even though easeof-execution can potentially change over time, regulators require the DAH to monitor their designs for changes to the effectiveness of security measures. Each threat scenario has several execution steps which should be scored and AND'ed or OR'ed to arrive at the final score for the threat scenario. In general, sequential steps in a threat scenario are AND'ed, and when there is a choice of systems to compromise to get to the next step, those are OR'ed as an attacker only needs to compromise one of them to proceed. The first step in a threat scenario is almost always obtain design knowledge, whether it is generic/publicly available or custom/proprietary. This aligns with the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing. The following steps may include the following: create injectable code, compromise system, create exploit, and execute exploit. 

## H.2.2 Threat Condition Assessment

The threat condition assessment can be thought of as a 'security-based fault hazard assessment'. This determines the severity of threat condition effect (impact) for the asset. Further analysis should be done as there can be a difference between safety based and threat condition assessment. Each hazard effect enumerated in the safety-based hazard assessment should be reviewed and analyzed from the perspective of malicious intent and cyber security. Systems should be analyzed for additional or changed hazard effects as a result of malicious intent and cyber security attacks. For example, safety designs often employ redundancy to mitigate the impact of a system failure. Many times, these redundant systems are identical hardware and software. When viewed from the perspective of a cyberattack, the redundant system does not provide independent security measures. Should an attacker successfully exploit one system, then it should be considered that the redundant system is also exploited thereby nullifying any reduction of hazard impact due to redundancy. Severity of threat condition is defined in section 3.3 in Table 3-1. 

## H.2.3 Required Security Assurance Level (Sal)

How to assign SAL of an asset is already described in 4.4 Security Assurance Levels (SAL). 

SAL is defined in Table 4-3: Security Assurance Level Definition. 

## H.2.4 Initial Risk Determination

The risk acceptability matrix is defined in Table 2-2 from section 2.7. The inputs are the level of threat (Likelihood) obtained from the first 6 steps of the process and severity of threat condition effect (impact) obtained from steps 1 and 7. The output is whether or not the initial risk determination is Acceptable. If the risk level is Acceptable and the mitigations are effective against the level of threat, then the assessor can proceed straight to step 11 "Residual Risk Determination". However, if the risk level is Unacceptable, more work is required. There is little one can do to change the severity of the threat condition effect as it is based on the asset's Design Assurance Level (DAL) and Threat Condition Assessment. However, one can affect the Level of Threat to bring the risk down to Acceptable. One way is to implement additional security requirements which may affect the design and/or the security measures. The process has a feedback loop so that the assessor stays in the feedback loop until the risk determination is deemed Acceptable. For this reason, it is important to perform risk assessments early while the design and/or security measures can still be influenced. Initial (as well as Final/Residual) Risk Determination needs to be performed for each threat scenario, summarized by system, and then summarized at the airplane-level as required (refer to section 2.3) to determine the risk and whether or not it is acceptable. 

## H.2.5 Operator Guidance

Another way to bring the risk down to Acceptable is to consider additional operator guidance as external/procedural security measures, especially if there is a threat scenario that involves maintenance devices and USBs in which case Ease-of-Execution is dependent on level of control and isolation maintained by airline. This can potentially mitigate risk and lower the overall risk level. This also aligns with DO-326A / ED-202A Aircraft Security Operator Guidance (ASOG) as part of the certification evidence. 

## H.2.6 Residual Risk Determination

After applying additional security requirements and operator guidance (if needed), use the risk acceptability matrix from section 2.7 to determine the residual risk. All the threat scenarios and their residual risk determinations should then be examined to determine the overall risk to the airplane and whether or not the airplane-level risk is acceptable. 

## H.3 Example Put Through Methodology - Gpws

The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) resides in the Aircraft Control Domain (ACD) with the primary GPWS function partition at DAL C and the maintenance partition that supports dataload at DAL D. GPWS has a direct Ethernet connection to a Network Gateway Device (NGD), a DAL D system in the Airline Information Services Domain (AISD). The GPWS includes a front panel Ethernet port and Universal Serial Bus (USB) port. Both ports support dataload. 

 

## H.3.1 Ease-Of-Execution Example

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Threat Scenario: The attacker injects malware from the NGD, USB port, or Ethernet port onto the GPWS. An attack from the NGD would be executed across the Ethernet. The GPWS USB and Ethernet ports are located in airplane secure zones, where physical access to the secure zone is restricted to authorized and trusted personnel. The threat mechanism for the USB and Ethernet ports would be a compromised maintenance device. For compromised maintenance devices and USBs, Ease-of-Execution is dependent on the level of control and isolation maintained by an airline. Airline procedures ensure that the maintenance devices and USBs are physically controlled and kept isolated from all sources of malicious code and unauthorized access. The attack steps are as follows: Obtain Proprietary Design Knowledge of the GPWS -AND- Create Attack Test Capability -AND- Create GPWS Injectable Malware -AND- Compromise Connected Device

--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
-AND- Create and Execute GPWS Exploit The detailed description of the attack steps and rationale for their ease-of-execution are as follows: Obtain Proprietary Design Knowledge of the GPWS: It is assumed that proprietary aviation design information could be compromised. Design knowledge includes system configuration management knowledge. Obtaining configuration management knowledge provides information concerning current and planned releases, part numbering, and time stamps. Obtaining proprietary design knowledge, i.e. design documents, is more of a corporate attack, so this step is **Non-Trivial**. Actually building a test bench for the GPWS would be more difficult as described in the next step. Create Attack Test Capability: It is assumed that loadable software, proprietary aviation hardware/software, and other design information could be compromised. Design knowledge also includes obtaining any source, assembly tools, and hardware parts. By definition, Challenging means proof of concept demonstrated in a lab or simulation, so the Create Attack Test Capability step and getting to the appropriate maturity where demonstration on an actual airplane is possible is considered **Challenging**. Create GPWS Injectable Malware: Creating the code itself is not difficult for a skilled attacker. However, it becomes more difficult if the code is based on proprietary operating systems, software development language, and/or tools, in which case additional knowledge and/or experience is required. It is assumed that the tools and/or skills required to carry out such an attack are similar to those required for an attack on a well-defended corporate network which also has proprietary software. This step is considered **Non-Trivial**. Compromise NGD: The NGD is a potential platform for an attack against any connected device, in the ACD or otherwise. This potential is only realizable if the device itself has been successfully attacked and compromised. The design reduces the potential of a successful attack by various design considerations. In this example, all interfaces restrict data using firewalls. The operating system kernel has been hardened to only contain features necessary for operation. Applications and services are disabled or removed if they are not required for operation. While there is a path, there are the appropriate technical and procedural security measures in place where it would be **Implausible** even for an attacker with special tools and/or skills. Compromise USB or Ethernet port: Obtain access and add the malware. Ease-ofexecution is dependent on the level of control and isolation maintained by an airline. It is assumed that the tools and/or skills required to carry out such an attack are similar to those required for an attack on a well-defended corporate network. There are further constraints on the attacker such as accessibility and procedures. For these reasons, this step is considered **Non-Trivial**. Create and Execute GPWS Exploit: The attacker executes an exploit against an Ethernet interface in order to inject malicious code into the target device. An Ethernet exploit depends on the services and protocols available on the interface being exploited. GPWS has a hardcoded Ethernet stack that only allows a specific IP address and limited ports and protocols. GPWS also validates all the data immediately after it is received from the stack. The communication exchange is very deterministic. For these reasons, this step is considered **Challenging**. The USB port is not restricted as it is with Ethernet. However, the input data is still validated, and there are physical access restrictions.

## H.3.2 Threat Condition Assessment Example

In this example, the severity of threat condition is summarized. 

The primary GPWS function partition at DAL C and the maintenance partition that supports dataload at DAL D, per ED-12 / DO-178. For the purpose of this example, Severity of Threat Condition Major (associated with DAL C) which requires a lower level of threat to have an acceptable risk. 

The NGD is DAL D, i.e. attacks against it alone are **Severity of Threat Condition Minor**. 

 

## H.3.3 Required Security Assurance Level (Sal) Example

A Security Assurance Level 1 or higher is assigned to every security measure implementation to ensure an effective protection of the aircraft. SAL 2 is assigned to at least one security measure in every aircraft-level threat scenario that leads to a Threat Condition with Major severity.

## H.3.4 Initial Risk Determination Example

The initial level of threat is Low for the NGD path and Moderate for the GPWS USB and Ethernet paths. Since the severity of threat condition effect for this attack on the GPWS is Major, this yields Acceptable. Table H-5: Risk Determination

 Even though the risk of injected malware is acceptable, the applicant still has the option of lowering the risk further. The applicant can do this by going through the feedback loop and applying additional security requirements to the GPWS and interfaces. This includes 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
applying additional security measures appropriate for a Major. The applicant can also do this by adding operator guidance, which is applicable to handling the USB and Ethernet ports on the GPWS. Each threat scenario produced by step 5, Misuse Cases and Chains of Protection, should go through the risk assessment method denoted specifically by steps 6-11. All the threat scenarios and their residual risk determinations should then be examined to determine the overall risk to the airplane and whether or not the risk is acceptable. It helps to summarize the results by system, and then summarize at the airplane-level. The risk assessments for all threat scenarios have to be acceptable.

## Security Architecture And Measures (Informative) I.1 Using Domains To Describe Security Architecture

One way to describe security architecture is through network-based domains. While domains can be used by the applicants at their discretion, they are not required, therefore the domain discussion is limited to this appendix. Networks have become more common within aircraft and provide greater connectivity between systems than legacy point-to-point databuses. This enhances capability but increases potential threats. Networks can be described as a domain with specific architecture, perimeter and policies. 

A domain as defined here is an architectural element finer than a domain of functions, but potentially coarser than a network or sub-network. The requirement is that a domain is a set of controlled architectural entities in the sense that inter-domain communications are subject to specifications and interface requirements. A domain is a collection of technical requirements, and not an assurance domain. Note: 
Security (sub) domains can be defined hierarchically, and so can be applied at any level of requirements management: aircraft, system, or subsystem. 

Security domains collect and manage functional requirements and use Domain Control Policies to manage the interaction and expectations between the domains. Security domains aid in the communication of security risks and mitigations and simplify the identification of overlapping requirements identified through the safety process. Allocation of devices and networks to domains can be made on any basis, but one important example is ARINC 811 [12] and ARINC 664 Part 5 [9] which provides for domains defined primarily on the basis of functionality. However, purely functional domains are insufficient for managing security policies. If functional domains are to be used as part of the security measures, as security domains, they need to be managed as part of the security architecture and security requirements. Functional domains have been defined in special conditions and provide means to show that those domains are identified and controlled and perform as an effective security measure. The reason for using security domains is to be able to create a level of architectural security separation between domains based on the domain specifications themselves. Security domains: 
•
Capture current practices in safety assurance and network architecture,

•
Abstract those properties that would be most useful to security architectures and properties,
•
Offer a unified approach to capturing trustworthiness relationships between devices and networks in a heterogeneous architecture, and
•
Offer a unified approach to managing trustworthiness relationships between domains in a heterogeneous architecture.
Within this guidance, a domain allows control of the local interfaces between domains, similar in intent to Interface Control Documents, as the means of providing control of domain separation. Domains are not, and cannot be, completely separated from each other, due to the heterogeneous communication requirements of modern aircraft systems. 

Assigning domains simplify the task of assessing technical requirements by providing separation properties. They will include systems of various assurance levels. 

## I.1.1 Domains Under Arinc 811 And 664 Part 5

As previously mentioned, ARINC 811 [12] and 664 Part 5 [9] provides for domains defined 
primarily on the basis of functionality. It is not required to conform to functional domains as defined in ARINC 811 [12] and 664 Part 5 [9]. However, if such conformity is desirable, the following definitions can be used. 
- 
The Aircraft Control Domain (ACD) is a closed domain that controls the aircraft. The ACD consists of systems and networks whose primary functions support the safe operation of the aircraft. The ACD is primarily focused on digital, and more specifically, Internet Protocol (IP) data networks. The justification for most of these systems is traceable to safety of flight. When these systems perform non-safety 
related functions, it should be demonstrated that there is no interference with safety related functions. 
- 
The Airline Information Services Domain (AISD) is a private domain that operates the aircraft. The AISD may provide services and connectivity between independent aircraft domains such as avionics, in-flight entertainment, cabin distribution and any connected off-board networks. The AISD provides a security perimeter, incorporating network routing and security measures/services between AISD and less 
critical domains and any connected wireless networks. 
- 
The Passenger Information and Entertainment Systems Domain (PIESD) is a private domain that informs and entertains the passengers. The PIESD is characterized by the need to provide passenger entertainment and network services. The PIESD is defined to include more than traditional IFE systems; that is, any device or function of a device that provides services to passengers. It may contain multiple systems from different vendors which may or may not be interconnected to one another, and its borders may not necessarily follow physical device borders. The PIESD can provide connectivity for the PODD into the on-board services of the PIESD or even the offboard environment. 
- 
The Passenger Owned Devices Domain (PODD) is a public domain that informs and entertains the passengers. The PODD is defined to include only those devices that passengers may bring on board. They may connect to the airplane network or to one another. Their connectivity to the airplane network is defined to be provided by the 
PIESD. Until they connect via the PIESD, the PODs should be considered external to the airplane network. They may connect to one other or directly off-aircraft to ground systems without involving the airplane network. 
ARINC 664 Part 5 [9] uses these definitions as well. Further, ARINC 664 Part 5 [9] states that the ACD can be divided into two subdomains: 
- 
Flight and Embedded Control System Sub-domain, where the aircraft is controlled 
from the flight-deck 
- 
Cabin Core Sub-domain, which provides environmental functions dedicated to cabin operations, such as environmental control, passenger address, smoke detection, etc. 
- 
The AISD can be subdivided into two subdomains: 
- 
Administrative Sub-domain, which provides operational and airline administrative 
information to both the flight deck and cabin 
- 
Passenger Support Sub-domain, which provides information to support the passengers 

## I.1.2 Network Security Domain Considerations

A domain is a subset of aircraft systems and networks with common architectural objectives, which provide the means to do the following where required, based on relevance of the threat scenarios: 
- 
Specify and manage the types of interactions between domains, 

- 
Specify and manage baseline policies within a domain, 
- 
Specify an architectural means for controlling external connections, 
- 
Organize and manage defense-in-depth security architectures, 
- 
Specify a means of relief for hosts within a domain from safety-related security requirements by satisfying those objectives at the domain level. 
A domain is characterized by: 
- 
Domain security rules and requirements, 
- 
Domain perimeter, and 
- 
Domain control rules and requirements. 
Domain security rules and requirements are the set of technical and assurance requirements for the domain itself, which help to support risk assessment. The domain perimeter is the set of devices and ports within the domain which connect the domain to devices or networks outside of the domain. For example, if a device has a VPN connection to something outside the domain, then that device is included in the domain perimeter. This is a logical rather than a physical determination. A partitioned system can include partitions that are in different domains. It is the intent of domain characterization to require all aircraft devices or partitions, including network devices and network interfaces, to be assigned exclusively to one domain or another. A common resource such as a satellite connection or network bus are required to be part of a domain and either only serve clients within the domain or offer services to clients in other domains subject to the external domain control policies of the resource and client domains. This serves to eliminate any possibility of "backdoor" interactions that would be outside the scope of the domain control policies. As an illustration of the use of the domain perimeter see Figure I-1 with two subnets connected by a gateway, if there is a port Ap on Device 1 in domain A connected to a Gateway Device 4 connected to port Cp on Device 6 in domain C, Gateway Device 4 could be allocated to either domain A or C, but if it is allocated to domain C, then device 1 with port Ap will be a boundary device of domain A. In either case, due to the required VPN connection, Device 3 and Device 5 which are logically connected across the domain boundaries, are also boundary devices of their respective domains. 

## 

 Domain control rules and requirements specify the external safety-related security requirements and objectives for all communications between the domain and devices external to the domain, and any internal safety-related security requirements and objectives which apply to communications between neighboring devices within the domain. They also specify those security requirements that might be applied to the domain devices, but for which the domain itself takes responsibility. Examples of possible contents of domain control rules and requirements include: 
- 
Allowed open ports and protocols and services, 

- 
Protocol restrictions across boundaries, 
- 
Technical requirements for authenticated logical channels such as VPN or SSL, 
- 
Associated security assurance requirements for the domain and for its devices, 
- 
Technical requirements for communications between particular domains, such as from a passenger domain to a private domain, and 
- 
Safety-related security requirements and objectives for communication within the 
domain. 
A normal use of a domain will be to prevent devices outside the domain from communicating or interfering with devices in the domain except for the authorized connections with boundary devices. Non-boundary devices should satisfy security requirements associated with the threat from their intended communications within the domain but need not consider the threat from unintended communications from outside the domain, except if the severity of the impact of their failure is higher than is appropriate for the assurance level of the domain. Boundary devices should consider the threat from 
--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
unintended communications from outside the domain since they are open to such communications. Domains may be used to provide confidentiality between devices internal to the domain and external to the domain. Practically speaking, this use is limited to the extent that confidentiality can be expressed in terms of allowed communications between devices due to the technical difficulties in finding effective mechanisms for a third-party boundary device to detect the passing of confidential information. In the case of security, many of these separation requirements will be in the form of prohibitions against certain forms of functionality (e.g., limitations on dynamic ports, limited access without authentication, no unspecified services), which can provide a challenge in the verification phase and in the allocation of responsibilities between developers and integrators. It is possible and common-place to have a mix of assurance levels within a domain. Often the point of specifying a domain with an assured boundary is to provide a "safe haven" for weak systems and hosts. The overall security of the domain then depends on complete control over the external interactions by the assured devices. (See the discussions below on "intrinsic" and "enclaved" domains.) Thus a domain will often accommodate a range of assurance levels for the devices and networks which are allocated to a particular domain. There is no a-priori assurance requirement for particular assurance levels or limitations, but designers may choose to enforce such a range. It might make sense that a dedicated line of defense has a similar security assurance applied. The security assurance level should be driven by the target of the threat scenarios that are protected by the security measures between the threat vector and the target. A domain approach usually bundles many threat scenarios and protects them with shared security measures. 

## I.1.3 Technical Basis For Network Security Domain Control

There are potentially many technical solutions for controlling and separating domains. It is the purpose of this section to establish three broad classes of technical measures that are common in airborne systems. These definitions are dissimilar to traditional national security architectures in that their emphasis is on integrity and availability over confidentiality. Airborne networks and devices are traditionally designed with integrity and availability always in mind. For most data, confidentiality has not been assessed as a significant airborne system concern. Where it is a concern, specific provisions for confidentiality of that data may be made. An unsecured domain (see Figure I-2) is a domain within which neither the networks nor the boundary devices provide sufficient integrity and availability assurance for device-todevice communications within the domain. As a result, the devices themselves are responsible for providing protection from intentional unauthorized electronic interaction, even if they do not intend to communicate with external systems. This is the situation for those IP-based networks that allow devices to dynamically establish connections to external systems, even if those communications occur through a firewall, unless there is sufficient assurance that external connections will not be made with any device in the domain (in which case, it is an enclaved domain, see below). An unsecured domain may be used if all devices are required to be responsible for mitigating their own security risk associated with the threat identification for the domain as a whole. An intrinsic domain (see Figure I-3) is a domain within which the networks and network interfaces themselves provide integrity and availability assurance for device-to-device communications throughout the domain. This is common in airborne flight control networks designed for high safety-related integrity and availability. Such networks provide antiimpersonation and anti-babbling guarantees in the presence of hosts with low integrity and availability. When a network allows multiple devices to share network resources, this necessarily implies that the assurance level associated with the network resources within the domain is equal to or exceeds the highest assurance level of any device in the domain connected to that network. In some network architectures, actual hard-wired connections may allow assurance of device identity without the need to assure the network resources themselves (although availability can require special attention). A network can be used in an intrinsic domain if a device can trust the network to (a) be there (availability), and (b) to tell it which device sent any message received by the receiving device. A trivial example is the use of point-to-point links. Other technical alternatives include high-assurance busses which enforce addressing through firmware or hardware configurations which cannot be modified by the devices themselves.

An enclaved domain (see Figure I-4) is a domain within which the boundary devices provide the integrity and availability assurances for the domain for security purposes. This necessarily implies that the assurance level associated with the boundary devices for the domain is equal to or exceeds the highest assurance level of the devices within the domain. 

 
All the classes have advantages and disadvantages. Networks that qualify for use in an intrinsic domain are generally higher cost than networks used in enclaved or unsecured domains. In an enclaved domain, all boundary devices satisfy the domain assurance and effectiveness requirements and objectives in addition to their own. In an intrinsic domain, only the network should satisfy the domain assurance and effectiveness requirements. The boundary devices may only satisfy their own requirements. In an unsecured domain, all devices should protect against all threats to the domain. In either an intrinsic or an enclaved class of domain, the non-boundary devices may only satisfy their own security requirements (which can include security requirements associated with a penetration of the domain itself). Note:  
It is possible for a single domain to be both intrinsic and enclaved. 

## I.2 Common Modes For Security Measures

The three major classifications of common modes for security are Independence, Diversity and Isolation. In order to understand the difference between these characteristics, examples are provided. Independence If a security architecture uses a firewall that allows certain connections to pass if authenticated, the firewall is dependent on the authentication service. The firewall is only able to provide its full security measure of blocking connections based on the strength of the authentication service. It may be fully effective for all connections it blocks at all times (e.g. if it always blocks a specific port range) but will be effective only as strong as the authentication services for specific port ranges (e.g. authentication on a specific port that will be allowed based on authentication token given to firewall). If the authentication service is of lower assurance than the firewall, it effectively lowers the combined effectiveness of the security measures of the firewall and authentication service for those port ranges, as detailed in section 3.6.3. 

Diversity Diversity is not binary in assessment and needs to be considered carefully if appropriate measures have been taken based on the specific lack of diversity identified. 

•
Two identical firewalls with same filter set have very low diversity

•
Two identical firewalls with different filter rules have a higher diversity but may have common flaws in the firewall implementation
•
Two different firewalls with same filter set have a higher diversity but may have common flaws in the rule set
Diversity extends beyond the implementation and requirements phase and needs to include other technological aspects such as the coding language and language framework. If two security measures are written in a common coding language that runs in a framework, such as a just-in-time compiler, they share code and a common environment that may expose both security measures to the same vulnerabilities. Isolation Isolation needs to consider both physical and logical boundaries. For the latter, some cases of logical separation may be sufficient but not necessarily in all cases. 1.

Two security measures hosted on different physical devices with no shared resources (different processors and memory) are fully isolated.

2.
Two security measures hosted on different processors but shared memory are not fully isolated. Their degree of isolation depends on the access control from each processor, for example by a memory management unit. Vulnerabilities in the memory access control can lead to a loss of isolation.
3.
Two security measures hosted on the same physical device using the same libraries, same kernel or operating system are generally not isolated
4.
Two security measures hosted on the same physical device using strong logical segregation such as hardware-assisted full virtualization of kernel, user space and
I-10 
resources may provide a low degree of isolation. But vulnerabilities in all applied logical segregation implementations need to be taken into account. 

5. 
A security measure that runs within or on a lower assurance operating environment on the same physical device may not be isolated from the libraries, kernel or operating system of that lower assurance environment; for example, when a firewall runs on a lower or no assurance platform that can reconfigure an Ethernet switch to bypass the 
firewall, it lowers the effectiveness of that firewall taking into account the vulnerabilities of the platform. 
Cases 2 and 4 may be acceptable in some circumstances but not all. Attacks on the common hardware and software providing logical segregation need to be considered and if mitigations are needed or in place. Although the side-channel type of attacks can only lead to a loss of confidentiality (and are relevant for security measures handling private key or password data), other attacks have been demonstrated to affect all security attributes across logical segregation boundaries (such as Rowhammer). 

 

## I.2.1 Example Of An Exhaustive Table

By using an exhaustive table to identify potential common modes, the analysis of lack of sufficient independence, diversity and isolation impacting security effectiveness can be identified in a comprehensive, consistent and repeatable fashion as well as supporting the process of justifying the common modes that may always be present. The following Table I-1 provides an example of a General Common Mode Types, Sources and Failures/Errors listing that can be adapted by applicants.

## History Of The Ed-203A / Do-356A Document (Informative)

This document is the joint product of two special industry committees: the EUROCAE Working Group WG-72, titled "Aeronautical System Security" and the RTCA Special Committee SC-216, also titled "Aeronautical Systems Security". WG-72 was formed and began meeting in 2006 to address information security for the overall Aeronautical Information System Security (AISS) of airborne systems with related ground systems and environment. SC-216 was formed and began meeting in 2007 to specifically address information security for certification of aircraft and its systems. Both organizations agreed to develop joint documents through which the airworthiness of aircraft would be enabled despite the potential for intentional or unintentional misuse of aircraft information systems. 

Work on ED-203 and DO-356 started in parallel to the development of DO-326 / ED-202 (published in 2012) and later DO-326A / ED-202A (published in 2014). For this reason, DO-326A / ED-202A relies on and references a "future companion" document to provide the guidance deemed necessary on methods and considerations. After the publication of DO-326A / ED-202A in June 2014, SC-216 and WG-72 decided in 
2014 to publish separate companion documents due to time constraints, different scopes of both committees and the lack of consensus on some topics under discussion. 

DO-356 was published by SC-216 in September 2014 as a "minimum core" document, extracting some essential guidance on risk assessments out of the existing and controversial draft material. WG-72 started to develop new guidance based on the final DO-326A / ED-202A needs and WG-72 scope. The first part of this material including guidance on risk assessments and security assurance was published as ED-203 in September 2015. WG-72 work on the second part began directly afterwards. DO-356 and ED-203 contain significant differences on risk assessment methods and the relation to other development assurance standards (mainly DO-178C / ED-12C). The Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) established the working group on Aircraft System Information Security/Protection (ASISP) to provide information, advice and recommendations on aviation related ASISP issues to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator, through the Associate Administrator of Aviation Safety. The ARAC is comprised of a wide range of domestic and international industry and government experts to ensure that relevant design, airworthiness, and international harmonization aspects of ASISP are considered in the recommendations. This included representatives from other regulatory bodies such as EASA and ANAC, who participated in the final report. The ASISP working group has recommended the FAA consider RTCA standards DO-326, DO-356 and DO-355 and EUROCAE standards ED-201, ED-202, ED-203, ED-204 as acceptable guidance materials to comply with the security rule 25.13xx for large transport aircraft for new Type Certifications or new significant changes or when the applicant elects to use them on a voluntary basis. The ASISP working group recommended that SC-216 create harmonized standards jointly with WG 72 around the risk acceptability and assurance framework based on the guidance material outlined in sections 2.2.3.4.1 - 2.2.3.4.8 of the final report. 

The ARAC ASISP working group started in 2015 to develop recommendations to the FAA about security. The ARAC ASISP report [6] recommended to the FAA and both industry committees to harmonize guidance on methods and considerations. SC-216 and WG-72 agreed in June 2016 to jointly develop DO-356A / ED-203A as an update to DO-356 and ED-203 such that they should provide the harmonized guidance. Significant changes from DO-356 to DO-356A and ED-203 to ED-203A: Chapter 2 with regulatory considerations has been added in response to the ARAC ASISP report [6]. Chapter 3 includes the harmonized risk management methods and considerations from DO- 356 and ED-203. Specific methods that were part of DO-356 or ED-203 have been moved into appendices, so that sections in chapter 3 contain only harmonized methods. Security assurance has been harmonized in a dedicated chapter 4 to allow the different approaches from DO-356 and ED-203 under one set of security assurance objectives. Dedicated chapters on security architecture and security logging have been added to the document.
