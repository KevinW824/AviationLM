## I N T Rod U C T Ion ---------

This Document sets forth Minimum Performance Standards for Airborne Ground Proximity Warning Equipment. 

This revision of DO-16l includes Changes 1 and 2 
to that Document, and also includes further changes that were suggested by operational experience. 

The Environmental Tests in this Document have been modified to re·flect the requirements of RTCA Document DO-160, "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Electronic/ 
Electrical Equipment and Instruments". 

Compliance with these standards by manufacturers and users is recommended as a means of assuring that the equipment will satisfactorily perform its intended function under all conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operations; 
In any application of these minimum performance standards, due allowance should be made, where necessary, for equipments in current use which meet the intent of the standards contained herein. 

It is recognized that any regulatory application of these standards is the responsibility of governmental agencies. 

Inasmuch as the measured values of equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the method of measurement, standard test conditions and methods of test are also recommended in this Document. 

The word "equipment" as used herein includes all of the components or units necessary (as determined by the equipment manufacturer) for the equipment to properly perform its intended function. 

For example, an Airborne Ground Proximity Warning "equipment" may include cockpit controls, an indicator, a computer unit, aural warning generator, a barometric rate computer, a shock mount, etc. 

In the case of this example, all of the foregoing components or units comprise the "equipment". 

It should not be inferred from this example, however, that every "equipment" will necessarily include all of the foregoing components. 

This will depend on the design used by the 
"equipment" manufacturer. 

The "equipment" need not include other sensor systems for which separate standards are applicable, e.g. Radio Altimeter.

## 2.0 Minimum Performance Standards Under Standard Test Conditions

The test procedures, applicable to a determination of the performance of Ground Proximity Warning equipment under standard test conditions, are set forth in Appendix "B" of this Document. 

Test procedures which provide equivalent information may be used. 

## 2.1 Envelopes Of Conditions For Warning

2 .1.1 
Excessive Rates of Descent With Respect 
To Terrain (Mode 1) 
Warnings shall be provided by the equipment when, regardless of landing gear and flap position inputs, the combination of barometric altitude sink rate and height above terrain is within the envelope(s) for Mode 1 selected from the envelopes prescribed for this mode in Appendix A. 

Excessive Closure Rate To Terrain (Mode 2) 
2.1. 2 
Warnings shall be provided by the equipment when the combination of the rate of change in height above the terrain and the height above the terrain is within the applicable portion of envelope prescribed for Modes 2A and 2B 
in Appendix A. 

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

2.1. 3 
Negative Climb Rate (Mode 3A) OR Altitude Loss 
(Mode 3B) Before Acquiring 700 Feet Terrain 
Clearance After Take-Off or Missed Approach 
Warnings shall be provided by the equip~ 
ment when the combination of barometric altitude sink rate and height above terrain is within the envelope prescribed for Mode 3A in Appendix A, OR when the combination of barometric altitude loss and height above terrain is within the envelope prescribed for Mode 3B in Appendix A, regardless of landing gear position and with flaps not in landing configuration. 

Optionally, the warning may be provided for all landing gear and flap configurations except both gear and flaps in the landing configuration. 

## 2.1. 4 Flight Into Terrain With Less Than 500 Feet Terrain Clearance And Not In Landing Configuration (Mode 4)

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Warnings shall be provided by the equipment when the combination of barometric altitude rate of change and the height above the terrain is within the applicable portion of the envelope(s) for Mode 4 selected from those prescribed for this mode in Appendix A. 

The warnings for the portion of each envelope labelled "gear other than landing configuration" shall be provided only when this portion of the envelope is entered from above with the landing gear configured other than for landing. 

There should be no warnings if the pilot changes the landing gear configuration from landing to not landing after entering this portion of the envelope with the gear configured for landing, unless descent continues into the portion of the envelope labelled "gear and/or flaps other than in landing configuration". y If the aircraft ascends above 1000 feet after the pilot changed the gear configuration from landing to not landing while in the "gear other than landing" part of the envelope, and before 
·entering the "gear and/or flaps other than in landing configuration" part of the envelope, the warning mode described for the "gear other than landing configuration" part of the envelope shall be rearmed. 

Warnings shall be provided if the aircraft reenters this portion of the envelope with the gear configured other than for landing. 

Warnings shall be provided for the "gear and/or flaps other than in landing configuration" 
portion of the envelope when a configuration other than for landing has been selected for either flaps or landing gear or both. 

Y 
If the optional Mode 3/Mode 4 logic is used (see Appendix A, page 8, 9 and 10) the equipment will revert to Mode 3 
after a 2 to 3 second delay. 

## 2.2 Automatic Mode Selection

The equipment shall be designed to accomplish automatically any mode selection from aircraft take-off to landing without action by the flight crew, as indicated in Appendices A and B. 

## 2.3 Characteristics Of Warning Indications (Modes 1 Through 4) Aural Warning Characteristics 2.3.1

The aural warning for Modes 1 through 
4 consists of the sound "Whoop-Whoop", followed by either "Pull-up" or "Terrain" (or other acceptable annunciation) repeated until the hazardous condition no longer exists. 

It is not necessary for any warning cycle ("Whoop-
Whoop" plus voice annunciation) to be completed following the termination of a hazardous condition. 

"Whoop-Whoop". is described as a tone sweep from 400 Hz ±10% to 800 Hz ±10% at a period of 0.3 seconds ±20% and with increasing amplitude of 9dB ±3dB. 

The complete cycle of two tone sweeps plus voice annunciation should take 1.4 seconds ±20%, with the cycle repeated immediately. 

The gain may be automatically reduced after three complete warning cycles to a lower, but discernable, level. 

2.3.1.1 
Speaker Output Level 
The voice warning signal shall have an output level of at least 2W RMS. 

2.3.1.2 
Headset Output Level 
If provided, the headset voice warning signal shall have an output level of at least 50.mW. 

Visual warning 
2.3.2 
The visual warning for Modes 1 through 4 
shall be red and include, in distinctive letters, the letters GPWS (or other acceptable legend). 

## 2.4 Deactivation Control

The control for deactivation of the warning indications under planned abnormal or emergency conditions shall be a circuit breaker. 

Alternatively a switch which is protected from inadvertant crew operation may be used. 

Such a switch shall provide obvious indication it has been operated. 

## 2.5 Failure Monitor And/Or Self-Test !I

The failure monitor and/or self-test functions shall provide highly reliable indications of equipment condition. 

They shall include power input, aural alert and warning outputs, visual warning output and input validity signals. 

Manufacturers may elect to provide, or users to use, either or both failur~ monitoring or self-test. 

Failure Monitor 
2.5.1 
If a failure monitor is elected as the 
exclusive alternative for equipment condition 
testing, the indicator(s) shall be provided on 
the flight deck. 
Self-Test 
2.5.2 
If self-test is used, it shall provide 
indication(s) of equipment condition on the 
flight deck. 
Failure Monitor and Self-Test 
2.5.3 
If both failure monitoring and self-test 
are provided, the failure monitor indicator(s) 
need not be located on the flight deck. 

## 2.6 Glide Slope Deviation Alerting (Mode 5)

2.6.1 
Envelope of Conditions For Alerting 
An alert shall be provided when the combination of deviation below an ILS glide slope and the height above terrain is within the envelope for Mode 5 prescribed in Appendix A. 

Definitions: 
Self-Test -
an aircrew-initiated test of the equipment; Failure Monitor -
an automatic test function within the equipment. 

## Deactivation

2. 6.2 
It shall be possible for the flight crew to deactivate Mode 5. 

The control provided for this purpose shall be separate from any control provided to deactivate Modes 1 through 4. 

The Mode 1 through 4 
deactivation control, however, may also deactivate Mode 5. 

2.6.3 
Reactivation 
If Mode 5 is deactivated by the pilot, it shall be automatically reactivated for the next app~oach. 

2. 6. 4 
Arming/Disarming 
Mode 5 shall be armed when the landing gear is selected to the landing position and disarmed either when the flaps are retracted from the landing position or the landing gear is selected to the non-landing position. 

## Glide Slope Mode Alert

2.6. 5 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The glide slope deviation alert shall consist of the aural annunication "Glide Slope" (or other acceptable annunciation) 
repeated until the condition responsible for the alert no longer exists or the alert is inhibited. 

An aural warning related to GPWS 
Modes 1 through 4 shall take precedence over this alert. 

The equipment may provide a constant alert repetition rate and audio output level, or one or both of these quantities may increase as the below glide slop'e deviation increases and/or the terrain clearance decreases. 

In the former case the alert shall be repeated at least once every three seconds. 

The audio output power levels may take on any value between 0 and 6dB below those values specified for the Modes 1 through 4 aural warning in paragraphs 2.3.1.1 and 2.3.1.2. 

If the repetition rate/audio output level is/are varied with terrain clearance/glide slope deviation, the alert should be repeated once every seven seconds (nominal) 
at 1000 feet terrain clearance and the audio levels be discernable to the pilot. 

As the terrain clearance decreases and/or the glide slope deviation increases, the alert rate should increase to a maximum of once every 
0.7 seconds and the audio output power levels to the maximum of those values specified for the Modes 1 through 4 aural warning in paragraphs 2.3.1.1 and 2.3.1.2. 

## 3.0 Minimum Performance Standards Under Environmental Test Conditions !I

Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of the performance of equipment under environmental test conditions shall be those set forth in RTCA Document DO-160, 
"Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Electronic/Electrical Equipment and Instruments". 

## 3.1 Temperature And Altitude Tests 3.1.1 Low Operating Temperature Test

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

!/ It will be noted that some of the performance parameters 
addressed in the paragraphs of Section 2.0, Minimum 
Performance Standards Under Standard Test Conditions, are 
not enumerated in the several specific env.ironmental tests 
contained in this section. 
This is so because engineering 
judgment and experience has indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to 
certain of these environmental conditions and that the 
level of performance specified in 2.0 will, therefore, not 
be measurably degraded by exposure to these particular 
environmental conditions.

change of the height above terrain signal 
starting from a height of 2450 feet. 
The warning outputs occur within 
the limits prescribed by the dashed 
lines for Mode 2A in Appendix A for each 
of the two applicable aircraft configurations. 
(b) 
Apply a uniformly decreasing rate of 
change of the height above terrain 
signal starting from the nominal warning 
envelope. 
The warning outputs shall 
occur within the limits prescribed by 
the dotted lines for Mode 2A in Appendix 
A for each of the two applicable aircraft 
configurations. 

MODE 2B 

(a)
