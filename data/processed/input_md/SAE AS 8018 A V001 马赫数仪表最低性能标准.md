## Minimum Performance Standard For Mach Meters Foreword

Changes in the revision are format/editorial only.

## 1. Scope:

This AS covers subsonic and supersonic Mach meter instruments which, when connected to sources of static (Ps), and total (Pt), or impact (Pt-Ps), pressure provide indication of Mach number.  These instruments are known as Type A.  This AS also covers servo-operated repeater or digital display instruments which indicate Mach number when connected to the appropriate electrical output of a Mach transducer of Air Data Computer.  These instruments are known as Type B.

1.1
Purpose:
This Aerospace Standard (AS) specifies the minimum safe performance standards for Mach Meter instruments primarily intended for use in aircraft under standard and environmental conditions.

GENERAL STANDARDS:
3.1
Operation of Controls:
The design of the instrument must be such that any controls intended for use during flight cannot be operated in any possible position, combinations or sequences that would result in a condition detrimental to the continued performance of the instrument.

3.2
Accessibility of Controls:
Controls which are not normally adjusted in flight must not be readily accessible to flight personnel.

3.3
Malfunction Indication:
Means must be provided to indicate failures and/or the existence of the following conditions:

3.3.1
Loss of such electrical power as is necessary for the functioning of the instrument.
3.3.2
If the equipment is a remote indicator, means must be incorporated to detect internal malfunction or loss of "information valid" signal from remote Mach number computing source, in addition to the requirement in 3.3.1.  Failure warning signals and flag alarms must not degrade the accuracy of associated equipment.  The indicating means shall indicate the failure or malfunction in a positive and conspicuous manner, that is effective for any operational lighting condition likely, when a malfunction may occur.
3.4
Self-Test Capability:
If the equipment contains integral arrangements to permit pre-flight and/or in-flight self-test checks on the operation of the equipment in combination with other aircraft subsystems, a means shall be provided to deactivate any subsystem which might be adversely affected during the self-test cycle.  
In flight, self-test activating controls must provide a means to warn the pilot of this mode of operation.

3.5
Compatibility of Components:
If components are individually acceptable but require matching for proper operation, they shall be identified on the equipment nameplate in a manner that will ensure proper matching.

3.6
Interchangeability:
Mach Meters and their components identified with a manufacturer's part and/or model number must be directly and completely interchangeable with all Mach Meters and their components identified with that part and/or model number.

With reference to type "B" instruments which have a separate sensor and indicator, replacing either device will not degrade the system tolerances beyond those specified in Figures 1 and 2.

## 3.7 Input Connections - Type A Instruments Only:

## 3.8 Presentation:

The presentation shall be such that it will not associate more than one Mach number with any indication.

## 3.9 Limitation Of Indicator Movement:

Indications beyond the normal range of the instrument shall not be displayed in a manner interpretable as an on-scale reading, or as an off-scale reading in the wrong direction.

## 3.10 Indicating Means:

The Mach number must be indicated by means of one or more pointers, dials, tapes, drums, digital displays or other devices.  Relative motion of the index with respect to the scale, when moving elements are employed, (either the index or the scale may be moving element) shall be clockwise, down or to the right for increasing Mach number. The indicating means shall be effective for any operational lighting condition that may occur.

lighting wedge, if applicable, shall not exceed 10% of the incident light.  This reflectance applies 
over the visible light spectrum from 450 nanometers to 600 nanometers, and over an incident solid angle of 60째 perpendicular to the viewing plane.

## 3.12 Fire Resistance:

Except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire, or produce a significant amount of toxic fumes, all materials used must be self-extinguishing when tested in accordance with the requirements of Federal Aviation Regulation 25.1359 (d) and appendix F, thereto, with the exception that materials tested may be configured in accordance with para.
