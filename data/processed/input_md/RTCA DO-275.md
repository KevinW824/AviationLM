## Foreword

This report was prepared by Special Committee 196 (SC-196) and approved by the RTCA Program Management Committee (PMC) on October 12, 2001. RTCA, Incorporated, is a not-for-profit corporation formed to advance the art and science of aviation and aviation electronic systems for the benefit of the public. The organization functions as a Federal Advisory Committee and develops consensus-based recommendations on contemporary aviation issues. RTCA's objectives include but are not limited to:

•
coalescing aviation system user and provider technical requirements in a manner that helps government and industry meet their mutual objectives and responsibilities;
•
analyzing and recommending solutions to the system technical issues that aviation faces as it continues
to pursue increased safety, system capacity and efficiency;
•
developing consensus on the application of pertinent technology to fulfill user and provider requirements, including development of minimum operational performance standards for electronic systems
and equipment that support aviation; and
•
assisting in developing the appropriate technical material upon which positions for the International
Civil Aviation Organization and the International Telecommunication Union and other appropriate international organizations can be based.
The organization's recommendations are often used as the basis for government and private sector decisions as well as the foundation for many Federal Aviation Administration Technical Standard Orders. Since RTCA is not an official agency of the United States Government, its recommendations may not be regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the U.S. government organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations relate.

## 1 Purpose

1.1
Introduction This document contains minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) for the aviation night vision imaging system (NVIS) used to supplement night VFR operations. These standards specify system characteristics that should be useful to designers, manufacturers, installers and users of the equipment. Compliance with these standards is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operations. Any regulatory application of this document is the sole responsibility of the appropriate governmental agency/authority. Section 1 (Introduction) provides information on the purpose and scope that is needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated in this document. It describes typical equipment applications and operational goals, as envisioned by the members of Special Committee 196, and establishes the basis for the standards stated in sections 2 and 3. Definitions and assumptions essential to proper understanding of this document are also provided in this section. Section 2 (NVG Performance Requirements and Test Procedures) contains general guidance and minimum performance standards for the night vision goggle (NVG). These standards specify the required performance under the defined operating and environmental conditions. Also included are recommended bench test procedures necessary to demonstrate equipment compliance with the stated minimums. Section 3 (NVIS Lighting Performance Requirements and Test Procedures) contains general guidance and minimum performance standards for NVIS lighting. These requirements specify the required performance under the defined operating and environmental conditions. Also included are recommended test procedures necessary to demonstrate equipment compliance with the stated minimums. Section 4 (Installed Integrated NVIS Equipment Performance) describes the minimum acceptable performance requirements for the installed integrated NVIS equipment. Installed equipment tests are conducted to complement, supplement and/or validate bench and component test performance data determined in sections 2 and 3. Section 5 (Continued Airworthiness) describes the continued airworthiness procedures used to ensure the integrated NVIS equipment installation continues to meet the minimum performance standard once in operational use. The following appendices are included in this document:

1.
Appendix A is a list of abbreviations and acronyms recommended for use with NVIS
and associated documents.
2.
Appendix B is a bibliography and a list of all references cited in this document.
3.
Appendix C is a glossary that defines terms that are used in conjunction with NVIS
operations and equipment.
4.
Appendix D contains information pertaining to the relative spectral response of Class
B NVGs.
5.
Appendix E contains recommended design practices for NVIS installations.
6.
Appendix F includes a table for converting Snellen acuity to visual angular resolution. 
7.
Appendix G contains suggested NVG pre-flight and adjustment procedures. 
8.
Appendix H NVIS Installation Ground Test Checklist.
9.
Appendix I contain information for constructing a light source for use during NVG
adjustment procedures.
The word "equipment," as used in this document includes all components and features necessary for the system to properly perform its intended function(s). Standards for design and implementation of optional features, beyond those required for a minimum NVIS, only apply if those features are implemented. If the equipment implementation includes a computer software package, the guidelines contained in RTCA/DO-178B, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, should be considered.

## 1.2 System Overview The Night Vision Imaging System (Nvis) Consists Of The Following:

•
NVG
•
Interior and exterior lighting
•
Cockpit transparencies (e.g., windshield, windows, chin bubbles, etc.)
•
Crewstation design and components (e.g., location of structural components that may
hinder use of NVGs, aircraft displays, etc.)

## 1.2.1 Night Vision Goggle

1.2.1.1
Binocular Assembly The binocular assembly contains two monocular assemblies. It may house the adjustment mechanisms for interpupillary (eyespan) adjustment, eyepiece and objective lens focus, fore and aft adjustment, and tilt adjustment. It may also contain a breakaway feature at its interface with the head or helmet mount.

1.2.1.2
Monocular Assembly The monocular assemblies contain the electro-optical components that gather the available light, amplify that light and present that light to the human eye. Each monocular assembly contains one or more intensifier channels. Each channel consists of an objective lens, image intensifier tube, and eyepiece lens. Available light from the night sky and other sources is reflected off scene objects, creating the input to the NVG.

1.2.1.3
Objective Lens Assembly The objective lens assembly (See Figure 1-1) collects the available energy and focuses it on the photocathode (the first part of the image intensification tube). It is housed in an assembly that is used for distance focusing. A coating is placed on the inside portion of the lens that filters out specific wavelengths, thus allowing the use of properly designed interior lighting without degrading the NVG image of the outside scene.

1.2.1.4
Image Intensifier An image intensification tube greatly amplifies available energy to provide an imaging capability at night. It consists of a photocathode, microchannel plate, phosphor screen, and fiber optic twist. Embedded circuitry is designed to protect the tube from bright light sources, and to automatically adjust the gain in response to varying light input levels by controlling the electron flow through the microchannel plate. 

1.2.1.5
Eyepiece Lens The eyepiece lens assembly is designed to provide some adjustment for the user that compensates for minor vision deficiencies (i.e., diopter adjustment). However, the assembly does not correct for all eye deficiencies and does not replace the need for wearing prescribed spectacles or contact lens. 

1.2.1.6
Power Source Assembly The power source for each tube can be provided by a variety of methods including for example duplicated battery compartments, individual batteries mounted on each tube, aircraft supplied with automatic switching to battery or aircraft back up power supply, or any other method providing a sufficiently reliable source of power. A suitable means of indicating to the user actual or impending power source problems would normally be provided.

1.2.1.7
Helmet or Head Mount The mount assembly serves as the mounting point for the binocular assembly. It may be affixed to an assembly that serves as a head mount (e.g., hair net mount), or it may attach to a helmet. The mount may contain a vertical adjustment and a means for connecting the binocular assembly to system power. The design may include a breakaway feature for the binocular assembly and/or the binocular assembly/mount combination. The mounting system shall provide a stable platform for the NVG during all flight conditions, and shall be designed not to interfere with the operator's ability to look beneath or around the binocular assembly when viewing inside or outside the cockpit using unaided vision. 

## 1.2.2 Nvis Lighting Properly Designed Nvis Lighting Provides For Adequate Illumination Of Cockpit Instruments/Displays/Controls For Unaided Readability Without Degrading The Nvg Image. 1.2.3 Transparencies Cockpit Transparencies Include The Windshield, Windows And Other Transparencies Through Which Operators View The Outside Scene With Nvgs.

1.2.4
Ancillary Equipment The aircraft shall be equipped with a radio altimeter (also known as a radar altimeter), vertical speed indicator, and attitude indicator within the pilot's primary field of view to facilitate cockpit viewing with minimal head movement, thereby minimizing the potential for spatial disorientation (e.g., lack of depth perception). It is recommended that the radio altimeter be equipped with an audio and/or visual warning device at a pilot selectable height, especially if the radio (radar) altimeter provides only a digital display. All cockpit instruments, displays, annunciators, etc. are viewed with unaided vision and not with the NVG. Also, the aircraft will be equipped with a generator or alternator of adequate capacity, and two-way radio communication equipment. (Reference RTCA/DO-268, Concept of Operations - Night Vision Imaging System for Civil Operators.) This equipment is to allow for a safe recovery from inadvertent encounters with below VFR weather conditions, or spatial disorientation. 

1.3
Operational Application This document establishes equipment requirements for the use of NVGs during night VFR operations. The minimum operating performance standards set forth in this document are intended to provide a system that will be compatible with both existing and future airspace operations. 

1.4
Intended Function The fundamental purpose of a NVG is to provide the operator with a means of acquiring an enhanced view of the scene outside the aircraft, thus enhancing situation awareness. If the NVG is to be used for tasks beyond those addressed in this document, additional requirements may apply. The NVG is not designed to be used during daytime or in bright conditions at night (e.g., in a hangar or ramp illuminated with incompatible light sources).

## 1.5 Operational Goals Properly Designed And Integrated, Nvis Equipment Should Increase The Effectiveness Of Operations During Night Vfr Conditions. 1.6 Assumptions And Scope The Following Are Germane When Designing Nvis Equipment Or When Developing Operational Guidelines:

1.6.1
NVIS Design Assumptions
1.
NVG design guidance in this document is intended for head-mounted devices presenting independent imagery to both eyes (i.e., binocular systems).
2.
This document provides a baseline for the NVIS, but does not contain an exhaustive
or comprehensive list of shared display or imaging considerations (e.g., simultaneously depicting imaging data with symbology). 
3.
The design guidance in this document provides for NVG incorporating Class B and
modified Class B filters. 
4.
Design guidance in this document does not address forward looking infrared (FLIR)
systems, synthetic or enhanced vision systems, fixed head-up displays (HUDs), or NVG HUD systems (attachable to or part of the NVG).
5.
All aircraft interior and exterior lighting complies with the applicable regulations.
6.
All testing is performed by trained and experienced test personnel.
7.
All references to the term "modification" can apply to new designs or installations.

## 1.6.2 Nvis Operational Assumptions 1. Nvg Enhanced Vision Is Not Equivalent To Daytime Vision.

2.
The pilot can maintain VFR flight in the event NVG imagery is lost or degraded. 
3.
The operator has 20/20 corrected vision and wears the appropriate corrective lenses
while using NVGs.
4.
The NVG does not provide adequate imagery under all lighting conditions, scene
contrast, and atmospheric conditions.
5.
The operator takes advantage of the maximum visual performance available of the
NVG, through proper alignment and focus. 
6.
Viewing imagery provided by a NVG will degrade the operator's depth perception
and distance estimation.
7.
The operator shall meet the color vision standard that is deemed necessary for safe
performance of duties.
8.
Acquiring and installing NVIS equipment that meets the standards of this document
does not constitute an operational approval. All NVIS operators shall be trained and have proper approval from their regulatory agency/authority to operate NVIS equipment.
1.7
Test Procedures The test procedures specified in this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the performance requirements. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred. These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information. The order of specified tests suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design, to design qualification, and finally to operational use. For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2 and 3 shall have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system test of Section 4.

1.7.1
Environmental Tests Environmental tests are specified in Section 2.3 and 3.3. The intent of environmental testing is to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions that replicate a wide range of aeronautical operations. Unless otherwise specified, the environmental test procedures contained in RTCA/DO-160D, "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment," will be used to demonstrate equipment compliance.

1.7.2
Bench, Component and/or System Tests Bench, component and/or system test procedures are specified in Section 2.4 and 3.4. These tests provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements in Section 2.2 and 3.2. Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers for ensuring compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design.

## 1.7.3 Installed Equipment Tests The Installed Test Procedures Are Specified In Section 4. The Following Is Applicable To Installed System Testing:

1.
Installed testing will take place only when the entire NVIS installation has been
incorporated by the applicant.
2.
Installed testing (i.e., integrated NVIS system testing) does not replace the requirement for performing NVIS lighting component testing described in Section 3 unless alternate methods of compliance can be demonstrated.
3.
Installed equipment tests may be used in lieu of bench/component testing when test
points are impossible to otherwise acquire (e.g., interference from other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc.). The need for this shall be adequately justified.
4.
Installed tests are normally performed on the ground and in flight. 
5.
Test results shall demonstrate functional performance in the intended operational
environment.
6.
Test results shall demonstrate compliance with the functional performance requirements for daytime operations (e.g., daytime readability of instruments).

## 1.8 Definition Of Terms This Section Contains A Definition Of Terms Used That May Have Multiple, Special, Or Unique Meanings In This Document.

Channel: A channel consists of an objective lens, image intensifier tube, and eyepiece lens. CIE color coordinate system: The fundamental definitions of color are expressed in terms of the "standard observer" and coordinate system adopted by the International Commission on Illumination (C.I.E.) at Cambridge, England, in 1931 and published in the Journal of the Optical Society of America, Vol. 23, page 359, October 1933. Wherever chromaticity coordinates (x, y, z) appear in this document they relate to this system. The CIE 1976 Uniform Color Space (UCS) diagram is the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram redrawn with the x and y axes subjected to a linear transformation as defined in CIE Publication 15, Supplement 2, 1978. Wherever chromaticity coordinates (u',v') appear in this document, they relate to this last system. Class A: Refers to a NVG in which a 625nm minus blue objective lens filter has been incorporated. This term also can refer to the NVIS lighting designed for use with NVGs that contain a class A filter. Class B: Refers to a NVG in which a 665nm minus blue objective lens filter has been incorporated. This term also can refer to the NVIS lighting designed for use with NVGs that contain a class B filter. Class C: Refers to a NVG in which a 645nm minus blue objective lens filter has been incorporated. These filters are typically incorporated in NVGs produced in Europe.

Contrast (Modulation Contrast): defined by the following equation: Cm = (B1–B2)/
(B1+B2). B1= luminance of the background (bright area) and B2 = luminance of a dark spot.

Spot Photometer (or spotmeter): An electro-optical device (typically hand-held) that may be aimed at a surface, much like a camera, to measure the luminance of that surface. The spot photometer typically has a viewfinder, and a circle or square in the viewfinder image defines the area of the surface in which the luminance is measured. Only light within the defining circle or square is measured. With accessory close-up lenses, a suitable spot photometer can measure the luminance of very small areas (such as portions of individual letters or numbers on instruments or displays). A spot photometer is a fundamentally useful instrument for many different types of light measurements.

Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in RTCA Document DO- 160D, *Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment* and Military Standard (MIL-STD) 810(C). General information on the use of DO-160D is contained in Sections 1 through 3 of that document. Also, a method of identifying which environmental tests were conducted and other amplifying information on the conduct of the tests is contained in MIL-STD 810(C) and/or Appendix A of DO-160D. In addition, specific test methods and procedures out of MIL-STD 810(C) that are unique to NVGs are documented throughout this section. Testing to all the conditions contained in RTCA/DO-160D is not required for each of the performance requirements in Section 2.2. Judgment and experience have indicated that certain of these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Subsection 2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these certain environmental conditions. The specific set of environmental performance requirements identified in this section must be met for all components in the NVG system.

Table 2-2 indicates which of the NVG design requirements specified in DO-160D shall be satisfied under this MOPS in accordance with the environmental test conditions specified in DO-160D. Certain requirements must be met with the system not operating, others with it operating, and others in both the operating and non-operating modes. For each row in Table 2-2, an "X" in the first column specifies that the requirements on the associated row must be met while this system is not operating. An "X" in the second column specifies that the requirements must be met with the system operating.

Detailed Test Procedures The test procedures set forth below constitute a satisfactory method of determining required performance. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred. Such alternate methods may be used if the manufacturer can show that they provide at least equivalent information. Therefore, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures.

2.4.3.1
Operation During Environmental Tests When operation during environmental tests is required the assembly shall as a minimum successfully pass the requirements of Section 2.2.2.7, "ON-OFF switch." Should an assembly indicate an operational failure after the last environmental test it shall be the manufacturer's responsibility to determine and prove where (in which environmental test condition) the operational failure occurred.

## 2.4.3.2 Operational Tests For The Purpose Of Operational Testing, The Nvg Shall Be Defined As The Binocular, Mount, And Power Pack Unless Otherwise Stated.

2.4.3.2.1
System Resolution Place a resolution target in the infinity focal plane of a test collimator. Adjust target luminance to obtain maximum resolution. Look into the collimator with one channel and obtain best focus. Determine smallest, i.e., highest spatial frequency test pattern that can be accurately resolved. Repeat for infinity stop. Determine the linear spatial frequency of test patterns resolved, "RA", in cy/mm. Calculate NVG resolution in cycles per milliradian (cy/mrad), "R",as: R = RA * (EFL) mm/1000. 

Where R is resolution in cy/mrad 
RA is linear spatial frequency in cy/mm
 
EFL is collimator effective focal length in mm
Repeat tests for other channels. Rotate channel approximately two-thirds the channel semi-field of view off-axis and read resolution in each monocular. Failure to meet requirements of Section 2.2.1.1 shall constitute failure of this test.

2.4.3.2.2
System Luminance-Gain Place a 2856K, extended Lambertian light source at least 28cm in front of the NVG objective lens. The extended Lambertian source shall be large enough to cover the field of view of the channel. Using a calibrated photometer, the extended light source shall be set to a luminance of not greater than 1 x 10-4 footlambert. Activate the binocular looking at the extended source, and read output through each eyepiece using a photometer calibrated to read with a 5 mm entrance pupil. The 5.0 mm entrance pupil shall be placed on the optical axis of the photometer and the optical axis of the monocular under test at the specified eye relief distance. Gain is calculated for each monocular as:

Gain = Output luminance
 
Input luminance
Failure to meet requirements of Section 2.2.1.2 shall constitute failure of this test.

2.4.3.2.3
Field of View (FOV)
Place the binocular in the setup shown in Figure 2-7. Set the slit target luminance to 1 x
10-4 footlambert or less. Looking through a monocular, rotate the table to the left until the edge of the field is located. Record this field angle. Rotate the table right until the slit is at the edge of the field. Record this angle. The difference between the two recorded angles is the FOV. Repeat for the other monocular. Failure to meet requirements of Section 2.2.1.3 shall constitute failure of this test.

2.4.3.2.4
Magnification (M)
Place the binocular in the test setup shown in Figure 2-8 and place the diopterscope (which is set to infinity) 25 mm behind a monocular eyepiece. Looking through the diopterscope mounted on a small rotary table, superimpose the slit image and the scope crossline by rotating the small table. Record the reading from the vernier scale of the small rotary table. Rotate the large rotary table to an angle θ, on either side of the optical axis. Measure the amount of small table rotation required to superimpose the image and diopterscope reticle again and record the difference angle α. The difference between the second reading and first reading determines the real angle of image rotation θr. Repeat these steps with the image positioned on the opposite side of the optical axis (θr', α'). The average tan is used to calculate the magnification M:

where

$$\tan\theta=\frac{\left(\tan\theta_{r}+\tan\theta_{r}\right)}{2}$$

$$\tan\alpha=\frac{\left(\tan\alpha+\tan\alpha^{\prime}\right)}{2}$$

$$\theta=\frac{\left(\tan\alpha+\tan\alpha^{\prime}\right)}{2}$$

$$\theta=\frac{\left(\tan\alpha+\tan\alpha^{\prime}\right)}{2}$$

$$\theta=\frac{\left(\tan\alpha+\tan\alpha^{\prime}\right)}{2}$$

$$\theta=\frac{\left(\tan\alpha+\tan\alpha^{\prime}\right)}{2}$$

$$\theta=\frac{\left(\tan\alpha+\tan\alpha^{\prime}\right)}{2}$$

Repeat for the other monocular. Failure to meet requirements of Section 2.2.1.4 shall constitute failure of this test.

## 2.4.3.2.5 Distortion Calculate Distortion For Each Monocular Using Data From Section 2.4.3.2.4. The Distortion At Any Point Is Calculated As:

$$D={\frac{\left(\tan\ \phi_{n}\ \mbox{-}\ M\tan\ \theta_{n}\right)}{M\tan\ \theta_{n}}}\,x\,100$$
where M = magnification of the system. Data shall be recorded for several field angles, including the largest semifield angle. Failure to meet the requirements of Section 2.2.1.5
shall constitute failure of this test.

If trapezoidal distortion is detected, then calculate distortion for each test point using the following formula: ∆r/R, 

where $\mathbf{Ar}=(\mathbf{Ax}^{2}+\mathbf{Ay}^{2})^{1/2}$ and $\mathbf{R}=(\mathbf{X}^{2}+\mathbf{Y}^{2})^{1/2}$.

X = coordinate of the point on the x-axis taken from the center of the display Y = coordinate of the point on the y-axis taken from the center of the display
∆
∆
∆
∆x = x - X and ∆
∆
∆
∆y = y -Y, x = coordinate of the image on the x-axis and y = coordinate of the image on the y axis Note:
On-Axis designs should not need to perform trapezoidal distortion calculation.

2.4.3.2.6
Collimation With two parallel beams of light entering the binocular objectives (or one beam large enough to fill both objectives) as shown in Figure 2-7, use a traveling telescope fitted with a filar eyepiece to measure the difference between the emergent beams (See Figure 2-9).

Failure to meet requirements of Section 2.2.1.6 shall constitute failure of this test.

2.4.3.2.10
Halo Size Halos are measured at the output of the image intensifier assembly. The standard test focuses a 0.35 mm diameter light spot (usually produced by projecting light through an aperture) on the photocathode. A 0.625 mm diameter halo would actually be made up of a 0.35 mm diameter spot in the center surrounded by an annulus with an inner circle at 0.175 mm radius and the outer circle at 0.5 mm radius. Zero halo would actually be 0.35 mm diameter under this test. The illumination in the spot shall be not less that 5 x 10-4 fc. The illumination incident on the photocathode in the region outside the 0.350mm spot shall not exceed 5 X 10-7 fc.

2.4.3.2.11
Eyepiece Diopter Range Place a resolution target in the infinity focal plane of a test collimator. Adjust the target luminance for maximum system resolution. Set each monocular objective focus to infinity. Look into each monocular eyepiece with a diopterscope of at least 3 power and measure the diopter focus range. Verify the diopter focus range meets the requirements of Section 2.2.1.11 or it shall constitute failure of this test.

2.4.3.2.12.1
Variable Focus Objective Lens Place a resolution target in the infinity focal plane of a test collimator. Adjust target luminance to obtain maximum resolution. Place a second resolution target, illuminated to the same light level, beside the front aperture of the collimator and 45 cm in front of the binocular objectives. Place the binocular in its holding fixture with one monocular objective looking into the collimator. Using objective focus ring rotation, determine if the infinity focus and the 45 cm focus will achieve the minimum specified resolution in cy/mrad at both focus positions. Repeat for the other monocular. Using objective focus ring rotation, determine if focus through infinity is possible. Repeat for the other monocular. Failure to meet requirements of Section 2.2.1.12 shall constitute failure of this test.

2.4.3.2.12.2
Fixed Focus Objective Lens Place a resolution target in the infinity focal plane of a test collimator. Adjust target luminance to obtain maximum resolution. Place the binocular in its' holding fixture with one monocular objective looking into the collimator. Determine if the infinity focus achieves the minimum specified resolution in cy/mrad. Repeat for the other monocular. Failure to meet the requirements of Section 2.2.1.12 shall constitute failure of the test.

2.4.4.3
Mount/Binocular Interface The NVG, as defined by paragraph Section 1.2.1-1.2.1.7, shall be tested for compliance to Section 2.2.2.3. If the binocular has a locking mechanism, move the binocular from the operational position to the stowed position using an appropriate force gage six times assuring that the position change can only take place when the lock release button is depressed and the binocular remains in the mount at all times. With the locking mechanism engaged, ensure that the binocular assembly will not move from the operating to the stowed position (and vice versa) for a force less than or equivalent to that required for breakaway to occur, reference Section 2.4.4.2. Then provide power to the image tubes and, if applicable, assure that the image tubes cut off and remain off when in the stowed position and turn on when in the operational position, as appropriate to the requirements of Section 2.2.2.3.

NVIS LIGHTING COMPONENT PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS AND TEST PROCEDURES
This section defines the minimum acceptable level of performance for NVIS lighting components. General guidance has also been provided where appropriate. The use of lighting components that meet the requirements defined in this section will reduce the risk that the lighting system will not comply with the requirements defined in Section 4. Lighting components that do not meet requirements defined in this section may still be able to comply with the requirements defined in Section 4. In this case, if an alternate means of compliance to this section is utilized, then it shall be documented and demonstrated. Recommendations made within this section (denoted by the word "should") are one acceptable means of assuring that the component will perform its intended function under any foreseeable operating condition. 

3.1
General Requirements This section lists general component requirements. Compliance with these requirements may be shown by demonstration. Specific requirements, for which compliance shall be shown by testing, are listed in paragraph 3.2 and its sub-paragraphs.

## 3.1.1 Airworthiness The Manufacturer Shall Design Such Components, And The Installation Shall Be Implemented, Such As Not To Impair The Airworthiness Of The Aircraft. 3.1.2 Intended Function The Component Shall Perform Its Intended Function(S), As Defined By The Manufacturer, And Its Proper Use Shall Not Create A Hazard To Other Users Of The Civil Airspace. 3.1.3 Federal Communications Commission Rules All Components Shall Comply With The Applicable Rules Of The Federal Communication Commission Or The Equivalent Regulatory Body.

3.1.4
Fire Protection All materials used shall be self-extinguishing except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire.

3.1.5
Operation of Controls The component shall be designed so that controls intended for use during night flight cannot be operated in any position, combination or sequence which would result in a condition detrimental to the reliability of the component or operation of the aircraft. Design consideration shall be given to the prevention of inadvertent operation of controls that would cause a hazard to operators during aided or unaided flight.

## 3.1.6 Accessibility Of Controls Controls, Which Do Not Require Adjustment During Flight, Should Not Be Readily Accessible To Flight Personnel.

3.1.7
Effects of Test The component shall be designed so that the application of specified test procedures shall not be detrimental to component performance following the application of the tests, except as specifically allowed.

3.1.8
Design Assurance (FHA Assessment)
Complete loss of the NVIS lighting system is classified as major, and therefore its loss shall be improbable. Inadvertent/un-commanded actuation of NVG incompatible light sources is classified as severe-major/hazardous, and therefore must be extremely remote. Design consideration shall take into account component failures and system design shall be failsafe. 

## 3.2 Component Performance - Standard Conditions 3.2.1 Installation All Lights Shall Be Oriented And All Components Shall Be So Indexed Or Designed Such That The Lights Are Properly Aimed When Lighting System Maintenance Is Performed.

3.2.2
System Integration The number of different types of lighting components and power sources should be kept to a minimum in any given aircraft installation. All lighting components on a single lighting control shall track together in luminance over the entire range of adjustment.

3.2.3
Lighting Provisions The design and location of the lighting components shall optimize visual performance and minimize adverse effects on NVG performance. The components shall not cause objectionable direct or indirect glare and/or reflections, which interfere with the operator's aided or unaided vision. 

3.2.4
Lighting Power The lighting system shall be designed to operate from aircraft power. The secondary lighting system, if installed, shall be powered by an independent electrical source separate from the primary lighting system in order to maximize system reliability.

3.2.5
Lighting Control Location and Actuation Lighting controls shall allow control of the intensity of all NVIS lighting subsystems. Continuous intensity controls of any lighting component should allow intensity to be smoothly variable from full bright (maximum rated drive condition for the lighting component) to full dimmed (reduced drive condition resulting in barely perceptible luminance of lighting components) plus "off". Lighting units related by function or area should have common controls. The design shall preclude inadvertent actuation of non-NVG compatible lighting. In addition, if a lighting component has a dedicated luminance control (or controls), then the control (or controls) shall provide continuously variable intensity for all anticipated lighting conditions. 

3.2.6
Daylight Legibility and Readability Each lighted component shall be daylight readable to the operator in all probable lighting conditions. When a lighted component has been modified, the daylight readability and attensity (ability to attract attention) shall be maintained. 

## 3.2.7 Nighttime Readability During Night Operations, The Lighting System Shall Provide The Operators With A Capability To Rapidly And Accurately Obtain Required Crew-Station Information With Unaided Vision.

The lighting system shall not have an adverse effect on external unaided night vision or on the operator's capability to obtain required information external to the aircraft while employing NVGs.

3.2.7.1
Luminance and Illuminance The luminance or illuminance levels of all lighted components, to include multi-function, and alphanumeric displays shall be adjustable to provide adequate attensity (ability to attract attention) and readability for all anticipated night lighting conditions. The luminance or illuminance level between lighted components shall be adequately balanced at operational intensity levels, such that all information on lighted components is easily read with the unaided eye, while at the same time no lighted component constitutes a bright visual distraction. Recommended luminance and illuminance levels for cockpit and cabin lighting are provided in Appendix E, paragraph 7.

3.2.8
Chromaticity and NVIS Radiance Limits Chromaticity and NVIS radiance of the aircraft lighting shall not adversely affect NVG performance. Suggested radiance limits and associated luminance levels for such lighting are listed in Table 3-1 and Figure 3-1. These limits, if properly employed, should provide color discrimination and perceptibility while not adversely affecting NVG performance. Recommended luminance and/or illuminance levels for installed lighting are provided in Appendix E, "Recommended Design Practices for NVIS lighting". The suggested colors (designated as "NVIS WHITE", "NVIS GREEN A", "NVIS GREEN B", "NVIS YEL- LOW" and "NVIS RED") of illuminated information (alphanumeric and symbolic) on instruments, controls, control panels and on illuminated areas in designated crew station and compartment areas are listed in Table 3-1. The CIE 1976 chromaticity coordinates and tolerances associated with those colors are shown on Figure 3-1. Radiance and chromaticity measurements shall be performed for all anticipated lighting conditions, to include daylight, dusk, night unaided and NVG aided, as appropriate.

Note:
        A limited number of light sources may slightly exceed the NVIS Radiance limits
        shown in Table 3-1 without adversely affecting the overall NVIS lighting system
        compatibility (See Section 4 Integrated NVIS Installation Performance). In such
        an event, careful consideration shall be given to the quantity, location and NVIS
        radiance of such sources.

The lights shall not be a source of objectionable direct or indirect glare and/or reflections to operators. Cabin lighting shall be NVG compatible if intrusion of non-compatible light cannot be prevented from entering the cockpit.

3.2.8.4
Warning, Caution and Advisory Messages/Annunciators The color scheme chosen for the Warning, Caution and Advisory messages/annunciators shall comply with the applicable airworthiness standards. The Warning, Caution and Advisory messages/annunciators shall be readable and draw the pilot's attention under all anticipated lighting conditions. If an aircraft is modified, then the original equipment manufacturer's previously approved color philosophy should be maintained. Optimally, the radiance and chromaticity of the Master Warning, Warning, Master Caution, Caution, and Advisory messages/annunciators should be as specified in Table 3-1 and Figure 3-1. It is important to emphasize that the colors (specifically, red and amber/yellow) appear to the human eye readily identifiable and distinguishable qualitatively during day and night conditions, as well as not adversely affect NVG performance.

3.3
Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions and Procedures New lighting sources need to be qualified in accordance with RTCA DO-160D, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment based on the intended operating environment. Modified NVIS lighted equipment (e.g., replacing the lighting source in an appliance) will not normally require additional environmental testing if the equipment was previously tested. Environmental testing conditions may be proven through similarity. However, certain NVIS lighting components may need to be qualified to the applicable environmental test conditions and procedures of RTCA DO-160D, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment based on the intended operating environment.

INTEGRATED NIGHT VISION IMAGING SYSTEM (NVIS) INSTALLATION PERFORMANCE
This section states the minimum acceptable level of performance for the equipment when installed in the aircraft. The performance of the NVG and the NVIS lighting components were verified to meet the applicable requirements using the test procedures described in Sections 2 and 3. However, the installed performance of the integrated NVIS shall be verified using the tests described in this section. This is done to evaluate the effects secondary to the physical installation of NVIS lighting components (e.g., cockpit reflections, control locations, etc.) and the effects of cockpit design on the use of NVGs, during both ground and flight evaluations. 

## 4.1 Equipment Installation The Installed Equipment Shall Meet The Performance Requirements Stated In Sections 2, 3 And 4. 4.1.1 Accessibility 4.1.1.1 Accessibility Of Nvg Controls In-Flight Manipulation Of Controls And Operation Of The Nvg Shall Be Possible With One Hand Only, And The Controls Shall Be Readily Identifiable.

4.1.1.2
Accessibility of NVIS Lighting System Controls Lighting controls provided for in-flight operation shall be readily accessible from the pilot's normal seated position and shall be readily identifiable. In-flight manipulation and operation of the lighting controls shall be possible with one hand only.

## 4.1.2 Aircraft Environment The Nvg And Nvis Lighting System Shall Be Compatible With The Environmental Conditions Present In The Specific Location In The Aircraft Where They Are Installed. 4.1.3 Display Visibility

4.1.3.1
Effect of NVG on Display Visibility The effect of the NVG hardware on display visibility should be minimized. The pilot, when seated in the normal flight position, shall have an unobstructed view of the primary flight instruments. All operators should have unobstructed views of displays when in the seated position. 

## 4.1.3.2 Effect Of Nvis Lighting System On Display Visibility Components Of The Nvis Lighting System Shall Not Cause Unacceptable Obstruction Of Data Displayed In The Cockpit.

4.1.4
Dynamic Response (Operation in Intended Environment)
Operation of the NVG and NVIS lighting system shall not be adversely affected by required crew movements, aircraft maneuvering, or changes in aircraft attitude within the aircraft's approved flight envelope. 

4.1.5
Failure Protection Any failure of the NVG and NVIS lighting system shall not degrade the normal operation of equipment or associated systems. Likewise, the failure of interfaced equipment or associated systems shall not degrade normal operation of the NVG or NVIS lighting. Additionally, the applicable regulations or design requirements for the aircraft shall be met.

4.1.6
Interference Effects The conducted or radiated emissions from the NVG and NVIS lighting system shall not adversely affect aircraft systems, nor be adversely affected by conducted or radiated interference from other equipment or systems installed in the aircraft.

Note:
Electromagnetic compatibility problems noted after installation of this equipment may result from such factors as the design characteristics of previously installed system or equipment and the physical installation itself. It is not intended that the equipment manufacturer design for all installation environments. The installing facility will be responsible for resolving any incompatibility between this equipment and previously installed equipment in the aircraft. The various factors contributing to the incompatibility shall be considered.

## 4.1.7 Inadvertent Actuation Of Controls Appropriate Protection Shall Be Provided To Minimize The Possibility Of The Inadvertent Actuation Of Nvg Controls And Non-Nvis Light Sources. 4.1.8 Aircraft Power Source The Primary And Secondary Nvis Lighting Systems Shall Be Powered By Independent Power Sources. 4.2 Installed Equipment Performance Requirements The Nvg And Nvis Lighting System Shall Meet The Requirements Of Sections 2.1, 2.2, 3.1 And 3.2 In Addition To, Or As Modified By, The Requirements Stated In Section 4.

4.2.1
Installed Performance Degradation A limited amount of degradation in NVG performance, as measured by the tests described in this section, may be acceptable. The following describes the acceptable levels of degradation in NVG-aided visual acuity (VA):

1.
The design and/or composition of transparencies (e.g., windshields, windows, etc.)
may result in the loss of energy to which the NVG is sensitive, which can result in image degradation. A loss of one resolution element (approximately 12%) is acceptable.
Note 1:
Windshield anti-ice systems may cause distortion in the area being heated. The distortion may in turn cause some degradation of the outside scene when viewing through the affected area during daytime or when using NVGs. The effect should be evaluated during flight test to determine the impact to operations, and, if necessary, relevant procedures should be developed and incorporated into applicable aircraft manuals. No added degradation to resolution due to this distortion is acceptable. 
CAUTION: When testing the anti-ice system, be sure to review operating limitations for the system. Damage to the windshield can occur if the system is actuated inappropriately.

2.
A maximum loss of one resolution element (approximately 12%) is acceptable when
attributed to warning, master caution and/or master warning messages/annunciators.
Note 2:
All other interior aircraft lighting shall not degrade NVG-aided VA. The combination of all degrading effects shall cause a maximum loss of no more than one resolution element.

## 4.2.2 Additional Equipment Any Additional Equipment Required For Nvg Operations Must Perform Its Intended Function Under All Foreseeable Operating Conditions. 4.3 Conditions Of Test A Detailed Description Of Test Conditions Is Included In Section 4.4. 4.3.1 Safety Precautions Personnel And/Or Equipment Safety Precautions Due To Any Unique Characteristics Of The Equipment Or Installation Shall Be Observed.

The flight test procedures described in Section 4.4 will result in the aircraft being flown in poor illumination conditions at night, possibly in close proximity to terrain and obstacles. The following are proposed as means to mitigate the risk inherent to this type of flight test:

1.
All maneuvers planned for the in-flight evaluation must be briefed during the preflight briefing, including criteria for terminating maneuvers if a potentially unsafe condition should occur. 
2.
The maneuvers planned for the in-flight evaluation should be performed during the
day prior to performing them at night. A build-up approach should be adhered to, progressing from more benign conditions to more severe conditions.
3.
The evaluation crew must familiarize themselves with the area that will be used to
evaluate the aircraft at night under daylight conditions prior to its use at night. Particular attention must be focused on the terrain, obstacles, and off-site landing area suitability. Emergency landing areas should be identified.
4.
Spatial awareness must be maintained at all times. In multi-crewed aircraft if any
crewmember has any doubts about the safety of the aircraft then the aircraft must be placed at a suitable altitude, in non-maneuvering flight until the flight crew is comfortable continuing with the test program.
5.
Prior to commencing the test ensure that all the barometric altimeters are set to the
current altimeter setting, and that the radar altimeter is serviceable. Set the low set index to an appropriate altitude in the radar altimeter.
6.
Maintain awareness of other air traffic.
7.
Maneuvers should be immediately abandoned if visual contact is lost with any obstacles or terrain during a test sequence.
8.
Control and display lighting should be adjusted to a level allowing readability with
minimal delay when transitioning from a bright, intensified image.
4.3.2
Power Input Unless otherwise specified, all aircraft electrically operated equipment and systems shall be turned on before conducting interference tests (See Section 4.4.1.1). The power supply used for ground tests, with the aircraft electrical generating system not operating, should provide power at the appropriate voltage (e.g., using a 24 volt aircraft battery or battery cart will not power aircraft electrical busses at the normal 28 volts).

## 4.3.3 Environment During Test, The Equipment Shall Not Be Subjected To Environmental Conditions That Exceed Those Specified By The Equipment Manufacturer.

4.3.4
Adjustment of Equipment Circuits of the equipment under test shall be properly aligned and otherwise adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practices prior to application of the specified tests.

## 4.3.5 Warm-Up Period Unless Otherwise Specified, Tests Shall Be Conducted After An Appropriate Warm-Up (Stabilization) Period.

4.4
Post Installation Test Procedures The following test procedures provide one means of determining the performance of an integrated night vision imaging system after installation. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that the applicant may prefer other methods. These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information. In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. The equipment shall be tested to demonstrate compliance with the minimum requirements stated in Sections 2.2 and 3.2. It is important to test the complete system. Partial system testing could lead to potential erroneous results and will lengthen the evaluation process. The procedures are designed to capture all components of the NVIS: the NVG (e.g., binocular assembly, mount, and helmet), the aircraft (e.g., NVIS lighting, transparencies, and crewstation ergonomics), and the operator (e.g., personal equipment). There will be concurrent testing in some cases (e.g., NVIS lighting and transparency transmissivity), but the various subcomponents of the system will be discussed individually to ensure each is adequately addressed. The procedures will be divided into those performed on the ground and those performed in flight. 

4.4.1
Ground Test Procedures The following represents a recommended approach for planning and conducting ground testing (A Testing Guide that summarizes the procedures in this section is provided as Appendix H):

1.
Coordinate with the applicant well in advance with respect to the test plan and the
support required for the conduct of testing. The following are some of the things to consider:
a.
Operator availability for test support (e.g., familiarity with aircraft and flight
operations, availability of test subjects, etc.).
b.
Availability of a test area: Typically this will require the use of a hanger or other
building (e.g., paint barn) that can be closed in order to control the interior light level. The test facility shall be sufficiently dark, such that when the NVGs are activated, nothing is visible through the NVGs except scintillation. This may require temporarily sealing windows, disconnecting vending machines, covering exit signs and other actions to eliminate excess light in the space. In extreme situations, this may require flying the aircraft to another site in order to have access to an acceptable test location.
c.
Equipment availability: This includes such things as electrical supply for test
equipment, stands for holding resolution charts, extension cords, coverings for windows, tape, and other things as required by the evaluator.
d.
Test plan development: It is advantageous to have the applicant supply in
advance a list of NVG equipment that will be used, and a layout of the NVIS lighting modification/installation that includes: each component that will be
modified/installed; the method used for the modification/installation (e.g., post light, bezel, floodlight, etc.); and a layout of the cockpit and cabin showing the location of all panels, displays, instruments, controls, annunciators, etc. From this information the evaluator can develop data sheets on which to document test results. This helps reduce the chance of missing items and also provides for a good record of the test.

2.
Ensure the aircraft is ready for testing prior to traveling to the test site. The entire system (NVG selected for use, NVIS lighting, etc.) should be available/installed prior to the start of testing.
3.
Upon arrival, review the test plan with the applicant, examine the testing area to
ensure it is acceptable (e.g., space is adequate, unwanted light sources have been covered or disconnected, etc.), inventory the test and support equipment to ensure everything is available that is needed, and set-up the test equipment. Setting up the test equipment includes such things as placing the resolution chart(s) at the appropriate location(s), measuring the distance from the chart(s) to the relevant eye position(s), placing the illumination source in a location that will not interfere with NVG-aided acuity testing, etc.
4.
NVG and NVIS lighting testing can be accomplished during daytime or nighttime,
but in either case the facility shall be able to be completely darkened (See 4.1.1 b). Testing at nighttime can be conducted in the same space provided for NVIS lighting testing. Ensure that all components are available for testing (e.g., NVG, mount, helmet or other head-mounting device, power supply, etc.).
5.
Some aircraft test procedures can be accomplished during daytime, but most testing
of NVIS lighting should be conducted at night, even if there is a space available that can be made dark. Even in the best testing area some light will intrude during daytime making it difficult to control the light levels required for testing. The order of testing (testing flow) for NVIS lighting may vary depending on the space available (e.g., how well the lighting can be controlled in the hanger, availability of a hanger, etc.) and the availability of test support. However, the following is a typical flow given that the space is adequate and that support is available: a.
Conformity Inspection
b.
Daylight Readability Evaluation 
c.
Crewstation Ergonomics 
d.
Light Leak Evaluation (Shall be accomplished under dark conditions.) 
e.
Nighttime Readability Evaluation (Shall be accomplished under dark conditions) 
f.
NVG-Aided Visual Acuity Evaluation (Shall be accomplished under dark conditions)
4.4.1.1
Interference Effects Tests Applicant is responsible for determining the emission characteristics for the NVIS installed component and how they can affect essential aircraft systems and NVG (if powered by aircraft). With the NVG and NVIS lighting system energized, individually operate each of the other electrically operated aircraft equipment and systems to determine that any detectable conducted or radiated interference do not exist. Evaluate all foreseeable combinations of control settings and operating modes. Make note of system states or modes of operation that should also be evaluated during flight. If appropriate, repeat tests using emergency power with the aircraft's batteries alone and the inverters operating. If detectable interference is noted during ground test, then the applicant shall determine if the worst case has been detected. After worst case is defined, the interference shall be eliminated at the source or the interference shall be evaluated to assure that the NVG or NVIS lighting system functions do not result in an unsafe condition.

4.4.1.2
Night Vision Goggle Test Procedures In addition to the following test procedures, the applicant should review bench test results conducted by the manufacturer, and should refer to the manufacturer instructions for NVG controls and adjustment procedures. Appendix G has a generic sample of NVG adjustment procedures.

4.4.1.2.1
Conformity Inspection Visually inspect the NVG to determine the use of acceptable workmanship and engineering practices. Verify, through review of manufacturer's system description that the NVG is in fact representative of that described and that all components (e.g., binocular assembly, mount, helmet, etc.) are included.

4.4.1.2.2
Equipment Function Testing of the NVG will include an evaluation of the following: visual performance, operator controls, mount assembly, head mounting device, and power supply. Though these will invariably be tested concurrently, it is important to assess each independently for functionality and human factor acceptability.

4.4.1.2.2.1
Operator Controls The purpose of this evaluation is to ensure that controls provided on the NVG perform their intended function during flight. In general, the controls: should allow the operator to properly locate an image directly in front of each eye, should be easily assessable, should move easily, and should not slip once the position is selected. The result should be an image that is properly fused by the brain and does not cause eyestrain after prolonged use. Typical operator controls include the following: fore and aft (to and from the eye), vertical (up and down), interpupillary (eye span), tilt (allows for proper alignment with the visual axis), and power on/off. For most operator's, the final position of all adjustments should be somewhere other than at the end of the adjustment range, thus allowing for maximum use over a wide range of facial types. The controls may be located on different components of the NVG system (e.g., binocular assembly and mount assembly).

4.4.1.2.2.2
Mount Assembly The mount assembly is that part of the NVG system that allows for attaching the binocular assembly (or equivalent) to the helmet (or other method used for head mounting). The mount usually provides access to the power necessary for the NVG to function. In some cases the design may incorporate the mount into the head-mounting device (e.g., helmet with integrated mount). In other cases, the mount assembly may be separate from the head-mounting device. The following are important to assess relative to the mounting system: ease of attaching and removing the binocular assembly (or equivalent), stability of the system when in the operating position (image in the line of sight), and stability of the system when in the stowed position (if available).

4.4.1.2.2.3
Head-Mounting Device The head-mounting device provides a platform on which the binocular assembly (or equivalent) can be attached for operator use. Depending on the system design, the headmounting device may also be the attachment point for the power supply. Typically this will be a helmet but there are other methods that could be used (e.g., hair net mount). The helmet or other device should be evaluated for functionality relative to the use of NVGs. The following are of importance: stability during scanning, comfort during long periods of NVG use (e.g., acceptable weight and center of gravity), and compatibility with the crew station compartment (e.g., remains clear of overhead obstructions, etc.). If a helmet is not used, in addition to the issues previously discussed, it is important to consider the compatibility of the selected head-mounting device with other required flight equipment (e.g., ear phones). 

4.4.1.2.2.4
Power Supply and Controls The power supply may be contained in a separate device attached to the helmet, may be integral to the mount, or may be of some other design. Evaluation of the power supply should include the following: ease of access to controls, ease of manipulation of controls, avoidance of inadvertent activation, ease of changing power supply or batteries in-flight, provision of a back-up power supply, stability of the power supply when attached (if designed as a separate component), and the security of wiring leading from the power supply to the mount.

4.4.1.2.2.5
NVG Visual Performance The visual performance of the NVG must be assessed in order to determine that it meets the intended function. Although this is accomplished mostly during flight testing, ground testing will ensure that the NVG can be safely and effectively tested in flight, and is better suited for determining compliance with minimum standards. If a test set is available that is compatible with the NVG, follow the recommended procedures for that test set and conduct an evaluation of the NVG. Typically this will include: gain, distortion, optical performance, cosmetic defects, collimation, etc. If a test set is not available, a qualitative evaluation may be performed using a chart designed for NVG evaluations that is illuminated by a controlled photopic light source. The following is a recommended procedure:

1.
Locate a space at least 30 feet long that can be made light tight (absence of light).
2.
Place a 1951 USAF Medium or High Contrast Tri-Bar Chart (or equivalent (e.g.,
other tri-bar, sine-wave, square-wave) chart having element intervals of the sixth root of two) at one end of the space. The chart should contain vertical and horizontal resolution elements, and should be designed to be read at twenty feet. 
3.
Illuminate the chart with a light source that is capable of producing selectable illumination that is reasonably equivalent to either full moon or starlight conditions. This can be a simple source and does not need to accurately represent the color content of the night sky. Refer to Appendix I for more information concerning a recommended light source setup and adjustment.
4.
Stand twenty feet from the chart. After correctly aligning and adjusting the NVG,
determine the smallest set of elements in which both horizontal and vertical lines can be discerned. It is not unusual to be able to more easily discern the vertical lines, but in order to be consistent, pick the smallest set in which both are discernable. Discernable means it is clear that the lines are horizontal and/or vertical, but it does not necessarily mean that every individual line in the set can be seen.
Note:
Varying the illumination level and using charts with varying contrast levels will allow for more definitive testing of an NVG, and will help provide a better method of comparing the performance of two different NVGs.
5.
Note the findings and compare to the manufacturer's results for similar conditions
(specification sheet). The purpose is to determine qualitatively if the NVG meets the
minimum standards for resolution. See Appendix F for formulas that can be used to change resolution specifications into Snellen acuity figures.

6.
In addition to resolution, other image characteristics should be assessed during this
procedure. Be attentive to the presence of any of the following: dark spots, bright spots, honeycombing, edge glow, shading, and distortion. Should any of these be obvious and/or distracting, then compare to the minimum standards (Section 2.2.1.8) for compliance.
4.4.1.3
Aircraft Test Procedures These procedures include guidance for conducting tests of the various NVIS components that are incorporated in the aircraft or with which the NVIS components interoperate (e.g., NVIS lighting, transparencies, and crew station ergonomics.

4.4.1.3.1
Conformity Inspection Visually inspect the installed NVIS lighting system to determine the use of acceptable workmanship and engineering practices. Verify, through review of installation drawings, wiring diagrams, and descriptive wiring routing that all mechanical and electrical connections have been made properly and without creating an unsafe electrical and mechanical environment. If primary and secondary NVIS lighting systems are installed, then confirm that they are powered by independent sources. Verify that the equipment has been located and installed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, approved equipment list, and master drawing list (MDL).

4.4.1.3.2
Daylight Readability Evaluation Filters or other methods (e.g., LEDs) employed to make cockpit lighting NVG compatible may degrade the daylight readability of displays and/or annunciators. Consequently, it is necessary to evaluate a NVIS modification to determine if daylight readability has been adversely impacted. Two different assessment procedures will be described. The first consists of a qualitative assessment conducted under natural daylight conditions, and the second consists of qualitative assessment using test equipment to replicate daylight conditions. The following is applicable to the evaluation regardless of the method used: 

1.
Only those modified (or filtered) items that provide information to be read (e.g., displays) or those items that provide status information (e.g., warning, caution or advisory annunciators) need to be evaluated.
2.
In some cases, daylight readability of an item may already be degraded due to poor
design or some other factor prior to the modification. It is highly likely that the modification will worsen the problem. It is the applicant's responsibility to identify items that relate to safety of flight (i.e., caution and warning indicators, primary flight displays, etc) that are to be modified for NVIS compatibility and assess possible daylight readability issues. In these special cases, it shall be necessary for the applicant/ authority to determine compliance with the appropriate regulations. It is highly recommended that these issues be discussed prior to aircraft installation.
3.
The attensity (ability to attract attention) of some annunciators (e.g., fire warning,
master caution, etc.) is critical to flight safety. Modifications to these annunciators must be evaluated to ensure attensity is acceptable.
4.
Modified displays with brightness and/or contrast controls should be evaluated at
various settings to fully assess daylight readability.
5.
The evaluator should document all findings.
6.
It is important to compare the results of ground tests with the results of flight test when making final decisions.
7.
These tests should be conducted with lighting power at the maximum available drive
level applicable for that component. The power supply used for the ground tests, with the aircraft electrical generating system not operating, should provide power at the appropriate voltage (e.g., using a 24 volt aircraft battery or battery cart will not power aircraft electrical busses at the normal 28 volts).
4.4.1.3.2.1
Qualitative Assessment Using Ambient Illumination The intent of this method is to simplify the process by using ambient daylight as the illumination source for evaluating daylight readability. The aircraft shall be positioned outside in an area where it can be easily repositioned. Repositioning is important in order for assessments to be conducted with the sun at various angles relative to the modified components (thus replicating flight in varying directions). The evaluator shall sit in the aircraft at all relevant stations and make subjective assessments of the daylight readability of the modified components. This shall be repeated with the aircraft facing in varying directions in order to ensure the modified instruments are exposed to bright daylight at relevant aspects. The critical case for instrument panel mounted displays is generally when the sun is at a low elevation angle. Therefore, ensure the test is performed when the sun is at low angles, and the light from the sun is unattenuated by any clouds.

4.4.1.3.2.2
Qualitative Assessment Using Artificial Illumination Performing daylight readability assessments while using an artificial source of illumination allows the evaluations to be performed regardless of the time of day or cloud condition, can be performed at any time during the NVIS evaluation process, and provides for a more consistent and reproducible test environment. Daylight readability is evaluated using a sunlight simulation device (sun gun). The sun gun is used in conjunction with an illuminance meter. The illuminance meter is placed immediately adjacent to the component being evaluated, and the sun gun is directed at the meter. The sun gun's distance from the meter is varied until an illuminance of 10,000 foot candles (fc) is indicated on the meter display. The distance is noted in case the illuminance meter cannot be easily placed next to the modified item due to access difficulties. In this case, the sun gun is positioned at the approximate distance from the modified item. The evaluator assesses daylight readability while the sun gun is positioned at the appropriate distance and at various angles relative to the item (thus replicating flight in varying directions). An attempt should be made to note those items that may not be fully subjected to bright sky conditions (e.g., shielded by a glareshield, located on a console well away from windows or a canopy, etc.). In those cases, judgment is required to evaluate daylight readability under realistic operating conditions.

4.4.1.3.3
Crewstation Ergonomics Evaluation In addition to testing the equipment that constitutes the NVIS, it is important to determine if the operators can safely and effectively use NVGs when occupying the crewstation. The following are recommended procedures:

1.
When seated in the various crew positions, evaluate the proximity of obstructions relative to their interference with NVG scanning procedures (e.g., window, overhead consoles, overhead throttles, etc.). In addition the potential for limiting the scan volume (and therefore the NVG field of regard), striking the obstructions may dislodge the NVG from the mount or may cause damage to the object (e.g., scratched window). 
2.
Cross-cockpit viewing of instruments may be required for some aircraft, and if so
should be evaluated during the nighttime readability evaluation.
3.
Accessible stowage locations for the NVGs may be necessary. In this case the stowage locations should be evaluated for ease of access (e.g., reduce heads-down time, require crew coordination technique, etc.), and for security (e.g., protection of NVG and avoidance of loose objects in the cockpit).
4.
If the aircraft has a compartment in which incompatible light sources will be used
during NVG flight, an evaluation should be performed to ensure the incompatible light sources are effectively shielded from the crewstation environment.
5.
Efforts should be made to identify crewstation design features that may increase
operator workload while using NVGs (e.g., primary flight instrument layout, location of controls that are frequently used during flight, etc.).
If the applicant has a fleet of aircraft of the same type that are being modified, efforts should be made to identify significant differences among these aircraft relative to crewstation design considerations. This is especially true for the primary flight instrument layout or the positioning of frequently used controls, displays, etc. These differences may lead to an increase in operator workload when using NVGs in the various aircraft (particularly if different aircraft are flown on the same night).

4.4.1.3.4
NVIS Lighting Test Procedures The following paragraphs provide guidance for performing an evaluation of the interior NVIS lighting modification. If the exterior lighting has been modified (e.g., strobe light repositioned, position lights filtered to reduce infrared emissions, etc.), the only testing that can be effectively accomplished during ground test is functionality (e.g., the correct lights illuminate when selected, the strobe light flashes, etc.). The effectiveness of the exterior lighting is more accurately evaluated during flight test.

4.4.1.3.4.1
 Light Leak Evaluation Light leaks usually result from improper installation procedures (e.g., leaks at the base of a floodlight) or manufacturing problems (e.g., loose filter in an annunciator). If present during the formal evaluation, test results can be invalidated, in particular the NVG-aided visual acuity measurements. Before beginning the formal evaluation, conduct a brief survey of the installed lighting system to determine if light leaks are present. While seated at the crew station and using the NVG that the operator will employ, focus the NVG on the instrument panel. Using the NVG, scan the cockpit (e.g., instrument panels, consoles, overheads, etc.) and look for halos or blooming of the image. Note and record light leaks that are visible to the unaided eye and those that are seen in the NVG image. If the NVIS lighting components have been properly manufactured and installed there should be no halos or blooming. If a halo or if blooming is noted, attempt to identify the offending component or installation defect. This may require refocusing the NVG to the specific area of interest. In multiplace aircraft, or when performing evaluations in areas away from the cockpit (e.g., cabin), perform the same procedure at a location from which the evaluation can be adequately accomplished. It is recommended that significant light leaks be repaired prior to performing further ground tests. 

Note:
Some lighting may cause slight haloing in the image that is normal and acceptable (e.g., NVIS red or yellow annunciators). Fluorescence of red flags within some instruments (e.g., ADI) may also cause slight haloing, but these are normally "off" flags that will not be present during flight. It is important to learn how to differentiate these effects from those caused by true light leaks.

## 4.4.1.3.4.2 Nighttime Readability Evaluation This Is A Subjective Determination Of The Unaided Readability Of Displays, Instruments And Annunciators During Nighttime Operational Conditions. The Intent Of This Test Is To Verify

that unaided nighttime flight has not been degraded by the modifications required to make the aircraft lighting NVIS compatible. Of particular importance is the readability of primary flight instruments, and the readability and attensity of the warning and caution annunciators. The following are recommended procedures/guidelines:

1.
The evaluator should dark-adapt for approximately fifteen minutes prior to the start
of the evaluation. This is normally accomplished during the test set-up or during other evaluations that have been conducted under darkened conditions (e.g., light leak evaluation, etc.).
2.
Adjust each lighting control independently to evaluate its function, to ensure the
range of brightness is adequate, and to ensure that all components whose illumination is dependent on that control are evenly illuminated (balanced) throughout the brightness range. 
Note:
This applies to components that are individually illuminated (e.g., bezels or post lights) and to components that are illuminated by flood lighting. If the exterior lighting has been modified, test the lighting controls to ensure they function as required. Recommend testing exterior lighting controls at the end of the night readability evaluation to ensure dark adaptation. The remainder of exterior lighting evaluation will be conducted during flight test.
3.
Adjust all lighting controls to ensure the entire lighting system (i.e., all illuminated components) can be balanced at operationally relevant brightness levels.
4.
In addition to the illumination balance on each control and the system illumination
balance, evaluate each display for illumination balance across the display face. This is particularly important for the primary flight instruments (e.g., ADI, HSI, altimeter, etc.).
5.
Before beginning the readability evaluation, the lighting intensity should be set at a
level representative of that normally used during flight.
6.
Each display, instrument and annunciator should be evaluated for readability. This
could include such things as: loss of individual color markings in a instrument/display due to filtering effects, shading of information on an instrument due to the edge of a bezel or the presence of a post light, lack of attensity of a warning light due to filtering effects or location (e.g., it was never in the unaided field of view and was not noticeable in the NVG image), readability of numerals found in small windows (e.g., course selection in the HSI), etc.
7.
Evaluate the legibility and/or positioning of switches and other controls (e.g., can the
characters on the panel be read, can it be determined if the switch is on or off, etc).
8.
Evaluate floodlight positioning to ensure stray light is reduced and that light does not
shine directly in the operator's eyes. This includes any component that shines light onto the surface of an instrument (e.g., post light, bezel edge, console floodlight, etc.).
9.
Evaluate failure modes. The evaluator shall simulate failures of various controls,
electrical sources, electrical distribution system etc to account for all significant failures. The evaluator shall make an initial assessment whether a safe transition to instrument flight could be made if there was a loss of outside visual cues. If the aircraft has a secondary NVIS lighting system, it should be evaluated independently from the primary system and should be powered by the relevant source (e.g., battery). The comprehensiveness of the evaluation should depend on the purpose of the secondary system (e.g., good enough to continue the mission or just to allow return home). Regardless, at a minimum, readability of the primary flight instruments should be assessed using only the secondary system.
10. Evaluate all reflections noted on transparencies. Document the location of the reflection and the source. Light leaks are the most common source of reflections and if present may adversely affect NVG performance. Other contributors to reflections include displays (especially large color displays) and floodlights. These sources may contain energy incompatible with NVGs in addition to visible energy that degrades unaided outside viewing. A more detailed evaluation of noted reflections will take place during NVG-aided visual acuity testing.
11. Conduct an evaluation with the NVG in place and turned on. Let the eyes adapt to the
NVG image for a few minutes, then adjust the lighting to a brightness level that will allow adequate readability of all required instruments with no lag in adaptation time (i.e., information on the instruments can be immediately read). Check to see that the brightness can be increased above this level. This will help ensure that the range of brightness is adequate for NVG operations.
12. With the NVG in the operating position, scan the outside scene while noting if the
NVG hardware (e.g., binocular assembly, etc.) obstructs unaided viewability of any displays, instruments, or annunciators. This is particularly important to know regarding warning annunciators (e.g., fire lights) that may be located towards the top of the instrument panel or just beneath the glareshield. If the annunciator is not in the unaided field of view, it is important that it be visible in the NVG image, but without adversely affecting performance (i.e., no change in gain, no large halo, etc.). Refer to Appendix E, last paragraph of 6 for recommendations.
4.4.1.3.4.3
NVG-Aided Visual Acuity Evaluation NVG-aided visual acuity (VA) measurements are obtained with the evaluator seated in the cockpit and with the cockpit lighting adjusted to an operationally representative level. No detectable degradation in VA due to the NVIS lighting should be observed. If degradation exists, the incompatible light source(s) should be identified, except as noted in Section 4.2.1. The NVG used during the evaluation should be representative of the NVG planned for use in the aircraft. If the NVGs intended for operational use have fixed focus objective lenses, then for the purpose of this evaluation NVGs having variable focus objective lenses and overall performance (e.g., resolution, gain) otherwise equivalent to the fixed focus NVG can be employed. Another means is use of (+) 1/8 diopter ophthalmic lenses in front of the fixed focus objective lenses. The assessment shall be conducted in a facility where absence of light can be easily obtained (See Section 4.4.1.2.2.5 Subparagraph 1).

NVG-aided VA measurements are obtained using a USAF 1951 Medium (or High) Contrast Resolution Resolving Power Target (USAF Tri-bar Chart) (or equivalent chart (e.g., other tri-bar, sine-wave, square-wave) having element intervals of the sixth root of two). The chart consists of a large number of target elements, encompassing a wide range of sizes, divided into groups of six. The elements progressively decrease in size (increasing in spatial frequency) at relative intervals of approximately 12%. Each element contains two patterns, each composed of three dark lines and separating white spaces all of equal width; one pattern is horizontal and the other vertical. Each group is identified by a different number, while the elements in each group are numbered 1 through 6. For a given viewing distance, the group/pattern numbers correspond to Snellen visual acuity values varying at fixed intervals of approximately 12%. At least two experienced evaluators should be used for the evaluation. The chart is placed twenty feet from the eyepoint of the evaluator seated in the cockpit. If it is not possible to locate the chart at twenty feet (e.g., multiplace aircraft with various eye positions), the chart is placed at a position where it can be viewed while seated at all crew stations (mathematical adjustments can be made for the varied distances). More than one chart could be used if measurements are to be taken through different transparencies (e.g., windscreen, windows, canopy, etc.), through transparency reflections, or for other purposes. The illumination level on the chart should be adjusted so that NVIS radiance measured from the white portion of the target is equivalent to 1.6 x 10-10 NRB. 

Prior to the assessment of NVG-aided VA, the evaluators will adjust the NVG to obtain maximum VA for the distance to the chart(s). If charts are located at different distances, it may be necessary to make small adjustments of the NVG objective lens focus for each chart. If the NVG has a diopter adjustment, care should be taken not to readjust the diopter setting when making these small adjustments for distance. While measurement conditions will be specific to the aircraft type, test procedures are usually performed in the following order:

1.
Unobstructed (over or around all transparencies)
2.
Baseline condition: View the chart through the appropriate transparency with all
cockpit lighting extinguished, and note the smallest discernable element. Some transparencies may block near-IR energy, thus reducing the amount of energy to which the NVG is most sensitive. Any loss of VA noted when going from the Unobstructed Condition to the Baseline Condition is a result of this effect. In this event, the loss of NVG-aided VA should be assessed for potential adverse effects on flight operations. The NVG-aided VA noted during the Baseline Condition will be the comparison point for determining if the modified lighting has an adverse effect on NVG performance. 
3.
Trial condition 1: View the chart through the appropriate transparency with the cockpit lighting at an operational brightness level and note the smallest discernable element
4.
Trial condition 2: View the chart through the appropriate transparency with the cockpit lighting at an operational brightness level and all warning, caution and advisory lights illuminated, and note the smallest discernable element.
5.
If any VA degradation is noted between the Baseline Condition and either of the Trial
Conditions, then additional measurements should be made with individual lighting components or combinations of components illuminated to identify the offending source(s).
6.
Using the reflection information gathered during the nighttime readability assessment, view through adverse reflections with the NVG to determine the impact on
NVG-aided VA. This may require the relocation of existing charts or the placement of additional charts. If a chart location is modified or if new charts are added, be sure to measure the viewing distance to the NVG. In addition to the reflections that are incompatible to the NVGs, evaluate the impact of reflections on unaided viewing. This may be difficult to adequately assess given the testing conditions. In that case, further evaluations should be conducted during flight tests.
7.
If the aircraft is equipped with a windshield anti-ice system, it should be evaluated (if
possible) to determine the impact on NVG use. Typically the problem will be distortion of the area being heated, which may cause some degradation of the outside scene when viewing through the affected area unaided or when using NVGs. The resolution chart should be viewed through the affected area to determine if there is any NVG- aided VA loss in addition to the distortion. The effects should also be evaluated during flight test to determine the impact to operations, and, if necessary, relevant procedures should be developed and incorporated into applicable aircraft manuals.
CAUTION: When testing the anti-ice system, be sure to review operating limitations for the system. Damage to the windshield can occur if the system is actuated inappropriately.

4.4.1.3.5
Operator Equipment Operator equipment refers to anything the operator may carry aboard the aircraft and use during NVG flight. The following may be included: flashlights, finger lights, lip lights, lighted kneeboards, computers, etc. Anything that will be used at the crewstation during NVG flight should be evaluated for NVG compatibility. Procedures should be developed that will mitigate the risk associated with inadvertent activation of light sources that will adversely affect the NVG image.

4.4.2
Flight Test Procedures
As with ground testing, early planning and coordination are important. Ground testing shall be completed and the modification deemed acceptable prior to the start of flight test. The following represents a recommended approach for planning and conducting flight test: 1.
Coordinate with the applicant well in advance with respect to the test plan and the
support required for the conduct of testing. The following are things to consider: a.
Operator availability for test support (e.g., familiarity with aircraft and flight
operations, availability of test subjects, etc.).
b.
Availability of a flight test area: Ideally this will be the area where flight operations will be conducted, which will allow for a more relevant evaluation regarding the effect that the NVIS system will have on flight operations.
c.
Test plan development: The test plan should be developed jointly with the applicant to ensure it includes test points relevant to the operation. The following test points should be included at a minimum: i.
Flight maneuvers representative of those performed during normal operations.
ii.
Flight over and around terrain and cultural areas representative of those
encountered during normal operations (e.g., mountainous areas, urban areas, reflective surfaces, etc.).
iii.
Flight during various illumination and weather conditions. As a minimum
this test must be performed during a moonless night and in an area with minimum cultural lighting.
2.
Ensure the aircraft is ready for testing prior to traveling to the test site. The entire system (NVG selected for use, NVIS lighting, etc.) shall be available/installed prior to
the start of testing, and the interior NVIS lighting shall have successfully passed ground testing.
3.
Prior to scheduling the test, review the test plan (to include illumination levels and
weather patterns) with the applicant to ensure it is acceptable. 
4.4.2.1
Interference Effects Tests Applicant will complete this test for those systems that need to be evaluated in flight due to the emission characteristics for the NVG or NVIS installed component. Refer to Section 4.4.1.1 for procedures and acceptability criteria.

4.4.2.2
Daylight Readability Evaluation Readability of modified displays and annunciators shall be accomplished during a daytime test flight. The test conditions should be worse case (i.e., bright sunlight) to ensure components that have been modified comply with the appropriate regulations for readability. This is particularly important for those components that have been filtered in order to make them NVIS compatible. Fly the aircraft at headings that will place the sun at various angles relative to the cockpit (e.g., in front of, behind, to the right side, to the left side, etc.). The flight should be scheduled when the sun is lower towards the horizon rather than when it is high. This will increase the opportunity for evaluating worse case sun angles. Pay particular attention to the readability and attensity of warning and caution indicators.

4.4.2.3
Crewstation Ergonomics Evaluation This is accomplished to verify the findings during ground testing and to perform evaluations that could not be adequately conducted at that time. Structures and other obstacles in the cockpit that may limit outside viewability or that may hinder the user from conducting an adequate NVG scan should be evaluated for flight safety. Since part of the evaluation is to determine if there are adverse impacts on the NVG field of regard, this evaluation shall be conducted at nighttime.

4.4.2.4
Nighttime Readability Evaluation This is a subjective determination of the unaided readability of the modified components during nighttime operational conditions. The purpose is to verify findings during ground test and to ensure that night unaided flight has not been degraded by modifications required to make the interior lighting NVIS compatible. The cockpit area (e.g., all instruments and controls) is viewed with unaided vision by looking beneath or around the NVG. Although unaided readability could be performed without wearing the NVG, some of the test points require the NVG to be worn. The lighting should be adjusted to a brightness level consistent with normal flight operations. The following are recommended test points:

1.
Evaluate all modified displays, annunciators, instruments and panels for readability,
balance of illumination across the instrument and panel face, and attensity.
2.
Evaluate the functionality of interior lighting controls.
3.
Evaluate the illumination balance of all components on each dimming control, and
the illumination balance of the entire NVIS lighting system when set by all dimming controls.
4.
Verify that cockpit controls are easily seen and that their selected positions are easily
discernable.
5.
Determine if wearing the NVG has any adverse effects on unaided viewability of
components within the cockpit. For example, when conducting a normal scan of the outside scene with the NVG, are there any warning or caution lights that cannot be
seen unaided due to the NVG hardware.
6.
Evaluate the effect of reflections. If new reflections are noted, attempt to determine
the cause (e.g., aircraft exterior light reflection, moon reflection from smooth surface in the cockpit, etc.) and the impact to flight operations. Due to the potential adverse effects secondary to reflections from exterior lighting, that subject will be addressed in the following paragraph.
4.4.2.4.1
Aircraft Exterior Lighting Evaluation All the aircraft's external light sources must be assessed for objectionable glare and reflections from all crew stations under both NVG-aided and unaided night flight conditions. The aircraft should be flown at operationally representative altitudes, over the expected terrain to assess the effects of aircraft light sources reflecting off the terrain/obstacles. If components of the aircraft, such as FLIR, landing gear, or directable spotlights, can change the external configuration of the aircraft then they should be assessed in their worst possible configuration. The following is a partial list of external aircraft mounted light sources:

1.
Position lights
2.
Anticollision lights
3.
Landing lights
4.
Search lights
If the exterior lighting has been relocated due to previous NVIS testing deficiencies, a comparison with previous test results shall be accomplished to ensure the deficiencies have been satisfactorily addressed If there are objectionable reflections/glare, they shall be eliminated. (See Appendix E, concerning recommended design practices). At least one separate switch must be provided as applicable: 

1.
For each separately installed landing light
2.
For each group of landing lights installed at a common location
These lights shall function in order to provide enough light for night operations, including hovering and landing under NVG-aided and unaided conditions.

## 4.4.2.5 Failure Modes The Pilot Shall Simulate Failures Of Various Controls, Electrical Sources, Electrical Distribution System Etc To Account For All Significant Failures.

The pilot shall verify that a safe recovery can be made following an NVG failure in any phase of flight. The pilot shall verify that a safe transition to instrument flight can be made after encountering inadvertent IMC.

4.4.2.6
NVG Evaluation A flight evaluation of the NVG should be an extension of the ground test. Some of the test points are more applicable if comparing two NVGs in order to down select to one, but they can be applied to the evaluation of a single NVG. An evaluation of the NVG with respect to crewstation ergonomics was described previously (see Section 4.4.2.3).

4.4.2.6.1
NVIS Lighting Compatibility Verification This is a subjective evaluation to ensure that the NVIS lighting modification does not adversely affect the NVG image. The evaluator shall determine that there is no perceptible difference in NVG image quality when viewing the outside scene with the modified lighting on or off. Afterwards, the aircraft should be flown at operationally representative altitudes, over the expected terrain to assess the adequacy of the visual cues provided to the pilot with the NVIS lighting set at operational representative brightness levels.

4.4.2.6.2
Functionality This evaluation relates to the tests described for Operator Controls, Mount Assembly, Head-Mounting Device, and Power Supply and Controls (Sections 4.4.1.2.2.1 through 4.4.1.2.2.4). Confirm that the findings during ground test are applicable to the relevant flight envelope. The following are examples of possible test points:

1.
Ensure that the NVG image remains in the preset position during normal maneuvering.
2.
Ensure that the weight and center-of-gravity are adequate (i.e., comfortable) during
maneuvering and extended use.
3.
Evaluate ease of donning and doffing while at the controls.
4.
Evaluate the stowed position (if available) for utility and clearance from cockpit
structures (e.g., overhead panels, etc.).
5.
Evaluate the functionality of NVG controls (including power controls).
6.
Evaluate the interoperability of the head-mounting device with other equipment (e.g.,
audio head set). Ensure that using the NVG does not degrade the use of other necessary equipment (e.g., makes the head set fit loosely thus reducing clarity of audio).
4.4.2.6.3
Visual Performance The performance of the NVG should be evaluated during conditions that are representative of the expected operational envelope. This includes but is not limited to the following considerations: terrain, proximity of urban areas, operational maneuvers and/or procedures, weather patterns, variation in ambient illumination, time of night, etc. The main purpose is to determine if the NVG provides an image that can be safely and effectively used for the intended missions. If the goal of testing is to evaluate a new NVG or to compare various NVGs for down select, it is strongly recommended that several test flights be scheduled in order to capture as many of the variables as previously listed. To effectively evaluate the performance, it is important to be very familiar with these variables (e.g., know the terrain very well, know the distances to cultural objects, etc.). At a minimum, test flights should incorporate the worse case scenarios (e.g., low illumination and low contrast terrain, most demanding maneuvers, etc.). The following are some examples of possible test points (as previously stated, some of these are more conducive for comparing the performance of two or more NVGs):

1.
Evaluate the effectiveness in detecting subtle terrain variations during high and low
illumination conditions.
2.
Evaluate the effects of cultural light sources (e.g., size and density of halos).
3.
Evaluate the effects of large urban areas (e.g., blooming, de-gaining, etc.).
4.
Evaluate the capability for estimating distances to known cultural or terrain features.
5.
Evaluate the effects of ambient illumination shortly after sunset or shortly before sunrise.
6.
Evaluate the effects of weather and other airborne obscurants (e.g., smoke, haze,
etc.).
7.
Evaluate the suitability of the field of view and the field of regard (partially addressed
in crewstation ergonomics).
8.
Evaluate the ability to effectively control the aircraft while using NVGs (e.g., maintain predetermined altitude and airspeed control over a specified course while conducting NVG visual tasks, etc.).
9.
Evaluate the impact of image characteristics (e.g., dark spots, veiling glare, distortion, phosphor tailing to include undesirable persistence, etc.).

## Appendix C—Glossary

1.
ABSORPTANCE. The ratio of the radiant energy absorbed by a body to that incident upon it.
2.
AIDED. A term used to describe those times when NVGs are being used as an aid to night vision.
3.
ALBEDO. The ratio of the amount of light reflected from a surface to the amount of incident light.
4.
AUTOMATIC BRIGHTNESS CONTROL (ABC). One of the automatic gain control circuits found
in second and third generation NVG devices. It attempts to provide consistent image output brightness by automatic control of the microchannel plate voltage.
5.
AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL (AGC). Comprised of the automatic brightness control and bright
source protection circuits. It is designed to maintain image brightness and protect the user and the image tube from excessive light levels. This is accomplished by controlling the gain of the intensifier tube.
6.
BLACKBODY. An ideal body of surface that reflects or radiates essentially no energy in the spectral
band to which NVGs are sensitive. .
7.
BLOOMING. Common term used to denote the "washing out" of all or part of the NVG image due to
de-gaining of the image intensifier tube when a bright light source is in or near the NVG field of view.
8.
BRIGHT SOURCE PROTECTION (BSP). Protective feature associated with second and third generation NVGs that protects the intensifier tube and the user by controlling the voltage at the photocathode.
9.
BROWNOUT. Condition created by blowing sand, dust, etc., which can cause the operators to lose
sight of the ground. This is most commonly associated with landings in the desert or in dusty LZs.
10. CIVIL TWILIGHT. The time when the true altitude of the center of the sun is six degrees below the
horizon. The illuminance level is approximately 3.40 lux and is above the usable level for NVG operations.
11. DIOPTER. A measure of the refractive (light bending) power of a lens equal to one over the focal
length of the lens in meters. Also, used to indicate the eyepiece focus setting needed to adjust the NVG image to compensate for people that require corrective lenses.
12. DIRECT VIEW IMAGE NVG (TYPE I). Any NVG which displays the intensified image on a phosphor screen in the user's direct line of sight.
13. DISTORTION. The difference between the original image and the intensified (direct or projected image) after correction made by magnification
14. ELECTRO-OPTICS (EO). The term used to describe the interaction between optics and electronics,
leading to transformation of electrical energy into light or vice versa.
15. ELECTROLUMINESCENT (EL). Referring to light emission that occurs from application of an
alternating current to a layer of phosphor.
16. FOOTCANDLE. A measure of illuminance; specifically, the illuminance of a surface upon which one
lumen is falling per square foot.
17. FOOTLAMBERT. A measure of luminance; specifically the luminance of a surface that is receiving
an illuminance of one foot-candle. Also, equal to 1/π candela per square foot.
18. GAIN. When referring to an image intensification tube, the ratio of the brightness of the output in
units of footlambert, compared to the illumination of the input in footcandles. A typical value for a GEN III tube is 25,000 to 30,000 fl/fc. A "tube gain" of 30,000 fl/fc provides an approximate "system gain" of 3,000. This means that the intensified NVG image is 3,000 times brighter to the aided eye than that of the unaided eye.
19. HALO. A bright circular "ring" surrounding a point light source that is caused by electron scattering
in the intensification process. The intensity and size of the halo will vary depending on the ambient illumination, the intensity of the light source, the wavelengths being generated by the light source, the design of the image intensifier, and other factors. The halos from several light sources may coalesce to form larger appearing halos and may result in blooming of the image.
20. HEAD-UP DISPLAY. An electro-optical system that displays flight data to the pilot while maintaining external view and without requiring direct observation of the cockpit instruments. There are two common types of head-up displays (HUD): fixed (aircraft mounted) and NVG-mounted. Fixed HUDs are mounted in front of the pilot, immediately behind the windshield and are viewed directly by NVGs. NVG-mounted HUDs are physically mounted on the NVG, and the imagery is viewed through the NVG optics.
21. ILLUMINANCE. Also referred to as illumination. The area density of luminous flux (visible light
power) on a surface at any given point. Foot-candles (lumens/square foot) and lux (lumens/square meter) are common units to measure illuminance.
22. IMAGE INTENSIFIER. An electro-optic device used to detect and intensify optical images in the visible and near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum for the purpose of providing visible images. The component that actually performs the intensification process in a NVG. This component is composed of the photocathode, MCP, screen optic, and power supply. It does not include the objective and eyepiece lenses.
23. INCANDESCENT. Refers to a source such as a filament that emits light due to thermal excitation,
i.e., heating by an electrical current, resulting in a very broad spectrum of energy that is dependent primarily on the temperature of the filament.
24. INFRARED. That portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in which wavelengths range from 0.7
microns to 1 millimeter. This segment is further divided into near infrared (0.7-3.0 microns), mid infrared (3.0-6.0 microns), far infrared (6.0-15 microns), and extreme infrared (15 microns-1 millimeter). A NVG is sensitive to near-infrared wavelengths approaching 0.9 microns.
25. IRRADIANCE. The radiant flux density incident on a surface usually measured in watts per square
centimeter or watts per square meter. This is similar to illuminance except that it includes all wavelengths of light whereas illuminance includes only visible wavelengths as weighted by the human visual sensitivity curve (photopic curve).
26. LIP LIGHT. A NVG compatible light that can be switched ON and OFF without the use of the hands.
27. LUMEN. A measurement of luminous flux equal to the light emitted in a unit solid angle by a uniform
point source of one candle intensity.
28. LUMINANCE. The luminous intensity of a surface in a given direction per unit of projected area.
This measure of light most closely approximates the human visual sensation of brightness. It is typically measured in units of foot-lamberts or candela per square meter (nits).
29. LUX. A unit of illumination measurement. The illuminance produced on a surface that is one-meter
square, from a uniform point source of one-candle intensity, or one lumen per square meter.
30. MESOPIC VISION. Vision at reduced levels of retinal illumination where both retinal cones and retinal rods are stimulated, but cone function and color vision is limited.
31. MICROCHANNEL PLATE. A wafer containing between 3 and 10 million specially treated microscopic glass tubes designed to multiply electrons passing from the photocathode to the phosphor screen in second and third generation intensifier tubes.
32. MICRON. A unit of measure commonly used to express wavelength in the infrared region; equal to
one millionth of a meter.
33. NANOMETER (nm). A unit of measure commonly used to express wavelength in the visible and near
infrared region; equal to one billionth of a meter.
34. NIGHT. The time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight as published in the American Air Almanac.
35. NIGHT VISION DEVICE (NVD). An electro-optical device used to provide a visible image using the
electromagnetic energy available at night.
36. NIGHT VISION GOGGLE (NVG). When referring to NVGs used for aviation purposes; a headmounted, lightweight, self-contained binocular system consisting of two independent monocular intensifier tube assemblies.
37. PERSISTENCE. The time required for the light emission from the phosphor to decay to 10 percent
from its steady state value after removal of excitation.
38. PHOTON. A quantum (basic unit) of radiant energy (light). 39. PHOTOPIC VISION. Vision by means of retinal cones; full color vision. Relatively high levels of
luminance are required for photopic vision.
40. PROJECTED IMAGE NVG (TYPE II). Any NVG which projects the intensified image on a seethrough medium in the user's line of sight.
41. RADIANCE. The flux density of radiant energy per unit solid angle per unit-projected area usually
measured in watts per steradian per square centimeter or watts per steradian per square meter. This is similar to luminance except that it includes all wavelengths of light (ultra-violet through infra-read) whereas luminance includes only those wavelengths that are visible to the human eye. Radiance and luminance are not interchangeable terms.
42. REFLECTIVITY. The fraction of energy reflected from a surface. 43. SCINTILLATION. Noise in the NVG image that appears as a sparkling or snow-like effect that typically appears when the NVG is operated in an area of low illumination.
44. SCOTOPIC VISION. Vision by means of retinal rods; vision of the dark-adapted eye. In scotopic
vision, the level of luminance is so low that the retinal cones are not stimulated, and there is no color vision. 
45. SITUATIONAL AWARENESS (SA). Degree of perceptual accuracy achieved in the comprehension
of all factors affecting an aircraft and crew at a given time.
46. STARLIGHT. The illuminance provided by the available (observable) stars in a subject hemisphere.
The stars provide approximately 0.00022 lux ground illuminance on a clear night. This illuminance is equivalent to about one-quarter of the actual light from the night sky with no moon.
47. STEREOPSIS. Visual system binocular cues that are used for distance estimation and depth perception. Three dimensional visual perceptions of objects. The use of NVGs seriously degrades this aspect of near-depth perception.
48. TRANSMITTANCE. The fraction of radiant energy that is transmitted through a layer of absorbing
material placed in its path.
49. ULTRAVIOLET. That portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in which wavelengths range between
0.1 and 0.4 microns.
50. UNAIDED. Term used to describe those times when NVGs are not being used (i.e., normal night
vision is not being aided).
51. VEILING GLARE. Ghost image(s), crescents, or other geometrically shaped images appearing in the
system's field of view when a bright source point of light is outside the field of view illuminating the entrance pupil of the objective lens.
52. WAVELENGTH. The distance in the line of advance of a wave from any one point to the next point
of corresponding phase; is used to express electromagnetic energy including IR and visible light.
53. WHITEOUT. Whiteout occurs over an unbroken snow cover, with or without blowing snow, and
beneath a uniformly overcast sky. The observer is unable to discern shadows, horizon, or clouds, and a sense of depth and orientation is lost.

## Appendix E—Aircraft Lighting - Recommended Design Practices

Over many years of designing, producing and installing NVIS lighting modifications there have been many lessons learned. The following is a list of things to be cognizant of during the modification process. The list is not all-inclusive and there may be other acceptable solutions.

E.1
General Guidelines When developing and incorporating a NVIS lighting system it is always important to keep in mind the main goals: instrument readability shall not be degraded, and NVG compatibility shall be maintained. This is particularly applicable to primary flight instruments. Modifying a lighting system for NVG compatibility does not reduce or eliminate the need to use sound cockpit lighting design principles. If anything, cockpit lighting should be better when using NVGs than when not using them in order to ensure instruments can be read easily when quickly scanned and to help reduce the added workload created by the use of NVGs. The lighting modification should include instrument panels, overhead panels, consoles, switches, circuit breakers, magnetic compass, secondary (emergency) lighting, cabin lighting, etc.

E.2
Eliminating or Reducing Glare and Reflections Secondary to Interior Light Sources
Minimize use of floodlights (excessive stray light can cause reflections from such things as clothing, seat belts, knee-boards, and floorboards that interfere with unaided viewing of the outside scene).
If flood lighting is used, ensure correct positioning to eliminate stray light and to provide best instrument readability. Use of non-reflective near-IR paint in the cockpit may help reduce reflections that adversely affect NVG performance (remember - NVGs are mostly sensitive to near-IR energy). It is important to test the paint for near-IR reflectivity before applying. Even some black paints may contain substances that do not reflect visible light but may be good near-IR reflectors. Use of non-reflective mats/covers may help reduce unwanted reflections. 

Note:
Flammability regulatory requirements shall be met.

Use of louver film or filters may help reduce unwanted reflections by directing the light in desirable directions, while reducing stray radiation. Glare shields may be used to block stray energy from light sources within the cockpit, thus reducing potential unwanted reflections. Replacing crazed/scratched windscreens may help minimize the effects of reflections. Crazing and scratches can cause what would normally be a small area of reflected energy to spread (diffuse) over a much larger area.

E.3
Eliminating or Reducing Glare and Reflections Caused by Exterior Light Sources Consider an exterior light design that is less offensive to NVG performance. Normally this means designing and producing exterior lighting that continue to meet the FARs for unaided viewing while reducing the adverse effect on NVGs. One way this can be accomplished is by filtering out the IR energy being emitted by the light source, while allowing the visible wavelengths to pass. 

Consider blanking/blocking the portion of external light source that introduces light into cockpit area. Consider repositioning of the offending exterior light source. Glare shields may be used to block energy from light sources outside the cockpit, thus reducing potential unwanted reflections. Consider limiting operational use of the offending exterior light source. Consider limiting the flight envelope of the aircraft so there are no effects from the light source (e.g., keep well away from clouds, remove NVGs prior to landing, etc.).

Notes:
1. The regulatory requirements for the design of exterior lights (e.g., intensity,
angle coverage, and color) shall be followed.
2. The regulatory requirements for the use of exterior lighting shall be followed.

## E.4 Eliminating Light Leaks Proper Use Of Potting Material, Gaskets, Etc. May Help Eliminate Light Leaks.

Consider an alternate source of illumination when a light leak cannot be eliminated.

Notes:
1. NVGs can be used to identify the source and location of light leaks.
2. It is a good operating practice to scan the cockpit area with NVGs prior to
taking off to identify light leaks. It is possible that light leaks that are not noticeable to the unaided eye can still adversely affect NVG performance.

## E.5 Improving Daylight Readability Of Instruments And Annunciators Increasing The Power To Existing Light Sources, Adding Additional Lamps, Or Changing To New Light Sources (E.G., Leds, Etc.) May Help Improve Daylight Readability.

Consider trying different types of filters. Reducing the use of color will help avoid the potential problems associated with daylight readability.

Notes:
1. Only those components modified for NVIS compatibility should be assessed
for daylight readability.
2. Components with pre-existing daylight readability problems will likely be
made worse when filtering for NVIS compatibility.
3. The regulatory requirements for the use of color shall be followed.

## E.6 Modification Of Warning, Caution And Advisory Lights Use Of Nvis Red, Yellow, Green And White Filter Material Is Recommended For Warning, Caution And Advisory Lights.

Colors must be distinguishable from each other (e.g., red versus amber). If any of the warning or caution lights are blocked from the unaided field of view when scanning the outside scene with the NVG (i.e., blocked by the physical presence of the goggle), consider moving the lights or ensuring that, when illuminated, the warning/caution lights are visible in the NVG image, but without adversely affecting performance.

E.7
Illuminance and Luminance Levels for Cockpit and Cabin The following tables provide general guidance for illuminance and luminance levels for the cockpit and cabin. Cabin levels for emergency medical service modifications or other special operations may need to be higher.

E.8
Aircraft Exterior Lighting Conventional exterior aircraft lighting emits, in addition to the visible light required to meet existing regulations (FAR 27 and 29); near infrared (NIR) energy that, if directed into the NVG may cause NVG aided VA to be degraded. Existing regulations require that the output from exterior light does not cause objectionable glare to the pilot. Note that the NVG is much more sensitive than the eye, therefore, glare that is not objectionable to the naked eye may be objectionable to the pilot using NVG. One means to reduce the NIR energy is to introduce visible pass NIR blocking filters in front of the incandescent light sources; however, the lights must still meet existing regulations. An alternative is to replace the lights with new lights fitted with filters or lights using LEDs as the light source. The performance of lights with filters is best evaluated by measuring NVIS Radiant Intensity (NRI) as this provides (by comparison) information regarding the range from which modified lights can be seen by the NVG.

E.9
Incandescent Position Lights Measurement of existing filter and LED light systems has shown that the NRI values shown in the Table E-3 below can be achieved with either filtered incandescent or LED
lighting systems. 

Note:
The lower limits are determined by the existing performance of green lights with glass covers.

## Appendix G—Suggested Nvg Preflight And Adjustment Procedures

G.1
NVG Preflight Effectiveness A correctly adjusted NVG that has been properly assessed will result in maximized performance. Optimizing performance will enhance operational effectiveness and safety. Until very experienced with focusing procedures and the effects caused by various goggle control adjustments, the use of an NVG eye lane or an adjustment tool such as the ANV-20/20 is the only sure method of optimizing performance.

G.2
NVG Preflight Procedures NVG preflight procedures fall into three parts: initial inspection, alignment, focusing, and image assessment. These must be accomplished in this sequence in order to ensure the NVG is in good condition and to ensure the best performance is attained prior to flight.

G.2.1
Initial Inspection Procedures Inspection procedures for the NVG are similar to the preflight procedures used for other aircrew or aircraft systems in that the purpose is to determine if all parts are in working order and if the system is functional. The initial adjustments performed during this time will place the binocular assembly in a favorable location in front of the eyes once inserted in the mount and rotated to the operating position, thus facilitating the alignment procedures. Before donning the helmet and the NVG, examine all components and manipulate the controls to ensure all are in proper working order. The following are recommended procedures:

1.
Inspect Helmet. Inspection of the helmet should be the same as for unaided flight.
However, particular attention should be paid to helmet fit due to the extra weight and forward center of gravity caused by the mount, goggle and battery pack.
2.
Inspect Mount. Ensure the mount is not cracked and that all contacts are clear and
clean, and check wiring for integrity. Test all controls for smooth operation.
3.
Load Battery Compartment. Prior to inserting the batteries, make certain that the
NVG is turned off. Ensure the batteries are correctly inserted.
4.
Inspect Binocular Assembly. Ensure there is no obvious damage to either monocular
housing. Each housing is attached to the binocular assembly bridge, which is constructed of lightweight plastic material. Consequently, each monocular may move slightly when gently moved, but the movement should not be excessive. Rotate the objective and diopter controls to ensure freedom of movement. The diopter controls are naturally "sticky" in their travel due to a plastic-on-plastic design. However, if the controls are very difficult to turn, the NVG should not be used. Test all other controls for smooth operation.
5.
Inspect and Clean Lenses. Inspect the objective and eyepiece lenses for scratches or
other damage. Clean the lenses with lens paper or equivalent material and not with a flight suit or a tee shirt. A single thumbprint on one of the lenses may degrade visual acuity by as much as thirty percent.
6.
Set Diopter. Set the diopter on each monocular to zero. Doing so will help ensure the
resolution chart will be initially viewable when beginning the focusing procedures.
7.
Adjust Eye Relief. Eye relief is the distance between the eyes and the surface of the
eyepiece lens. Position the binocular assembly as far forward (away from the eyes) as possible. This will avoid damage to spectacles and placement of oil on the lens from
eyebrows or eyelashes when the NVG is attached to the mount and rotated to the operating position.

Note:
The operational eye relief position varies person to person and is dependent on a number of factors. Essentially, the selected position should allow the user to easily view the cockpit area when looking around or below the
goggle without sacrificing the full field of view.
8.
Center Tilt. Set the tilt adjustment to the centered position (determined by aligning
the tilt lever with bottom portion of the bridge). Ensure the IPD adjustments do not move when manipulating the tilt lever.
9.
Set IPD. Actuate the IPD controls to ensure the mechanisms move freely and that the
tilt lever does not move as the monoculars track along the bridge.
10. Adjust Vertical. Ensure the mechanism tracks smoothly to the upper and lower limits
of movement, and ensure the thumb wheel moves freely. Leave the adjustment in the centered position.
11. Don Helmet. The helmet should be donned in order to check for proper fit and to prepare for attaching the NVG. Fasten and adjust the chinstrap. The chinstrap will help stabilize the helmet when the NVG is attached.
12. Attach and Remove Binocular Assembly. Attach the binocular assembly to the mount
by holding the binocular assembly in a vertical position (i.e., parallel to the body), aligning the spring loaded bearings in the binocular assembly with the grooves in the mount, and pushing gently until the assembly snaps into place. Do not exert excessive force. If too much force is required, it is an indication that the bearings are not properly aligned and the binocular assembly may fail to seat properly or become jammed in the mount. 
Do not release the binocular assembly until confirming that it will lock securely in the stowed position. This action confirms two important points: it indicates that the binocular assembly is properly seated in the mount, and that the assembly has not been mounted backwards. If the assembly will not lock in the stowed position, remove it, turn it 180 degrees, and try again. Once the binocular assembly has been properly seated, press the lock release button and rotate the assembly to the operating position. The eyepiece lens (diopter adjustment) should now be closest to the eyes. Begin removing the binocular assembly by pressing the lock release button and turning the binocular assembly to a vertical position. Once out of the locked position, the lock release button can be released. Pull the binocular assembly straight forward out of the mount, preferably using both hands. Easy removal may be facilitated by first pulling one side slightly out of the detent, and then pulling forward on the assembly. Practice mounting and removing the binocular assembly until comfortable with the procedures.

G.2.2
Alignment Procedures Proper alignment is important because the best visual performance is possible only when the optical axis of the binocular assembly is perfectly aligned with the visual axis of the eye. For this reason, precise focus is not possible until proper alignment has been accomplished. Rough alignment procedures can be accomplished prior to turning off the lights. This can be beneficial in an operational setting when other aircrew may be in various stages of inspection and initial adjustment. It will, in addition, expedite the alignment procedures once the lights are turned off.

Note:
Never turn on the NVGs in brightly lighted areas. Repeated exposure to bright light will result in a reduction in the life of an intensification tube.
The following is a recommended order of procedures for obtaining a proper alignment. Using the same procedures in the same order will, over time, help ensure that none of the steps are inadvertently omitted. The procedures are conducted with the helmet on, and the NVG attached and in the operating position.

1.
Vertical Adjustment. Adjust the vertical position of the binocular assembly using the
vertical adjustment control. The binocular assembly should be located directly in front of the eyes.
2.
Tilt Alignment. Adjust the tilt so the optical axis of the binocular assembly is perfectly aligned with the visual axis of the eyes. Changes in tilt usually require a correction in the vertical adjustment, and vice versa.
3.
Eye Relief Adjustment. If necessary, move the binocular assembly closer to the eyes.
As discussed earlier, eye relief should be positioned to maximize the field of view without unnecessarily reducing the ability to see around the NVG to view cockpit displays or perform other tasks. It is especially important that the goggle never be positioned so close to the face that the eyepiece lens contact spectacles or eyelashes.
4.
IPD Adjustment. Close one eye and center the image in front of the opposite eye
(e.g., close the left eye and, using the right IPD control, center the image in front of the right eye). Repeat for the opposite eye. With both eyes open, the two images should overlap to form a single image. Small adjustments may be necessary to form a single image.
5.
Evaluate Image. When the goggles are correctly aligned, there should be no shading
of any part of the image. If shading is present, attempt to eliminate it by making adjustments in the direction of the shading. If there is insufficient travel in the goggle adjustments, move the entire helmet in the direction of shading. If proper alignment can only be made by moving the helmet, it is an indication that the mount assembly is not properly positioned on the helmet. In this case an attempt should be made to reposition the mount.
G.2.3
Focus Procedures (For NVGs having variable focus objective lenses)
These procedures are performed with the lights off. Stand at the appropriate distance from the resolution chart and turn on the NVG. The objective is to be able to see the grids well enough to determine whether the lines are horizontal or vertical. Every line in the grid may not be perfectly clear, but the direction of the lines should be readily apparent. Start by using the coarser grids, and then move to the finer grids as the adjustment process continues.

1.
Objective Focus. With one eye closed or one tube covered, turn the objective lens
(outer ring) of the opposite tube while viewing one of the coarser grids. Attempt to bring the lines into sharp focus. Do not spend a great amount of time with this initial focus, as the purpose is to obtain an image that is adequate for permitting a suitable diopter adjustment.
2.
Diopter Focus. Next, turn the diopter focus adjustment (inner ring) counterclockwise
(to the left) until the image is blurred. Pause for one to two seconds to allow the eye muscles to relax, and then turn the diopter adjustment clockwise until the image first becomes quite sharp. It may be necessary to continue to move the adjustment clockwise in order to correctly locate the point where the image first becomes sharpest. In this case, begin the process again by rotating the adjustment counterclockwise until the image blurs, then clockwise to the predetermined point of first image sharpness. Two or more of these exercises may be necessary in order to correctly set the diopter.
Performed correctly, this procedure focuses the image on the retina of the eye without accommodative effort by the eye muscles. Rotating the diopter adjustment beyond the point of first sharpness forces the eye muscles to actively work to keep the image focused. Over time, the eye muscles will become fatigued and unable to maintain focus. This results in a gradual loss of visual acuity and depth perception and often causes severe eyestrain and/or headache.

Note:
The diopter adjustment is the one most misunderstood, and if maladjusted can result in degraded visual acuity. It is essential to understand what the adjustment accomplishes and how to properly perform the procedure.

3.
Readjustment of Objective Focus. Once the diopter has been adjusted, fine-tune the
focus by readjusting with the objective adjustment to bring into focus as many of the grids as possible. This accomplishes two things. First, it assures the user that the diopter adjustment has been satisfactorily performed. Second, it allows for an accurate assessment of NVG performance.
At first it may take several attempts going back and forth between the diopter and objective adjustments to obtain the best focus. However, once comfortable with the procedure and when familiar with the visual picture, focusing can be accomplished accurately and consistently with ease.

4.
Focus of Opposite Monocular. After focus of the first monocular is accomplished, the
same procedures are employed to focus and evaluate the remaining monocular. Do not be concerned if one side is slightly beter than the other. Slight differences in the performance of individual intensification tubes are common.

## G.2.4 Assessment Of Nvg Image When Focusing Is Complete, Assess The Nvg Image. With Experience, Some Of These Things Will Be Noted When Performing Alignment And Focusing Procedures.

1.
Evaluate Visual Acuity. Visual acuity obtained with both eyes should always be at
least as good as that obtained by either side. If this is not the case, the goggles should be returned and another pair obtained. The minimum acceptable visual acuity will be established by the operator, but is always best to maximize NVG performance.
2.
Evaluate Image Quality. A number of image peculiarities and defects exist, some
acceptable and others not acceptable. The most common include the following:
a.
Shading. Appears as a shaded or indistinct area along the edge of the image. If it
cannot be eliminated by adjusting the IPD or by moving the goggle toward the shading, the defect is likely within the optics and the NVG should not be used.
b.
Edge glow. Appearing as a bright area along the outer edge of the image, edge
glow is most often the result of a bright light source somewhere just outside the image field of view. If noted, turn away from any bright lights or hold one hand over the objective lens. If the edge glow persists, it is an indication of damage to the intensification tube and the goggle should not be used.
c.
Bright spots. Constant or flickering bright spots may appear anywhere in the
image. Hold one hand in front of the objective lens. If bright spots are still present and they degrade the image and/or are distracting, do not use the NVG.
d.
Dark spots. Dark or black spots in the image. If large, numerous, or located near
the center of the image, the goggle should not be used.
e.
Honeycomb. A honeycomb-like pattern in the image, which is most often seen
in high light-level conditions. If it is obvious or distracting, the NVG should not be used.
f.
Distortion. The most common types of distortion noted in the NVG image are
"bending" distortion and "shear" distortion. Bending distortion results in the image having a wavy appearance, usually in the horizontal or vertical directions. Shear distortion results in a choppy appearance somewhere in the image. If distortion is present and it is deemed likely to interfere with normal operations, do not use the NVG.
g.
Flicker. The NVG image from one or both tubes may flicker. The effect may
occur only at a particular illumination level. If noted, do not use the NVG.
h.
Veiling glare. Appears as a light haze across the entire image. It can be caused
by dirty, chipped, or scratched lenses. If it is obvious during the adjustment procedures, do not use the NVG.
i.
Scintillation. A normal finding at low light levels. It is seen as a sparkling effect
over the image and represents electronic noise created at the high gain levels that occur during low illumination conditions. In flight, it can be an indication of decreasing illumination caused by such things as worsening weather conditions or flight into shadowed areas.
Note:
Newer intensification tubes have improved signal to noise capability. Consequently, scintillation may be subtler and may not occur until darker conditions. If used to a certain level of scintillation under specific conditions, the use of an NVG with newer tubes may lead to an assumption that conditions are better than actual. 

## G.3 Procedures At The Aircraft Perform The Following Procedures Prior To Takeoff:

1.
Focus the NVG at Optical Infinity. If the NVG was focused to 20 feet in the eye lane,
it will be necessary to refocus at infinity before flight using only the objective lens (unless the diopter setting has been inadvertently moved). This can be accomplished
by focusing on an object at least 150 feet distant, preferably one with well developed
vertical or horizontal features. It must be illuminated well enough to be easily seen with NVGs but not so brightly lit that the image blooms or washes out. Avoid focusing on incompatible lights because the halo effect they create makes it difficult to discern when the image is in precise focus. Stars are excellent point light sources that do not cause halos and provide for a good endpoint for focusing.
Note:
If unable to perform this procedure prior to launch (e.g., takeoff during daylight), use the same guidelines in finding something to use for focusing to infinity while airborne.
2.
Set Aircraft Lighting and Display Intensity. Set lighting and display intensity so
information can be easily interpreted when looking around or below the NVG. When the NVG is turned on, the brightness of the image will cause unaided night vision to be adversely affected. This will require cockpit lighting and display intensity to be increased in order to be able to immediately interpret information they present. If the lighting is set at a dimmer level, more heads-down time will be required to interpret the information, which may result in loss of situational awareness or, at worse, may result in spatial disorientation.
3.
Practice NVG Donning and Removal. Practice donning and emergency removal of
the NVG in the aircraft prior to flight. This will become less necessary as more experience is gained with donning and removal of goggles.

## G.4 Procedures While Airborne Make The Following Minor Adjustments During Flight As Required:

1.
Vertical. As the helmet settles and/or rotates during flight, it may be necessary to
make minor vertical adjustments as needed to keep the image in the proper position in front of the eyes.
2.
Tilt. Any vertical adjustment will likely require a readjustment in tilt.
3.
Eye Relief. Eye relief may need readjusting to allow better viewing of cockpit instruments or displays, or in some cases, to maintain the full field of view.
4.
IPD. Make small adjustments to IPD as required.
Note:
Limit changes to diopter settings. Once adjusted correctly in the eye lane or with the ANV-20/20, the diopter should never need to be reset in flight. If the diopter was not adjusted prior to flight or if the setting was inadvertently moved, both objective focus and diopter should be readjusted using the standard procedures and an appropriate target (e.g., stars, etc.).

H.1
NVG
1.
Verify NVGs are functioning properly and have no defects that would affect test
results.
2.

## H.3 Setup Requirement For Night Ground Evaluation 1. Aircraft Must Be In A Facility That Can Be Sealed From All Light Sources.

2.
A resolution chart (preferably a tri-bar or equivalent chart) is positioned ∼ 20 ft in
front of the pilot's eye position.
3.
An appropriate NVIS light source is used to illuminate the resolution chart (See
Appendix J).
4.
Aircraft ground power should be available since the test may last several hours. In
addition, an AC power source should also be available and within close proximity to the aircraft.
5.
Window/doors and interior shall represent the operation configuration.
6.
Windshield and windows are clean prior to evaluation.
7.
Evaluator must be familiar with A/C switch positions and be able to activate correct
switches during a darkened condition (BAT, NAV, COMM, lights, operating equipment, etc.).
8.
Evaluator must assure proper adjustment of NVG (focus on target at higher ambient
light condition).
H.4
Test Sequence 
Note:
This is accomplished in a darkened test facility, properly illuminated resolution chart, with the evaluator adapted to NVG light level or image brightness level.
1.
Outside A/C a.
Evaluator will be positioned abeam crew position (outside A/C maintaining 20
feet from the chart) and determine the smallest element on the chart where the white between the black line is clearly discernible.
b.
Note the line number or identify this chart position\ if a different resolution chart
is being used for the tests.
2.
At each pilot and/or operator's seat position
a.
Normal operation position with aircraft doors/windows closed.
b.
All A/C lights OFF.
c.
Note smallest element with acceptable resolution.
d.
Determine if there has been any degradation in the NVG VA due to windshield
by comparing the results of test 1 with the results of test 2. The maximum permissible NVG VA degradation due to the windshield is 12%. 
3.
Light leakage check
a.
Turn on all NVIS lighting systems and check for hot spots (non-compatible light
sources).
b.
Turn on all COMM/NAV and mission systems and again check for hot spots
(light leaks around filters).
c.
All light leaks shall be fixed.
d.
Determine if the evaluation can be continued without jeopardizing test results
using "work around" solutions.
4.
NVIS lighting tests
a.
Start with all A/C lights OFF (including BAT) and reestablish smallest element
on chart that can be resolved.
b.
Evaluate each NVIS lighting system through the full range of intensity (in night
mode only, if applicable) and determine if there is any degradation in the NVG VA obtained from Step a., due to the aircraft lighting system. 
c.
Evaluate combination of NVIS lighting system to represent operational condition (intensity level) and determine if there is any degradation in the NVG VA obtained during Step a., due to the aircraft lighting system. Also ensure lighting is uniform across cockpit instruments, gauges, displays, etc.
d.
Activate COMM, NAV and any other lighted systems individually and in combination and determine if there is any degradation in the NVG VA obtained from Step a., due to various aircraft systems or displays. 
Note:
These tests should include all potential light sources that could be used during an operational situation. Ensure all equipment/instrument and cabin lighting has been modified (i.e., magnetic compass, OAT gauge, circuit breaker/switch panels). The effect on NVG VA due to Caution/Warning/Advisory lights or annunciators shall be evaluated.
e.
Degradation of NVG VA due to NVIS lighting is not permitted except as noted
Section 4.2.1.
5.
Cockpit glare/reflections
a.
These tests should include an evaluation in all aircraft positions that flight crew
or other individuals will occupy during NVG operations. Additionally, the evaluator should attempt to position themselves to insure a full range of operational eye positions are assessed.
b.
During (c) and (d), evaluate all external viewing areas for objectionable glare
and reflections.
c.
All sources of glare and reflections shall be identified. Objectionable glare and
reflections shall be corrected.
d.
Effects from illumination of caution/warning or advisory lights must be evaluated. These tests will be repeated during the flight evaluation phase also.
Note:
The evaluations should be repeated by another evaluator that uses a different sitting position, or the evaluator must reposition to a "non-normal" position to insure the required extremes of evaluator eye position has been tested.
6.
Interference
During the ground tests, note any anomaly that appears to be interference between NVG and other installed equipment. A more comprehensive EMI test shall be conducted during flight phase.

7.
Failure
The effects of NVG/NVIS and A/C system failure should be simulated during the ground test to assess the impact that system failures may have on NVG operations. Some failure modes must be evaluated during the flight phase.

8.
Head movement
a.
During these tests, with the evaluator in normal seated position, anticipate head/
body movement to simulate operational scenarios. Determine if interference between NVG and A/C structure (or other installed appliances) exists.
b.
During the ground tests normal inflight scan patterns should be evaluated for
obstructions to clear field of view. The effects of any blockage to field of view must be evaluated during the flight phase.

## Appendix I—Nvg Preflight Illumination Source Assembly Instructions Necessary Materials

Light fixture (recommend the "Spot Clip Light" from Brilliant Light Inc.) One 7 ½ watt (night light type) bulb Electrical tape Black cardboard or matting material Five millimeter hole punch Millimeter ruler Scissors

1.
Obtain a standard light fixture that accepts a 7 ½ watt bulb and has a 40mm distance from the bulb to
the edge of the enclosure. (See Figure I-1) The 40mm distance is critical for proper chart illumination.
2.
Carefully cut disk of black cardboard or matting material to fit the opening of the light fixture. Make a
hole in the exact center of the disk using the 5 millimeter punch. (See Figure I-2) From the 10' placement distance, this hole will allow the 7 ½ watt bulb to illuminate the resolution chart with the equivalent of full moonlight. In order to get starlight conditions, one may add a rheostat to allow dimming capability of the bulb.
3.
Using rubbing alcohol, remove the manufacturer's logo from the light bulb. Install the light bulb in
the fixture.
4.
Tape the disk over the front of the light fixture using the electrical tape. Secure all edges to prevent
light leaks.
5.
Cover the vent holes in the back of the light fixture with electrical tape. This prevents excessive light
leaks. If overheating occurs, try leaving the holes partially covered and determine if the light leakage is excessive. If it is desirable to completely cover the vent holes, reducing the amount of time the light is left on will help lessen overheating of the assembly.
