## 1 Purpose And Scope 1.1 Introduction

This document contains minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) for avionics that provide Aeronautical Mobile Satellite (R) Services (AMS(R)S) by means of satellite communications technologies scheduled to become operational after the year 2000.  Each of these technologies is individually and collectively referred to as a "Next Generation Satellite System" (NGSS), and the NGSS nomenclature will be used throughout this document.  This document does not apply to avionics that provide AMS(R)S in accordance with the Standards and Recommended Practices defined in ICAO Annex 10, Part I, Volume III, Chapter 4 (Chapter 4 SARPS).  Such equipment is specified in the current version of RTCA DO-210. 

Compliance with these standards is recommended as one means of assuring that NGSS 
avionics will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operations.  Any regulatory application of this document is the sole responsibility of appropriate governmental agencies. 

This document contains a generic description of a satellite communication system configuration including Ground Subnetworks; NGSS Satellite Subnetworks, of which the Aircraft Earth Station (AES) is one part; and Aircraft Subnetworks.  However, the specified Minimum Operational Performance Standards in this document address only the AES portion of the Satellite Subnetwork. 

To comply with the minimum requirements of an application for certification or other approval, an NGSS applicant is required to submit information regarding the technical characteristics of the NGSS.  These technology-specific technical requirements for each such system will become normative appendices to this document.  It is anticipated that such technology-specific appendices will be created as the particular NGSS becomes operational for AMS(R)S. 

This document covers typical NGSS avionics requirements and tests for the aircraft avionics.  It includes the purpose, scope and equipment performance requirements, recommended bench tests and other performance verification procedures, and installedequipment tests and operational performance characteristics.  Detailed requirements and test procedures are based on the technical characteristics documented in the normative appendices, as discussed in the previous paragraph. 

A companion document, Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) for the Aeronautical Mobile-Satellite (R) Service (AMS(R)S) as Used in Aeronautical Data Links, should be available in early 2001.  The MASPS should be consulted for operational requirements at the air/ground system level, and for details of specific systems providing AMS(R)S.  RTCA documents DO-215A and DO-231 provide guidance on overall data and voice performance issues. 

## 1.2 Document Overview

Section 1 of this document provides general background information needed to understand the NGSS equipment and system characteristics and requirements stated in the remaining sections.  It describes typical applications and operational goals as envisioned by the members of Special Committee 165 and establishes the basis for the standards stated in Section 2 and Section 3.  Definitions and assumptions essential to proper understanding of this document are also provided in this section, while a more extensive glossary appears as Appendix A.  A more detailed informative explanation of the operation of each of the aeronautical services provided by particular NGSS systems is contained in the appropriate technique-specific appendix.  Section 1 of this MOPS is intended to be informative in nature and contains no requirements applicable to the avionics equipment covered by this document. 

Section 2 contains the minimum performance standards for the aircraft NGSS equipment. These standards specify the required performance under standard operating and environmental conditions, and are common to all NGSS AES equipment.  Specific values which quantify the requirements are contained in the technique- or technology-specific appendix prepared for each system.  The main body of the MOPS also includes bench test procedures necessary to demonstrate equipment and network compliance with the stated minimum requirements. 

Section 3 describes the performance required of the installed aircraft avionics equipment. 

Tests specifically for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. 

Section 4 describes the operational performance characteristics for equipment installations and for network operation and defines conditions that will assure the equipment user that operations can be conducted safely and reliably in the expected operational environment. 

Appendix A is an informative appendix containing an extended glossary, abbreviation, and acronym list. 

Appendix B is a normative appendix and associated test procedures for AES equipment that implements an ISO-8208-compliant ATN interface. 

Appendix C is an informative appendix containing specific recommendations tailoring the requirements contained in this MOPS for equipment that supports only non-safety AMSS communications. 

Additional technique-specific normative appendices are included.  These are intended to be part of certification or approval documentation information.  Each of these normative appendices is divided into two sections.  Section 1 contains a detailed informative description of system operation, focusing on those aspects particular to AMS(R)S. Subsequent sections contain normative information regarding the technique- or technology-specific requirements  unique to the particular NGSS.

Document references within these MOPS are used to assure common requirements between various documents, to minimize the risk of conflict, and to reduce the complexity of this document.  The user of this MOPS should keep in mind that the referenced documents may or may not contain actual references to NGSS equipment and, therefore, some editorial translations may be necessary. 

As used in this document, the terms "aircraft avionics" and "Aircraft Earth Station" 
include all components and units necessary for the aircraft system to provide voice and/or data communications using the satellite constellation, but not including the aircraft user subnetwork defined in DO-215A. The NGSS avionics comprises multiple components, including antennas, couplers, voice digitization circuitry and modulators/demodulators. A particular NGSS avionics complement will not necessarily include all components or units referred to herein but will perform all required functions. 

The guidelines contained in RTCA/DO-178B, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, should be considered with respect to NGSS 
avionics software.

## 1.3 System Overview

The Aeronautical Mobile-Satellite (R) Service, abbreviated as AMS(R)S, is the designation by the ICAO and ITU for two-way communications via satellite(s) pertaining to the safety and regularity of flight along national or international civil air routes.  The designator (R) is added to indicate that the international spectrum allocation is intended for aeronautical communications for aircraft flying civil aviation routes.  Equipment and services operating in radio spectrum designated as (R) are historically accorded special measures of protection from interference and normally are used only for communications related to the safety and regularity of flight.  In the case of AMS(R)S, non-safety communications are also permitted on a non-interference basis when priority and preemption can guarantee the precedence of safety communications.  The term Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service, AMSS, without the (R), is often used (e.g., in ICAO documentation) and is considered to comprise both AMS(R)S and the non-safety aeronautical services, which can include specialized government and administrative communications as well as public correspondence. 

End-to-end AMS(R)S data communications are provided by several subnetworks (aircraft user, avionics, satellite, terrestrial and ground user) as shown in Figure 1-1. This MOPS 
addresses only the avionics portion of a subsystem which consists of satellites, Aeronautical Earth Stations (AESs), Ground Earth Stations (GESs), radio-frequency propagation paths, and associated ground facilities including a Network Control Center (NCC) function. 

Figure 1-1 depicts a single satellite served by multiple GESs for illustrative simplicity only.  Depending on the architecture of a particular system, multiple satellites may be in view of an aircraft; and a satellite may not require any GES in its own view by maintaining connectivity via intersatellite links. 

 
Ownership and operation of the satellites, aeronautical stations, ground stations and network control functions may be responsibility of one or several organizations or corporate entities. 

An important element of the system architecture is the NCC function.  Again depending on the architecture of a given system, this function may be entirely contained in the ground segment, comprising GES(s) and control centers; or the NCC functionality may be shared between the ground segment and the satellite constellation.  It is not assumed that GESs are completely autonomous but it is expected that  a system's GESes conform to common operating policies and rules and utilize with some form of intersite communication.  The NCC function could be distributed among a domain's GESs and/or satellites; however, it is expected that all NCC functions have some form of intercommunication. 

## 1.3.1 System Elements And Functions 1.3.1.1 Aircraft Earth Station (Aes )

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- An Aircraft Earth Station (AES ) serves as the radio transceiver that provides RF path connectivity with the satellite(s), and provides the digital data and/or analog voice and/or digital voice interfaces with other aircraft user subsystems.  Its primary functions are the modulation and demodulation of transmitted and received signals, respectively; signaling and protocol interactions with corresponding satellites and/or Ground Earth Stations (GESs); channel management; and switching and interconnections with the aircraft and their attached avionics. The sensitivity, gain, polarization, and spurious requirements specified in Section 2.2.3 of this document are intended to support the system-level link budgets contained in the corresponding MASPS or other RTCA document. 

Figure 1-2 provides a generic block diagram of the AES described in this document.  This document contains requirements for the antenna and transceiver subsystems of the generic AES.  Figure 1-2 is intended to be informative, not normative; there is no requirement to design equipment that corresponds to the partitioning of the block diagram.  No functionality beyond that stated in Section 2.2 is required. The requirements contained in Section 2.2 are designed to be tested or measured at either the external antenna interfaces or at the transceiver interfaces.  The transceiver interfaces are indicated by points A and B in Figure 1-2.  Special control signals may be required to execute the recommended tests. 

## 1.3.1.2 Ground Earth Station (Ges)

 A Ground Earth Station (GES) provides the connectivity between the ground network(s) and the satellite(s) via RF transmission and reception feeder links.  Components of a GES include antenna(s), modulators and demodulators for the transmitted and received signals, respectively; computers controlling the signaling and protocol interactions with corresponding Aircraft Earth Stations (AESs); and channel management.  A GES may also host some or all of the Network Control and Coordination functionality. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 1.3.1.3 Network Control And Coordination Function

The Network Control and Coordination Function performs administrative and technical management functions for an AMSS Subsystem.  Among the functions essential to the provision of AMSS services are satellite tracking, telemetry and control (TT&C); overall system management and performance monitoring; maintenance of data bases of satellite and user parameters; frequency management; inter- and intra-system coordination; and billing. 

## 1.3.1.4 Satellites

 This document does not assume a particular type of NGSS satellite constellation for AMS(R)S use.  Satellite constellations are typically characterized by their orbital parameters, and are generally segregated into four groups: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO), and near-Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO). LEO systems contain a multiplicity of satellites in orbits between 500 km and 1500 km altitude.  The Low-Earth nature of the orbits dictates that the velocity of the satellites is much greater than the platform velocity of even high-performance aircraft, thus the system design must compensate for relatively high Doppler shifts at all times.  Typical LEO communications systems depend on a multiplicity of antenna spot beams to service the user service link.  Some LEO systems require continuous connectivity between the satellite providing service and an associated Ground Earth Station, while others allow for indirect connectivity by means of intersatellite radio links. MEO systems rely on constellations with orbits in the range of 1500 km to 15,000 km altitude.  Because the higher orbit permits coverage of a larger portion of the Earth's surface by each satellite, MEO constellations generally have fewer satellites than LEO constellations.  Most MEO constellations are likely to use a "bent pipe" communications technique that requires continuous connectivity between the satellite providing service and an associate Ground Earth Station. HEO constellations are designed to allow each satellite to service a particular region of the Earth's surface for long periods of time.  A typical HEO orbit has a perigee in the range of 1000 km and an apogee of approximately 10,000 km.  Satellites in HEO orbits may be used as a supporting element of LEO, MEO or GEO constellations. 

GEO constellations consist of satellites at an orbital altitude of 35,800 km.  At this altitude, the orbital period is 24 hours, and the ground track of the satellite varies only slightly with time.  From the viewpoint of a user aircraft, the satellite is nearly stationary. Typical GEO constellations consist of only four or five satellites in equatorial orbits, spaced nearly uniformly in longitude.  The AMS(R)S/AMSS communications described in ICAO Chapter 4 SARPs and in the current version of DO-210 utilize such a constellation of GEO satellites.  This document specifically allows for the possibility of future GEO constellations that comply with the more generic requirements of NGSS, vice the original requirements detailed in Chapter 4 SARPs and in DO-210. 

## 1.3.1.5 Satellite System Coverage

The coverage area of a satellite system is determined by the aggregation of all servicelink beams formed by all satellites in its constellation.  In current AMSS systems, coverage of an individual beam can range from that portion of the Earth's surface within line of sight of a given satellite (roughly one-third of the Earth's surface for a GEO 
satellite) to a portion of the Earth's surface as small as 800 km in diameter.  These beams can be stationary (as in GEO system) or can be continuously moving over the Earth's surface (as in a LEO/MEO system). 

This document defines coverage area as that airspace over a delineated portion of the Earth's surface, within which all service/performance criteria are met by a given Satellite Subsystem.  It is the responsibility of the Satellite Subsystem service provider to define, declare, and verify its coverage areas.  Information on the service area provided by a specific NGSS system can be found in the applicable technique-specific appendix to this MOPS. 

## 1.3.2 Communications Protocols

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN) is being implemented on a worldwide basis to provide a common set of interfaces and protocols for aeronautical data communications (see also Section 1.4.1).  The requirements of this document are based on the assumption that NGSS data services will be constituent subnetworks of the ATN. 

The ATN is based on the Open System Interconnect (OSI) data communications model. 

The OSI Reference Model defines seven such functional layers with responsibilities ranging from control of data transfer on the physical media (radio, wire, fiber, etc.) to control of the application user interface.  The seven layers are named: (1) Physical, (2) Data Link, (3) Network, (4) Transport, (5) Session, (6) Presentation and (7) Application. Each layer provides communication services to the layer above it.  The particular protocol for a given layer may be optimized for the environment in which it operates; e.g., a satellite communications subnetwork must operate in a medium prone to errors, has long propagation times, and has limited bandwidth. 

Each layer incorporates well-defined operations designed to optimize control and information flow across the layer boundaries.  To carry out its function, each layer may add protocol control information fields to the service-data-unit supplied by the layer above.  However, each layer leaves the control information added by previous layers intact, treating it as data to be passed on unaltered.  The aircraft avionics and its counterpart of the ground station implement either the lowest two or the lowest three layers of the OSI model to provide packet-mode data services. This document recognizes two potential modes of data operation.  These modes are referred to as Data-2 and Data-3, to be consistent with existing industry standards (see RTCA/DO-210D).  Data-2 operation provides transparent data communications by enveloping the packets received from a higher-layer entity (HLE) without using internal network layer protocols.  Data-3 operation provides to the user a packet-switched subnetwork that implements the lowest three layers of the OSI model (physical, data link and network) and is intended for use with the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN).  One proven means of providing an OSI compliant interface for ATN data is by using the standard interface defined in ISO-8208. At initial operational capability, it is anticipated that all equipment compliant with this standard will support Data-2, with Data-3 available when ATN equipment and procedures are established. 

 

## 1.4 Operational Applications

 Applications for the NGSS satellite communications include both safety and non-safety services.  Safety services are always given priority, and can, if necessary to secure system resources, preempt non-safety traffic.  A detailed description of safety and non-safety services falling into the four categories described below can be found in DO-215A. The AES equipment specified here is intended to support the following categories of aeronautical communications related to the safety and regularity of the flight: 
Air Traffic Services (ATS) - Safety communications between the flight crew and air traffic control as necessary for safe air navigation (e.g., air traffic control, navigation system operation, weather information collection and dissemination).  This includes tactical control of aircraft to ensure safe separation and sequencing, clearances to enter controlled airspace, approach clearances, weather information collection and dissemination, and the coordination of handoffs between adjacent control areas. Although current procedures provide ATS services primarily via voice networks, future ATN applications will primarily use data communications to performed the same functions. 

Aeronautical Operational Control (AOC) - Safety communications between the flight crew and flight operations as necessary for initiation, continuation, diversion, or termination of a flight in the interest of the safety of the aircraft and the regularity and efficiency of a flight.  Current procedures provide AOC services via both voice and data networks. In addition to safety communications, the equipment specified herein may also support the following non-safety communciations: 
 
Aeronautical Administrative Communications (AAC) - Non-safety communications between the cabin crew or flight crew and airline business operations as necessary for passenger services or cabin support services. 

Aeronautical Public Correspondence (APC) - Non-safety communications between an aircraft passenger and party/parties on the ground or in another aircraft for the passenger's private or business use.  APC services are provided via both voice and data networks. 

## 1.4.1 Compatibility And Interoperability

NGSS satellite communications must be compatible and interoperable with external avionics systems and external terrestrial communications networks for users ranging from private aircraft through widebody commercial jet transports.  This requires implementation of well-defined interfaces and peer-to-peer protocols; therefore, a NGSS 
satellite system must provide standard end-user subnetwork interfaces among satellite systems and associated terrestrial systems on a global basis.  One such standard is the ISO/IEC 8208 mobile sub-network dependent convergence function.  Other standard interfaces are permissible. For packet data transmissions, NGSS will implement the OSI Reference Model and will ultimately be integrated in the ATN.  When the ATN is operational, NGSS communications will be interoperable at the subnetwork interface level with High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF) and Mode Select (Mode-S) data links.  It is expected that common operating procedures will be used among all three systems. 

For worldwide ATN compatibility among these constituent subnetworks, a common routing and addressing scheme is required.  The twenty-four (24) bit International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aircraft identification numbers will be recognized by the NGSS systems.  Translation from ICAO standard address to an identity number consistent with the number used internally by the satellite subnetwork  is performed in a manner transparent to airborne and ground users. 

NGSS equipment is intended to co-exist with AMSS equipment specified by DO-210D at least to the extent that use of either type of equipment within a given airspace will not preclude use of the other type of equipment.  Certain protection separations may apply, but these separations will be well within the standards established for routine aircraft operations within the airspace in which NGSS operations are permitted.  It is expected that the service providers of NGSS services and existing AMSS services will coordinate system operations to assure operations on a non-interfering basis in accordance with ITU 
Radio Regulations.  This system level coordination will not directly affect the design, test, or installation of NGSS equipment.  Changes in system operation, if necessary, will be instituted at the appropriate network control facility or appropriate ground station. 

While these MOPS do not require that dissimilar AMSS equipment be able to operate simultaneously and independently on the same aircraft, manufacturers are urged to consider such interoperability as a very desireable feature of their equipment design. 

## 1.4.1.1 Protection Of Radio Astronomy

Worldwide deployment of AES terminals means that transmissions can occur near sensitive Radio Astronomy sites, and that those sites could experience harmful interference from out-of-band spurious AES emissions.  The standards established in this document protect Radio Astronomy (RA) data collection from harmful effects of AES emissions in the L-Band during normal over flight and maneuvers near the RA station. The maximum permissible power spectral flux density and averaging parameters of ITU- R RA.769-1 have been applied for the purposes of establishing these spurious emissions levels.  Each AES design should complete a thorough analysis to assure that it complies with ITU-R RA.769-1 given the specific operational characteristics of the satellite subnetwork it supports. 

## 1.4.2 End-To-End Service Criteria

 
The criteria for NGSS service provided among end users of the system are contained in RTCA DO-215A. 

## 1.5 Assumptions And Postulated Environment 1.5.1 Coverage

 This MOPS assumes an NGSS communications system which provides coverage with a common user link signal format and satellite sub-network protocol over an extended portion of the Earth's surface, preferrably worldwide.  It assumes that communications capabilities do not depend on the location of the NGSS user aircraft within the defined coverage volume, nor on the availabililty of a line-of-sight between the AES and the GES.  Ideally, the system should allow any aircraft to communicate with any location on Earth, regardless of the position of the aircraft or the originating or terminating location. 

## 1.5.2 Data Versus Voice Communications

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- Although voice communications will be used for the foreseeable future, as the capacity and precision capabilities of aeronautical data links become more apparent, routine air-ground-air communications will evolve toward being computer-tocomputer.  Pilots and controllers will use digital data for many purposes but will continue to use voice communication for non-routine and emergency communications.  The NGSS system design is assumed to support voice services, data services, or both, as declared in the technique-specific appendix.  This MOPS allows both data-only and voice-only capabilities.  Combined voice and data units are encouraged, but this MOPS does not require that all types of AES equipment  be capable of  both data and voice services or of simultaneous data and voice services. 

 

## 1.5.3 Safety

 Safety communications, by ICAO and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) regulations, are assured of always having the highest priority and are accorded special measures for protection from interference.  A system supporting safety communications is assumed to have the appropriate priority and preemption control mechanisms embodied in all elements comprising the system. 

## 1.5.4 Priority, Precedence And Preemption

 The primary mechanism for assuring that safety related communications are always available is the mechanism for priority, precedence and preemption.  This MOPS assumes that the NGSS system design implements the priority structure necessary for Aeronautical Mobile (R) Service safety services.  This includes the mechanisms for controlling the precedence of both safety and non-safety messages, for the preemption of system resources as needed to support safety services and to provide for the added measure of protection to be accorded the safety services.  Priority, precedence and preemption mechanisms are assumed to apply to both data and voice transmissions, with voice communications taking priority over data transmissions at the same level of priority. 

## 1.5.5 Assumptions On Higher Layer Packet Data Interfaces

To support the evolving ATN environment, this MOPS emphasizes data communications. Data link operations are defined in terms of a user application, also known as a Higher Level Entity (HLE).  For the purpose of specifying these interfaces, this document assumes the HLE performs the following functions: 

a. Is able to initiate, accept and terminate calls via the interface.
b. Is prepared to accept error messages from the AES. c. Monitors the AES operation in case of unrecoverable error conditions and reinitializes
the AES as necessary.

## 1.5.6 Assumptions On Voice Communications Using Digitized Voice

Despite the fact that the evolving ATN environment will utilize digital data communications, there is still a desire to maintain voice communications for some operations, especially distress/urgency communications.  This document assumes that the underlying communications infrastructure exists and has not been created solely for the purpose of AMS(R)S communications.  To the extent that the underlying infrastructure provides voice communications, it is expected that such voice capability will be provided by digital means, and not by conventional analog modulation techiques. 

When such "digital voice" technology is implemented, the techniques used to translate the spoken word into digital form and back will be established by the specific subnetwork.  This document only establishes the high level requirements for such voice encoding and decoding techniques, which are collectively referred to as "the vocoder". Previous RTCA efforts have indicated that the suitability of a particular vocoder for a particular AMS(R)S function involves a subjective evaluation of voice communications using that vocoder in a variety of channel environments and ambient audio noise environments.  Furthermore, complete interoperablility between two different vocoder implementations is extremely problematic.  Thus, this document assumes that voice communications, if provided, will utilize the standard vocoder employed by the satellite subnetwork and sets an extremely high standard for the use of any alternate vocoder. This is the only manner in which both interoperability and suitability for a particular application can be assured. 

## 1.5.7 Assumptions On Aircraft Motion

The minimum requirements stated in this document assume that the AES is to be operated on a commercial air transport vehicle operating at approximately 550 knots true air speed with a 250 knot tail wind.  Thus the frequency tracking requirements are for 800 knots ground speed, with a recommendation for supersonic aircraft. 

## 1.5.8 Assumptions On Same-Aircraft Interference

The minimum requirements stated in this document assume that all AES equipment will be located on-board aircraft that use GNSS receivers for navigation and location.  GNSS 
equipment is assumed to comply with the ICAO GNSS SARPS.  Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all interference requirements assume an AMS(R)S-antenna- input-port-to-
GNSS-antenna-output-port-isolation of 40 dB. This document also assumes that it is a minimum requirement for AMS(R)S equipment to operate simultaneously with and independently from other AMS(R)S equipment, possibly using different communications infrastructure, when the different equipment is installed on different aircraft operating in the same airspace.  Furthermore, it is highly desirable that AMS(R)Sequipment operate simultaneously with and independently from other AMS(R)Sequipment on the same aircraft.  In such case, the assumed AMS(R)S-
system-A-antenna-input-port-to-AMS(R)S-system-B-antenna-output-port is 40 dB. 

 

## 1.6 Overview Of Test And Performance Verification Procedures

 The test and performance verification procedures specified in this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the performance requirements.  Although specific test and performance verification procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred and may be used if they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. The specified order of procedures suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of tests or analyses as it moves from design to design qualification and into operational use. Since NGSS systems are expected to utilize a significant amount of commercial telecommunications functionality, this standard specifically allows pre-qualification of embedded core hardware and software, subject to verification that the hardware and software which implement AMS(R)S-specific functionality do not alter the previously qualified functions. Four types of procedures are described in the following Sections. 

 

## 1.6.1 Environmental Tests And Performance Verification

 Environmental test and/or analysis requirements are specified in Section 2.3.  The procedures and their associated limit requirements are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under the environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations. Unless otherwise specified, the environmental conditions and test procedures contained in RTCA/DO-160D, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, will be used to demonstrate equipment compliance. 

## 1.6.2 Bench Tests And Performance Verification

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- Bench test and/or analysis procedures are specified in Section 2.4, and provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Section 2.2.  
Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design. 

## 1.6.3 Installed Equipment Tests And Performance Verification

The installed equipment test and/or analysis procedures and their associated limits are specified in Section 3.0.  Successful completion of bench and environmental test procedures is a precondition to completion of the installed equipment tests.  In certain instances, however, installed equipment tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from or to other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc.  Installed-equipment tests are normally performed under two conditions: 

a.
With the aircraft on the ground and using simulated or operational system inputs
b.
With the aircraft in flight using operational system inputs appropriate to the
equipment under test
Test results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the intended operational environment. 

## 1.6.4 Operational Tests And Performance Verification

Operational tests and/or analyses are specified in Section 4.0.  These test procedures and their associated limits are intended to be conducted by operating personnel as one means of ensuring that the equipment is functioning properly and can be reliably used for its intended function(s).

methods used for satellite subnetwork access, not necessarily to the internal data communications processes used within the specific sub-network. 

Residual Packet Error Rate: The likelihood that a particular packet will be duplicated or delivered incorrectly.  An incorrectly delivered packet is one in which the user data is delivered to the satellite subnetwork interface with one or more bit errors or the user data is deliverd to an incorrect higher level entity.

## Equipment Performance Requirements And Test Procedures 2.1 General Requirements 2.1.1 Airworthiness

The design and manufacture of the equipment shall provide for an installation that does not impair the airworthiness of the aircraft. 

## 2.1.2 Intended Function

The equipment shall perform its intended function, as defined by the manufacturer, and its proper use shall not create a hazard to users of the National Airspace System. 

## 2.1.3 Federal Communications Commissions Rules

The equipment shall comply with all applicable rules of the Federal Communication Commission (FCC).1 

## 2.1.4 Fire Protection

All materials used shall be self-extinguishing except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire. 

Note: One means of showing compliance is contained in the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Part 25, Appendix F. 

## 2.1.5 Operation Of Controls

The operation of controls intended for use during flight, in all possible combinations and sequences, shall not result in a condition detrimental to the continued performance of the equipment.  Controls shall be designed to maximize operational suitability and minimize pilot workload.  Reliance on pilot memory for operational procedures shall be minimized. 

## 2.1.6 Accessibility Of Controls

Controls that are not normally adjusted in flight shall not be readily accessible to flight personnel.  Controls that are normally adjusted in flight shall be readily accessible and properly labeled as to their intended function.  The controls shall be operable with the use of only one hand. 

## 2.1.7 Effects Of Tests

The equipment shall be designed so that the application of specified test procedures shall not be detrimental to equipment performance following the application of these tests, except as specifically allowed. 

## 2.1.8 Performance In A Shared Environment

 All requirements for data integrity and timing shall consider the effect of other active aircraft data links performing transfer operations in both directions at their nominal rates. It is strongly recommended that the AES receiver design take into account the existence and/or probable deployment of other mobile communications systems operating in the airspace, on-board the aircraft, or in the proximate airport environment.  Because the power flux densities (both composite and per carrier) of such systems may be very much higher than the power flux density of the desired NGSS downlink carriers, particular attention needs to be paid to the dynamic range of the AES receiver, to avoid saturation and consequent intermodulation products.  At the same time, the receiver design should provide as much selectivity as possible as near to the input port as possible in the receiver down-conversion process.  Despite these precautions, it may prove infeasible to independently and simultaneously operate two NGSSs or a NGSS and a Chapter 4 SARPs-compliant satellite communications equipment on the same aircraft. 

## 2.2 Equipment Performance Requirements, Standard Conditions

 Figure 2-1 provides a graphical guide to the organization of the equipment performance requirements discussed in the following subsections. In the event of a conflict between a requirement stated in Section 2 of this document and a requirement stated in a system-specific2 appendix, the requirement in the systemspecific appendix shall take precedence. 

Note:  Precedence is given to the system-specific appendices because, by their very nature,  these appendices represent later, more up-to-date information than the main body of this document. 

 

## 2.2.1 Avionics Subsystem Definitions And Overall Requirements

 Single-channel AES equipment shall support voice-only or packet-data-only or nonsimultaneous voice-or-data operations.  Enhancements to single channel AES equipment may include optional data rates or simultaneous voice and data operations. Multi-channel AES equipment shall support either voice-only or packet-data only, or a combination of simultaneous voice and packet mode data, and may support circuit mode data services.  The manufacturer shall declare any limitations on the combination of voice and data services supported by the equipment. 

Note 1: 
For the purposes of this requirement, a distinction is made between packet mode data and circuit mode data services.  Packet mode data utilizes services that operate by transferring independent packets of information over the subnetwork interface.  Circuit mode data, such as facsimile is transferred via a point-to-point connection between the local (airborne) and remote users.  
This document places no restriction on the method used to implement either packet mode or circuit mode data.  Because AMS(R)S circuit mode data requirements have not yet been established, the minimum requirement is for packet mode. 

Digitized voice shall utilize the protocol, including any forward-error-correction coding and interleaving, determined for the vocoder implementation specified in the techniquespecific appendix. 

Note 2: 
Digitized voice operation is expected, but not required, to utilize a circuit mode connection. 

## 2.2.2 Definition Of System Specific Parameters

The normative system-specific appendix contain requirements that apply only to a particular NGSS system or technology.  It is expected that such appendix will heavily reference requirements documents created as part of the systems engineering process followed by the satellite system architects and designers.

## 2.2.3 Detailed Requirements 2.2.3.1 Aes Application Requirements

This section and its subsections contain AMS(R)S-specific requirements for functionality over and above that required for basic access to the satellite network. 

## 2.2.3.1.1 Antenna Notes:

 
1. Unless otherwise noted, the following specifications generally apply to unsteered 
antennas, with fixed, near-omnidirectional patterns for both transmit and receive 
functions.  However, in certain instances (e.g., to increase data throughput) higher gain, mechanically or electronically steered antennas may be required by the NGSS system design.  For steered antennas, the following specifications are to be met over 
the specified coverage volume when supplied with steering data having the worstcase specified accuracy. 
 
 
2. The receiver sensitivity specified herein is a bench-test requirement.  When coupled 
with the antenna performance specified in the following subsections, and when compensated for the effective sky temperature of typical operations, this sensitivity is 
consistent with the Figure of Merit G/T requirements of the MASPS and DO-215A.  
Manufacturers are cautioned that antenna designs may degrade the achieved G/T, and that these effects must be considered in the overall system performance estimates required by the [MASPS].

Axial Ratio The AES antenna voltage axial ratio shall not exceed RA
A
 relative to a perfect circularly polarized antenna over the declared coverage volume, or else the antenna shall have sufficient gain to compensate for excess polarization losses caused by an axial ratio greater than RA
A
.  To calculate the gain compensation required, the satellite antenna axial ratio shall be assumed to be RSV
A
, and the major axes of the satellite and AES 
polarization ellipses assumed to be orthogonal to each other. 

Note: It is recommended that the maximum axial ratio not exceed 6 dB over the 
coverage volume. 

## 2.2.3.1.1.3 Power Handling Capabilities 2.2.3.1.1.3.1 Single Carrier Units

Note: This requirement refers to the number of carriers, not necessarily the number of channels. 

For avionics designed to transmit only a single carrier, the maximum power handling capability of the AES antenna shall be sufficient to support at least one individual data or one individual voice carrier, whichever requires the higher burst output power consistent with the requirements of Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, below.  The choice of data or voice shall be dependent on the capabilities of the specific AES as declared by the manufacturer. 

## 2.2.3.1.1.3.2 Multi-Carrier Units

channels. 
For avionics designed to operate simultaneously on multiple carrier frequencies, the maximum power handling capability of the AES antenna shall be sufficient to support simultaneous transmission of at least D
N  individual data carriers and V
N  individual voice carriers meeting the requirements of Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.1 below.

## 2.2.3.1.1.6.1 Radiated Antenna Intermodulation Products In The Gnss Band

 When tested by transmitting two unmodulated carriers, the average power output produced by antenna-generated wideband intermodulation products in the frequency bands 1559-1605 MHz, 1164-1233 MHz, and 1260-1300 MHz shall not exceed –122 
dBm when measured in a direction toward a likely location(s) of a GNSS antenna(s) on the same aircraft.  For the purpose of this requirement, the intermodulation products shall be measured at the GNSS antenna output port.  Both carriers shall be generated at the maximum permissible individual carrier power level in accordance with Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, and both carriers shall be on assignable carrier frequencies within the band TMN
f to TMX
f
.  Average power output shall be as defined in Section 1.7, above.  
Narrowband intermodulation products shall be limited to –125 dBm under the same conditions.  For the purposes of this requirement, the GNSS antenna is taken to be a quarter-wave monopole antenna matched to its load and the isolation between the AES 
antenna and the GNSS antenna is taken to be 40 dB.  Systems that declare a different antenna isolation in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.3 may adjust this requirement based on the declared antenna isolation, with more isolation resulting in an increase in the allowable intermodulation product level. 

Note: For the purposes of this requirement, "wideband" intermodulation is defined as occurring when the following inequality is satisfied: 

 
25,000 Hz
ORDER
M

For the purpose of this requirement, harmful interference is defined as an interference power level that increases the effective noise temperature of the victim AMS(R)S system by more than 6%.  In this condition, the other antenna is taken to be a quarter-wave monopole antenna matched to its load and the isolation between the AES antenna and the victim AMS(R)S antenna is taken to be 40 dB. Relaxation for increased isolation is permitted under the same conditions as in Section 2.2.3.1.1.6.1. For steered antennas, this specification shall apply for the worst-case beam direction within the declared system coverage.

## 2.2.3.1.1.7 Carrier-To-Multipath Discrimination

When measured over a representative ground plane, the difference in decibels between the minimum antenna gain measured at the minimum declared elevation angle, MIN
Θ
, and the maximum antenna gain measured at the same angle below the horizon, shall be greater than the minimum carrier-to-multipath discrimination,

C M , required by the technique specific appendix. 

## 2.2.3.1.1.8 Pattern Discrimination

When measured over a representative ground plane, the difference in decibels between the antenna pattern measured at any two potential satellite positions above the minimum elevation angle, MIN
Θ
,  and separated by the minimum separation angle, SA
Θ
, shall be greater than the minimum pattern discrimination,
/
D U , required by the technique specific appendix. 

Note: Some systems, such as those with omindirectional antennas, may not have a pattern discrimination requirement. 

## 2.2.3.1.1.9 Steered Antenna Requirements

, as declared in the technique specific appendix. 

Note: Both phase discontinuity and beam switching transients may affect the 
performance of the demodulator, which is heavily system-dependent.  Factors 
such as data rate, modulation method, error correction and interleaving characteristics, as well as the demodulator design itself, can determine by how much the integrity of the received data is affected.  In addition, different systems may have different overall requirements for the integrity/availability of the received/transmitted data.

Note 1: This requirement is included to provide compatibility with the GNSS receiver susceptibility requirements.  The linear segments were determined from Appendix B of the GNSS SARPS.  The absolute power levels are given at the input to the AMSS/AMS(R)S antenna.  The absolute power levels assume a minimum isolation between the GNSS antenna output to the GNSS receiver and the AMS(R)S antenna input of 40 dB.  This value is consistent with the assumptions made in DO-210D and the Chapter 4 SARPs. 

The manufacturer may establish a system-specific requirement different from the assumed 40 dB.  Any such a requirement shall be declared in the system-specific appendix.  When an isolation value different from 40 dB is declared in the systemspecific appendix, the allowable power output values in Table 2-2 may be changed by an equivalent amount. 

 
Note 2: For example, if a system-specific isolation of 50 dB is declared, the values in 
 
Table 2-2 may be adjusted by (50 - 40) = +10 dB.  Thus, the adjusted requirement of Table 2-2 in the 1614-1626.5 MHz band is: 
 

$$\begin{array}{r}{4.64\times(\mathrm{f}-1614)-40\mathrm{~dB}+(50\text{-}40)\mathrm{~dB}}\\ {4.64\times(\mathrm{f}-1614)-30\mathrm{~dB}\mathrm{~dB}}\end{array}$$

Both carriers shall be generated at the maximum permissible individual carrier power level in accordance with Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, or one-half of the maximum total output power of the transceiver, whichever is less.  Both carriers shall be on assignable carrier frequencies within the band TMN
f to TMX

As an alternative to 2.2.3.1.2.1.4.1, the transceiver shall satisfy the requirements of Table 2-5 and Table 2-6 when transmitting two modulated carriers each of which is at the maximum single-carrier power permitted by 2.2.3.1.2.1.2 or one-half the maximum output power of the transceiver, whichever is less. Both carriers shall be on assignable carrier frequencies within the band fTMN to fTMX. The emission that does not fall within the band 0.99675 fTMN to 1.00325 fTMX or the band 0.99675 fRMN to 1.00325 f*RMX* shall not exceed the values of Table 2-5. For transition regions, the terms "increasing" and 
"decreasing" are defined by a linear slope in decibels versus a linear frequency scale connecting the two endpoints of the designated range. 

The emission that falls within the band 0.99675 fTMN to 1.00325 fTMX or the band 0.99675 
fRMN to 1.00325 f*RMX*  shall not exceed the values of Table 2-6. For measured IM products generated by modulated signals, having bandwidth less than 100kHz, and falling within the frequency range 1565 MHz to 1605 MHz, the requirements of Table 2-5 shall be modified by Figure 2-2 or 2-3 as appropriate."

Transmitter Function Harmonics, Discrete Spurious and Noise Density When tested with a single modulated signal at the maximum permissible single carrier level specified by Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, the average power output of the composite harmonic, discrete spurious and noise density, including phase noise, at the transceiver output shall not exceed the values in Table 2-5, except for frequencies falling within the band band 0.99675

.  For transition regions, the terms "increasing" and "decreasing" are defined by a linear slope in decibels versus a linear frequency scale connecting the two endpoints of the designated range. For equipment capable of simultaneously transmitting on multiple different carrier frequencies, the requirements for composite harmonics, spurious and noise shall be reduced by the quantity 10log10(N) + 3 dB, when N is defined in Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.1 as the maximum number of independent carriers supported by the AES.  This more stringent requirement does not apply if the multi-carrier AES is capable of allocating its entire power capability to a single carrier frequency. 

Note 1: 
For example, in a system capable of 4 independent carriers, each with a maximum power of PD , the HSN in the band 1618-1650 MHz must meet a requirement of: 

 
$$-55-(10\log_{10}(4)+3)=-64~\mathrm{dBW/100~kHz}\,.$$
 
If the maximum power in each of the four equal-level carriers is limited to 
/4
D
P
, the HSN must meet –55 dBW/100 kHz.

, the average power output of the composite harmonic, discrete spurious and noise density, including phase noise, at the transceiver output shall not exceed the values of Table 2-6. 

In addition to the requirements of Table 2-5 and Table 2-6, individual discrete spurious signals falling in the bands 1164-1233 MHz, 1260-1300 MHz, and 1559-1585 MHz and having spectral bandwidth less than 100 kHz shall not exceed the average power levels of the applicable table adjusted for spurious bandwidth in accordance with Figure 2-2. 

Note 2:  Figure 2-2 is taken from the Table B.3.7-3 of the GNSS SARPs, adjusted for a nominal interference bandwidth of 100 kHz. 

In addition to the requirements of Table 2-5 and Table 2-6, individual discrete spurious signals falling in the band 1585-1605 MHz and having spectral bandwidth less than 100 
kHz shall not exceed the average power level of the applicable table adjusted for the spurious bandwidth in accordance with Figure 2-3.

## Notes:

1.
Figure 2-3 is taken from the Table B.3.7-3 of the GNSS SARPs, adjusted for a
nominal interference bandwidth of 100 kHz.
2.
In the preceding requirements, the adjustment to the requirements Figure 2-2  or
Figure 2-3  is  made by adding the value obtained from the appropriate figure for the
measured interference bandwidth to the value obtained from Table 2-5 or Table 2-6.
For example, if a discrete spurious signal with bandwidth 400 Hz is measured at a center frequency of 1587 MHz, the appropriate specification level is:
3.
Requirement = Value from HSN Table 2-5 + value from Figure 2-3 at appropriate
bandwidth 

= -121 dBW + value at Point "ο" from Figure 2-3 
= -121 dBW + (-0.7) dB = -121.7 dBW 

## 2.2.3.1.2.1.6 Protection Of Radio Astronomy 2.2.3.1.2.1.6.1 Aes Transmitting On Frequencies Outside Of The 1610-1626.5 Mhz Band

 An AES that transmits on any assignable frequency except those in the 1610-1626.5 MHz band shall meet the requirements of Table 2-5. 
1. When operating with the maximum combination of channels permitted by the 
equipment design. 
 
2. When averaged over 2000 seconds of normal operation, including any frequency 
switching and power control due to normal satellite motion during that interval, and 
typical call duration and voice or data activity statistics. When operating under the same conditions, the average power spectral density due to the composite of HSN and intermodulation emissions in the band 1660-1670 MHz shall meet the requirements of Table 2-5. 

Note:  The required composite emissions levels stated values in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz 
      and 1660-1670 MHz bands are sufficient to protect Radio Astronomy to the levels 
      of ITU-R RA.769-1 during normal air route operations without additional lateral 
      protection zones.  If the system design precludes operations within a specific 
      distance of active RA sites, the allowable levels may increase by 
                                                                           10
                                                                      20log (
                                                                                  /3)
                                                                               RA
                                                                              ρ
                                                                                      
      decibels, where 
                        RA
                       ρ
                           is the radius of the RA protection zone in kilometers.  For 
      example, equipment designated for operation with a 30 km protection zone will 
      have the values increased by 20log10(30/3) = 20 dB.  Therefore, the requirements 
      on such a system will be –80 dBW/10 kHz in the 1610.6-1613.8 MHz band and –
      68 dBW/MHz decreasing to –78 dBW/MHz in the 1660-1670 MHz band. 

The manufacturer shall declare the radius of any exclusion zone necessary to protect 
Radio Astronomy Services in the technique-specific appendix.

AES equipment that transmits on assignable frequencies within the 1610-1626.5 MHz band shall comply with the requirements of FCC Rule 47CFR25.213(a).  Any emissions levels negotiated under the provisions of this rule shall be declared in the system-specific appendix and shall be interpreted as a minimum requirement under this MOPS.  
Emissions levels should be measured under the conditions identified in items 1 and 2 of Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.6.1. 

When operating under the same conditions identified in Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.6.1, the average power spectral density due to the composite of HSN and intermodulation emissions in the band 1660-1670 MHz shall meet the requirements of Table 2-5.

## 2.2.3.1.2.1.9 On-Channel Output Spectrum The Output Spectrum Of A Single Modulated Carrier Shall Satisfy The In-Band Requirements Of The Specific Satellite Subnetwork, As Given In The Appropriate Normative Portion Of The Techique-Specific Appendix. 2.2.3.1.2.1.10 Transmitter Operation In Moving Aircraft

 Any AES capable of AMS(R)S voice and/or AMS(R)S data communications shall comply with the satellite network interface requirement specified in the appropriate normative portion of the system-specific appendix of this document when installed in aircraft operating at ground speeds of up 800 knots (1480 km/hr). It is recommended that all AES equipment comply with the satellite network interface requirements of the appropriate normative portion of the system-specific appendix of this document when installed in aircraft operating at ground speeds of up to 1500 kts (2800 km/hr). 

 
Note: For the purposes of verifying these requirements and recommendations, it may be advantageous to design an interface to allow external adjustment of the frequency reference used internal to the AES. 

 
2.2.3.1.2.2 
Receiver Function For the purposes of this section, the reference point for all signal level measurements is the input port to the AES, Point C in Figure 1-2. The contractor shall declare the maximum allowable cable loss, LMAX .

When coupled with the antenna performance specified earlier, and when compensated for the effective sky temperature of typical operations and any increase in the effective noise temperature due to antenna effects, this sensitivity is consistent with the Figure of Merit G/T requirements of the MASPS and DO-
215A. 

 

## 2.2.3.1.2.2.1.2 Voice

 The vocoder shall satisfy its performance requirements when provided with an input signal of SV from an appropriately configured satellite system test set. 

 
Note: The receiver sensitivity specified here is a bench-test requirement.  When coupled with the antenna performance specified earlier, and when compensated for the effective sky temperature of typical operations and any increase in the effective noise temperature due to antenna effects, this sensitivity is consistent with the Figure of Merit G/T requirements of the MASPS and DO-215A.

2.2.3.1.2.2.4 
Rejection of Carrier Signals Generated by Other AMS(R)S Equipment In addition to the general CW interference requirements described in Section 
2.2.3.1.2.2.3, the receiver shall acquire and track a satellite downlink signal with a minimum signal level given by the minimum of SV and SD in the presence of a CW 
interfering signal of the following levels and carrier frequencies.  This requirement need not be met when the specified CW interfering signal is within +/-0.325% the declared operational band of the receiver.

 Note: These levels assume an antenna-port-to-antenna-port isolation of –40 dB between 
AMS(R)S equipment on the same aircraft, and includes the effects of DO-210D compliant avionics on the same aircraft. 
2.2.3.1.2.2.5 
Receiver Operation in Moving Aircraft Any AES capable of AMS(R)S safety voice and/or data communications shall comply with the satellite network interface requirement specified in the appropriate normative portion of the system-specific appendix when installed in aircraft operating at ground speeds of up to 800 knots (1480 km/hr). It is recommended that the AES comply with the satellite network interface requirements of the appropriate normative portion of the system-specific appendix when installed in aircraft operating at ground speeds of up to 1500 kts (2780 km/hr). 

 
2.2.3.1.2.2.6

S
 across the designated receive band. The receiver shall properly acquire and track the required signals and shall output data at the specified rate when subjected to CW interference of level UN

f
, of the NGSS under consideration.  Wideband interference shall be defined as interference with a bandwidth greater than M
f
. 

 

## 2.2.3.1.3 Required Aircraft Interfaces 2.2.3.1.3.1 External Position Although Not Required As Part Of This Minimum Standard, It Is Recommended That The Aes Utilize External Geolocation Methods, Such As Gps, Glonass, Fms Or Loran C To Provide An Accurate Position Reference, And Thereby Minimize The Subnetwork-Specific Geolocation Requirements. 2.2.3.1.3.2 External Time Reference Although Not Required As Part Of This Minimum Standard, It Is Recommended That The Aes Be Capable Of Accepting An External Time Reference, Such As Gps, To Provide An Accurate, Consistent Source Of Time Information. 2.2.3.2 User Link Modulation And Signal In Space

 The AES shall generate and accept a user link signal-in-space with the modulation and signal format characteristics set forth in the applicable normative appendix. 

Note: The modulation and signal in space characteristics of NGSS are completely determined by the underlying telecommunications infrastructure.  Since that infrastructure is assumed to provide at least regional and preferrably near-worldwide, coverage, and since there are potentially several different systems which may provide AMSS, there are no AMSS- or AMS(R)S-specific signal-in-space or modulation requirements.  Detailed requirements for operation within the satellite subnetwork are identified in system-specific appendices*.  These* appendices, in turn, reference commercial documentation maintained by the various satellite and service providers.  The commercial documents may be obtained from the appropriate source for use in support of this document, subject to certain distribution restrictions.  Except as necessary to specifically identify safety-related performance, system-specific details are not reproduced within this MOPS or its appendices s. 

## 2.2.3.3 Priority, Precedence And Preemption

The requirements of this section shall apply to all communications channels available for assignment to users, specifically excluding channels used for internal NGSS signaling and system management functions.  
All AES equipment used for AMS(R)S services shall provide at least three levels of priority for safety communications, all of which are higher than the priority provided for any non-safety communications, as illustrated in Table 2-7. 

When the AES supports both voice and data communications, voice communications shall have priority over data within any given application or priority level.   

| Application (Voice and/or Data)     | Priority Identifier                            |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Distress, Urgency                   | 4 (high)                                       |
| Direction Finding, Flight Safety    | 3                                              |
| Other Safety & Regularity of Flight | 2                                              |
| 1 (low)                             | All other non-safety communications, including |
| public correspondence               |                                                |

1.
The numeric Priority Identifier scheme indicated in Table 2-7 is a logical scheme
only and is intended for the purpose of unambiguously identifying test conditions within this document.  There is no requirement that the actual interface(s) to pilots, to the satellites, or to the terrestrial users use this method for identifying
priorities.  Specific NGSS implementations may incorporate more than the minimum four priority levels specified above, and may utilize various specific priority/precedence numbering schemes for the levels.
2.
Schemes identified in other RTCA and ICAO standards include 1 (highest)
through 4 (lowest) and 15 (highest) through 0 (lowest), etc.  In particular, the
priority labeling convention listed in Table 2-7 is different from that used to
identify circuit mode priorities in Chapter 4 SARPs and DO-210D.  The
convention of using a larger numeric value to indicate a higher priority is consistent with that used for ATN, Chapter 4 SARPs, and DO-210D packet mode
data communications.
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
2.2.3.3.1 
Packet Data The AES shall provide for prioritization of data packets input at the AES data port(s). The AES shall support the system-level prioritization techniques described in the appropriate normative portion of the system-specific appendix. This document recognizes that messages may be subject to segmentation in accordance with technique specific internal protocols.  Transmission preemption, if necessary, shall be effected by changing the order of data transmission such that the data units of the internal protocols comprising the higher-priority message are transmitted before corresponding lower-priority data units.  Any reordering necessary to comply with this requirement shall take effect immediately upon completion of currently active data unit transmission.  Preemption of lower-priority messages, if necessary, shall be effected by any means necessary to preserve the higher-priority message(s). This document recognizes that a given network may choose to provide packet-mode data services over circuit-mode connections.  If packet-mode data services are implemented over circuit mode connections, the requirements of Section 2.2.3.3.2 shall apply to the circuit mode connections themselves.  Within such a circuit mode connection, packet priority, precedence and preemption shall be in accordance with Table 2-7. If an AES does not support Priority Level 1 (low) non-safety communications, a request for Priority Level 1 (low) packet service shall be ignored. 

2.2.3.3.2 
Circuit Mode Communications For circuit mode communications, the AES shall establish the priority structure shown in Table 2-7.  When providing AMS(R)S services, the AES shall always have sufficient communications resources to detect a request to establish an incoming call, except in the rare case when all AES resources are consumed by distress/urgency communications. Signaling and system management actions for circuit-mode calls in either the airoriginated or ground-originated direction shall be queued and processed within the AES in an order corresponding to each call's Circuit-mode Priority per Table 2-7, with the higher Circuit-mode Priority numbers having the higher precedence.  The lowest priority in-progress shall be interrupted immediately if necessary to make AES resources (e.g., transmitter power, channel unit, vocoder) available for a higher-priority call of either air or ground origination.  If a new ground-originated call has the same or lower priority as the lowest-priority call in progress, and if sufficient AES resources are not available to support the new circuit, then the AES shall indicate "busy" to the originating party. If an AES does not support Priority Level 1 (low) non-safety communications, a request for Priority Level 1 service shall be refused. When circuit-mode preemption is necessary, the AES channel resources shall be available within 4 seconds of the user request. 

## 2.2.3.4 Satellite Subnetwork Data Protocol (Satellite Layer 2)

 The AES shall support the satellite subnetwork data protocols specified for the individual satellite network, as detailed in the appropriate normative appendix.  Implementation of the Satellite Layer 2 Protocols shall include any actions and protocols necessary to acquire the satellite, maintain a connection over an extended period of time, transfer digital data and digitized voice information, and participate in the overall system management functions of the satellite subnetwork. 

The AES shall register itself with the satellite system so that it is enabled to receive or transmit data or voice, as appropriate, on the subnetwork.  This registration may occur either automatically or by manual command. 

Notes: 

1.
Satellite Layer 2 is a generic term for the internal protocol(s) used by the NGSS.  For
information on the context see the MASPS or RTCA DO-215A, Change 1.  This
document uses the term Satellite Layer 2 to avoid confusion with the Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocols discussed in Section 2.2.3.6.3.
2.
This registration action is referred to as "system log on", and an AES which has
completed this action is referred to as being in a "logged-on" state.

## 2.2.3.5 Voice Protocol

Vocoded voice information shall be transmitted and processed in accordance with the system-specific protocols identified in the appropriate normative portion of the systemspecific appendix.  Any voice services supported by the avionics shall be certified by the satellite network operator as compliant with the voice protocol specified in the techniquespecific appendix or underlying technique-specific documents. 

Note:  As evidenced by this requirement, this MOPS assumes digital transmission of voice, as explained in Section 1.5.6. 

## 2.2.3.5.1 Vocoder Interoperability With Satellite Subnetwork

The vocoder algorithm implemented in the AES shall exhibit 100% interoperability with the standard vocoder algorithm used by the underlying satellite telecommunications architecture.  In the event the vocoder algorithm is not identical to the algorithm used in the satellite subnetwork, the manufacturer shall be responsible for demonstrating the required 100% interoperability to the satisfaction of the satellite network operator, and shall be certified as achieving this compliance by the satellite network operator. 

## 2.2.3.5.2 Vocoder Performance In An Aeronautical Environment

Voice services intended for safety applications shall provide overall intelligibility performance that is statistically equivalent to or better than the 9.6 kbps vocoder algorithms defined in the ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices found in Annex 10, Volume III, Part I, Chapter 4, when operating with a system-specific test signal level of SV .  This requirement shall be satisfied when tested in audio noise environments representative of aeronautical cockpit applications in a variety of airframes, including wide-body air-transport cockpit background noise, helicopter cockpit background noise, prop-jet cockpit background noise, ATC Control Center background noise.  It is highly desirable that performance also be verified in the turbo-prop cockpit acoustic environment.

## 2.2.3.6 User Data Interfaces

 Packet-mode data services shall provide an Aeronautical Telecommunications Network- 
(ATN-) compliant protocol, or the Data-2 protocol, or both, as defined in the following sections. ATN-compliant protocols implement a subnetwork interface in which the AES contains the physical layer, link-layer and network layer functionality, where the layers are defined according to the Open System Interconnect terminology. One particular implementation that is known to be ATN-compliant is an ISO-8208 
compliant interface.  If the AES implements an ISO-8208 compliant interface, that interface shall comply with the requirements of Appendix B of this document. Implementation of this interface will assure maximum compatibility with AMSS avionics designed and qualified in accordance with DO-210D. Data-2 provides a link-level service, which has been used to support ACARS in other airto-ground subnetworks.  In Data-2 implementations, a minimum AES provides only the physical and link layer functionality.  Management of priority and preemption are implemented in higher level entities.  If these higher level entities support the necessary priority and ISO 8473 convergence functions, Data 2 may also be useful for ATN communications. 

Notes: 1. It is highly desirable that the minimum data services include support for both ATN 
and Data-2 protocols as defined in DO-210D. 

 2. It is not the intent of this minimum standard to preclude the inclusion of additional 
satellite subnetwork access protocols, if desired by the avionics manufacturer 

## 

2.2.3.6.1 
ATN-Compliant Protocol 
 
The Satellite Subnetwork Layer (SSNL) in the AES shall offer connection-oriented packet data service to the Higher Layer Entities (HLEs) by facilitating satellite subnetwork switched virtual circuits (SVCs) with its peer entity in the subnetwork GES function.  It also shall offer methods to convert addressing from the HLE to the SSNL.   
Figure 2-4 illustrates the ISO-style protocol stacks associated with ATN-compliant operations. 

 
Notes: 1. The terminology used in the high-level description of and requirements for an ATN-
compliant protocol is based on ISO-8208.  Use of this terminology should not be interpreted to require an ISO-8208 compliant interface as a minimum standard. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

 2. Figure 2-4 is intended to be representative of a typical implementation, not 
normative.  In particular, certain applications within the AES may function as a "Higher Level Entity" in their use of the communications resource.  The existence of such internal applications is not shown in Figure 2-4, but this omission should not be 
construed as a prohibition against such internal applications.  This document neither encourages nor prohibits such implementations. 

The SSNL in the AES shall support the following three main functions: 

a.
The Satellite Subnetwork Dependent (SSND) sublayer
b.
The Satellite Subnetwork Access (SSNAc) sublayer
c.
The Satellite Subnetwork InterWorking Function (IWF)
The SSND sublayer shall perform the SSND protocol between the AES and a GES as defined in the appropriate normative portion of the system-specific appendix of this document by exchanging SubNetwork Protocol Data Units (SNPDUs).  The SubNetwork Protocol and definition of the SNPDUs are completely determined by the underlying communications infrastructure, and are defined in either the appropriate normative appendix or the documents referenced by such an appendix. 

The SSNAc sublayer in the AES shall perform the ATN-compliant protocol between the AES and the connected airborne HLE (DTE).  The IWF shall provide the protocol conversion functions and the flow control operation required between the SSND and SSNAc protocols. 

## Notes:

1.
The role of the ATN is to define an environment within which reliable end-to-end
data transfer may take place, spanning the envisioned airborne, air/ground, and
ground-based data subnetworks, including the satellite subnetwork, while providing interoperability among those networks.  The critical emphasis is on end-system data transfer interoperability.  In the ATN environment, the Satellite Subnetwork Layer must support the transparent transfer of Network Protocol Data Units between adjacent interworking entities (or HLEs as seen by the satellite subnetwork).  This also implies the transparent transfer of global addresses (or Network Service Access Points (NSAPs) and of quality of service information (including network priority) as well as of user data. 

 2. In Data-3 communications, HLEs communicate with the SSND sublayer by means of 
a DTE/Data Circuit-terminating (or Communication) Equipment (DCE) interface, as indicated in Figure 2-4.  The DTE contains the DTE portion of SSNAc functions.  
One or more DTE/DCE interfaces are provided as logical entities within the AES. Each DTE/DCE interface is configured to connect to not more than one DTE.  The AES contains and implements the DCE side of the interface.The satellite subnetwork 
acts as a relay between the HLE and its peer(s) on the ground.  The need to send user 
information to, or receive user information from, the ground is not determined in any 
way by the AES but by the HLEs. 3. The HLE (in addition to the incorporation of the SSNAc function) will also support 
additional functions.  As a minimum, the DTE incorporates an internetwork function and may also incorporate transport, session, presentation and application functions. In some AES implementations, certain HLEs may be contained within the AES software itself, but this configuration is not illustrated in Figure 2-4. 

## 2.2.3.6.1.1 Join And Leave Requirements An Aes  That Provides Atn-Compliant  Packet-Mode Data Service Shall Provide Join And Leave Event Information To The Aircraft Routing Function To Indicate That The Air/Ground Data Link Is Either Available Or Not Available, Respectively.  The Join/Leave Information Shall Include Sufficient Information For The Routing Function To Determine The Address(Es) Of The Attached Terrestrial Dte(S). 2.2.3.6.1.2 Atn-Compliant Mapping For Priority, Precedence And Preemption The Target And Selected Values Of The Priority Of Data On An Atn-Compliant Interface Shall Be Mapped To The Equivalent Values At The Opposite End Of The Satellite Subnetwork.

2.2.3.6.2 
Data-2 Data-2 is intended as a legacy interface. An AES offering packet-mode Data-2 service shall include a Link Service Interface that provides direct access to the highest level of the Satellite Layer 2 Protocol, so that bits may be sent in a first-in-first-out manner over the subnetwork.  For AES implementations that provide both ATN-compliant and Data-2 interfaces, it is permissible for this Link Service Interface to utilize portions of the SSNDP, if desired. 

Note: One potential implementation is shown in Figure 2-4.  The Data-2 depiction in Figure 2-4 is intended to be informative only. 

 
In Data 2 operations, Link Service Data Units (LSDUs) are injected or collected at the Link Service Interface in the AES.  In order to ensure the forward compatibility of the Data-2 architecture with an ATN-compliant subnetwork architecture, the AES shall add a two-octet header to the external user's message to form an LSDU before transmission, as shown in Figure 2-5.  The user's message may consist of binary data and may contain up to LMSG octets.  The two-octet dedicated header shall be set to the hexadecimal value FFFF.  Unless otherwise established by the Link Service Interface user, a packet mode priority equivalent to Flight Regularity Communications shall be used for transmission of Data-2 LSDUs. 

While the AES is in a logged on state, all LSDUs passed to the Link Service Interface shall be transmitted to the GES.  If the AES is not in the logged on state, any LSDU passed to the AES shall be discarded.  Conversely, while the AES is logged on, any messages received from the GES shall be forwarded to the Link Service Interface regardless of the availability of the destination avionics equipment. 

Notes: 

1.
On the ground, a separate Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) may be established for
each AES between the GES and a predefined SubNetwork Point of Attachment (SNPA) DTE using X.25/X.75 protocol.  The terrestrial SVC is established by the
GES when an AES is logged onto the GES and is cleared when the AES is logged off
of the GES.

2.
When packet-mode operations are conducted using a Data-2 implementation,
priority, precedence and preemption are managed by a higher-layer entity.

## 2.2.3.6.3 Satellite Subnetwork Requirements 2.2.3.6.3.1 Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocol Requirements

The combination of the Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocol and the Satellite Layer 
2 protocol is expected to provide a reliable link service to assist the overall AMSS air-toground subnetwork in delivering high integrity data.  The Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocol (SSNDP) shall provide the additional error control mechansims, if any, necessary to assure a residual packet error rate, including misdirected packets, of 1 x 
10-6 or less for a standard 128-octet message.  
The SSNDP shall operate in accordance with the requirements referenced in the appropriate appendix. The SSNDP may include a separate Air-Ground Protocol sublayer (AGP) between peer entities in the AES and GES.  When the Air-Ground Protocol sublayer is included, it shall be defined in the technique-specific appendix, and the AES shall comply with the defined protocol. 

## 2.2.3.6.3.2 Atn-Compliant Requirements If An Atn-Compliant Snacp Is Provided, The Ssndp Shall Provide Atn-Compliant Subnetwork Services To The Hle.  Atn Compliance Is Achieved By Satisfying The Following Requirements: 1. The Ssndp Shall Be Byte And Code Independent

 
2. The SSNDP shall maintain the sequence and order of data (i.e. data submitted to the 
SSNDP for transmission shall arrive at the destination peer in the same order it was transmitted) 
 
3. The SSNDP shall inform its interworking function whenever its connectivity with the 
satellite network changes 

## 

2.2.3.6.3.3 
Data 2 Requirements To the extent that the SSNDP is utilized for Data 2 transmissions, the following requirements shall be met: 1. The SSNDP shall be code and byte independent 2. The SSNDP shall maintain the sequence and order of data 3. The SSNDP shall inform the associated DTE when its connectivity with the satellite 
network changes 
 
2.2.3.6.4 
External Physical and Data Link Layer Requirements At the physical and data link layer of the HLE/AES connection: 1. the interface shall be "bit-oriented" (i.e., there shall be no restrictions on the 
sequence, order or pattern of the bits transferred within a packet between the HLE and the AES); 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

 2. the interface shall support the transfer of variable length network layer packets; and 3. the data link layer shall provide an undetected bit error rate consistent with the 
satellite subsystem performance requirements, reference RTCA DO-215A, Section 
3.2.1.1.2. 

## 2.2.3.6.5 Avionics Subnetwork Interface Requirements  For Iso-8208 Service

All AES equipment that supports an ISO-8208-compliant (Data-3) packet-mode service shall have the Packet Layer Protocol (PLP) interface specified in detail in the ISO-8208 
standard, as modified by Appendix B of this document. 

The correspondence between ISO-8208 primitives Appendix B and SSNDP protocol data units, if any, shall be as defined in the relevant technique-specific appendix.  There is no required mapping of ISO-8208 primitives to technique dependent Satellite Subnetwork Protocol Data Units.  The use of the underlying satellite communications system is unspecified, providing that the DCE/DTE interface actions act and respond appropriately as defined in ISO-8208 as modified by Appendix B. 

The operation of the AES as specified in this standard assumes that the HLE operates in accordance with Section 1.5.5. 

## 2.2.3.6.6 Alternative Atn-Compliant Subnetwork Access Protocols

Any manufacturer wishing to implement an ATN-compliant SNAcP that differs from the ISO-8208 implementaiton specified in Appendix B to this MOPS shall provide the detailed protocol implementation and associated verification procedures in the techniquespecific appendix.  The level of detail included in the SNAcP definition shall be equivalent to or better than the detail provided in Appendix B. 

## 2.2.3.7 Circuit Mode Service Requirements

Circuit-mode voice and/or data services, if provided, shall comply with the requirements of this section.  The AES may provide voice communications capability to the cockpit and/or the passenger cabin areas. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Note 1: 
At the time this document was published, RTCA had not yet published a MASPS dealing with safety-voice capabilities and operations.  Until such a 
document is available, AES manufacturers are encouraged to follow the recommedations of DO-231 when  implementing safety voice capabilities. 
Circuit-mode data service, which provides a circuit-switched data channel to support a variety of communication applications that require the allocation of dedicated channel capacity for the duration of a call (such as interactive or bulk data, encrypted voice/data and facsimile), may optionally be provided in AESs capable of voice communications. 

The minimum requirements for circuit-mode voice service on the satellite subnetwork, if such service is provided by an AES, shall be the minima specified for that subnetwork in the appropriate normative appendix. 

Circuit-mode voice and data service shall comply with the priority, precedence and preemption requirements established in Section 2.2.4.2 of this document. 

Note 2: 
Samples of cockpit voice interworking can be found in ARINC-741 Part 2. 
These interworking connections are installation specific, and are not addressed in this minimum standard. 

## 2.2.3.8 Recovery From Primary Power Interruption

 The NGSS equipment shall conform to the following requirements after encountering primary power interruptions from any cause. 1. Power interruptions of less than 5 milliseconds duration shall be indistinguishable from outages in the RF transmission path of equal duration. 

 2. Power interruptions from five to 200 milliseconds duration shall require no more than 
five seconds recovery time, beginning from when primary power has been restored. Recovery is defined as automatically returning to the previous operating state 
(without user intervention) such that data channels resume in the same configuration they were in before the power interruption occurred.  This assumes a channel signal with at least the minimum quality characteristics specified in Section 2.2.3.1.2.2. 
 
Note: In-transit data service packets which have been acknowledged on either the DTE 
or DCE interface, but not yet transferred to the opposite interface, may be lost. Higher-layer entities that employ end-to-end acknowledgment protocols may 
choose to retransmit such lost data.  Synchronization and RF output power may 
be lost during the power interruption and recovery time.  There shall be no more than a momentary effect on cockpit displays. 

## 2.2.3.9 Failure/Status Indication

 The NGSS equipment shall provide, independent of any operator action, an indication of a failure of NGSS equipment resulting in loss of data or voice communications, as appropriate. 

## 2.3 Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions 2.3.1 General Requirements

 The environmental tests and their associated performance requirements described in this Section are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under environmental conditions representative of those which may be encountered in actual operations. Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in RTCA Document DO-160D, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment.  General information regarding the use of the procedures in RTCA DO-160D 
is contained in Sections 1.0 through 3.0 of that document.  Also, a method of identifying which environmental tests were conducted and other amplifying information on the conduct of the tests is contained in Appendix A of RTCA DO-160D. Some of the minimum performance requirements in Section 2.2 of this MOPS are not required to be qualified to all of the conditions contained in RTCA DO-160D.  Judgment 
and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Section 2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these conditions. There it is sufficient to verify compliance at ambient conditions for many requirements, and then continued compliance is inferred by successfully meeting the requirements. 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Table 2-8 is a compliance matrix that cross-references the RTCA DO-160D 
environmental test requirements with the performance requirements listed in Section 2.2.3 of this document.  Only those tests specifically identified by "X" or by a numerically referenced footnote need be repeated in the various environments. Furthermore, unless otherwise noted successful verification of compliance to a requirement section implies compliance to all lesser sections as well. 

In addition to the exceptions above, certain environmental tests contained in this section are not required for minimum performance equipment unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for additional environmental conditions.  If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional conditions, then these tests shall be performed. 

## 2.3.2 Equipment Configurations

This document contains provisions to subject different AES configurations to environmental qualification.  Specific AES performance tests have been included for use in conjunction with the environmental procedures of RTCA DO-160D.  These tests are a subset of the full AES performance tests contained in Section 2.4.  Normally, a minimum performance standard does not provide specific equipment performance tests to be used in conjunction with the environmental procedures of RTCA DO-160D.  However, the large number of performance tests in Section 2.4 indicates that a test procedure that includes all of the performance tests combined with the appropriate environmental procedures would be impractical. 

## 2.3.3 Configuration Control

Nominal environment testing, followed by extreme environment testing, shall be conducted on the AES with the Operational Flight Program (OFP) installed according to the correct software version number as specified in the AES configuration documentation. 

## 2.3.4 Specific Environmental Test Conditions

In addition to the specific functional tests to be repeated in various operational environments, the equipment as a whole shall be subjected to the test conditions as specified in RTCA DO-160D, in the sections identified in Table 2-8.  By performing (and passing) those tests, the corresponding requirements of this standard shall be met. 

## 2.3.5 Performance Vs. Test Requirements Matrix

Detailed test procedures for performance requirements contained in Section 2.2 are found in Section 2.4.  The subsection numbering in Section 2.4, at the third and lower levels, corresponds identically to that in Section 2.2.  Consequently, this document does not provide a detailed cross-reference matrix.

1.
Due to the difficulties in performing radiating measurements while changing the environmental conditions of the antenna, acceptable alternative test procedures may
be implemented.  Portions of the antenna subsystem may be measured over the operating environmental conditions range.  The measurement data thus obtained may be used in an analysis to show that the specified antenna performance can be achieved under all operating environmental conditions.  This analysis shall include the effects of materials and construction of the individual radiating elements and account for the effects of beam pointing errors versus environmental conditions on other specification requirements within the declared coverage volume.
2.
Performance parameters of the antenna subsystem will not be measured during these
environmental tests.  These environmental tests are for survivability and apply only to equipment which is mounted on the outside of the aircraft.
3.
These tests are not listed for the receiver and transmitter subsystems and need not be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for the particular environmental condition.
4.
The application of the Crash Safety Shock test may result in damage to the equipment
under test.  Therefore, this test may be conducted after the other tests have been completed.  In this case, Section 2.1.7, "Effects of Test" does not apply.
5.
This test shall be conducted with the spray directed perpendicular to the equipment.
6.
Applicable requirements: a) At the end of the 24-hour exposure period, the equipment shall function.
b) Following the 2-hour operation period at ambient temperature after the
160-hour exposure period at elevated temperature, the performance requirements shall be met.
7.
The appropriate test will depend upon whether the equipment is AC or DC  powered.
8.
The application of the Low Voltage Conditions (DC) (Category B equipment) test
may result in damage to the equipment under test.  Therefore, this test may be
conducted after the other tests have been completed.  Section 2.1.7, "Effects of Test," does not apply.
9.
Select Category A (high degree of protection against voltage spikes required) or
Category B (lower standard of protection acceptable) as applicable for the equipment under test.

10. Excluding frequency to which receiver is tuned and the response within its resonant
pass band.
11. Equipment is not required to meet performance specifications during the application
of HIRF, (Category U, 20 v/m).  The equipment must meet all requirements following the application.
12. Meet requirements of DO-160C except as noted by Section 2.2.9.
13. Phase Noise (Section 2.2.4.2.12) performed under normal conditions only.
14. Equipment is not required to meet performance specifications during the period of
application of the Lightning Induced Transient test, but must meet all requirements following the test.
15. Not required for AMSS.
16. Applicable to equipment requiring cooling.  Modify test length to three hours.
Verify no smoke or fire; compliance to performance specifications not required.
17. During operational shock testing, measure maximum output stability only.
18. Altitude tests, 4.6.1, not applicable; not applicable to receiver tests.
19. Gaussian only; not multipath.
20. Steady state conditions only (Paragraphs 16.5.1.1 and 16.5.3.1, or 16.5.2.1 and
16.5.4.1, as applicable).

Notes 19 and 20 apply.

## 2.4 Equipment Performance Verification Procedures

The following procedures provide guidelines for tests to ensure compliance with the MOPS performance requirements.  Except for Section 3.4.5, these do not require flight testing.  Regarding secondary references from this section, any reference to "flight tests" in lower level documents should be ignored. 

Some of the following tests may require additional test equipment not shown in the test setup figures.  Such equipment would be associated with the interface between the satellite system emulator and the AES or radio channel unit. 

## 2.4.1 Definitions Of Terms And Conditions Of Test

The following are definitions of terms and the conditions under which the tests described in this Section should be conducted: 

a.
Power Input Voltage - Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be conducted with
the power input voltage adjusted to design voltage +2%.  The input voltage shall be
measured at the input terminals of the equipment under test.
b.
Power Input Frequency
(1) In the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC source of 
essentially constant frequency (e.g., 400 Hz), the input frequency shall be 
adjusted to design frequency +2%. 
(2) In the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC source of 
variable frequency (e.g., 300 to 1,000 Hz), unless otherwise specified, tests shall be conducted with the input frequency adjusted to within 5% of a selected frequency and within the range for which the equipment is designed. 
c.
Adjustment of Equipment - The circuits of the equipment under test shall be
properly aligned and otherwise adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practices prior to application of the specified tests.
d.
Test Equipment - All equipment used in the performance of the tests should be
identified by make, model and serial number where appropriate, and its latest calibration date.  When appropriate, all test equipment calibration standards should be traceable to national and/or international standards.
e.
Test Instrument Precautions - Due precautions shall be taken during the tests to
prevent the introduction of errors resulting from the connection of voltmeters, oscilloscopes and other test instruments across the input and output impedances of the equipment under test.
f.
Ambient Conditions - Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be made within the
following ambient conditions:
(1) Temperature:  +15 to +35 degrees C (+59 to +95 degrees F) 
(2) Relative Humidity: Not greater than 85% 
(3) Ambient Pressure: 84 to 107 kPa (equivalent to +5,000 to -1,500 ft)  (+1,525 
to -460 m) 
When tests are conducted at ambient conditions which differ from the above values, allowances shall be made and the differences recorded. 

g.
Connected Loads - Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed with the
equipment connected to loads having the impedance values for which it is designed.
h.
EMI Testing - Only the AES in  (not the test equipment) need be subjected to the
electromagnetic environment as specified in Table 2-8.  For the antenna subsystem, a
matched load should be connected, and the antenna subsystem performance verified to requirements after application of HIRF.
Note: For specific airframes, the aircraft manufacturer may require the interconnecting wiring to be included in the specified electromagnetic environment. 

i.
Warm-up and Stabilization Requirements - Unless otherwise specified, all tests
shall be conducted after a minimum equipment warm-up period of not less than five minutes.  In addition, the frequency reference source shall have completed its warm-up cycle, if any, and any power-on self test(s) shall have been completed prior
to testing.
j.
Special Cooling Requirements - The manufacturer shall specify any special cooling
requirements for any of the specified tests.

## 2.4.1.1 Aes Application Test Conditions

2.4.1.1.1 
                Antenna Subsystem Test Conditions 
                 
                Note: The Low Earth Orbit characteristics of the satellite system make passive, near-
                        omni-directional antennas highly desirable.  The requirements contained below 
                        assume a non-steered antenna system.  Installations desiring to use actively 
                        switched or steered antenna systems are referred to RTCA Document DO-210D, 
                        Section 2.4.3, for appropriate test procedures. 

 
2.4.1.1.1.1 
Antenna Under Test The antenna under test shall not include the LNA, HPA, or front end filter(s) associated with the RF Front End subsystem.  For steered antennas, or active antennas requiring any other type of control, a suitable control unit shall be included in the test.  If a radome forms part of the antenna, this shall also be installed during the measurements.  The antenna test installation shall also include any adapter plates, where used, or other hardware used to interface the antenna to the fuselage in a flight installation. In the case of multiple antenna installations which are normally located at different areas of the aircraft (e.g., two side-mounted antennas), one antenna may be tested at a time. 

 

## 2.4.1.1.2 Transceiver Subsystem Test Conditions Unless Otherwise Noted, The Transciever Subsystem Detailed Verification Procedures Are Assumed To Be Performed At Normal Laboratory Ambient Temperature And Humidity. 2.4.1.1.3 Required Aircraft Interfaces Test Conditions The Required Aircraft Interfaces Shall Be Tested With The Aes Operating Under The Standard Conditions Noted In Section 2.4.1. 2.4.1.2 Satellite Subnetwork Test Conditions

## 2.4.2.1.2 Transciever Subsystem Required Test Equipment 2.4.2.1.2.1 Standard Test Equipment The Test Procedures Assume Access To A Variety Of Standardized Test Equipment, Including Directional Couplers, High Power Loads, Spectrum Analyzers And Oscilloscopes.  Wherever Possible, Specific Model Numbers Are Identified.  It Is Permissible To Substitute Alternate Items Of Standard Test Equipment Provided That The Equivalent Performance Is Maintained.

2.4.2.1.2.2 
Special Test Equipment The test procedures assume that the following special test equipment may be required. 

Satellite System Emulator - For the tests described herein, a Satellite System Emulator is highly desirable.  Transceiver functions and characteristics can be verified only when coupled through an L-Band RF link with its Space Vehicle counterpart, each controlling or reacting to various states (or changes of state) of the other.  It is very desirable to be capable of strictly controlling this interation by use of test equipment rather than the satellite constellation itself. The Satellite System Emulator is not necessarily a single definable piece of test instrumentation, but it will likely comprise an assemblage of test equipment appropriate for a given test procedure capable of providing the functions necessary for that test.  For example, in certain RF tests, the Emulator would establish a "link" with the transceiver, providing the properly-modulated RF signals with appropriate accuracy and precision. 

As another example, the Emulator is necessary to verify correct operation of the signaling and communications protocols embodied in the transceiver. 

Because there are many ways in which the Emulator can be realized, a detailed description is not necessary, or possible, herein.  However, in each procedure involving the Emulator, the particular characteristics essential for that procedure are described. 

Despite the fact that an emulator is an acceptable means by which performance can be verified, the complexity of modern LEO and MEO satellite constellations used for voice and data communications dictate that a Satellite System Emulator will be an extremely complex and, as a result, extremely costly, device.  This standard, therefore, permits testing the critical functionality of the AES using the satellite constellation directly, provided that the following conditions are satisfied: 

1.
Permission of the Satellite System Operator must be obtained in advance of any
such testing.
2.
Whenever possible, testing of high priority communications shall be performed
during periods of low network demand as determined by the Satellite System Operator.
3.
Any sensitivity testing performed using the operational Satellite Constellation must accommodate both the link budget statistical performance margin and the multipath fade margin by means of a calibrated attenuator inserted between the antenna and the AES transceiver under test.
Protocol Analyzer (Air) - This device consists of a computer capable of bi-directional communications with the AES under test by means of one of the provided digital data bus formats.  The PAA shall permit user control of data content and message timing for transmitted messages, and shall permit user examination of incoming and outgoing messages on both octet and message levels. 

Protocol Analyzer (Ground) - This device consists of a computer capable of bidirectional data communications with the GES by means of one of the GES-supported digital data bus formats (e.g., X.25).  The PAA shall permit user control of data content and message timing for transmitted messages, and shall permit user examination of incoming and outgoing messages on both an octet and an message level. 

Data Generation Unit - This device consists of a computer capable of generating random binary messages of programmable length.  It may be combined with PAG and PAA. 

Transceiver Test Controller  - This device may be required to initialize the AES or to induce the AES to a certain state, or to initialize a certain condition.  It is permissible for the transceiver test controller to use existing AES interfaces for this purpose. 

## 2.4.2.1.3 Required Aircraft Interfaces Required Test Equipment

There are no requirements to test under this topic. 

## 2.4.2.2 Modulation And Signal In Space Required Test Equipment

 Compliance with the technique-specific modulation and signal-in-space requirements will be verified by means of a certification from the Satellite System Operator that the AES is permitted to operate within the subnetwork.  Required test equipment, if any, will be determined by the satellite system operator certification procedure, which is not an integral part of this MOPS or its technique-specific appendices. 

 

## 2.4.2.3 Priority, Precedence, And Preemption Test Equipment 2.4.2.3.1 Packet Data Theses Test Requires The Ability To Initiate And Terminate Multiple Virtual Circuit Communications Channels By Means Of The Paa And Pag.

2.4.2.3.2 
Circuit Mode Communications This test requires the ability to initiate and terminate N simultaneous circuit-mode calls through the satellite network.  Depending on the specific sub-network, this may require N telephone lines or N satellite network mobile terminal channels.  This test makes no assumptions about the capabilities of these circuit-originating and circuit-terminating devices.  It is permissible to utilize a separate AES, independent of the AES under test, in this role. This test is not intended to verify the ability of the satellite network or the satellite subnetwork as a whole, to satisfy the Priority, Precedence and Preemption requirements of the MASPS.  This test should be coordinated with the satellite network operator to ensure that appropriate satellite capacity exists for the completion of the test.  Such coordination may require that the test be performed in off-peak traffic hours. 

## 2.4.2.4 Satellite Subnetwork Data Protocol Test Equipment

 Compliance with the overall technique-specific satellite subnetwork dependent protocol will be verified by means of a certification from the Satellite System Operator that the AES is permitted to operate within the subnetwork.  Required test equipment, if any, will be determined by the satellite system operator certification procedure, which is not an integral part of this MOPS or its technique-specific appendices. Compliance with an aeronautical application specific Air-Ground Protocol sub-layer, if applicable, will be determined using the Protocol Analyzer (Ground) and Protocol Analyzer (Air) defined above. 

## 2.4.2.5 Voice Protocol Required Test Equipment

 Compliance with the overall technique-specific voice protocol, if applicable, will be verified by means of a certification from the Satellite System Operator that the AES is permitted to operate within the subnetwork.  Required test equipment, if any, will be determined by the satellite system operator certification procedure, which is not an integral part of this MOPS or its technique-specific appendices. 

 
Compliance with the requirements of Section 2.2.3.5.2 requires special test equipment capable of accurately reproducing the required environments.  The tests are complex, and are typically carried out by organizations with expertise in the evaluation of vocoder or voice modem capabilities. 

## 2.4.2.6 User Data Interface Required Test Equipment

ISO-8208 Test Set/Protocol Analyzer (2), one designated as Protocol Analyzer Air 
(PAA), one designated as Protocol Analyzer Ground (PAG). 

Remote access equipment to ISO-8208 compatible data port at GES. 

or, alternative, GES Emulator.

No special test equipment is required to verify these requirements. 

## 2.4.2.8 Recovery From Primary Power Interruption Test Equipment

No special test equipment is required to verify these requirements. 

## 2.4.2.9 Failure/Status Indication Test Equipment

No special test equipment is required to verify these requirements. 

## 2.4.3 Detailed Test Procedures

The test procedures set forth below constitute a satisfactory method of determining required performance.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred.  Such alternate methods may be used if the manufacturer can show that they provide at least equivalent information.  Therefore, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. 

For performance verification purposes, this section includes procedures for transceiver and the antenna.  The term Satellite Subnetwork Physical Layer is also used for this subsystem in regard to the layered ISO concepts for data communications protocols. 

Some of the following receiver-related tests require a Satellite System Emulator and may require additional test equipment not shown in the test figures.  The transceiver frequency, mode, etc. are controlled by commands from the emulator.  In cases where a Satellite System Emulator is not available, it shall be permissible to use the operational satellite constellation, provided the criteria established in Section 2.4.1.1.2 are satisfied.

                         using the test setup of Figure 2-6.  Depending on the individual antenna design, 
                         it may be necessary to modify the setup of Figure 2-6 to use the antenna under 
                         test as a transmit source and the reference antenna as a receiver.  Such 
                         modifications are fully compliant with the intent of the following test procedures.

Measurement points where the axial ratio does not comply with the requirements of Section 2.2.3.1.1.2 may be included in coverage volume if the measured gain at the corresponding elevation and azimuth angles (G*MEAS* ) exceeds the minimum value required by Section 2.2.3.1.1.1.3 (G*REQD*) by at least a compensating amount (G*COMPp*). 

Points which should be included in the coverage volume because of axial ratio are those where: 

$$G_{M E A S}\geq G_{R E Q D}+G_{C o o M P}$$
and where all gain values are measured in decibels.

Set the Satellite Subnetwork Emulator to simulate a satellite geometry corresponding to the worst case relative velocity between the satellite and the AES.  Verify that the AES can initiate and receive communications in all specified modes.  Verify that the AES can maintain a continuous connection with the Satellite Subnetwork Emulator for at least 60 
seconds under the worst case relative velocity. Repeat the test with the transmit frequencies increased by the amount given above. Alternatively, it is acceptable to offset the AES reference frequency so that the AES maximum transmit frequency is reduced by the amount computed above, and then, with the AES offset in this manner, communicate with the operational constellation.  If the constellation is used, the requirements of Section 2.4.1.1.2 shall be observed.  If the constellation is used, the testing shall be timed to coincide with the occurance of the worst case relative velocity between the satellite and the stationary AES.

## Measurement Requirments

 
Notes: 1. Considering the very low signal levels required and the small tolerance allowed, 
measures should be taken to avoid possible leakage problems from the test signal generator. 2. This test uses a digital data interface to collect data transmitted over the network.  It 
is permissible to use the data interface tested in  Section 2.4.3.6.4, provided that the 
"number of bits received" includes any protocol bits required for interfaces to the 
"higher level entity".  In any case, the manufacturer shall verify that the digital data 
interface has sufficient bandwidth to service the declared end-user throughput.  For example, a 2400 bps satellite path must be tested with a digital data interface of not less than 2400 bps. 

Perform the following steps: 

1.
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-20.  The sensitivity of the
transceiver will first be measured at ambient temperature.  Command the transceiver to receive a data signal on a valid traffic channel, on a channel frequency near the center of the receive band.
2.
Command the Satellite Network Simulator to establish a data connection
with the AES.
3.
Generate an extended sequence of data bits from a simulated user source
using a suitable Data Generation Unit.  The total number of data bits, N*DATA*,
and the test duration time, T*TEST*, shall be chosen to ensure that the probability
of accepting a unit which sustains a rate of less than 99% of the nominal user throughput rate is less than 5%.
4.
Command the Satellite Network Simulator to send the entire sequence of
data bits to the AES.  Adjust the test signal level at the antenna port to the
Input Signal Power as listed in Section 2.2.3.1.2.2.1 for the desired nominal rate.
5.
Using a suitable external device, collect the all output bits from the external
data interface of the AES received during the test interval T*TEST*.  At the
conclusion of the test interval, compute the average throughput rate during the interval by:
 
For this computation, the number of bits received must be adjusted to account for any SSNDP protocol bits which are transmitted within the user 
payload as well as any external interface protocol bits generated between the AES and the data collection unit.  Internal protocol bits are not included in 
the number of bits received.  SSNDP protocol bits may be included only if they are passed to the data collection device. 6. Determine compliance by comparing the average value of the throughput, 
computed in Step 5, with the selected data rate from Section 2.2.3.1.2.2.1. 7. Repeat Steps 1-6 for the nominal user data rates specified in Section 
2.2.3.1.2.2.1. 8. Repeat Steps 1-7 for the receive frequencies corresponding to the transmitter 
test frequencies identified in Section 2.4.3.1.1.4. 
 
Note: If the AES provides a Data-2 interface capability, it may simplify the test to use the Data-2 interface, thereby eliminating a layer of protocol.

 Measurement Procedure This is a two-part procedure.  In Part One, the receiver design is analyzed to identify potential analog image and spurious response frequencies and possible digitally-induced aliases.  In Part Two, the receiver is tested to determine if the receiver performance is degraded, causing loss of communications, by any of the signals identified in Part One. Part One: Prior to the start of the test, analyze the transceiver under test to determine required input test frequencies.  All IF and reference frequencies used within the transceiver must be known.  Using these frequencies, calculate all frequencies within the ranges specified in Section 2.2.3.1.2.2.3, which have the potential to produce image or spurious signals.  The calculations should include image frequencies and mixer harmonic intermodulation distortions through 11th order which are capable of producing IF frequencies used within the transceiver, or subharmonics of these IF frequencies, and such frequencies that may lead to digital aliasing problems or other spurious responses. 

Part Two: Connect the measurement equipment as shown in Figure 2-21.  Tune the receiver to the operational frequency closest to 1

Adjust its output to produce signal levels into the transceiver as specified for each of the frequency ranges in Section 2.2.3.1.2.2.3.  Sweep the frequency over the critical frequency sub-ranges identified in Part One.  Choose the sweep rate so that any satellite sub-network timers designed to coast through interference bursts time out during the sweep of any specific subband.  Verify that communications are not interrupted by observing that voice connections are not lost and data connections maintain the desired user throughput rate. Repeat the test over the entire frequency range of Section 2.2.3.1.2.2.3 using the sweep rate identified in the previous step. Repeat these tests with the transceiver tuned to frequencies of and RMN

Note: As an alternative to Part Two, this test may be performed using the operational constellation, provided the considerations of Section 2.4.1.1.2 are met.  If the operational constellation is used, tests should be timed to coincide with the worst case satellite geometry declared by the satellite system operator. 

 
It is anticipated that some NGSS-based AES equipment may use embedded transceiver devices for the underlying satellite network.  In such cases, transceiver manufacturer test data on the individual transceiver units may be acceptable alternative to performing the tests at the AES level, provide that such data essentially reproduces the tests described above.

## 2.4.3.1.3 Required Aircraft Interfaces Reference:  Section 2.2.3.1.3 To The Extend That Specific Aircraft Interfaces Are Required By The Specific Satellite Subnetwork, They Shall Be Tested In Accordance With The Satellite Network Provider Certification Process Discussed In The Technique Specific Appendix. 2.4.3.2 Satellite Subnetwork Specific Test Requirements

Reference:  Section 2.2.3.2 This document envisions the use of commercial satellite communications systems for AMS(R)S and general AMSS services.  It is expected that each commercial satellite system operator will have a unique set of access requirements that must be satisfied before a terminal, or family of terminal, is granted access to the network.  The AES shall satisfy all network access requirements, including compatibility and interoperability testing, required by the satellite network operator.  The AES manufacturer shall make the results of such network access certification testing available to civil aviation authorities as required to facilitate certification for safety service. 

The satellite network access certification procedures shall be identified in the systemspecific appendix.  Appendices applicable to specific systems are identified in Section 
2.2.3.2 of this document. 

## 2.4.3.3 Priority, Precedence And Preemption

The test procedures of the following subparagraphs assume that the AES is capable of serving both AMSS (Priority Level 1 [low] in Table 2-4) and AMS(R)S (Priority Level 2 Priority Level 3, and Priority Level 4 [high]).  If the system being tested support solely AMS(R)Service, references to Priority Level 1 may be replaced with Priority Level 2. 

## 2.4.3.3.1 Packet Data Reference:  Section 2.2.3.3.1 Equipment Required

This test requires the ability to establish ND simultaneous packet data channels using the AES under test.  This may require multiple AES control units or multiple digital interfaces from a single control unit.  Each interface must be capable of sustaining a bit rate of at 2R*SC-UD*.  If a single interface is used to contol all ND packet data channels, that interface must be capable of sustaining a bit rate of 2(ND)R*SC-UD*. 

## Measurement Procedure

The precedence and preemption test procedures are designed to verify the AES's ability to determine the precedence of packet-mode data and preempt, if necessary, lowerpriority AGPDUs. 

## 1. Data Communications Setup

Utilizing the appropriate SNAcP interface and commands, create ND  independent packet data channels between the AES and either the system test simulator or an appropriate GES.  For the purpose of this test, label these independent channels Channel A, Channel B, etc.  (For the purposes of this test description, we will assume ND=4). 

## 2. Data Packets From Data Packets

This test verifies proper ordering of AGPDUs according to the link layer precedence of the data packets arriving at the AES. 

a.
Using the external interface send a message consisting of L*SNDP* +10 octets of
data over the established channels in the following order: Channel A, Channel C, Channel B, Channel D.  Fill the User Data Field with following patterns:

|      For    |     For           |     Pattern  |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| channel D   | priority 4 (high) |    01010101  |
| channel C   | priority 2        |    10101010  |

 
 
channel B  
priority 3  
11001100 
 
 
channel A  
priority 1 (low) 00110011 
 
These packets shall be sent to the AES interface at the maximum rate supported by the external interface hardware. 
  
 
Verify that the AES sends data packets over the subnetwork in priority order, 
with higher priority packets transmitted first. 
 
b. For equipment that does not support Priority Level 1 (low, non-safety) 
communications, create a data stream that alternates the data fields from step (a) and the Priority 1 data stream from step (a).  Verify that only Priority 2, 3, and 4 packets are transmitted. 
 
Note: AES designs that choose to implement an ISO-8208 compliant interface may 
satisfy this requirement by means of the tests specified in Appendix B, Section 
3.1.2. 
 
2.4.3.3.2 
Circuit Mode Communications Reference:  Section 2.2.3.3.2 
 
Equipment Required This test requires the ability to initiate and terminate N simultaneous circuit-mode calls through the satellite network.  Depending on the specific sub-network, this may require Ntelephone lines or Nsatellite network mobile terminal channels.  This test makes no assumptions about the capabilities of these circuit-originating and circuit-terminating devices.  It is permissible to utilize a separate AES, independent of the AES under test, in this role. This test is not intended to verify the ability of the satellite network or the satellite subnetwork as a whole, to satisfy the Priority, Precedence and Preemption requirements of the MASPS.  This test should be coordinated with the satellite network operator to ensure that appropriate satellite capacity exists for the completion of the test.  Such coordination may require that the test be performed in off-peak traffic hours. 

Test Procedure This test assumes that the AES is capable of N channels of simultaneous circuit-mode operation.  The value of N shall be declared before the test is started. Perform the following steps: 
1. Establish N voice calls at non-safety circuit-mode priority, Priority Level 1 (low), identified in Table 2-7. 

 2. While monitoring the Priority Level 1 (low) calls, attempt to establish an air-toground call at Circuit-Mode Priority 2 identified in Table 2-7.  Verify that one of the 
non-safety circuits is terminated and made available for the safety call, and that the call is completed. 
 
3. Repeat Step 2 until all channels are consumed by Priority 2 calls. 
4.
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 with Priority 3 calls.
5.
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 with Priority 4 (high) calls.
6.
At the completion of Step 5, there will be N Priority 4 (high) calls established.
Attempt to initiate an air-to-ground call at Priority 3, and verify that the call is not
accepted.
7.
Attempt to initiate an air-to-ground call at Priority 2, and verify that the call is not
accepted.
8.
Attempt to initiate an air-to-ground call at Priority 1 (low), and verify that the call is
not accepted.  This step shall be performed for all equipment, including equipment that does not support Priority 1 (low) non-safety communications.
9.
Terminate all calls, and re-establish Step 1 with Priority 1 (low) calls.
10. Repeat Steps 2 through 8 using ground-to-air calls and verify that the same results are
obtained.

## 2.4.3.4 Satellite Subnetwork Data Protocol (Satellite Layer 2) Reference:  Section 2.2.3.4

AES compliance with Sub-network specific protocol requirements shall be verified by means of the satellite network access certification identified in the system-specific appendix.  Appendices applicable to specific systems are identified in Section 2.2.3.2 of this document.  The comments contained in Section 2.4.3.1.3 apply to this verification procedure as well. 

## 2.4.3.5 Voice Protocol Reference:  Section 2.2.3.5

Compliance with the system-specific protocols shall be verified by means of the satellite network operator certification process identified in the normative technique-specific appendix.  Acceptable evidence of such compliance is a certification document from the satellite network provider. 

## 2.4.3.5.1 Vocoder Interoperatiblity With Satellite Subnetwork

Section 2.2.6 permits the use of a "100% compatible" vocoder algorithm.  If algorithm other than the specific algorithm identified in the relevant system-specific appendix, including version and part number, is selected, it shall be the responsibility of the manufacturer to develop test procedures and documentary evidence that complete interoperability is achieved.  These procedures shall be approved by satellite network operator prior to the start of testing.  Because of the complexity of such vocoder design and testing issues, these tests are not specifically identified in this document. 

All AES vocoders shall demonstrate compliance with Sub-network specific vocoder requirements by means of the satellite network access certification identified in the system-specific appendix.  Appendices applicable to specific systems are identified in Section 2.2.3.2 of this document.  The comments contained in Section 2.4.3.1.3 apply to this verification procedure as well. 

2.4.3.5.2 
Vocoder Performance in an Aeronautical Environment For AES equipment intend for safety voice applications shall verify that the vocoder is suitable for the aeronautical cockpit environment when operating in the noise environments identified in Section 2.2.3.5.2 by conducting statistically significant comparison tests with the 9600 bps vocoder specified in RTCA DO-210D and the Annex 10, Chapter 4 SARPs. 

## 2.4.3.6 User Data Interfaces

 The option of providing an ATN-compliant protocol is tested in Section 2.4.3.6.1.  The option of providing a Data-2 interface is tested in Section 2.2.3.6.2.  An AES must pass either or both sets of tests, depending on the capabilities declared in the techniquespecific appendix. If an ISO-8208 compliant interface is provided as the ATN interface, the tests are described in Appendix B.  Satellite subnetwork-dependent validation is discussed in the appropriate appendix to this document. 

 
2.4.3.6.1 
ATN Interfaces Reference:  Section 2.2.3.6.1 The requirements established in Section 2.2.3.6.1 concern the implementation of an  Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE) interface on the digital side of the AES.  To verify the proper functionality of that interface, it is necessary to issue certain commands and analyze certain responses from both a simulated Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) external to the AES and from a correponding simulated DTE external to the GES.  One means of verifying compliance would be to probe the radio-frequency emissions of the AES, back out the satellite-network signal-in-space, Layer 1 and Layer 2 and possible Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocols, and confirm transmission of the proper DCE- DCE message traffic.  This approach requires the ability to simulate the signal processing of the entire satellite network, including its ground terminals and gateways to the public and private networks.  This is a complex and expensive process. The same information can be obtained, however, by using the satellite network directly, and examining the data at the output of the GES.  The potential exists to remotely access this information so that the entire testing is performed in a closed loop from a single location, as shown in Figure 2-22. 

 
Note: Use of the Active Satellite Sub-Network for performance testing is subject to the restrictions identified in Section 2.4.1.1.2 of this document. 

 

## 2.4.3.6.1.1 Join And Leave Requirements Reference:  Section 2.2.3.6.1.1 Verify That A Join Event Message In Accordance With Section 2.2.3.6.1.1 Is Transmitted To The Routing Function Upon Determination Of Availability Of The Air/Ground Data Link.  Similarly, Verify That A Leave Event Message Is Transmitted Upon Determination Of Non-Availability Of The Air/Ground Data Link. 2.4.3.6.1.2 Atn-Compliant Mapping For Priority, Precedence, And Preemption Reference:  Section 2.2.3.6.1.2

This test establishes only that the satellite subnetwork properly maintains the subnetwork priority field, not that the priority, precedence and preemption mechanisms are implemented.  Perform the following steps: 

1.
Using the standard packet data test setup up shown in Figure 2-22, use the PAG to
send packets with values the priority field in the appropriate call set-up packet set to
the value corresponding to the lowest priority.  Use the PAA to verify that the associated received packet contains the same value.  Verify that the priority is
confirmed back to the PAG.  Use the appropriate procedure to clear the resulting call.
2.
Repeat  Step 1 with values in the priority field set to increasing levels of priority.  For
systems capable of both safety and non-safety communications, verify that a
minimum of four levels of priority are supported, in accordance with Table 2-7.  For
systems capable of only safety communications, verify that a minimum of three
levels of priority are supported, in accordance with Table 2-7.
3.
Repeat the Step 1 and Step 2 tests with the roles of the PAA and PAG reversed.

## 2.4.3.6.2 Data 2 Reference:  Section 2.2.3.6.2

Systems providing Data-2 interface shall be tested in accordance with the test procedures referenced in the appropriate subnetwork-specific appendix. 

## 2.4.3.6.3 Satellite Subnetwork 2.4.3.6.3.1 Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocol Reference:  Section 2.2.3.6.3.1

Experimental verification that the requirements of Section 2.2.3.6.3.1 have been met could require an inordinate amount of test time, due to the extremely small packet error rates permitted.  Therefore, compliance these requirements shall be demonstrated by analysis or simulation of the protocols involved in reliable packet transmission. Guidance for such analytical methods may be found in the MASPs and DO-215A, Change 1. 

SSNDP test procedures and AGP sub-layer test procedures are specified in the techniquespecific appendix or referenced documents.

While continuously maintaining the communications session, monitor the receiver digital or audio output on the scope.  Apply power interruptions of 5 ms and observe no dropout of output whatsoever.  Apply 200 ms interruptions and verify that the output recovers within 5 seconds and verify the data link functions are unaffected.

Use the protocol analyzer to verify that the AES communications is reported as AVAILABLE or its equivalent.  Using the programmable attenuator, increase the loss between the AES and the satellite until communications with the satellite are lost.  Verify that the status is reported as UNAVAILABLE or its equivalent.  Return the attenuation to its original setting and verify that the status returns to AVAILABLE.

conditions.  These fans are activated with flaps extended and low- to mid-throttle,
and cause aircraft power fluctuations when activated.
2.
See Section 3.4.4 for requirements for message generation.
The equipment shall not be the source of harmful conducted or radiated interference, and shall not be affected by conducted or radiated interference from other equipment or systems installed in the aircraft. 

Adequate protection of on-board GNSS equipment from harmful interference due to equipment meeting the requirements of Section 2 is based on an average power level not exceeding –122 dBm referenced to the port of the GNSS antenna, the spectral width of the interfering signal(s) lies in the range of 100 to 1000 kHz. 

Notes: 3. In a typical installation, this could be achieved if: 
a) the transceiver meets all requirements of Sections 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, 2.2.3.1.2.1.4, 
2.2.3.1.2.1.5; 

 
 
b) the isolation between AMSS and GNSS antennas is not less than 40 dB; and 
c) interfering intermodulation products generated external to the transceiver do 
not increase the average average power level referenced to the port of the 
GNSS antenna by more than 1.5 dB. 
 
4. Interference problems noted upon installation of this equipment may result from such 
factors as the design characteristics of previously installed systems or equipment and the physical installation itself.  It is not intended that the equipment manufacturer design for all installation environments.  The installing facility will be responsible for 
resolving any incompatibility between this equipment and previously installed equipment in the aircraft. 
 
If the equipment is installed on an airframe as part of a "dual-dissimilar" satellite communications suite, the following test procedures shall be performed.  In the following discussions, "SATCOM A" refers to the system covered by this MOPS, for which installed equipment tests are currently being performed, while "SATCOM B" refers to the other satellite communications system.  It is possible that this document and a particular technique-specific appendix may apply to the SATCOM B system, as well. 

 

## 3.4.2.1 Antenna Isolation

 If the declared isolation between the AMS(R)S and any GNSS antenna is greater than 40 dB, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, the installed isolation shall be tested for each aircraft installation. 

## 3.4.2.2 Satcom B Interference To Satcom A

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

 Perform the following steps: 1. 
With SATCOM B inactive, establish a circuit-mode communications session on SATCOM A, if appropriate.  Verify that this session is maintained when SATCOM B is switched on and commanded to initiate a packet mode communications session, if appropriate.  Verify that the SATCOM A communications session is maintained when the SATCOM B transfers a package message of 4000 octets containing 
random binary data.  Terminate the SATCOM B packet mode communications session and verify that the SATCOM A communications session is maintained. 

2.
Repeat the process of Step 1 with SATCOM B circuit mode data communications, if
appropriate.
3.
Repeat the process of Step 1 with SATCOM B voice communications, if
appropriate.
4.
Repeat the process of Steps 1, 2, and 3, with SATCOM A circuit mode data communications, if appropriate.
5.
Repeat the process of Steps 1, 2, and 3 with SATCOM A voice  communications, if
appropriate.  Test the ability of SATCOM A to sustain packet data communications by sending messages of 4000 octets.
6.
With SATCOM A inactive, initiate a SATCOM B packet mode communications
session.  Transmit a series of test messages of 4000 octets each.  While the transmission is in progress, activate SATCOM A.  Verify that SATCOM A can acquire the network.  Verify that the AES can initiate and sustain SATCOM A voice
communications session for a period of 60 seconds during SATCOM B packet mode operations.  Verify that the AES can properly terminate its voice call.
7.
Repeat Step 6 with SATCOM A operating in circuit data mode, if applicable.
Verify that SATCOM A can initiate and complete a transaction by transmitting a
4000 octet message.  Verify that the AES can properly terminate its circuit mode call.
8.
Repeat Step 7 with SATCOM A operating in packet data mode, if applicable. Verify that SATCOM A can initiate and complete a transaction by transmitting a 4000 octet message. Verify that the AES can properly terminate its packet mode communications session.

## 3.4.2.3 Satcom A Interference To Satcom B

Repeat the tests of the previous section with the roles of SATCOM A and SATCOM B 
reversed.  This will make SATCOM B the victim and SATCOM A the interferer. 

## 3.4.3 Power Fluctuation Tests

Transceiver aircraft power sources shall be cycled through all normal configurations to verify that the transceiver performance for power interruption recovery during and after power changeover is satisfactory with no discernible abnormal operation. 

In-transit data service packets which have been acknowledged on either the DTE or DCE 
interface, but not yet transferred to the opposite interface, may be lost.  Nontransceiver higher layer entities which employ end-to-end acknowledgment 
protocols may choose to retransmit such lost data. 

## 3.4.4 Ground Test Procedures

 Perform the ground test portions of tests defined in manufacturer's installation instructions. 

 

## 3.4.5 Flight Test Procedures

 Flight tests of installed systems are desirable to confirm or supplement bench and ground tests of installed performance.  Flight tests may be defined in the manufacturer's installation instructions. 

## 3.4.6 Installed System Performance Verification 3.4.6.1 Installed Functionality

 Performance of the installed avionics, consisting of the Antenna Subsystem and the Transceiver Subsystem, should be verified in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.  The following general functional categories shall be validated: 
Subnetwork Physical Layer - Verify by initiating and terminating multiple communications session in all applicable modes and with all applicable channels.  This test shall include test of the maximum capability of Nv and ND simultaneous communications channels as declared by the manufacturer. 

Network Management Tests - Verify the ability of the AES to acquire and register with the network from a cold start.  Verify that the AES performs the appropriate registration or log-on functions as specified in the technique-specific appendix.  If multiple data channels are available, verify that they can be assigned and released as required. 

Message Transfer Tests - For all operational modes (i.e., voice, circuit mode data, packet data, as appropriate) ensure that the AES can initiate and receive data and sustain communications in its installed environment.  Voice calls should extend for at least five minutes.  Data transfers should include at least 4 blocks of 4000 octets in each direction. 

Circuit Mode Services - Verify that the mechanisms for selecting, dialing, and releasing a circuit are operational.  Verify that the mechanisms for accepting, and rejecting an incoming call through operator action are operational. 

## 3.4.6.2 Installed Antenna Coverage

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`--- The antenna tests of Section 2.4.3.1.1 provide sufficient verification of coverage for topmounted antenna installation using steered antennas and non-steered antennas with essentially hemispherical patterns.  These installations are expected to be the common installation for most platforms. 

 

## 4 Equipment Operational Performance Characteristics

AMSS AES installations are expected to be accomplished in a variety of ways to fit the aircraft equipment and intended usage.  This will also be the case with associated cockpit interfaces.  The requirements of this section shall be suitably interpreted for the particular installation under consideration.

## Appendix B  Interference Model For Emissions Associated With Ancilliary Terrestrial Component (Atct) Ground Stations 1 Introduction

This normative appendix defines the requirements and verification procedures for an ATN-compliant interface based on ISO-8208.   This interface is intended to be compatible with the Data-3 interface defined in DO-210D. 

All AES equipment desiring to implement an ISO-8208 compatible interface to provide ATN services shall comply with the requirements and verification procedures stated in this appendix. 

The reference model of Figure B-1 will be used throughout this appendix. In keeping with the structure of the main body of these MOPS, this appendix has been organized so that the requirements of each sub-paragraph of Section 2 are verified by the procedures described in the corresponding sub-paragraph of Section 3.  For example, the priority mapping requirements of 2.1 are verified by the procedures of 3.1.  As a result of this mapping, this appendix does not contain a verification cross reference matrix. 

## 1.1 Assumptions On Higher Layer Packet Data Interfaces

 To support the evolving ATN/ATM environment, this MOPS emphasizes data communications.  As noted earlier, one proven means of supporting an ATN-compliant 
interface is by use of ISO-8208 compatible interfaces.  ISO-8208 operations are defined 
in terms of a user application, also known as a Higher Level Entity (HLE).  For the purpose of specifying these interfaces, Appendix B of this document assumes the HLE 
performs the the following functions: a. Supports the operations of the DTE as specified in The ISO-8208 standard. b.  Is able to initiate, accept and terminate calls via the interface. c.  Is prepared to accept error messages from the AES . 
 
d. Monitors the AES operation in case of unrecoverable error conditions and reinitializes 
the AES as necessary. 

## 2 Iso-8208 Protocol Requirements 2.1 Iso-8208 Priority Mapping

The values contained in the ISO-8208 SNC_Priority Field in the CALL_REQUEST, CALL_ACCEPTED, INCOMING_CALL and CALL_CONNECTED packets shall be assumed to be assigned as given in Table B-1, and shall be transparently transmitted across the satellite network. 

Note: It is recommended, but not required, that packets received at AES with SNC_Priority of 4, 9, 10, 12, and 14 be transparently transmitted across the satellite network, and that packets with these SNC_Priority received from the network be transparently transmitted to the HLE. 

 

## 2.2 Iso-8208 Protocol Implementation Conformance

 The interface between the Higher Level Entity (HLE) and the AES shall conform to the ISO-8208 standard with the following characteristics.  It shall provide for the following: a.  A User Data Field (in the CALL REQUEST, DATA, CLEAR REQUEST and CALL ACCEPTED packets) of up to 128 octets. b.  Expedited Data Delivery, i.e., the use of INTERRUPT packets with a User Data Field of up to 32 octets. c.  Called and Calling Address Extension Facilities. d.  Fast Select (without restrictions). e.  Fast Select Acceptance (without restrictions). f.   Throughput Class Negotiation. 
g.  Transit Delay Selection and Indication. h.  Default maximum user data field length of 128 octets in DATA packets. 
i.    Priority (of data on a connection). Notes: 1.  End-to-end data delivery confirmation service is not supported.  The D-bit shall be 
transmitted as a zero. 2.  Additional ISO-8208 facilities may be found necessary in the future.  These may include Minimum Throughput Class Negotiation and End-to-End Transit Delay Negotiation.

 1. Priority levels at the ISO-8208 interface to the AMSS Subnetwork are mapped to equivalent ATN priority levels by the ATN 
Subnetwork Dependent Convergence Function (SNDCF) contained in external ATN facilities. 
2.   ISO-8208 priorities range from] 0 (lowest priority) to 14 (highest priority).  The value 255 (all ones) indicates       
"unspecified".  All other values (i.e., 15 through 254) are reserved."] 
 
3. "None" means that the optional ISO-8208 Priority Facility is not invoked in the CALL_REQUEST, 
CALL_ACCEPTED, INCOMING_CALL, or CALL_CONNECTED packets, as appropriate for the specific entry. Note that some AMSS implementations receiving a packet with priority level other than 1 - 14 may forward the equivalent packet with no requested priority. 
 
4. Certain levels are identified as Reserved.  The response to a DTE/DCE request for communications at these levels 
may vary between AMSS systems.  Users should consult the technique-specific MASPS appendix or the applicable 
MOPS for details. 
 
5. 
Network/System Management and Administration are not categories of end-use messages but may be used by 
ATN management or for other network management/administration functions. 

## 2.3 Aes Operation As Dce In Iso-8208 Environment

 The Data Communications Equipment (DCE) process within the AES shall function as a peer process to the external Data Terminal Equipment (DTE).  The DCE shall support the operations of the DTE with the facilities specified in Section 2.1 of this appendix. The following requirements do not include those relating to format definitions, diagnostic and cause codes, and flow control on the ISO-8208 interface.  The default or standard values defined in the ISO-8208 standard shall apply in these cases. 

 

## 2.4 State Transitions

The DCE is defined as a state machine.  An ISO-8208 packet received from the DTE can cause state transitions, as can a packet received from the Interworking Function illustrated in Figure B-1.  The next state transition (if any) occurs when the DCE receives a packet from the DTE as specified by Table B-3 through Table B-10. These tables are organized according to the substate hierarchy illustrated Figure B-3. 

 
Upon receiving a packet, the Action is classified as normal or erroneous under the entry "A =".  Normal actions, if not defined in the Table itself, are defined via a parenthetical reference {e.g., (4.2)} to the ISO-8208 standard.  The resulting state is shown under the entry "S =". 

If a state transition is specified, the actions taken shall be as specified in Table B-3 
through Table B-10.  In addition, the actions specified for transition to that state as specified in Table B-3 shall be performed. 

Table B-3 through Table B-10 also specify the disposition of the received packet.  When a packet is received from the DTE, the expressions in parentheses in Table B-3 through Table B-10 specify whether the packet shall be forwarded or not forwarded to the SSNIW.  If no remark in parentheses is listed or listed as "not forwarded," then the packet shall be discarded. The ISO-8208 DCE shall either forward or not forward a packet from the SSNIW to the DTE in a manner that is compatible with ISO-8208.

## Notes To Table B-5:

1.
The AES Subnetwork has no restart states.  Receipt of a RESTART REQUEST causes the
DCE to respond with a RESTART CONFIRMATION.  The RESTART REQUEST causes the ISO-8208-to-satellite interworking function to clear all SVCs associated with the DTE/DCE 
interface. 
2.
(Reserved for future use).
3.
 
The RESTART REQUEST packet is not forwarded to the ISO-8208-to-satellite
interworking, and thus is not forwarded to the ground over the satellite subnetwork.
4.
If the DCE enters the r3 state, then the RESTART CONFIRMATION is not sent.
5.
The DCE upon entering the r3 state checks for the completion of r2 processing and issues an
ISO-8208 RESTART INDICATION packet to the DTE, when the r3 state is entered via the r2
state.  If the r3 state is not entered via the r2 state, the DCE performs all of the actions normally performed when entering r2 and issues an ISO-8208 RESTART INDICATION to
the DTE, and causes the ISO-8208 to satellite interworking function to clear all SVCs associated with the DTE/DCE interface.
6.
Table B-entries are defined as follows: A = Action to be taken, S = State to be entered, D =
Diagnostic code to be used in packets generated as a result of this action, DISCARD indicates that the received packet is to be cleared from the AES buffers.
7.
The number in the parentheses below an "A = NORMAL" Table B-entry is the Section
number in the ISO-8208 standard.  The DCE shall take the same actions as the ones taken
by the DTE, acting as a DCE, to perform nominal processing on the received packet.  If no Section number is referenced, the normal processing is defined in the Table B-entry.

## Notes To Table B-7:

1. 
On entering the p5 state, the DCE cancels the outgoing call to the DTE, issuing a CLEAR REQUEST to the SSNIW (no CLEAR 
INDICATION is issued) and responds to incoming DTE call as appropriate with a CLEAR INDICATION or CALL CONNECTED 
packet. 
 
2. 
The error procedure consists of performing the actions specified when entering the p7 state (including sending a CLEAR INDICATION 
packet to the DTE) and additionally sending a CLEAR REQUEST packet to the SSNIW. 
 
3. 
The use of Fast Select Facility with restriction on response prohibits the DTE from sending a CALL ACCEPTED packet. 
 
4. 
The DTE in the event of a Call Collision must discard the CALL INDICATION packet received from the DCE. 
 
5. 
Table B-entries are defined as follows: A = Action to be taken, S = the State to be entered, D = Diagnostic code to be used in packets 
generated as a result of this action, DISCARD indicates that the received packet is to be cleared from the AES buffers. 
 
6. 
The number in parentheses below an "A = NORMAL" Table B-entry is the Section number in the ISO-8208 standard.  The DCE shall 
take the same actions as the ones taken by the DTE, acting as a DCE, to perform normal processing on the received packet.  If no Section 
number is referenced, the normal processing is defined in the Table B-entry. 
 
 7.      If  the packet is accepTable B-to the state of the logical channel (i.e., Action = Normal), but contains a format error or is otherwise 
unacceptable, then the DCE shall initiate a CONNECTION RELEASE procedure (diagnostic codes that may apply include 34, 38, 39, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 73, 77 and 82).  If such an error is detected in states p1 or p7, the DCE does not send a CLEAR REQUEST packet to the 
SSNIW.

NOTES for Table B-9: 

1. 
The error procedure consists of performing the specified actions when entering the d3 state (which includes forwarding a RESET INDICATION packet to the DTE) causes the 8208 to satellite interworking function to clear all SVCs associated with the DTE/DCE interface. 
 
2. 
Table B-entries are defined as follows: A=Action to be taken, S=the State to be entered, D=the 
Diagnostic code to be used in packets generated as a result of this action, DISCARD indicates that the received packet is to be cleared from the AES buffers. 3. 
The number in parentheses below an "A=NORMAL" Table B-entry is the Section number in The ISO-
8208 standard.  The DCE shall take the same actions as the ones taken by the DTE to perform normal processing on the received packet. If no Section is referenced, the normal processing is defined in the Table B-entry. 4. 
If the packet is accepTable B-to the state of the logical channel (i.e., Action = Normal), but contains a 
format error, then the DCE shall initiate a connection reset procedure (diagnostic codes that may apply include 38, 39, 81 and 82).

NOTES for Table B-11: 

1.
If the packet is accepTable B-to the state of the logical channel (i.e., Action = Normal), but
contains a format error, then the error procedure applies (See Note 4). 
2.
Table B-entries are defined as follows: A=Action to be taken, S=the State to be entered,
D=the Diagnostic code to be used in packets generated as a result of this action, DISCARD indicates that the received packet is to be cleared from the AES buffers.
3.
The number in parentheses below an "A=NORMAL" Table B-entry is the Section number
in the ISO-8208 standard.  The DCE shall take the same actions as the ones taken by the
DTE to perform normal processing on the received packet. If no Section is referenced, the
normal processing is defined in the Table B-entry.
4.
The error procedure consists of performing the specified actions when entering the d3 state
(which includes forwarding a RESET INDICATION packet to the DTE) and causes the
8208 to satellite interworking function to clear all SVCs associated with the DTE/DCE interface.

NOTES  to Table B-10: 
1. The RR, and RNR procedures are a local DTE/DCE matter and the corresponding packets are not forwarded to the SSNIW. 

2. Table B-entries are defined as follows: A=Action to be taken, S=the State to be entered, D=the Diagnostic code to be used in packets generated as a result of this action, DISCARD indicates that the received packet is to be cleared from the AES buffers. 

3. The number in parentheses below an "A=NORMAL" Table B-entry is the Section number in the ISO-
8208 standard.  The DCE shall take the same actions as the ones taken by the DTE to perform normal processing on the received packet. If no Section is referenced, the normal processing is defined in the Table B-entry. 

4. The error procedure consists of performing the specified actions when entering the d3 state (which includes forwarding a RESET INDICATION packet to the DTE) and sending a RESET REQUEST packet to the SSNIW. 

5. The diagnostic codes are as follows: D=1 for invalid PS; D=39 for a User Data Field greater than 128
Octets; D=82 for a User Data Field not octet aligned. 

6. If possible, the DCE should process these packets normally.  On the other hand, the DCE may define an internal mechanism to indicate that valid DATA packets have been discarded during a receive-not-ready condition.  In this case, when the receive-not-ready condition clears, the DCE should reset the logical channel, forwarding both a RESET INDICATION packet to the DTE (D = 0, no additional information) 
causes the ISO-8208-to-satellite-interworking function to clear all SVCs associated with the DTE/DCE 
interface. 

7. For RR, or RNR packets, the presence of one or more octets beyond the third octet is considered an error.  Although a valid P(R) may be accepted to update the status of outstanding DATA packets, the DCE shall invoke the ERROR procedure, as defined in Note 4 (with D = 39). 

Diagnostic and Cause Codes The tables for certain conditions indicate a diagnostic code that shall be included in the packet that is generated when entering the state indicated.  The term "D =" defines the diagnostic code.  When "A = DIAG" appears in a Table B-entry, the action taken shall be to generate an ISO-8208 DIAGNOSTIC packet and transfer it to the DTE; the diagnostic code indicated defines the entry in the diagnostic field of the packet.  Bit 8 of the cause field of any packet type shall  always be set to 0, indicating that the condition was recognized by the ISO-8208 interface. 

## 2.5 Dce Timer

 Under certain circumstances, the DTE shall respond to a packet issued from the DCE within a given time. Table B-14 covers these circumstances and the actions that the DCE shall initiate upon the expiration of that time. 

Whenever a timer action defined in Table B-14 causes a CLEAR REQUEST or signals a CLEAR INDICATION, the clear action shall extend to the satellite subnetwork, that is, the equivalent of a CLEAR REQUEST shall be issued to the interworking function.

## 3 Iso-8208 Protocol Verification Procedures

This section defines a succession of test procedures for a comprehensive logical state test for ISO-8208 DCE.  The tests are defined using the configuration illustrated in Figure 5 .  For all test procedures, the transceiver is logged on to the GES.  The AES and the Protocol Analyzer (Air) exchange ISO-8208 packets, the AES and GES communicate via the satellite sub-network, and the GES and Protocol Analyzer (Ground) communicate via ISO-8208 packets.  packet content will be monitored at both ends to confirm proper state transitions. 

## The Use Of Iso-8208 Default Parameters

Unless otherwise specified, this procedure assumes that relevant parameters of the DTE/DCE interface are set to their standard default values as defined in ISO-
8208. 

NOTE: These include, for example, packet sizes, flow control window sizes, timers and retry counters. 

## Maintaining Flow Control

Unless otherwise specified, the tester shall ensure that flow control is maintained across the transceiver/HLE interface through the use of RECEIVE READY packets, or DATA packets with updated PR/PS Subfields. 

Network Conditions Unless otherwise specified, the following test procedures assume that only one 
DTE will be connected to the transceiver during a given test.  Failure to observe this precaution may cause test results to differ from the expected values. 
 
Standard Test Signals The network protocol selected for the transceiver/HLE interface is ISO Standard 8208. 
NOTE: The manufacturer is free to choose the appropriate physical data bus for 
connection between the transceiver and the HLE.  Characteristics such as amplitude, timing, and waveform shapes of test signals applied to the transceiver 
shall be consistent with the standards definition of the selected data bus. Moreover, the manufacturer should adhere to system impedance requirements of the appropriate standards whether the equipment under test has power applied or 
not, or is in an active or quiescent state (i.e., standby). General Characteristics - Transceiver/HLE Test Signals a. 
Data Formats:  Data transmitted across this interface shall be in packets 
conforming to ISO Standard 8208. b. 
Electrical Characteristics:  Test signals on this interface shall be 
consistent with the appropriate standards for the connecting data bus. c. 
ISO-8208 Channel Assignments:   The test procedures in this MOPS use 
12 ISO-8208 channels in the range 2805 through 2816.  This assignment of channels is introduced as a documentation aid.  The manufacturer is free to choose any block of 12 ISO-8208 channels in the range 2565 through 2816 in a 
particular transceiver implementation. d. 
Data Content:  The test equipment shall be capable of generating or 
accepting messages with the following content:  packet fields such as sequence numbers, addresses, packet types or any other control fields shall be capable of 
being loaded with any combination of ones and zeros, including all ones and all zeros.  Data fields within the packets shall be capable of being loaded with any combination of ones and zeros, including all ones and all zeros. Message Validation The test equipment shall provide a means of validating the information content of any message received from the AES .  This requirement applies to either the AES /HLE  interface or the GES/DTE interface. 

## 3.1 Packet Data Priority, Precedence And Preemption 3.1.1 Iso-8208 Priority Mapping

This test establishes only that the satellite subnetwork properly maintains the SNC Priority field, not that the priority, precedence and preemption mechanisms are implemented. 

Step 1:  Using the standard packet data test setup up shown in Figure 5, use the PAG to send packets with values the SNC_Priority field in the CALL_REQUEST packet set to 1.  Use the PAA to verify that the associate INCOMING CALL packet contains the same value in the SNCPriority field. Verify that the PAA responds with the same SNC_Priority field in its CALL_CONNECTED packet.  Verify that the PAG receives the same value in the CALL_ACCEPTED packet.  Use the appropriate procedure to clear the resulting call. 

Step 2:   Repeat  Step 1 with SNC_Priority field set to the following values:  2, 3, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 14. 

Step 3:   Repeat the Step 1 and Step 2 tests with the roles of the PAA and PAG 
reversed. 

## 3.1.2 Iso-8208 Priority Implementation

The Precedence and Preemption capability is test via the following procedure: 

## Equipment Required

ISO-8208 Test Set/Protocol Analyzer (2), one designated as Protocol Analyzer Air (PAA), one designated as Protocol Analyzer Ground (PAG). 

Remote access equipment to ISO-8208 compatible data port at GES. 

or, alternative, GES Emulator. 

Appropriate cabling and antenna for access to the Satellite Subnetwork, or,  alternatively, Directional Coupler, 30 dB coupling, 20 watts average power rating High Power RF Load, 50 ohms, minimum 20 watts average power rating 

## Test Procedure

The precedence and preemption test procedures are designed to verify the AES's ability to determine the precedence of packet-mode data and preempt, if necessary, lower-priority AGPDUs. 

Use the PAA to perform the airborne HLE functions, and use the PAG to perform the ground HLE functions. 

Step 1 - Virtual Call Setup 

This test opens multiple channels with the AES. a.  
Program the PAA to send four CALL REQUEST packets to the AES 
with the following channel numbers and corresponding link layer precedence: channel 2816, precedence 14; channel 2815, precedence 11; channel 2814, precedence 8; and channel 2813, precedence 3.  Use the PAG to verify that the PAG receives INCOMING CALL packets with four distinct logical channel 
numbers. b. 
Program the PAG to send four CALL ACCEPTED packets to the AES.  
Verify that the AES sends four CALL CONNECTED packets to the PAA with the following channel numbers: 2816, 2815, 2814, and 2813. Step 2 - DATA packets from Data packets This test verifies proper ordering of AGPDUs according to the link layer precedence of the data packets arriving at the AES. a.  
Program the PAA to send an ISO-8208 M-bit sequence consisting of four 
DATA packets, time sequence in the following order:  2813, 2815, 2814, 2816., 
each with L*SNDP* +10 octets of data in the User Data field on each opened channel 
to the AES.  Fill the User Data Field with following patterns: 
 
channel 2816   01010101 


channel 2815   10101010  


channel 2814   11001100  


channel 2813   00110011 These packets shall be sent to the AES 8208 interface at the maximum rate supported by the external interface hardware. 
Note:  Like the equivalent tests in DO-210C, this test implicitly assumes that the external I/O bandwidth significantly exceeds the satellite subnetwork bandwidth 
available to any single AES for packet data operations.  If such is not the case, 
priority, precedence and preemption mechanisms must be supplied at the external I/O controller, effectively overriding AES mechanisms.  
  
b. 
Use the PAG to verify that the AES sends data packets awaiting transmission over the SSNDP in accordance with the data packet precedence with User Data Fields contents as follows. 
 
channel 2813 
00110011 
 
 
channel 2815 
10101010 
 
 
channel 2815 
10101010 
 
 
channel 2816 
01010101 
 
 
channel 2816 
01010101 
 
 
channel 2814 
11001100 
 
 
channel 2814 
11001100 
 
 
channel 2813 
00110011 
Step 3 - Clear Channels Perform the procedure in Section 3.4.1.1Call Setup and Clearing States Step 3 to clear the four open channels. 

## 3.2 Iso-8208 Protocol Implementation Conformance

The basic ISO-8208 functionality is verified by the detailed tests that follow, and is not explicitly tested. 

## 3.3 Aes Operation As A Dce In  Iso-8208 Environment

The peer-to-peer relationship of the AES as a DCE and the support of the required facilities is verified by the detailed tests which follow, and is not explicitly tested. 

## 3.4 State Transition Test Procedures

The channel state test procedures are designed to test the restart, call setup and clearing, reset, interrupt, flow control and data transfer state tables of the transceiver.  The tests are divided into two subgroups: the Normal State Test Procedures and the Error Recovery State Test Procedures. 

Unless otherwise indicated, the tests all occur on one logical channel. 

## 3.4.1 Normal State Test Procedures

Reference: Section 2.3, 2.4 
These procedures are designed to test the transceiver actions when receiving the logically correct ISO-8208 packets, from either interface, for the state of the logical channel.  A series of packets will be transferred across the transceiver interfaces to stimulate the logical states.  packets generated using the Protocol Analyzer (Ground) will arrive at the AES via the Satellite Subnetwork Protocol Data Units using the Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocol (SSNDP).  Failure of these tests could be indicative of a failure to fully comply with the SSNDP. 

## 3.4.1.1 Call Setup And Clearing States

Steps 1-3 must be performed sequentially. 

Step 1 - Virtual Call Setup from HLE 
Program the PAA to send an CALL REQUEST packet to the transceiver.  The use of NSAP addressing is optional.  Invoke the Expedited Data Negotiation Facility in the Optional CCITT-specified DTE Facilities Field.  Use PAG to return a CALL ACCEPTED packet for the corresponding channel.  Use the PAA to verify that the AES generates the corresponding CALL CONNECTED packet with the correct fields. Step 2 - Data Transmission 
 
 
Program the PAA to send two DATA packets to the AES on the open channel. Set the M-bit to zero on each of these DATA packets.   Maintain flow control for the channel, i.e. the PS Subfields for the first and second packet should be zero and one, respectively.  Use a 32-bit User Data Field, and fill the Fields with alternate one-zero patterns. Verify that the DATA packets received in the proper order at the PAG.  After both DATA packets are accepted by the AES , verify that the AES sends a RECEIVE READY packet to the PAA. Step 3 - Clear Request Procedures from HLE Program the PAA to send a CLEAR REQUEST packet on the open channel to the AES .  Verify that the AES returns a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet to the HLE and sends a corresponding CLEAR INDICATION packet to the PAG. Use the PAG to return a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet.  Verify that there is no output on the transceiver/HLE interface. Steps 4-6 must be performed sequentially. Step 4 - Virtual Call Setup from PAG Program the PAG to send an CALL REQUEST packet to the AES.  The use of NSAP addressing is optional.  Invoke the Expedited Data Negotiation Facility in the Optional CCITT-specified DTE Facilities Field.  Use PAA to return a CALL ACCEPTED packet for the corresponding channel.  Use the PAG to verify that the AES generates the corresponding CALL CONNECTED packet with the correct fields. Step 5 - Data Transfer from the PAG Program the PAG to send two DATA packets to the AES on the open channel. Set the M-bit to zero on each of these DATA packets.   Maintain flow control for the channel, i.e. the PS Subfields for the first and second packet should be zero and one, respectively.  Use a 32-bit User Data Field, and fill the Fields with alternate one-zero patterns. Verify that the DATA packets received in the proper order at the PAA.  After both DATA packets are accepted by the AES , verify that the AES sends a RECEIVE READY packet to the PAG. Step 6 - Ground DTE Requests to Clear the Channel Program the PAG to send a CLEAR REQUEST packet on the open channel to the AES .  Verify that the AES returns a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet to the PAG and sends a corresponding CLEAR INDICATION packet to the PAA. Use the PAA to return a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet.  Verify that there is no output on the PAG interface. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Steps 7 - 12 can be performed in any order, if desired. 

## Step 7 - Hle Aborts A Call Request

Program the PAA to send a CALL REQUEST packet to the transceiver.  Use the PAG to verify that the CALL REQUEST packet is output to the ground DTE. 

Have the PAA send a CLEAR REQUEST packet for that channel to the transceiver.  Use the PAA to verify that the AES returns a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet to the HLE.  Use the PAG to verify the Clearing and Diagnostic Cause Fields in the corresponding CLEAR INDICATION packet and to return a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet.  Verify that there is no corresponding output at the transceiver/HLE interface. 

Step 8 - GES Aborts a Call Request Program the PAG to send a CALL REQUEST packet to the AES.  Use the PAA 
to verify that the CALL REQUEST packet is output from the AES.  Have the PAG send a CLEAR REQUEST packet for that channel to the transceiver.  Use the PAG to verify that the AES returns a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet to GES.  Use the PAA to verify the Clearing and Diagnostic Cause Fields in the corresponding CLEAR INDICATION packet and to return a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet.  Verify that there is no corresponding output at the PAG. 

## Step 9 - Ges Rejects A Call Request

Program the PAA to send a CALL REQUEST  Packet.  Use the PAG to verify that a CALL REQUEST packet is produced by the GES, and to return a CLEAR REQUEST packet the GES.  Verify that the GES returns a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet to the PAG.  Use the PAA to verify that the CLEAR INDICATION packet is output from AES, and to send a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet back to the GES.  Verify that there is no corresponding output to the PAG. 

## Step 10 - Hle Rejects A Call Request

Program the PAG to send a CALL REQUEST  Packet.  Use the PAA to verify that a CALL REQUEST packet is produced by the transceiver, and to return a CLEAR REQUEST packet to transceiver.  Verify that the AES returns a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet to the HLE.  Use the PAG to verify that the CLEAR INDICATION packet is output from the ground entity, and to send a CLEAR 
CONFIRMATION packet back to the AES.  Verify that there is no corresponding output to the PAA. 

Step 11 - CLEAR REQUEST packet for a Channel in the Ready State (p1) 
 
 
Program the PAA to send a CLEAR REQUEST packet to the transceiver.  Verify that the AES returns a CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet. 

Step 12 - Call Collision Program the PAG to send a CALL REQUEST packet to the AES.  Verify that the AES forwards an INCOMING CALL packet to the HLE.  Program the PAA to return a CALL REQUEST packet to the AES with the same channel number. Verify that the AES forwards a CLEAR INDICATION packet to the PAG Packet, followed by a CALL REQUEST packet to the PAG. 

 
Step 13 - Clear Channels Perform the procedures in Step 3, to clear the channels used in Step 12. At this point, there are no active communications channels. 

## 3.4.1.2 Restart Request States

 Steps 1 and 2 must be performed sequentially. Step 1 - DTE Restart Procedures Perform the procedure in 3.4.1.1, Call Setup and Clearing States, Step 1, to open two channels.  Program the PAA to send a RESTART REQUEST packet to the AES.  Verify the RESTART CONFIRMATION packet is returned from the AES to the PAA.  Use the PAG to verify that the AES sends a CLEAR INDICATION  
Packet to the GES for each channel not in the p1 State.  Program the PAG to send the corresponding CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet to the AES.  Verify that there is no corresponding output at the PAA. At this point, the channels have been cleared. Step 2 - DCE Restart Procedures Without changing the system state from that produced in Step 1, program the PAA to send a RESTART CONFIRMATION packet to the AES.  Use the PAA to verify that the AES will return a RESTART INDICATION packet to the HLE with diagnostic code set to 17.  Program the PAA to return a RESTART CONFIRMATION packet to the transceiver.  Verify that there is no corresponding output at the AES interfaces. Step 2 is a *negative* test, i.e., it assures robust operation in the face of an unexpected input during a restart operation. 

## 3.4.1.3 Reset States

 Step 1 - Reset Procedures by HLE  
 
Perform the procedure in Section 3.4.1.1, Call Setup and Clearing States, Step 1, and Step 2.  Program the PAA to send a RESET REQUEST packet on the open channel to the transceiver.  Verify that the AES returns a RESET 
CONFIRMATION packet to the HLE.  Use the PAG to verify that the RESET INDICATION packet sent from the AES contains the appropriate Resetting and Diagnostic Cause Fields.  Program the PAG to send RESET CONFIRM packet. Verify that there is no corresponding output at the transceiver/HLE interface. 

## Step 2 - Reserved

Program the PAA to send a CALL REQUEST packet to the AES.  Fill the Facilities Field with the following facilities: Calling Address Extension Facility, and Called Address Extension Facility.  Use the PAG to verify that the AES 
transmits a corresponding CALL INDICATION packet to the PAG, and that the NSAP addresses have been transparently transferred. 

Step 2 - Call Accept from the PAG 
Program the PAG to return a CALL ACCEPTED packet to the AES without the Responding NSAP Address Field from the request in Step 1.  Use the PAA to verify that the AES transmits the corresponding CALL CONNECTED packet with the same called NSAP address that was in the original CALL REQUEST packet. 

Step 3 - CALL REQUEST from PAG 
Program the PAG to send a CALL REQUEST packet to the AES.  Fill the Facilities Field with the following facilities: Calling Address Extension Facility, and Called Address Extension Facility.  Use the PAA to verify that the AES outputs a corresponding CALL INDICATION packet to its HLE, and that the NSAP addresses have been transparently transferred. 

Step 4- Clear Request Procedures This test clears the open channel.  Program the PAA to send a CLEAR REQUEST packet to the AES.  Use the PAG to verify that the AES transmits the corresponding CLEAR INDICATION packet to the PAG.  Use the PAG to return the corresponding CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet to the AES.  Verify the corresponding CLEAR CONFIRMATION packet. 

Step 5 - CALL ACCEPT from PAA Program the PAA to return a CALL ACCEPTED packet to the AES without the Responding NSAP Address Field from the request in Step 1.  Use the PAG to verify that the AES transmits the corresponding CALL CONNECTED packet to the PAG with the same called NSAP address that was in the original CALL REQUEST packet. 

Step 6 - Clear Request Repeat Step 3 to clear the open channel. 

## Step 7 - Call Accept From Paa - (Different Nsaps)

Repeat Step 4.  Program the PAA to return a CALL ACCEPTED packet to the AES with a Responding NSAP Address Field that is different than the the request in Step 3.  Use the PAG to verify that the AES transmits the corresponding CALL CONNECTED packet to the PAG with the same called NSAP address generated by the PAA.

## 4 Test Equipment 4.1 Standard Test Equipment 4.2 Special Test Equipment

Protocol Analyzer (Air) - this device consists of a computer capable of bidirectional communications with the AES under test by means of one of the provided digital data bus formats.  The Protocol Analyzer (Air) (PAA) shall be capable of acting as an ISO-8208/ANSI X.25 Data Transmitting Equipment (DTE).  The PAA shall permit user control of data content and message timing for transmitted messages, and shall permit user examination of incoming and outgoing messages on both octet and message levels. 

Protocol Analyzer (Ground) -- this device consists of a computer capable of bidirectional data communications with the GES by means of one of the GES-
supported digital data bus formats (e.g. X.25).  The Protocol Analyzer (Ground) (PAG) shall be capable of acting as an ISO-8208/ANSI X.25 Data Transmitting Equipment (DTE).  The PAA shall permit user control of data content and message timing for transmitted messages, and shall permit user examination of incoming and outgoing messages on both an octet and an message level. Data Generation Unit -- A *transceiver test controller* may be required to initiate or induce the AES to a certain state, or to initialize a certain condition.  It is permissible for the transceiver test controller to use existing AES interfaces for this purpose. 

## 4.3 Test Configuration

The  requirements established by this appendix concern the implementation of an ISO-8208 compatible Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE) interface on the digital side of the AES .  To verify the proper functionality of that interface, it is necessary to issue certain commands and analyze certain responses from both a simulated Data Terminal  Equipment (DTE) external to the AES and from a corresponding simulated DTE external to the GES.  One means of verifying compliance would be to probe the radio-frequency emissions of the AES , back out the satellite-network signal-in-space, Layer 1 and Layer 2 and possible Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocols, and confirm transmission of the proper DCE-DCE message traffic.  This approach requires the ability to simulate the signal processing of the entire satellite network, including its ground terminals and gateways to the public and private networks.  This is a complex and expensive process. The same information can be obtained, however, by using the satellite network directly, and examining the data at the output of the GES.  The potential exists to remotely access this information so that the entire testing is performed in a closed loop from a single location, as shown in Figure 5. 

Note:  Use of the Active Satellite Sub-Network for performance testing is subject to the restrictions identified in Section 2.4.2.1.2.2 of the MOPS.

## Appendix C - Recommended Standards Fo Amss Equipment Not Providing Ams(R)S

This appendix provides guidance on the tailoring of the MOPS requirements for AMSS equipment that does not provide AMS(R)S. For such equipment, which supports only non-safety data and/or voice communications, many of the needs for interoperability features specified in the MOP no longer exist.  However, the provision of AMS(R)S by terminals operating within the same satellite subnetwork, and the necessity of protecting other CNS systems on-board the same aircraft and within the same airspace make it desirable that all AMSS equipment be held to a subset of the minimum standards established for AMS(R)S. 

Table C-1 provides a cross-reference to the paragraphs of the MOPS body and an indication of what specific paragraphs should apply to a non-safety AMSS system.  Paragraphs have been listed to the sixth level of indenture.  In general, lower-level paragraphs have been deleted for brevity.  In the case where a higherlevel requirement does not apply to non-safety AMSS, then it can be assumed that no lower-level unlisted requirements apply.  In cases where lower-level requirements may or may not apply, the table has been expanded to a depth consistent with clearly identifying which requirements should be met by nonsafety AMSS equipment. 

To the extent that a requirements sub-paragraph of Section 2.2 applies, the associated verification paragraph(s) of Section 2.3 and 2.4 apply as well.   
Manufacturers of non-safety AMSS equipment using NGSS technologies are urged to consider all of the antenna (Section 2.2.2.1), transmitter (Section 2.2.2.1.1) and receiver (Section 2.2.2.1.2) requirements as guidance in their design.

## Appendix D Normative Requirements For Iridium Ams(R)S Equipment 1 Introduction 1.1 Scope And Objectives

This normative appendix provides Iridium-specific technical requirements and information regarding the technical characteristics of an Aircraft Earth Station (AES) operating over the Iridium satellite network for the purpose of providing Aeronautical Mobile Satellite (Route) Service or AMS(R)S.  The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Telecommunications Union (ITU) reserve the designation "(Route)" for services related to the "safety and regularity of flight along national and international air routes." This normative appendix has been developed in accordance with RTCA DO-262 as a techniquespecific attachment to an application for certification or other approval document.  This appendix covers Iridium Satellite avionics requirements and tests for the AES only, including the Iridium transceiver and auxiliary equipment and the associated antenna.  As required by DO-262, this appendix contains both detailed requirements and test procedures.  Compliance with these requirements and test procedures is intended to provide one means of providing evidence for certification or other approval for Iridium AMS(R)S services.  Alternative means of compliance that provide equivalent information are acceptable. 

The focus in this document is on ensuring correct behavior of the AES at the services interfaces, where the user avionics interact with the AES, and at the signals-in-space interface, where the AES has desired interaction with the network, and potentially undesired interaction with other aircraft systems and the outside world. 

## 1.1.1 Document Overview

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Section 1 of this normative appendix provides an informative description of the Iridium Satellite network, focusing on those aspects particular to AMS(R)S.  Definitions and assumptions essential to proper understanding of this normative appendix are provided in this Section, while a more extensive glossary can be found in Appendix A of the DO-262 MOPS main document.  Section 1 
is intended to be informative in nature and contains no requirements applicable to the avionics equipment covered in this normative appendix. The remaining sections contain normative information regarding technique or technology-specific requirements that are unique to the Iridium Satellite network.  These sections are organized based on the numbering and format of the DO-262 MOPS.  
Section 2 contains minimum performance standards that specify the required performance under standard operating and environmental conditions and provides values which quantify requirements specific to Iridium AMS(R)S. 

Section 3 describes the performance required of installed Iridium aircraft avionics equipment. Tests specifically for installed Iridium equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. Section 4 describes the operational performance characteristics for Iridium equipment installations and for network operation, and defines conditions that will assure the Iridium equipment user that operations can be conducted safely and reliably in the expected operational environment.   

## 1.1.2 Iridium As A Commercial Service

Iridium is a commercially operated telephony and data communications system operated by Iridium Satellite LLC (ISLLC).  Some aspects of the system design and service offerings have been specifically modified to support AMS(R)S data and voice communications, while other aspects of the system design are common with the standard commercial service offerings.  A 
 
Technical Manual for Iridium AMS(R)S was approved by ICAO in November 2007.  A description of the Iridium network is contained in Section 1.2 et seq. 

## 1.1.3 Applicable Documents

Detailed descriptions of some portions of the design and operation of Iridium AMS(R)S are contained in proprietary company documents referenced in this normative appendix.  The following list summarizes documents referenced in this normative appendix:

## 1.2 Iridium Satellite Network 1.2.1 Overview

Iridium Satellite Network, with its constellation of 66 low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, is a global mobile satellite communication network, with complete coverage of the entire Earth, including polar regions, offering voice and data service to and from remote areas. Iridium data services include Circuit-Switched Data with a throughput rate of up to 2.4 Kbps, Router-Based Unrestricted Digital Interworking Connectivity Solution (RUDICS), and Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD) service. Iridium Satellite operates its Satellite Network Operations Center (SNOC) in Virginia, USA. 

Gateways for Iridium are in Arizona and Hawaii, USA.  Telemetry, Tracking, and Control 
(TTAC) facilities are located in Arizona and Alaska, USA; Yellowknife and Iqaluit, Canada; and Svalbard, Norway, with backup facilities located around the globe. ISLLC has contracted The Boeing Company to operate and maintain its satellite constellation. The Iridium constellation, gateway facilities, testing and development laboratories, TTAC facilities, as well as overall network and system health, are continuously monitored.  ISLLC 
manufactures its subscriber equipment, satellite handsets, L-band3 Transceivers (LBT) 95xx, and Short Burst Data (SBD)-only Transceivers 96xx. The LBT and SBD devices are installed in the Iridium SATCOM Data Units (SDUs). 

Multiple tests and analyses have demonstrated satellite constellation longevity to provide service through the transition plan of the next generation constellation.   Plans are underway for manufacture and launch of the next generation constellation starting in 2015 with completion planned for full operation by 2017. Continuity of service is core part of the satellite transition with fully backward compatibility.   

## 1.2.2 International Telecommunication Union (Itu) Frequency Assignment

The Iridium network uses radio frequency assignments that have been coordinated and notified in accordance with the provisions of the Radio Regulations under the aegis of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). ITU RR5.367 states that AMS(R)S can be provided on a primary basis after completion of coordination under RR9.21. At this time, coordination required under RR9.21 for AMS(R)S on a primary basis pursuant to RR5.367 is completed except for 8 countries.    

## 1.2.3 System Architecture

The Iridium Satellite Network is a satellite-based, wireless personal communications network, based on Global System for Mobile Communications standard (GSM), providing voice and data services to virtually any destination on earth. 

 
The Iridium communication system comprises three principal components: the satellite network, the ground network and the Iridium subscriber products.  The design of the Iridium network allows voice and data to be routed virtually anywhere in the world.  Voice and data calls originated by a terrestrial user to an aircraft AES are relayed from the Gateway (GES) to the satellite communicating directly with the  Gateway through a series of satellites until the call is received at the Aircraft Earth Station (AES), which includes the Iridium transceiver.  For aircraft to ground communications, the system functions in the reverse. 

The key elements of the Iridium communication system are illustrated in Figure 1-1. 


## 1.2.4 Space Segment

The Iridium space segment utilizes a constellation of 66 operational satellites in low-Earth orbit, as shown in Figure 1-2.  The satellites are located in six distinct planes in near-polar orbit at an altitude of approximately 780 km and circle the Earth approximately once every 100 minutes, travelling at a rate of roughly 27,088 km/h.  The 11 mission satellites within each plane are spaced approximately every 32.7 degrees and perform as nodes in the communications network.  
Satellite positions in adjacent odd and even numbered planes are offset from each other by onehalf of the satellite spacing.  This constellation ensures that every region on the globe is covered by at least one satellite at all times.  As of July 2008 there were 10 additional satellites in-orbit spares ready to replace any unserviceable satellite in case of a failure. 

Each satellite communicates with the AES, which includes the SDUs, through tightly focused antenna beams that form a continuous pattern on the Earth's surface.  Each satellite uses three phased-array antennas for the user links, each of which contains an array of transmit/receive modules.  The phased-array antennas of each satellite create 48 spot beams arranged in the configuration shown in Figure 1-3 covering a circular area with a diameter of approximately 
4,700 km.  These arrays are designed to provide user-link service by communicating within the 
1616-1626.5 MHz band.  
The near-polar orbits of Iridium satellites (commonly referred to as space vehicles or satellites) cause the satellites to be closer together as the sub-satellite latitude increases, as illustrated in Figure 1-2.  This orbital motion, in turn, causes the coverage of neighbouring satellites to increasingly overlap as the satellites approach the poles.  A consistent sharing of load among satellites is maintained at high latitudes by selectively deactivating outer-ring spot beams in each satellite.  This beam control also results in reduced inter-satellite interference and increased availability in high latitudes due to overlapping coverage. 

The Iridium Satellite Network architecture incorporates certain characteristics which allow the Space Segment communications link with subscriber equipment to be transferred from beam to beam and from satellite to satellite as such satellites move over the area where the subscriber is located.  This transfer is transparent to the user, even during real-time communications. 

Each satellite has four cross-link antennas to allow it to communicate with and route traffic to the two satellites that are fore and aft of it in the same orbital plane, as well as to neighbouring satellites in the adjacent co-rotating orbital planes.  These inter-satellite links operate at approximately 23 GHz.  Inter-satellite networking is a significant technical feature of the Iridium Satellite Network that enhances system reliability and capacity and reduces the number of gateways or Ground Earth Stations (GESs) required to provide global coverage to one with redundant back-up switch, processors and an earth terminal station which is physically separated from the primary GES.

1.2.5 
Terrestrial Segment The terrestrial segment is comprised of the System Control Segment and Iridium Gateways that connect into the terrestrial telephone/data network.  
The System Control Segment is the central management component for the Iridium system.  It provides global operational support and control services for the satellite constellation, delivers satellite-tracking data to the Iridium Gateways, and performs the termination control function of messaging services. The System Control Segment consists of three main components: five TTAC sites, the Operational Support Network (OSN), and the SNOC.  The primary linkage between the System Control Segment, the satellites, and the gateways is via control feeder links and inter-satellite cross-links throughout the satellite constellation.  
The Iridium Gateway provides call processing and control activities such as subscriber validation and access control for all calls.  The gateway connects the Iridium satellite network to ground communication networks, such as the terrestrial Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs) and Public Switched Data Networks (PSDNs), and communicates via ground-based antennas with the gateway feeder-link antennas on the satellite.  The gateway can also serve as a gateway to the aeronautical telecommunication network (ATN) for forwarding ATN messages from the aircraft to the required Air Traffic Command (ATC) or Aircraft Operational Communication (AOC) unit or vice versa.  The gateway includes a subscriber database used in call processing activities such as subscriber validation, keeps a record of all traffic, and generates call detail records used in billing. 

## 1.2.6 Channel Classifications

Each Iridium communications channel consists of a time-slot and a carrier frequency.  Channels provided by the system can be divided into two broad categories: system overhead channels and bearer service channels.  Bearer service channels include traffic channels and messaging channels, while system overhead channels include ring alert channels, Broadcast Channels, acquisition and synchronization channels.  A specific time-slot-and-frequency combination may be used for several types of channels, depending on what specific activity is appropriate at each instant.  Each time-slot-and-frequency combination is only used for one purpose at a time.  Figure 
1-4 illustrates the hierarchy of Iridium channel types.  Iridium aeronautical services utilize only the indicated channel types.  
In the discussions that follow, the term "channel" will always refer to a time-slot-and-frequency combination. The terms "frequency" or "frequency access" will denote the specific radio frequency of an individual channel. 

## 1.2.6.1 Overhead Channels The Iridium Satellite Network Has Four Overhead Channels: 1) Ring Channel; 2) Broadcast Channel; 3) Acquisition Channel; And 4) Synchronization Channel.

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The Ring Channel is a downlink-only channel used to send ring alert messages to individual subscriber units.  Its downlink frequency is globally assigned in order to be the same known frequency throughout the world.  The Ring Channel uses a time division format to send ring alert messages to multiple subscriber units in a single frame. Broadcast Channels are downlink channels used to support the acquisition and handoff processes. These channels provide frequency, timing, and system information to SDUs before they attempt to transmit an acquisition request.  In addition, Broadcast Channels provide downlink messages which acknowledge acquisition requests and make channel assignments.  Finally, Broadcast Channels are used to implement selective acquisition blocking to prevent local system overloads. 

Acquisition channels are uplink-only channels used by individual subscriber equipment to transmit an acquisition request.  These channels use a slotted ALOHA random access process. The time and frequency error tolerances are larger for an Acquisition Channel to allow for initial 
 
frequency and timing uncertainties.  SDUs determine which Acquisition Channels are active by monitoring the Broadcast Channel. The Synchronization Channel is a duplex channel used by the SDU to achieve final synchronization with a satellite before it begins traffic channel operation.  The Synchronization Channel occupies the same physical channel time slots and frequency accesses as the traffic channel that the SDU will occupy when the synch process is complete.  During the synch process, the satellite measures the differential time of arrival (DTOA) and differential frequency of arrival (DFOA) of the uplink synch burst and sends correction information to the SDU in the downlink synch burst.  A synchronization channel is assigned to an SDU by the satellite.  The synchronization procedure is accomplished by the SDU transmitting an uplink burst which the satellite measures for time and frequency error relative to the assigned channel.  The satellite sends time and frequency corrections for the latest uplink burst over the downlink channel.  This process is repeated until the satellite determines that both the SDU transmit time and frequency are within the tolerance for a traffic channel.  When this occurs, the satellite transmits a message to that effect to the SDU and reconfigures the channel for traffic channel operation. 

1.2.6.2 Bearer Service Channels The Iridium subscriber link provides two basic types of bearer service channels: traffic channels and messaging channels. Messaging channels support downlink only simplex messaging service.  This service carries numeric and alphanumeric messages to Message Termination Devices. Traffic channels support duplex services which include portable mobile telephony and a variety of duplex bearer data services.  Each traffic channel consists of an associated uplink and downlink channel.  A duplex user has exclusive use of the assigned channels until service terminates or until handed off to a different channel.  

## 1.2.7 Channel Multiplexing

Channels are implemented in the Iridium Satellite Network using a hybrid Time Division Multiple Access/Frequency Division Multiple Access (TDMA/FDMA) architecture based on Time Division Duplex (TDD) using a 90 millisecond frame.  Channels are reused in different geographic locations by implementing acceptable co-channel interference constraints.  A channel assignment comprises both a frequency carrier and time slot.  
1.2.7.1 TDMA Frame Structure The fundamental unit of the TDMA channel is a time-slot.  Time-slots are organized into TDMA 
frames as illustrated in Figure 1-5.  The frame consists of a 20.32 millisecond downlink simplex time-slot, followed by four 8.28 millisecond uplink time-slots and four downlink time-slots, which provide the duplex channel capability.  The TDMA frame also includes various guard times to allow hardware set up and to provide tolerance for uplink channel operations. 

The simplex time-slot supports the downlink-only, ring and messaging channels.  The Acquisition, Synchronization, and Traffic channels use the uplink time-slots.  The Broadcast, Synchronization, and Traffic channels use the downlink duplex time-slots. There are 2250 symbols per TDMA frame at a channel burst modulation rate of 25 Kilosymbolsper-second (25 ksps).  A 2400 bps traffic channel uses one uplink and one downlink time-slot per frame. 

 
1.2.7.2 FDMA Frequency Plan The fundamental unit of frequency in the FDMA structure is a frequency access that occupies a 41.667 kHz bandwidth.  Each channel uses one frequency access.  The frequency accesses are divided into the duplex channel band and the simplex channel band.  The duplex channel band is further divided into sub-bands. 

1.2.7.3 Duplex Channel Band The frequency accesses used for duplex channels are organized into sub-bands, each of which contains eight frequency accesses.  Each sub-band, therefore, occupies 333.333 kHz (8 x 41.667 kHz).  In duplex operation, the Iridium Satellite Network is capable of operating with up to 30 
sub-bands, containing a total of 240 frequency accesses.  Table 1-1 shows the band edges for each of the 30 sub-bands.  Iridium's current band usage includes sub-bands 8-30.

The Iridium Satellite Network reuses duplex channels from beam to beam when sufficient spatial isolation exists to avoid interference.  Channel assignments are restricted so that interference is limited to acceptable levels.  A reuse pair is the minimum group of duplex channels that can be assigned to an antenna beam.   A reuse unit pair consists of an uplink reuse unit and a downlink reuse unit.   A reuse unit consists of one time-slot and the eight contiguous frequency accesses of a sub-band for a total of eight channels.  The frequency accesses are numbered 1 through 8 from lowest to highest frequency.  
Table 1-2 lists the lower, upper and center frequencies for each of the 8 frequency accesses within a reuse unit.  These frequencies are relative to the lower edge of the sub-band defined in Table 1-
1. Reuse unit pairs can be assigned to a beam, reassigned or activated/deactivated at the beginning of each TDMA frame.  Dynamic beam assignment and reclassification are used to provide additional capacity to beams that have heavy traffic loading.

1.2.7.4 Simplex Channel Band A 12-frequency access band is reserved for the simplex (ring alert and messaging) channels. These channels are located in a globally allocated 500 kHz band between 1626.0 MHz and 1626.5 MHz.  These frequency accesses are only used for downlink signals and they are the only frequencies that may be transmitted during the simplex time-slot.  As shown in Table 1-3, four messaging channels and one ring alert channel are available during the simplex time-slot.

## 1.2.8 L-Band (1616-1626.5 Mhz) Transmission Characteristics

1.2.8.1 Signal Format All L-Band uplink and downlink transmissions used in the Iridium Satellite Network employ variations of 25 ksps quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation and are implemented with 40% square root raised cosine pulse shaping.  The variations of QPSK used include differential encoding (DE-QPSK) and binary phase shift keying (BPSK), which is treated as a special case of QPSK.  Figure 1-6 illustrates the relevant FDMA frequency characteristics. 

 
 
The modulation structure used for the uplink and downlink traffic data includes differential encoding to allow demodulators to rapidly reacquire phase and resolve phase ambiguities in case there is a momentary loss of phase-lock due to a link fade.  
Downlink traffic, broadcast, synchronization, ring alert, and messaging channels all use DE- QPSK modulation with 40% square root raised cosine pulse shaping.  In all cases, the burst transmission rate is 25 ksps and provides a burst data rate of 50 kilobits-per-second (kbps). Uplink traffic channels use DE-QPSK modulation with 40% square root raised cosine pulse shaping and burst transmission rates of 25 ksps, or 50 kbps. Uplink acquisition and synchronization channels both use DE-BPSK with 40% square root raised cosine pulse shaping and burst transmission rates of 25 ksps, or 25 kbps.  BPSK is used because it provides a 3 dB link advantage, which improves the burst acquisition probability. Certain, control, and traffic applications implement error correction coding to improve the link bit error rate, with characteristics tailored for certain traffic and signalling message applications.  The vocoder algorithm provides its own interleaving and forward error correction. Most of the administrative transmissions used in granting access to and exerting control of the link implement their own internal error correction and interleaving.  
The link protocol does not provide forward error correction to user generated data transmitted in the payload.  Such data is protected from transmission errors by a 24-bit Frame Check Sequence 
(FCS) transmitted in every traffic burst containing a data payload (as opposed to a voice payload). If the FCS does not validate that the payload data was correctly received, the L-Band Protocol implements error by retransmission of the Iridium frame.  Erroneous information, i.e., payload data that does not satisfy the Frame Check Sequence, is not passed to the end user. Therefore, a decrease in channel quality which causes any increase in channel bit-error-rate results in an increase in the number of retransmissions and a corresponding decrease in the number of usergenerated bits provided to the end user.  Iridium circuit-switched data service has been designed to provide a minimum throughput of 2400 bps user generated information. Traffic channels operate with adaptive power control, discussed below, which acts to limit power transmissions beyond what is required for appropriate voice and data quality. 

1.2.8.2 Power Control The L-Band link has been designed for a threshold channel bit error of 0.02, which is sufficient to support voice services and data services. Note this does not include any Forward Error Control (FEC) or other methods that are employed in the network.  This level is achieved at an Eb/(No+Io) of 6.1 dB in clear line of sight conditions.  When used with a standard Iridium handset, the basic Iridium Satellite Network will operate with a link margin of 15.5 dB above this level with respect to an average received signal level.  This margin is required to mitigate fading due to the Rayleigh multipath and shadowing typical of handheld phone operation in urban environments.  This margin is available on a statistical basis based on the underlying Rayleigh statistics.  Under good channel conditions, this level is reduced by adaptive power control.  Even under adaptive power control, the link margin is maintained to mitigate fades that are too short in duration to be compensated by the power control loop. In the aeronautical environment, the fading statistics are Rician and the spread of possible received signal levels is less.  Iridium has agreed to make some of the Rayleigh statistical margin available to meet the needs of aeronautical installations for the AES2 type of terminal in use.  In effect, this increases the average demand on the satellite transmitter power necessary to support aeronautical users by a factor of two with respect to the aggregate average power demand for handheld users.  The remainder of the handheld margin is required to meet the statistical variations of Rician aeronautical environment.  The transmitter power and receiver sensitivity requirements of this document are based on this 3 dB installation loss allowance, except as specifically noted in the accompanying explanatory notes. The Class AES1 and AES3 operate at Iridium Network Nominal levels. Adaptive power control uses a closed loop algorithm in which the space vehicle and AES receivers measure the received energy per bit per noise power spectral density (Eb/No) and 
 
command the transmitters to adjust their transmitted power to the minimum value necessary to maintain high link quality.  When the entire available link margin is not required to mitigate channel conditions, adaptive power control has the effect of reducing system power consumption. There are slight differences in the power control algorithms used for voice and data operations.  
For data operations, the algorithm is biased toward higher power levels and does not use adaptive power control, hence ensuring low channel bit error rates and high user throughput. 

## 1.2.9 Call Processing

Call processing in the Iridium Satellite Network consists of Acquisition, Access, Registration and Auto-Registration, Telephony, and Handoff.  This is managed through the Iridium ATS Network which is co-located with the Iridium Gateway location currently located in Tempe, AZ.  The Iridium ATS Network manages all aspects of acquisition, access, registration, telephony and Handoff.  See Iridium Reference G - "Iridium ATS Operator Guide". 

1.2.9.1 Acquisition Acquisition is the first step in obtaining service from the Iridium Satellite Network.  It is the process of establishing a communication link between a satellite and the SDU.  Acquisition by an SDU is necessary for registration, call setup, answering call terminations, or to initiate any service on the Iridium Satellite Network. 

To enter the Iridium Satellite Network, a subscriber unit must go through an Acquisition sequence. The first steps in Acquisition are to achieve frame timing alignment, determine the correct downlink time slot, and detect the Doppler shift of the received signal.  Then the SDU 
must pre-correct the transmitted signal so the received signal, at the satellite, arrives during the correct receive time window and has, at most, a small Doppler offset. To acquire the system, an SDU turns on its receiver and acquires the satellite Broadcast Channel transmission for the beam in which the SDU is located.  The Ring Channel includes the broadcast time/frequency for each beam, and the SDU can use this to determine which channel to use.  The decoded satellite broadcast (Broadcast Acquisition Information message) indicates to the SDU if Acquisition is permitted; this is done via the Acquisition Class control.  Acquisition denial might occur as a result of network capacity or some other system constraints.  If the network permits Acquisition, the SDU extracts the beam ID and selects a random Acquisition Channel. The SDU estimates Doppler offset and predicts uplink timing based on beam ID.  It pre-corrects its timing and frequency and then transmits a ranging burst (Acquisition Request message) to the satellite on the Acquisition Channel.  Upon receipt of the Acquisition Request message from the SDU, the satellite calculates the time and frequency error of the received signal.  It then sends a Channel Assignment message to the SDU along with time and frequency corrections. After each transmission on the uplink Acquisition Channel, the SDU decodes the Broadcast Channel and checks for an acknowledgment of its request (Channel Assignment message) and makes sure its acquisition class is still allowed on the system.  Receiving no acknowledgment after a request, the SDU repeats its request after a random time interval (Slotted Aloha) and on a random Acquisition Channel.  This minimizes the number of collisions between the acquiring SDU and other SDUs attempting to use the Acquisition Channel. The SDU, upon receiving the Channel Assignment message, immediately transitions to the new Sync Channel and acknowledges the change by sending a Sync Check message to the satellite. The satellite measures the time and frequency offset error of the received burst and responds with a Sync Report message.  The Sync Report message contains a Sync Status information element. The satellite will set Sync Status to "Sync OK" if the time and frequency errors are within the tolerance for Traffic Channel operation.  If the satellite sends a Repeat Burst in the Sync Status information element, the SDU adjusts its timing and frequency and retransmits a Sync Check message.  If the satellite sends "Sync OK" in the Sync Report message, the SDU acknowledges 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
by sending a Sync Check message and waits for a Sync/Traffic Switch message from the satellite. Upon receipt of the Sync/Traffic Switch message, the SDU exits the Acquisition process and initiates the Access process.  The satellite then switches the Sync Channel to a Traffic Channel. 

1.2.9.1.1 Acquisition Control Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to prevent users from making Acquisition attempts.  Such situations may arise during states of emergency or in the event of a beam overload.  During such times, the Broadcast Channel specifies, according to populations, which SDUs may attempt Acquisition.  All subscribers are members of one out of ten randomly allocated populations, referred to as Acquisition Class 0 to 9.  The subscriber equipment reads the Acquisition Class from the SIM card that was programmed when it was initially provisioned. In addition, subscribers may be members of one or more special categories (Acquisition Class 11 to 15), also held in the SDU.  The system provides the capability to control a user's acquisition to the system based on the following acquisition classes:  

15. ISLLC Use 14. Aeronautical Safety Service 13. Reserved 12. Reserved 11. Fire, Police, Rescue Agencies 10. Emergency Calls 0-9. Regular Subscribers (randomly allocated) 
The use of acquisition classes allows the network operator to prevent overload of the acquisition or traffic channels.  Any number of these classes may be barred from attempting Acquisition at any one time.  If the subscriber is a member of at least one Acquisition Class that corresponds to a permitted class, the SDU proceeds with Acquisition. 

1.2.9.2 Access The Access process determines the SDUs location with respect to Service Control Areas defined in earth fixed coordinates.  Based on the Service Control Area within which the SDU is found to be located and on the identity of the SDUs service provider, a decision is made regarding whether or not to allow service, and which gateway should provide that service. The process is initiated immediately following Acquisition. Location information may be reported by the SDU based on an external source such as an aircraft navigation system, or it may be determined by the Geolocation function contained within the Access function.  
1.2.9.3 Registration and Auto-Registration Registration is the process of the SDU communicating its location to the system, and requires the prior completion of Acquisition and Access.  The registration process allows the network to maintain an estimate of the location of roaming users as part of mobility management.  This location estimate is required to allow the network to notify the subscriber when an incoming call is available (i.e., 'ring' an SDU for a mobile terminated call).  The SDU must be registered in the gateway serving its location to initiate or terminate a call.  An SDU registration occurs for one of five reasons: 

1.
The SDU presently contains an invalid Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identification (TMSI) or Location Area Identity (LAI)
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

2.
The TMSI presently assigned to an SDU expires
 
3. A call termination or origination is performed and, based on the new location, the SDU is 
told to re-register by the system 
4. A mobile subscriber initiates a manual SDU registration procedure 
5. The SDUs present location exceeds the re-registration distance from the point of its last 
registration. 
The procedures used for SDU registration (Location Update) after acquisition and access are GSM procedures. Auto-registration refers to the capability of an SDU to re-register with the network only on an asneeded basis. The SDU will automatically re-register with the system when it knows its current location exceeds a specified distance from the point it last registered.  In order to make this decision, the SDU passively estimates both its location and its positional error, based upon information gathered from the Ring Channel of the passing satellites. 

1.2.9.4 Telephony Telephony is the process of establishing a connection between two telephone users and releasing the connection at the end of the call.  For mobile terminated calls, Telephony also includes the process of alerting a user of an incoming call. 

Functions supporting Telephony are distributed between the SDU, satellite and gateway components.  The functions are partitioned to group similar procedures together.  The SDU supports a set of protocols used to communicate among the components of the system.  In order to reduce the complexity of individual components, the protocols are partitioned to group similar functionality together.  The partition is shown in Figure 1-7 below. 

Five protocol partitions are supported by the SDU: 

1. Call Control (CC) 2. Mobility Management (MM) 3. L-Band Link (LL) 
4. L-Band Physical (LBP) 

## 5. Associated Control Channel, L-Band (Acchl)

Call Control - The CC partition is equivalent to Call Control in the GSM standard.  This includes Mobile Switching Center to Mobile Subscriber (MSC-MS) signalling in the GSM 
Mobile Radio Interface CC sub-layer and associated procedures and the general Telephony Call Control capabilities included in a standard GSM switching subsystem. Mobility Management - The MM partition is equivalent to Mobility Management in GSM.  
This includes the MSC-MS signalling in the GSM Mobile Radio Interface MM sub-layer and associated procedures, along with the portions of Mobile Application Part that support it. L-Band Link - The LL control provides the functionality to control and monitor the air channels, determine access privileges, update system programmable data, and establish and release connections. LL is responsible for the Call Processing-related signalling associated with Mobile origination or termination and provides for the signalling procedures associated with the Access portion of the Iridium Network.  Additionally, LL controls the real-time aspects of radio resource management on the L-band link, such as the allocation and maintenance of L-
band resources and handoff procedures. 

L-Band Physical - LBP represents the control interface that exists between the satellite and the SDU.  The primary distinguishing characteristic of LBP is that unlike ACCHL, the delivery of messages is not guaranteed.  Examples of messages carried in this manner are ring alerts, directed messaging, Broadcast Channel messages, handoff candidates, handoff candidate lists, and Doppler/timing/power control corrections. Associated Control Channel, L-Band - The ACCHL transmission protocol is used by all entities that need to (reliably) send data via the L-Band traffic channel burst between the satellite and the SDU.  The ACCHL protocol permits sharing the traffic channel burst with other protocols.  The ACCHL Logical Channel is bi-directional and uses portions of the uplink and downlink Traffic Channel, Link Control Word and the Payload Field between the satellite and the SDU.  The Traffic Channel is described in the next section.  The ACCHL protocol will transport variable size messages on the ACCHL Logical Channel and is used to guarantee the delivery of messages between the satellite and the SDU.  It relies on LBP only in that LBP arbitrates the access to the physical layer when there is contention for the Physical Layer resources.

1.2.9.5 Handoff The Iridium satellites, in low earth polar orbit, have highly directional antennas providing Iridium system access to SDUs.  These antennas are configured to project multiple beams onto the surface of the earth.  The beams move rapidly with respect to SDUs and with respect to other satellites.  
Handoff, the process of automatically transferring a call in progress from one beam to another (or sometimes within a beam) to avoid adverse effects of either user or satellite movement in this highly mobile environment, is required in three situations.  First, an SDU must be handed off between satellites as they move relative to the SDU (Inter-satellite). 

Second, an SDU must be handed off between beams on a satellite as beam patterns move relative to the SDU (Intra-satellite).  Last, an SDU must be handed off to another channel within a beam for frequency management and to reduce interference (Intra-beam).  Although the Iridium system may force a handoff, handoff processing is primarily SDU initiated. As a satellite moves away (for example, moves over the horizon) and a new satellite approaches (for example, comes into view over the horizon), an SDU must transfer from the current satellite (the losing satellite) to the new satellite (the gaining satellite).  This Inter-satellite handoff, on the average, occurs approximately every five minutes during a telephone call.  It may be initiated as frequently as five seconds or as long as 10 minutes, depending on link geometry. 

 
As satellites move from the equator to a pole, the actual distance between adjacent satellites decreases to a few kilometers and then increases to several thousand kilometers as the satellites again approach the equator.  To avoid radio interference, beams near the edges of a satellite's coverage field are turned off as the satellite approaches a pole and then turned on again as it approaches the equator.  Additionally, the same radio channels are never available in adjacent beams on a satellite or between nearby satellites.  Thus, as the satellite and its beams pass by, an SDU must frequently transition to a new beam.  This Intra-satellite handoff occurs approximately every 50 seconds during a call. As the inter-satellite geometry changes, radio channels must be reallocated among the beams to avoid interference. This process can cause an SDU to be handed off to a different channel in the same beam.  This is called Intra-beam handoff.  An SDU can also request an Intra-beam handoff to reduce interference.  If the Iridium system detects an allocation change coming up where it will not have enough channels to support the number of current users, the satellite will ask for volunteers to handoff into other beams so calls will not have to be dropped when the resource change takes place.  Handoffs made under these conditions are called Volunteer handoffs. Volunteer handoffs may result in one of two situations requiring handoff, namely Inter-satellite or Intra-satellite, but are initiated by the SDU (at the request of the Iridium system) rather than by the Iridium system itself. 

1.2.10 Voice and Data Traffic Channel  
Traffic channels provide two-way connections between space vehicles and subscriber equipment that support Iridium services.  These channels transport the system voice and data services along with the signalling data necessary to maintain the connection and control the services. The uplink and downlink Traffic Channels use identical burst structures.  Each burst is 8.28 ms long and contains 414 channel bits. The bursts are divided into four major data fields:  Preamble, Unique Word, Link Control Word and Payload Field.  The preamble and unique word are used in the receiving demodulator for burst acquisition.  The preamble and unique word patterns are different for the uplink and downlink. The Link Control Word provides a very low data rate signalling channel that is used to support link maintenance, the associated control channel and handoff.  The payload field furnishes the primary Traffic Channel that carries the mission data and signalling messages. 

The Link Control Word field provides a low rate signalling channel used for control of the subscriber link.  The uplink and downlink Traffic Channels use the same Link Control Word format.  The Link Control Word is used to support link maintenance, handoff and the ACK/NAK of the associated control channel transmission protocol.  The Link Control Word field is protected by FEC code. The Traffic Channel payload field provides the primary Traffic Channel. This field carries the mission data and mission control data.  This field supports a channel bit rate of 3466.67 bps.  
Typically error correction coding, error detection, and other overhead functions provide a nominal information throughput on this channel of 2400 bps. Mission data may be either vocoded voice data or data services.  For voice service, the proprietary Iridium vocoder uses FEC to achieve an optimal MOS of 2.5 to 2.7 depending on AES type (based on mean opinion score for a basic telephony voice call, where 1 is bad and 5 is toll quality).  For data service, the L-band transport employs a frame check sequence to provide essentially error free data transport service. Some Iridium data services also provide additional service specific interfaces to facilitate user access.  In summary, the Iridium communication channel appears to the end users as an efficient and reliable data transport.  

## 1.2.11 Iridium Data Services - Rudics And Sbd 1.2.11.1 Iridium Rudics Service

The Iridium RUDICS service "Iridium Router-based Unstructured Digital Information Connectivity Solution" is an enhanced gateway termination and origination capability for circuit switched data calls across the Iridium Satellite network. RUDICS offers an optimized data connection service for various end to end data applications or solutions.  
There are four key benefits of using RUDICS as part of a data solution over conventional PSTN 
circuit switched data connectivity or mobile-to-mobile data solutions: 

1.
Elimination of analog modem training time, hence faster connection establishment time.
2.
Increased call connection quality, reliability, and maximized throughput.
3.
Protocol independence.
4.
Both Mobile Originated and Mobile Terminated calls are rated at the same rate.
Remote applications use commands to control a circuit switched data capable SDU.   Figure 1-8 
illustrates the call set up process of a Mobile Originated (MO) data call.  Iridium pre-assigns RUDICS Server Number(s) to Satellite Communications Service Providers who assign and provision these numbers to customers.  The remote application dials the customer's assigned RUDICS Server Number which connects the call through a telephony switch to the RUDICS server.  Each SDU is authenticated using Calling Line Identification for the RUDICS Server Number that it dialed.  Once authenticated, the call is routed over the terrestrial connection to a customer-specified Internet Protocol (IP) address and Port.  The RUDICS service supports the follow service transport types: transport control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) encapsulation, point to point protocol (PPP), and Multi-link PPP (MLPPP). 

 
 
The Host application can make a Mobile Terminated call by opening a Telnet session to the RUDICS server. Once authenticated, a series of AT Commands are used to connect to the remote SDU and establish a circuit switched data call. Mobile Terminated access must specifically be requested at the time of the initial configuration and set up. Connectivity between the Iridium Gateway and the end user Host Server can be via a number of options, including: 

- 
Internet 
- 
Internet with Virtual Private Network 
- 
Private leased line such as: 
o Frame Relay 
o T1/E1 Leased Line 
 
Additionally, the RUDICS capability offers the capability for Multi-Link Point to Point Protocol 
(MLPPP). This is where multiple SDUs can be used to send data simultaneously and the data can be delivered in an N x 2400 bps PPP connection. 

## 1.2.11.2 Iridium Sbd Service

The Iridium Short Burst Data Service is a satellite network transport capability to transmit short data messages between (data) terminal equipment (TE) and a centralized host computing system. A Mobile Originated SBD message can be up to 1960 bytes for an AES2 or AES3 and 340 bytes for an AES1 device; a Mobile Terminated SBD message can be up to 1890 bytes for an AES2 or AES3 device and up to 270 bytes for an AES1 device.   
Figure 1-9 shows the system architecture of the Iridium SBD service while Figure 1-10 depicts the MO call set up process. The original SBD service delivers SBD messages to email addresses provisioned on the SBD Subsystem. The newer SBD service added direct IP capability allowing SBD messages to be delivered directly to IP sockets provisioned on the SBD Subsystem. For mobile terminated application, a SBD message is sent to the SBD Subsystem by the Host via the Internet or leased line. A Ring Alert is then sent by the SBD Subsystem to the addressed SDU to notify it of the arrival of a new message. The SDU then initiated a MO call to the SBD Subsystem to pull down the message. 

Since an SBD message utilizes the Iridium signaling transport (ILap) during the access phase of a circuit-switched voice call set up process, it has the benefits of additional FEC protection as well as on-the-air, off-the-air, packet delivery service. 

 
For the MT SBD cycle there is a ring cycle that wakes up the modem on the receiving side for receiving the message. This process is very straight forward by the unit auto-answering the ring for the receipt of the SBD message. 

## 1.3 Iridium Ams(R)S System

End-to-end AMS(R)S data communications are provided by several sub-networks.  Sub-networks may be classified as ground-ground (fixed), air-ground (mobile) or airborne sub-networks.  More information on ATN, including mobile sub-networks are contained in ICAO documents, Manual of Technical Provisions for the Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN) (Doc 9705) and Comprehensive Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN) Manual (Doc 9739). See also Iridium Reference G - "Iridium ATS Operator Manual". An Iridium AES will be capable of both AMS(R)S safety communications and AMSS non-safety communications.  Safety communications refer to communications for Air Traffic Services (ATS) and Aeronautical Operational Control (AOC) to the flight deck.  Non-safety communications to the cabin crew and passengers are known as Aeronautical Administrative Communications (AAC) and Aeronautical Public Correspondence (APC), respectively. To support these services, a SATCOM data unit (SDU) will be deployed and will interoperate with the Iridium global satellite communications system and existing aircraft voice and data communication systems.  In addition, a ground-based server will be deployed by Iridiumapproved) ATSP (Aeronautical Telecommunications Service Provider) for data service.  This server will provide connectivity with existing aviation terrestrial data networks, such as ARINC and SITA or other, in support of AAC, AOC, and ATC data communications.   
The three main components of the aviation safety service are as follows: 

•
Iridium Network for AMS(R)S
•
Iridium-based AES for AMS(R)S
•
Iridium Ground-based Server for AMS(R)S
There is a fourth pre-existing component of the aviation safety service - the aviation terrestrial data network.  This network has been in existence for a number of years, evolving to meet the changing needs of the aviation industry.  This network will not be described in detail but may be referenced throughout this document.  SITA or ARINC should be contacted directly for further details about the aviation network. 

End-to-end models of Iridium Aviation Safety Services for both voice and data are found in Figure 1-11 (air-to-ground voice / ground-to-air voice) and Figure 1-12 (air-to-ground data / 
ground-to-air data).  

## 1.3.1 Iridium Network For Ams(R)S

The major elements of an Iridium AMS(R)S system are the Aircraft Earth Station (AES), Iridium space segment, ground earth stations (GES) or Gateways, and the network control stations.  In addition, for data communication services, a ground-based server is required for connectivity between the Iridium satellite network and the aviation-centric data communication network.  The aviation network provides connectivity to the end user, e.g., air traffic service units, airline operations, flight departments and aviation support application services, such as meteorological information. Use of the Iridium network for air traffic services, particularly in remote areas where connectivity between the Iridium gateways and responsible air traffic service units is difficult to achieve, could be facilitated by the deployment of ground-based Iridium units.  This set up can support voice service but is not recommended for data communication services. 

## 1.3.2 Iridium-Based Aes For Ams(R)S

An AES includes all avionics on board an aircraft necessary for implementing satellite communications.  An Iridium AES includes the SDU, the antenna(s), cabling, and any required RF power amplifiers (PA/LNA).  An Iridium SDU consists of one or more Iridium LBT's 95XX and/or SBD 96XX modems which serve as radio transceivers and provide the actual modem and signal processing functions. Modem functions include Iridium satellite sub-network protocol management and modulation/demodulation of the Iridium signal.  The Iridium modem(s) allow the SDU to establish voice/data communication over the Iridium Network. The Iridium SDU, in turn, provides data and voice interfaces with other aircraft systems. See Iridium Reference B and Iridium Reference C for more information on Iridium LBT and SBD transceivers. 

Figure 1-13 to Figure 1-15 provides a generic block diagram of the AES1, AES2, and AES3 
systems described in this document.   
AES1 and AES2 utilize passive antenna(s) while AES3 requires active antennas and/or additional PA/LNA components. Configurations of AES class are identified by antenna input. An AES may have consist of a single box that has two or more antenna inputs (See Section 5.1). Each antenna input is connected to a specific AES configuration. For example, an AES with four (4) 95XX 
transceivers and two antenna inputs (two 95XX per antenna), classifies as two AES2 configurations where intermodulation testing and validation for multi-channel system must be performed. 

The points A, B, C and D as shown in Figure 1-13, Figure 1-14 and Figure 1-15 are referenced for measurements or calculations as indicated in Table 2-4.  The manufacture will measure the data at Point A for the transmit path, and calculate or measure the data at Point D for the receive path. Point D may be integrated as a test point for an AES design to allow direct measurement versus calculations. The manufacturer is responsible for mapping the data from A and D to a value at point C for each installation configuration to allow for meaningful field measurements.  
The AES shall provide adequate domain segregation to prevent the data stream from influencing the data streams used for the ACARS or priority voice functions.  Information security requirements may be found in DO-326. 

## 1.3.3 Iridium Space Segment

Information on the Iridium Satellite constellation is provided in Section 1.2.4. 

## 1.3.4 Iridium Ground-Based Server For Ams(R)S

The Iridium Ground-based Server for AMS(R)S is co-located with the main satellite gateway. 

The gateway may also be referred to as a Ground Earth Stations (GES). The GES provide appropriate interface between the space segment and the fixed voice and data networks, public switched telephone, and aviation terrestrial data networks (e.g ARINC, SITA or other).  
All voice and data calls for AMS(R)S are routed through the GES. Priority, pre-emption and call waiting are all managed by the AMS(R)S server in the GES. 

## 1.3.5 Installation Environment

1.3.5.1 Simultaneous Operation of Iridium and Inmarsat Aeronautical Services The minimum performance standards contained in this document are intended to assure proper operation of Iridium AMS(R)S on all aircraft.  This section, however, addresses operational scenarios occurring beyond that of minimum performance standards, including aircraft that desire simultaneous independent operation of both Iridium and Inmarsat AES terminals without a demonstrated means of cooperation.  Owners, operators and installers are cautioned that simultaneous independent operation of Iridium and Inmarsat AES equipment on the same aircraft has the potential to cause significant interference to all Iridium AMSS and AMS(R)S services.  
This caution applies to Inmarsat equipment that is compliant with RTCA DO-210D, including all changes, AEEC Characteristic 741, AEEC Characteristic 761, and AEEC Characteristic 781.  At 
 
the time of publication of this document, simultaneous independent operation of Iridium and Inmarsat equipment on the same aircraft had been reported in special cases.  However, no generally applicable and technically feasible means of mitigating the potential for interference could be identified. 

This caveat specifically excludes installations where Iridium and Inmarsat are intended for use in separate airspace.  For example, no special installation or other considerations are required for Iridium use in polar airspace that is outside of the Inmarsat coverage volume. 

At the time of the publication of this document, there is neither regulatory guidance nor AMS(R)S operational need to require Iridium and Inmarsat systems to work simultaneously on the same aircraft. Some operators may choose to use Iridium and Inmarsat as backup or in a nonsimultaneous mode of operation. 

1.3.5.2 Co-location of Iridium AES with GPS/GNSS Systems 
 
The ARINC 761 standard provide guidance on the required isolation between antennae of Iridium and GNSS system. Interference from the GNSS antenna to the SATCOM antenna is not regarded as a high risk. Requirements for emissions from the SATCOM terminal for GNSS compatibility are given in Sections 2.2.3.1.1.6.1, 2.2.3.1.2.1.3, and 2.2.3.1.2.1.5. The declared isolation between the AES antenna and a GNSS may differ between GNSS systems (GPS and GLONASS). See Section 2.2.3.1.1.6.1, 2.2.3.1.2.1.3, and 2.2.3.1.2.1.5 for additional details. 

## 1.3.5.3  Co-Location Of Iridium Aes With Other Iridium Satcom Systems Co-Location Of Multiple Iridium Satcom Systems May Be Achieved. Installation Guidance Is Given In Section 3.1.9

## 2 Equipment Performance Requirements And Test Procedures 2.1 General Requirements 2.1.1 Airworthiness

The design and manufacture of the equipment shall provide for an installation that does not impair the airworthiness of the aircraft. 

## 2.1.2 Intended Function

The equipment shall perform its intended function, as defined by the manufacturer, and its proper use shall not create a hazard to users of procedural airspace. 

## 2.1.3 Federal Communications Commission'S Rules

The equipment shall comply with all applicable rules of the Federal Communication Commission 
(FCC).4 

## 2.1.4 Fire Protection

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
All materials used shall be self-extinguishing except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire. 

Note: One means of showing compliance is contained in the Federal Aviation Regulations 
(FAR), Part 25, Appendix F. 

## 2.1.5 Operation Of Controls

The operation of controls intended for use during flight, in all possible combinations and sequences, shall not result in a condition detrimental to the continued performance of the equipment.  Controls shall be designed to maximize operational suitability and minimize pilot workload.  Reliance on pilot memory for operational procedures shall be minimized. 

## 2.1.6 Accessibility Of Controls

Controls that are not normally adjusted in flight shall not be readily accessible to flight personnel. Controls that are normally adjusted in flight shall be readily accessible and properly labeled as to their intended function.  The controls shall be operable with the use of only one hand. 

## 2.1.7 Effects Of Tests

The equipment shall be designed so that the application of specified test procedures shall not be detrimental to equipment performance following the application of these tests, except as specifically allowed. 

## 2.1.8 Performance In A Shared Environment

All requirements for data integrity and timing shall consider the effect of other active aircraft data links performing transfer operations in both directions at their nominal rates. 

 
It is strongly recommended that the AES receiver design take into account the existence and/or probable deployment of other mobile communications systems operating in the airspace, onboard the aircraft, or in the proximate airport environment.  Because the power flux densities (both composite and per carrier) of such systems may be very much higher than the power flux density of the desired NGSS downlink carriers, particular attention needs to be paid to the dynamic range of the AES receiver, to avoid saturation and consequent intermodulation products. At the same time, the receiver design should provide as much selectivity as possible as near to the input port as possible in the receiver down-conversion process.  Despite these precautions, it may prove infeasible to independently and simultaneously operate two NGSSs or an NGSS and an ICAO Annex 10 Chapter 4 AMS(R)S SARPs-compliant satellite communications equipment on the same aircraft. Solutions may include operating procedures or mechanisms which disable transmission from one system while the other system is being used to provide AMS(R)S. 

As described in Section 1.3.5.1, this document provides minimum performance standards for Iridium AMS(R)S which do not take into account simultaneous and independent use of Iridium equipment and equipment of another dissimilar satellite system. Table 2-1 provides a list of requirements that have been identified as applicable for same-aircraft installation of Iridium equipment with equipment of another satellite system intended for simultaneous independent use. For installations that do not intend to use dual dissimilar SATCOM systems, these requirements are considered not applicable and can be disregarded for certification purposes.

## 2.1.9 Aes Availability

Note: Appendices B and C of ICAO GOLD specify the availability for the data link capability on the aircraft as 0.999, assuming an average flight of 6 hours.  Allocating 50% of the unavailability to the AES yields an availability requirement for the AES of 0.9995. Availability = 1 - (MTTR/MTBF).  Failures (on average) occur halfway through the flight.  
The MTTR = 3 hours because failed equipment is repaired or replaced after the flight. This implies that an MTBF of 6000 hours or better is required for the AES to achieve the 

## 

0.999 availability requirement for the aircraft.  Evaluating this number at the time of MOPS testing is considered impractical.  In-service MTBF measurement and reliability management may be required, but this considered beyond the scope of this MOPS. 

## 2.2 Equipment Performance Requirements, Standard Conditions

 In the event of a conflict in requirements between the DO-262 MOPS main document and this technic-specific appendix, this technic-specific appendix shall take precedence. 

Note: This precedence is established because the technic-specific material contained in this document is, by its very nature, more up-to-date and more detailed than the DO-262 
MOPS main document.  

## 2.2.1 Avionics Subsystem Definitions And Overall Requirements

An Iridium AES shall be capable of AMS(R)S safety communications but may also support AMSS non-safety communications. Single-channel AES equipment shall support voice-only or packet-data-only or non-simultaneous voice-or-data operations.   Single-channel AES equipment will transmit on a single frequency at any given time. 

 
 
Multi-channel AES equipment shall support either voice-only or packet-data only, or a combination of simultaneous voice and packet mode data, and may support circuit mode data services. Multi-channel AES equipment may simultaneously transmit on multiple frequencies. 

The manufacturer shall declare any limitations on the combination of voice and data services supported by the equipment.  
 

Note 1: 
For the purposes of this requirement, a distinction is made between packet mode data and circuit mode data services.  Packet mode data utilizes services that operate by transferring independent packets of information over the subnetwork interface. Circuit mode data is transferred via a point-to-point connection between the local 
(airborne) and remote users.  This document places no restriction on the method used to implement either packet mode or circuit mode data.  However, because AMS(R)S circuit mode data requirements have not yet been established, the minimum 
requirement is for packet mode. 
Digitized voice shall utilize the protocol, including any forward-error-correction coding and interleaving, determined for the vocoder implementation specified in this normative appendix. 

 
Note 2: 
Digitized voice operation is expected, but not required, to utilize a circuit mode connection Further validation of the ability of AES equipment to meet the requirements in Section 2 of this attachment shall be demonstrated during ISLLC acceptance and certification testing, as outlined in Section 1.1.3 Iridium Reference D - Iridium Satellite Compliance and Test Requirements for Value Added Manufacturing (VAM) Products. The following table describes the AES class identifiers as used in this document:

2.2.1.1 AES1 Subsystem Definition 
 
The AES1 configuration is a single channel SDU that contains one SBD (96XX) transceiver for AMS(R)S data only applications.  The AES1 cannot support voice calling. A passive LGA is required for use with the AES1. The system specific parameters of an AES1 are contained in Table 2-4. See Section 5 on AES Configurations and Test Requirements. The valid combination of AES components is shown in Table 2-3. 

The testing and validation requirements for AES1 class SDU are contained in Table 5-2. 

2.2.1.2 AES2 Subsystem Definition The AES2 configuration is a single or dual channel SDU that contains one or two LBT (95XX)

An AES3 shall support a minimum of one (1) AMS(R)S voice line to a maximum of two (2) 
AMS(R)S voice lines. Depending on the design, an AES3 may also support AMS(R)S data or AMSS non-safety communication (voice and/or data) in addition to the line(s) used for AMS(R)S 
voice. 

Depending on the design of the AES3, a passive LGA omni antenna or an active (powered) antenna subsystem, such as an IGA switched beam or IGA/HGA phased steering array is required. The system specific parameters of an AES3 are contained in Table 2-4.

## 2.2.3 Detailed Requirements

2.2.3.1 AES Application Requirements This section and its subsections contain requirements for an AMS(R)S terminal and subsystem. 

Where possible, reference has been made to Reference D, Iridium Satellite Compliance and Test Requirements for Value Added Manufacturing (VAM) Products. The aim is to achieve a commonality between the requirements and test methods in this document and those required to obtain access to the Iridium network through the Iridium Compliance and Test Requirements In addition to any other requirements stated in this document, achieving Iridium Compliance and Test Requirements is a specific requirement of this MOPS. 

Note: The relevant Communication Network Provider (e.g. ARINC or SITA or other) may require additional validation of a particular AES as being fit for use on their network (e.g. ARINC 
AQP or SITA VAQ testing or other). Such validation is beyond the scope of this document and is the sole responsibility of the given Communication Network Provider. 

## 2.2.3.1.1  Antenna Notes:

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The receiver sensitivity specified herein is a bench-test requirement. When coupled with the antenna performance specified in the following subsections, and when compensated for the effective sky temperature of typical operations, this sensitivity is consistent with the Figure of Merit G/T requirements of the DO-270 MASPS.  Manufacturers are cautioned that antenna designs may degrade the achieved G/T, and that these effects must be considered in the overall system performance estimates required by the MASPS. 

 

## 2.2.3.1.1.1 Coverage Volume, Polarization And Antenna Gain

2.2.3.1.1.1.1 Coverage Volume When measured on an antenna range over a representative ground plane, the antenna shall meet its polarization, antenna gain and axial ratio requirements over a partial hemispheric volume from the minimum elevation angle ΘMIN to 90° in elevation angle relative to the horizontal and throughout 360° of azimuth. 

## 2.2.3.1.1.1.2 Polarization The Antenna Shall Be Right Hand Circularly Polarized (Per Itu-R Recommendation 573), That Is, Having A Clockwise Rotation When Viewed In The Direction Of Transmitted Signal Propagation.

2.2.3.1.1.1.3 Antenna Gain An LGA, IGA or HGA antenna  shall  maintain GMIN weighted gain over all the elevation angles and azimuth angles. The weighting factors for computing the weighted antenna gain over elevation angle can be found in Section 2.2.3.1.1.1.4 

## 2.2.3.1.1.1.4 Weighted Average Gain Coefficients To Calculate The Weighted Average Gain Of The Antenna (For Multi-Beam Antennas (Un-Weighted) Average Across The Beams)

1)
RHCP gains in dBic (from antenna measurement including connector) are converted to power gain.
2)
For each elevation angle listed in Table 2-5 below, samples are selected for the positive and
negative elevation angles from the 0, 45, 90, 135 degree azimuth cuts.
3)
These eight samples are combined using a simple (un-weighted) average.
4)
The average of the eight samples is weighted by the respective values in Table 2-5 below.
(Elevation angle in table is measured from horizon 0degrees).
5)
The resulting values are then summed over all listed elevation angles and converted back to dBic.

## 2.2.3.1.1.2 Axial Ratio See Table 2-4 For Axial Ratio Information. 2.2.3.1.1.3 Power Handling Capabilities 2.2.3.1.1.3.1 Single Carrier Units

Note: This requirement refers to the number of carriers, not necessarily the number of channels. 

For avionics designed to transmit only a single carrier, the maximum power handling capability of the AES antenna shall be sufficient to support at least one individual data or one individual voice carrier, whichever requires the higher burst output power consistent with the requirements of Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2 Maximum Individual Carrier Output.   

## 2.2.3.1.1.3.2 Multi-Carrier Units Note: This Requirement Refers To The Number Of Carriers, Not Necessarily The Number Of Channels.  This Is Applicable When Two 95Xx Or 96Xx Transceivers (Or One Of Each) Are Used With A Single Antenna Or Two 95Xx Or 96Xx Transceivers (Or One Of Each) Are Used With Two Antennas Packaged In One Radome Or Two Antennas At 1.0 M Separation Minimum.

 For avionics designed to operate simultaneously on multiple carrier frequencies, the maximum power handling capability of the AES1 and AES2 antenna shall be 20W CW. AES3 antennas need to be designed to carry the power of the N transmitters, and the resultant Peak to average ratio which is dependent on the number of carriers.  

## 2.2.3.1.1.4  Passband As A Minimum, The Antenna Shall Meet All Of Its Requirements For Transmit Frequencies Between 1616-1626 Mhz And Receive Frequencies Between 1616 And 1626.5 Mhz.

ƒTMN, ƒRMN : 1616.0 MHz   
ƒTMX, ƒRMX : 1626.0 MHz, 1626.5 MHz 
2.2.3.1.1.5 Antenna Voltage Standing Wave Ratio When measured at the transmit (and receive) RF port(s) of the antenna, the Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) shall not exceed the value VSWR as per Table 2-4, when correctly mated with the appropriate connector.  The nominal characteristic impedance shall be 50 ohms. 

2.2.3.1.1.6  Radiated Antenna Intermodulation Products The following requirements apply to AES equipment capable of operating simultaneously on multiple radio frequency carriers within the frequency band TMN
f to TMX
f
. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
2.2.3.1.1.6.1 Radiated Antenna Intermodulation Products in the GNSS Band For multi-carrier operation, when operating two unmodulated carriers, each with a power of 7 
dBW (HGA) or 7 dBW (IGA), anywhere in the antenna's declared transmit band, the antenna shall not generate intermodulation products with levels and frequencies as follows: In the frequency range 1559 to 1585 MHz, the level of the intermodulation product shall not exceed -158.5 dBW. In the frequency range 1585 to 1605 MHz, the level of the intermodulation product shall not exceed -157 dBW. Intermodulation levels should be referenced to the output port of an external 1/4-wave monopole GNSS antenna mounted on a common ground plane with the AES antenna under test. The isolation between the monopole and the AES antenna shall be 55 dB or other declared antenna isolation applicable to GPS and GLONASS respectively, or suitable compensation to the measurement shall be applied. 

Note: Additional filters maybe required to meet this requirement. 

## 2.2.3.1.1.6.2 Radiated Antenna Intermodulation In Ams(R)S Bands

Note: This requirement is only applicable under the conditions described in Section 2.1.8. 

When tested under the same conditions as in Section 2.2.3.1.1.6.1, the antenna subsystem shall not radiate harmful interference due to internally generated intermodulation products in a direction toward likely locations of antennas on the same aircraft serving other AMS(R)S systems.  For the purpose of this requirement, harmful interference is defined as an interference power level that increases the effective noise temperature of the victim AMS(R)S system by more than 6%.  In this condition, the other antenna is taken to be a quarter-wave monopole antenna matched to its load and the isolation between the AES antenna and the victim AMS(R)S antenna is taken to be 40 dB.  Relaxation for increased isolation is permitted under the same conditions as in Section 2.2.3.1.1.6.1. 

Note: Section 2.2.3.1.1.6.1 applies to specific bands but because of the specific susceptibility of satellite navigation and communication downlinks to high level interference, manufacturers are cautioned that antenna intermodulation has the potential to adversely affect terrestrial and airborne AES functions as well 
2.2.3.1.1.7 Carrier-to-Multipath Discrimination C/M When measured over a representative ground plane, the difference in decibels between the minimum antenna gain measured at the minimum declared elevation angle, MIN
Θ
, and the maximum antenna gain measured at the same angle below the horizon, shall be greater than 3 dB. 

## 2.2.3.1.1.8 Pattern Discrimination D/U Not Applicable For Leo Satellite Systems 2.2.3.1.1.9 Steered Antenna Requirements Not Applicable For Non-Steerable, Fixed Pattern Lga Antennas The Manufacturer Of An Active Iga, Hga Antenna Array System Shall Work With The Aes3 Terminal Manufacture To Implement A Steered Antenna Control System.

Note: 
1) The purpose of the antenna control system is to point the Primary TX/RX beam at the SV that is currently providing the link, and provide a Secondary RX only beam which is used to search for handoff SV. 2) IGA and HGA antennas require at least two RF paths, the primary TX/RX and an Secondary RX only (which can be an omni-directional as the search path does not need the high gain and only needs to meet Gmin for the LGA). With suitable RF design the two RX paths are allowed to be combined post TX/RX switch if needed by the terminal modem. 

2.2.3.1.1.9.1 Phase Discontinuity Not Applicable for non-steerable, fixed pattern antennas LGA.  
IGA and HGA shall meet the value of  φ
∆
 as described in Table 2-4 
 
2.2.3.1.1.9.2 Beam Switching Time Not Applicable for non-steerable, fixed pattern antennas LGA.  
IGA and HGA shall meet the value of  
SW
τ
 as described in Table 2-4 
 
2.2.3.1.1.9.3 Steering Rate Not Applicable for non-steerable, fixed pattern antennas LGA. For IGA and HGA the Secondary RX path (See section 2.2.3.1.1.9) shall be able to search the entire hemisphere in 4 seconds where each IGA/HGA antenna beam has a dwell time of 4ms. 

2.2.3.1.1.9.4 Pattern Discrimination The LGA, IGA, HGA antenna D/U is not applicable.  
Note: For the IGA and HGA antenna, the Secondary RX beam is considered to be fully independent from the Primary RX beam and by definition D/U is not applicable to the IGA, HGA. This is because the terminal is not trying to get two SV(s) in the same RF path. Similarly this does not apply to an LGA as it is an omni-diriectional antenna. 

 

## 2.2.3.1.2 Transceiver Subsystem 2.2.3.1.2.1 Transmitter Function The Transmitter Shall Meet All Its Requirements Over The Following Frequency Bands: 1616-1626

2.2.3.1.2.1.1 Minimum Power Output  
The AES shall be capable of providing an on-channel power output, measured in free space or other  suitable measurement technique, in order to achieve a single carrier power level of at least EIRPMIN as per Table 2-4.  The EIRPMIN shall be converted to equivalent Transmit Power Limits, referred to the connector of the antenna, using the appropriate antenna gain as described in the test procedure in Section 2.4.3.1.2.1.1. 

 
2.2.3.1.2.1.2 Maximum Individual Carrier Output When measured at Point A of any AES configuration, the on-channel power output of the transceiver shall be no more than PD or PV depending on the AES class. The on-channel power output shall be defined as in the definition of Burst Output Power found in Section 1.7 of the DO-262 main document. 

 
2.2.3.1.2.1.3 Maximum Total Transmitter Output When measured at Point A with the minimum practical cable loss for the specific AES design, the average power during a transmission burst from the output of the transceiver on any assignable frequency ƒ, with ND data channels and/or NV voice channels simultaneously active, shall not exceed 15dBW- Antenna Gain (for clarity 15dBW minus the value of the antenna gain). This is based on an assumed -55 dB coupling between the AES antenna and the GNSS antenna. If a different coupling level is used, the highest average maximum total transmit power limit shall be adjusted accordingly or appropriate filtering methods applied. All channels shall be assumed to be transmitting with the maximum duty cycle.  
Notes: 
1) This value of 15dBW is governed by ETSI EN V1.4.1, Section  5.3.2 for peak EIRP density within operational band, using with iridium's declared bandwidth for a single carrier of 208kHz 2) This requirement maintains compatibility with GNSS susceptibility requirements as stated in the ICAO GNSS SARPS 

## 2.2.3.1.2.1.4 Transmitter Intermodulation Performance 2.2.3.1.2.1.4.1 Narrow-Band (Cw) Intermodulation Performance Not Applicable 2.2.3.1.2.1.4.2 Modulated Intermodulation Multi-Carrier Performance

This requirement does not apply to AES1 configurations unless it is part of a combined system as outlined in Section 5.1. 

A transceiver capable of multi-carrier operation, including any associated HPA and output filter, shall satisfy the requirements of Table 2-6 or Table 2-7, depending on EIRPmax) with a 4 dB 
relaxation when transmitting two modulated carriers each of which is at the maximum singlecarrier power permitted by 2.2.3.1.2.1.2 or one-half the maximum output power of the transceiver, including HPA, whichever is less. Both carriers shall be on assignable carrier frequencies within the band fTMN to fTMX. The emission that does not fall within the band 0.99675 
fTMN to 1.00325 fTMX or the band 0.99675 fRMN to 1.00325 fRMX shall not exceed the values of Table 
2-6 or Table 2-7 by more than 4 dB.  
The emission that falls within the band 0.99675 fTMN to 1.00325 fTMX or the band 0.99675 fRMN to 
1.00325 fRMX shall not exceed the two-tone intermodulation signal level SIMT given in Table 2-4. 

Notes: 

1) Manufacturers may demonstrate compliance with the standards established in Table 2-6
or Table 2-7, depending on EIRPmax ,by testing with CW carriers and applying a
mathematically justifiable spreading factor to account the modulation rate and the order of the intermodulation product.  Such spreading factor should not increase with IM order faster than sqrt(k), where k is the lowest order of the IM product capable of producing products in the specified band.
2) Intermodulation requirements do not apply to AES equipment, or combination of AES
systems as outlined in Section 5.1, that only transmit on a single carrier frequency.

## 2.2.3.1.2.1.5 Transmitter Harmonics, Discrete Spurious And Noise Density Limits Notes:

This section excludes requirements for emissions in the transmit band, which are covered in Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.9. 

 
 
When tested with a single modulated signal at the maximum permissible single carrier level specified by Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, the average power output of the composite harmonic, discrete spurious and noise density, including phase noise, at the transceiver output shall not exceed the values in Table 2-6 or Table 2-7, except for frequencies falling within the band .99675 fTMN to 
1.00325 fTMX and the band 0.99675 fRMN to 1.00325 fRMX 
 
A modulated single carrier transmitted from equipment with a maximum EIRP greater than or equal to 15 dBW shall meet the requirements of Table 2-6.  A modulated signal carrier transmitted from equipment that with maximum EIRP of less than 15 dBW shall meet the requirement of Table 2-7. Table 2-6 and Table 2-7 specify power limits at the transceiver output (including the HPA and output filter) and in EIRP.  The EIRP values may be mathematically adjusted to an equivalent transceiver output value using the specific antenna configuration specified for the equipment.  If the equipment is configured to operate with several different antennas, the adjustment resulting in the lowest emission at the transceiver output shall be used.  The assumed antenna gain(s) shall be clearly declared in Section 3 of the system-specific appendix. 

 
The values contained in Table 2-6 and Table 2-7 are based on a standard assumption of 40 dB 
isolation between the SATCOM and any GNSS antennas.  System-specific specifications may relax such requirements by increasing the assumed isolation on a decibel-for-decibel basis up to a maximum isolation of 60 dB.  Such a relaxation in performance shall be accompanied by a specific statement as to the assumed isolation. The declared isolation may be different for different GNSS systems, for example GPS and GLONASS.  The assumed isolation shall clearly be stated as an installation requirement in Section 3 of the system-specific appendix. 

 
 
The required test category in Table 2-6 or Table 2-7 shall be declared for GPS & GLONASS or GPS Only. See Notes on the tables regarding GPS only test requirements.

## Notes To Table 2-6.

1.
Additional filters maybe required to meet these requirements.
2.
The values in the "Transmit Power Limit" column refer to power at the connector of the
antenna.
3.
The values in the "EIRP Limit" column shall be converted to equivalent Transmit Power
Limits, referred to the connector of the antenna, using the appropriate antenna gain as declared in Section 3.
4.
All measurements shall use an averaging detector.
5.
In the band 3253.0 MHz to 3321.0 MHz the maximum EIRP in one, and only one, 300
kHz measurement bandwidth shall not exceed -38 dBW. Elsewhere in this band the power
limit in Table 2-6 shall be applied.
6.
In each of the bands 4 879.5 MHz to 4 981.5 MHz, 6 506.0 MHz to 6 642.0 MHz and
8 132.5 MHz to 8 302.5 MHz the maximum EIRP in one, and only one, 300 kHz
measurement bandwidth shall not exceed -48 dBW. Elsewhere in this band the power in
Table 2-6 shall be applied.
7.
In the band 9 759.0 MHz to 9 963.0 MHz the maximum EIRP in one, and only one, 300
kHz measurement bandwidth shall not exceed -59 dBW. Elsewhere in this band the power
limit in Table 2-6 shall be applied.
8.
If measured on one channel of a multi-channel system, this level shall be reduced by
10*log(N) dB, where N is the number of channels the system is capable of transmitting on
simultaneously.
9.
This value assumes an isolation of 40 dB between the transmitter antenna port and the
antenna port of a receiver operating in this band.  If additional isolation is explicitly

## 

required in the satellite-specific appendix, this value may be increased on a decibel-perdecibel basis up to a maximum of 20 dB (60 dB total isolation). 

10. If the satellite-specific material explicitly provides for a class of equipment that is 
intended for operation only on aircraft where GLONASS is not used, the linear increase shown in the 1605-1610 MHz band may be used across the 1585-1610 MHz band.

Notes to Table 2-7: 

1. 
Additional filters maybe required to meet these requirements. 
2. 
Sections marked "linear" are linearly interpolated in dB vs. frequency. 
3.

The values in the "Transmit Power Limit" column refer to power at the connector of the antenna. For Class 4 antennas with integrated DLNA this physical connector does not necessarily exist. In this case the equivalent measurement may be performed using a specially prepared unit, or by measuring at a different point and calculating the equivalent levels.    
4.

The values in the "EIRP Limit" column shall be converted to equivalent Transmit Power Limits, referred to the connector of the antenna, using the appropriate antenna gain as described in the test procedure in relevant satellite-specific Appendix

All measurements shall use an averaging detector.

6.
     In the band 3 253.0 MHz to 3 321.0 MHz the maximum EIRP in one, and only one, 300

     In the bands 4 879.5 MHz to 4 981.5 MHz and 5 004.0 MHz to 5 025.0 MHz the
maximum EIRP in one, and only one, 3 MHz measurement bandwidth shall not exceed -48 
dBW. Elsewhere in these bands the power limit in Table 2-7 shall be applied. 

8.
     In the bands 6 506.0 MHz to 6 642.0 MHz and 6 672.0 MHz to 6 700.0 MHz the
maximum EIRP in one, and only one, 3 MHz measurement bandwidth shall not exceed -48 
dBW. Elsewhere in these bands the power limit in Table 2-7 shall be applied. 

9.
     In the bands 8 132.5 MHz to 8 302.5 MHz and 8 340.0 MHz to 8 375.0 MHz the
maximum EIRP in one, and only one, 3 MHz measurement bandwidth shall not exceed -48 
dBW. Elsewhere in these bands the power limit in Table 2-7 shall be applied. 

10. In the bands 9 759.0 MHz to 9 963.0 MHz and 10 008.0 MHz to 10 050.0 MHz the
maximum EIRP in one, and only one, 3 MHz measurement bandwidth shall not exceed -59 
dBW. Elsewhere in these bands the power limit in Table 2-7 shall be applied. 

11. This value assumes an isolation of 40 dB between the transmitter antenna port and the
antenna port of a receiver operating in this band.  If additional isolation is explicitly required 
in the satellite-specific appendix, this value may be increased on a decibel-per-decibel basis 
up to a maximum of 20 dB (60 dB total isolation). 

12. If the satellite-specific material explicitly provides for a class of equipment that is
intended for operation only on aircraft where GLONASS is not used, the linear increase in 
the 1605-1610 MHz band may be used across the 1585-1610 MHz band. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.1.6 Protection Of Radio Astronomy

Requirements for protection of the radio astronomy bands are included in Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.5, Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.7, and Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.9. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.1.7 Carrier Off Level After The Transmitter Has Not Transmitted For More Than Two Seconds, The Transmitted Eirp, Referred To The Connector Of The Antenna, Shall Be Below The Levels Specific In Table 2-8.

In no circumstances shall the unwanted emissions from an AES in its carrier-off state exceed the unwanted emissions from the AES when in its carrier-on state. In Table 2-8, whenever a change of limit between adjacent frequency bands occurs, the lower of the two limits shall apply at the transition frequency.

2.2.3.1.2.1.8 Power Control 
 
Note:  The transceiver function of controlling the power level of its emissions on any individual 
carrier over a range of PRNG, with nominal steps of 1dB or less is controlled by Iridium 
through the satellite network communications and is not testable in the transceiver.   
2.2.3.1.2.1.9 On-Channel Output Spectrum 
The maximum EIRP spectral density of the unwanted emissions from an AES in any 30 kHz band within  
the band 1610 - 1626.5 MHz is stated in Table 2-9. 
Note:  The Iridium transceiver meets the adjacent carrier power ratio requirements of the 
Iridium system.  This parameter is verified on each unit in production testing prior to being provided to the avionics manufacturer for installation into the SDU.

Notes to Table 2-9 

1.
Frequency offset is determined from:
i)
The nearest edge of the nominated bandwidth of the nominal carrier closest to the MSS system operating in another operational band within the band 1,610 MHz to 1,626.5 MHz.  The frequency offset is measured in the direction of the adjacent MSS system;
ii) The upper edge of the nominated bandwidth of the carrier under test for emissions within
the band 1,626.5 MHz to 1,628.5 MHz.
2.
The measurement bandwidth used may be 3 kHz if the unwanted EIRP limits are reduced correspondingly.
3.
Linearly interpolate in dBW vs frequency offset.
2.2.3.1.2.1.10 Transmitter Operation in Moving Aircraft Any AES capable of AMS(R)S voice and/or AMS(R)S data communications shall comply with the Iridium satellite network interface requirements when installed in aircraft operating at ground speeds of up to 800 knots (1481.6km/hr). See Iridium Reference H- Iridium Doppler Requirements/ Performance for Aeronautical Communication GEN-0020 as an analysis reference. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.1.11 Manufacturer Defined Transmitter Tests The Manufacturer Shall Define The Tests Required To Detect Degradation In Performance Before, During, Or After Environmental Tests (Depending On The Environmental Category) And Shall Be Used To Verify The Transceiver Operates Correctly Over The Indicated Do-160G Categories.

Note: The manufacturer may choose to combine environmental tests when able to avoid excessive time and cost. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.2 Receiver Function For The Purposes Of This Section, The Reference Point For All Signal Level Measurements Is The Input Port To The Aes, Point C In Figure 1-13, Figure 1-14 And Figure 1-15. 2.2.3.1.2.2.1 Receiver Sensitivity

2.2.3.1.2.1.4.3 Data Sensitivity When operated with a single active data channel, an AES capable of packet data service shall output user data at average rate of R*SC-UD* bps or higher with input signal level greater than or equal to SDS.  When transferring packets of 128 octets of user data, the receiver data output shall exhibit a residual packet error rate of no more than
6
1 10−
×
. 

 
effective sky temperature of typical operations and any increase in the effective noise temperature due to antenna effects, this sensitivity is consistent with the Figure of Merit G/T requirements of the DO-270  MASPS and DO-215A. 

 
As allowed under DO-270 MASPS, a calculation of the residual packet error rate is allowable given the excessive number of tests required to validate 1 x 10-6. See Iridium Packet Error Rate Calculations Paper (Reference E) on a calculation of the packet error rate that demonstrates the network FEC and other mechanisms that contribute to data sensitivity. This calculation is part of the validation when coupled with a test requirement of no more than 2% Bit Error Rate (BER). 

Note: Iridium Certification will validate the 2% BER at SDS at average rate of RSC-UD bps or higher. 

2.2.3.1.2.1.4.4 Voice Sensitivity The vocoder shall satisfy its performance requirements when provided with an input signal of SVS 
from an appropriately configured satellite system test set. See Iridium Packet Error Rate Calculations Paper (Reference E) that covers the circuit switch data analysis of the Iridium system. The same 2% BER that is references in 2.2.3.1.2.2.1.1 will enable the validation of this requirement based on the analysis in Iridium Reference E - Iridium Packet Error Rate Calculations Paper. 

 
2.2.3.1.2.2.2 Receiver Bandwidth The receiver shall meet its requirements for an input carrier frequency anywhere in the range of 
1616 - 1626.5 MHz. 

Note: The Iridium system is an TDD/FDD system with a channelization system based on 47.7kHz channel spacing. (Table 2-4 FM with RRC 0.4)  The RF path at the LGA, IGA, HGA has to cover the entire Iridium band as described above. At any given time the modem is TX/RX over one or more carriers centered in the channel spacing and is defined here as receiver tuned bandwidth. 

 
For systems where MAX(ND, NV) = 1 the receiver tuned bandwidth shall be at least Bw = 
180kHz. This is due to the 47.7kHz modulation bandwidth + /- 60kHz Doppler shift + tolerance. 

For systems where MAX(ND, NV) > 1 the receiver tuned bandwidth shall be Bw = ({Max() -1} * 
50) + 180kHz. 

e.g. if ND = 16 the receiver has to have a bandwidth of at least 930kHz. 

 
2.2.3.1.2.2.3 Rejection of Signals Outside the NGSS Receive Band The receiver shall acquire and track the satellite downlink signal with a minimum signal level given by the SVS and SDS in the presence of CW interference signal of -10 dBm in the frequency range 470 to 18,000 MHz, excluding the band 0.95 ƒRMN to 1.05 ƒRMX. Within the excluded band, the level of the CW interference signal shall be reduced linearly from -
50dBm at 0.95 ƒRMN to -72 dBm at 0.99938 ƒRMN and from -10 dBm at 1.05 ƒRMX to -72 dBm at 
1.00062 ƒRMX. 

 

## 2.2.3.1.2.2.4 Rejection Of Carrier Signals Generated By Other Ams(R)S Equipment

Note:  This requirement is only applicable under the conditions described in Section 2.1.8. 

In addition to the general CW interference requirements described in Section 2.2.3.1.2.2.3, the receiver shall acquire and track the satellite downlink signal with a minimum signal level given by the minimum SVS and SDS in the presence of CW interfering signal of the following levels and carrier frequencies.   

Carrier Frequency Band 
CW Interference Level 
1626.5-1660.5 MHz 
 -2dBm 

Note: These levels assume an antenna-port-to-antenna-port isolation of 40 dB between AMS(R)S 
equipment on the same aircraft, and includes the effects of DO-210D compliant avionics on the same aircraft.  For AES installations that can provide more than 40 dB of isolation, the interference level can be reduced on a decibel for decibel basis.  .

2.2.3.1.2.2.5 Receiver Operation in Moving Aircraft Any AES capable of AMS(R)S voice and/or AMS(R)S data communications shall comply with the Iridium satellite network interface requirements when installed in aircraft operating at ground speeds of up to 800 knots (1481.6km/hr).  See Iridium Reference H- Iridium Doppler Requirements/ Performance for Aeronautical Communication GEN-0020 as an analysis reference. 

Note: For aircraft that may operate above 800 knots, the same requirement applies. This 800 
knot is not a limiting factor for AES functionality but is referenced here based on existing aircraft technology. 

2.2.3.1.2.2.6 Receiver Susceptibility The receiver shall properly acquire and track the required signals and shall output data at the specified rate when subjected to wideband interference noise of level UW
S
 across the designated receive band. 

The receiver shall properly acquire and track the required signals and shall output data at the specified rate when subjected to CW interference of level UN
S
 on any assignable channel within the designated receive band. 

For the purposes of this requirement, narrowband interference shall be defined as interference with a bandwidth of less than the modulation rate, M
f of the NGSS under consideration. 

Bandwidth with modulation rate greater than fM shall be defined as wideband interference.

## 2.2.3.1.2.2.7 Receiver Damage The Aes Receiver Shall Operate Properly After Exposure To An Rf Signal Of 10 Dbm At Point C Of And Aes Class As Shown In Figure 1-13, Figure 1-14, Or Figure 1-15.  The Aes Receiver Shall Be Powered On During This Test. 2.2.3.2 User Link Modulation And Signal In Space (Physical Layer) The Aes Classes Shall Use, As A Basis, An Iridium Supplied Modem Which Creates The Modulated Signal According To Iridium Specifications Which May Change From Time To Time And Is Not Part Of This Requirement Appendix. For Testing Purposes Using A 8.32Ms Burst Every 90Ms With 41.667 Khz Bandwidth, 50Ksps, De-Qpsk With A 0.4 Rrc Filter Is Sufficient To Model The Air Interface.

2.2.3.3 Priority, Precedence and Preemption The requirements of this section shall apply to all communications channels available for assignment to users, specifically excluding channels used for internal NGSS signaling and system management functions. 

An AES shall provide mechanisms to enable prioritization of priority-related communications over lower priority and non-priority communications. The priority levels are indicated in Table 2- 10. An AES1 is a packet data only system with details covered in Section 2.2.3.3.1. An AES2 or AES3 shall support circuit switch voice and/or packet data, covered in 2.2.3.3.2 and 
2.2.3.3.1 respectively. If an AES supports voice and data communications, voice communications shall have priority over data within any given application or priority level. 

The Iridium ATS switch supports three levels of call priority for safety communication and one level of non-safety communication as outlined in Table 2-10.   
 

| Application (Voice and/or Data)     | Priority Identifier                            |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Distress, Urgency                   | 4 (high)                                       |
| Direction Finding, Flight Safety    | 3                                              |
| Other Safety & Regularity of Flight | 2                                              |
| 1 (low)                             | All other non-safety communications, including |
| public correspondence               |                                                |

 Notes: 1.   
The numeric Priority Identifier scheme indicated in Table 2-10 is a logical scheme only 
and is intended for the purpose of unambiguously identifying test conditions within this document.  There is no requirement that the actual interface(s) to pilots, to the satellites, or to the terrestrial users use this method for identifying priorities.  Specific NGSS implementations may incorporate more than the minimum four priority levels specified above, and may utilize various specific priority/precedence numbering schemes for the levels. 2.   
Schemes identified in other RTCA and ICAO standards include 1 (highest) through 4 (lowest) and 15 (highest) through 0 (lowest), etc.  In particular, the priority labeling 
convention listed in Table 2-10 is different from that used to identify circuit mode priorities in DO-210D.  The convention of using a larger numeric value to indicate a higher priority is consistent with that used for ATN, ICAO Annex 10 Chapter 4 AMS(R)S 
SARPs, and DO-210D packet mode data communications. 

3.
The required priority mechanism may be protocol based or may be hardware-specific. For example, an AES implementing the ISO 8208 protocol described in Appendix B of the DO-262 main document may rely on the packet priority mechanism inherent in the ISO
8208 protocol.  AES's that implement other protocols may use either an inherent
mechanism that is essentially equivalent to that of 8208.  Other methods, including
hardware-based methods and provision of dedicated Iridium hardware for AMS(R)S services, are permissible.  Hardware-based mechanisms may include segregation of data
priority by input port, identification of data priority via interface bus (e.g., ARINC 429) protocol separate from the packet protocol, a discrete hardware interface, or any other means that permits near-real-time determination of packet priority.

## 2.2.3.3.1 Packet Data

The AES shall ensure that data packets are transferred to and from the Iridium network in such a way that higher priority data is not affected by lower priority data.  

## Notes:

1) This requirement is considered a subset of the requirements for protection from a Denial-
Of-Service (DOS) attack.  This requirement is more thoroughly covered in the
Information Security Section 2.2.3.10.
2) This normative appendix recognizes that messages may be subject to segmentation in
accordance with Iridium Satellite protocols.  Transmission preemption, if necessary, will
be effected by changing the order of data transmission such that the data units of the internal protocols comprising the higher-priority message are transmitted before corresponding lower-priority data units.  Any reordering necessary to comply with this
requirement will take effect immediately upon completion of currently active data unit
transmission.  Preemption of lower-priority messages, if necessary, will be effected by
any means necessary to preserve the higher-priority message(s).

## 2.2.3.3.2 Circuit Mode Communications (Voice)

The AES shall apply priority and preemption mechanisms to air-to-ground and ground-to-air voice calls.  Each call shall be assigned one of four levels of priority as shown in Table 2-10 
using the prioritization mechanism required by 2.2.3.3.   When providing AMS(R)S services, the AES shall always have sufficient communications resources to detect a request to establish an incoming call, except in the rare case when all AES resources are consumed by distress/urgency communications. 

Notes: 

 
1) The Iridium ATS Safety Voice Switch is co-located at the Iridium gateway and 
controls all aspects of the priority, precedence and preemption of voice calling. The AES equipment receives the voice calls as directed by the ATS Safety Voice Switch based on the priority of the calls. The ATS Safety Voice Switch allows for at least 
three levels of priority for safety communications, all of which are higher than the 
priority provided for any non-safety communications, as illustrated in Table 2-10.  
 
2) The ATS Safety Voice Switch management of actions for circuit-mode calls in either 
the air-originated or ground-originated direction are queued and processed within 
the AES in an order corresponding to each call's Circuit-mode Priority per Table 2-
10, with the higher Circuit-mode Priority numbers having the higher precedence. The lowest priority in-progress call will be interrupted immediately if necessary to make AES resources (e.g., transmitter power, channel unit, vocoder) available for a 
higher-priority call.  If a new ground-originated call has the same or lower priority 
as the lowest-priority call in progress, and if sufficient AES resources are not 
available to support the new circuit, then the AES shall indicate "busy" to the originating party.  See Iridium Reference G - Iridium ATS Operator Guide MAN-
2000-IR. 
2.2.3.4 Satellite Subnetwork Data Protocol (Satellite Layer 2) 
The AES shall support the satellite subnetwork data protocols specified for the individual satellite network.  Implementation of the Satellite Layer 2 Protocols shall include any actions and protocols necessary to acquire the satellite, maintain a connection over an extended period of time, transfer digital data and digitized voice information, and participate in the overall system management functions of the satellite subnetwork. The AES shall register itself with the satellite system so that it is enabled to receive or transmit data or voice, as appropriate, on the subnetwork. Notes: 1. Satellite Layer 2 is a generic term for the internal protocol(s) used by various NGSS.  For information on the context see the DO-270 MASPS. .  This document uses the term Satellite Layer 2 to avoid confusion with the Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocols discussed in Section 2.2.3.6.3. 

 2. This registration action is referred to as "system log on", and an AES which has completed 
this action is referred to as being in a "logged-on" state. 
2.2.3.5 Voice Protocol Vocoded voice information shall be transmitted and processed in accordance with the ISLLC protocols identified in Iridium Reference A.  Any voice services supported by the avionics shall be certified by the ISLLC as compliant with the voice protocol specified in Iridium Reference A. 

 
Note:  As evidenced by this requirement, this normative appendix assumes digital transmission of voice.

## 2.2.3.5.1 Vocoder Interoperability With Satellite Subnetwork Not Applicable

The vocoder algorithm shall be implemented by means of an Iridium LBT (95XX transceiver) 
that complies with Iridium Reference A.  The Iridium LBT is 100% compatible with the Iridium network. 

2.2.3.5.2 Vocoder Performance in an Aeronautical Environment The vocoder intended for safety applications shall provide overall intelligibility performance suitable for the intended operational and ambient noise environment when operating with an Iridium satellite test signal level of SVS.  This requirement shall be satisfied when tested in audio noise environments representative of aeronautical cockpit applications in a variety of airframes, including wide-body air-transport cockpit background noise, helicopter cockpit background noise, prop-jet cockpit background noise, and ATC Control Center background noise. 

## 2.2.3.6 User Data Interfaces Short Burst Data (Sbd), As Defined In Section 1.2.11.2, Shall Support Acars, Or Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (Atn) Service, Or Both.

One particular implementation that is known to be ATN-compliant is an ISO-8208 compliant interface.  If the AES implements an ISO-8208 compliant interface, that interface shall comply with the requirements of Appendix B of the DO-262 main document.  Implementation of this interface will assure maximum compatibility with AMSS avionics designed and qualified in accordance with DO-210D. 

SBD provides only the physical and link layer functionality.  Management of priority and preemption are implemented in higher level entities.  If these higher level entities support the necessary priority and ISO 8473 convergence functions, SBD may also be useful for ATN 
communications. 

Notes: 

1.
It is highly desirable that the minimum data services include support for both ATN protocols
as defined in DO-210D.
2.
It is not the intent of this minimum standard to preclude the inclusion of additional satellite
subnetwork access protocols, if desired by the avionics manufacturer
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
2.2.3.6.1 ATN-Compliant Service Interface The Satellite Subnetwork Layer (SSNL) in the AES shall offer connection-oriented packet data service to the Higher Layer Entities (HLEs) by facilitating satellite subnetwork switched virtual circuits (SVCs) with its peer entity in the subnetwork GES function.  It also shall offer methods to convert addressing from the HLE to the SSNL.   Figure 2-2 illustrates the ISO-style protocol stacks associated with ATN-compliant operations. 

## Notes:

1.
The terminology used in the high-level description of and requirements for an ATN-compliant
protocol is based on ISO-8208.  Use of this terminology should not be interpreted to require
an ISO-8208 compliant interface as a minimum standard. 2. Figure 2-2 is intended to be representative of a typical implementation, not normative.  In 
particular, certain applications within the AES may function as a "Higher Level Entity" in their use of the communications resource.  The existence of such internal applications is not 
shown in Figure 2-2, but this omission should not be construed as a prohibition against such 
internal applications.  This document neither encourages nor prohibits such implementations. The SSNL in the AES shall support the following three main functions: 
 
a. The Satellite Subnetwork Dependent (SSND) sublayer 
b. The Satellite Subnetwork Access (SSNAc) sublayer 
c. The Satellite Subnetwork InterWorking Function (IWF) 
 The SSND sublayer shall perform the SSND protocol between the AES and a GES as defined in this document by exchanging SubNetwork Protocol Data Units (SNPDUs).  The SubNetwork Protocol and definition of the SNPDUs are completely determined by the underlying communications infrastructure, and are defined in either the appropriate normative attachment or the documents referenced by such an attachment. The SSNAc sublayer in the AES shall perform the ATN-compliant protocol between the AES and the connected airborne HLE (DTE).  The IWF shall provide the protocol conversion functions and the flow control operation required between the SSND and SSNAc sublayers.

The role of the ATN is to define an environment within which reliable end-to-end data
transfer may take place, spanning the envisioned airborne, air/ground, and ground-based data subnetworks, including the satellite subnetwork, while providing interoperability among
those networks.  The critical emphasis is on end-system data transfer interoperability.  In the
ATN environment, the Satellite Subnetwork Layer must support the transparent transfer of Network Protocol Data Units between adjacent interworking entities (or HLEs as seen by the
satellite subnetwork).  This also implies the transparent transfer of global addresses (or Network Service Access Points (NSAPs) and of quality of service information (including network priority) as well as of user data.
2.
The HLE (in addition to the incorporation of the SSNAc function) will also support additional functions.  As a minimum, the DTE incorporates an internetwork function and may also incorporate transport, session, presentation and application functions.  In some AES implementations, certain HLEs may be contained within the AES software itself, but this
configuration is not illustrated in Figure 2-2.
2.2.3.6.1.1 Join and Leave Requirements An AES that provides ATN-compliant packet-mode data service shall provide Join and Leave event information to the aircraft routing function to indicate that the air/ground data link is either available or not available, respectively.  The Join/Leave information shall include sufficient information for the routing function to determine the address(es) of the attached terrestrial DTE(s). 

## 2.2.3.6.1.2 Atn-Compliant Mapping For Priority, Precedence And Preemption The Target And Selected Values Of The Priority Of Data On An Atn-Compliant Interface Shall Be Mapped To The Equivalent Values At The Opposite End Of The Satellite Subnetwork. 2.2.3.6.2 Acars

Note: Sections 2.2.3.6.2 and 2.2.3.6.3, as well as related figure and table references, have been 
changed from the DO-262 main document to reflect that Data-2 is not applicable to the Iridium Satellite system.  This requirement has been adjusted to reflect the ACARS interface. 
An AES supporting ACARS services shall utilize the Iridium SBD data service. 

The ACARS protocol itself does not capture or convey priority information. Therefore the AES and the Iridium network both handle all ACARS messages transparently at the same priority level.  
RUDICS is not approved for use as method of ACARS messaging and does not require testing for ACARS under this MOPS.  
SBD is an Iridium Satellite network packet-mode data type protocol.  Figure 1-9 shows the system architecture of the Iridium SBD service while Figure 1-10 depicts the MO (aircraft originated) call set-up process.  As outlined in Section 1.2.9.2, SBD messages benefit from additional FEC protection.  SBD messages are routed from the AES through the Iridium Satellite Gateway to the ground-based Safety Service Provider processor, serving as a higher level entity. 

The ground-based safety service processor converts the unmodified message for distribution via the aviation terrestrial network as a standard ACARS ground-ground message.  Aircraft bound 
 
ACARS messages are handled in the opposite fashion; the safety service processor converts the standard ACARS ground-ground message to an ACARS air-ground message for delivery to the aircraft via the Iridium sub-network. 

 

## 2.2.3.6.3 Satellite Subnetwork Requirements

2.2.3.6.3.1 Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocol Requirements The combination of the Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocol and the Satellite Layer 2 protocol is expected to provide a reliable link service to assist the overall AMS(R)S air-to-ground subnetwork in delivering high integrity data.  The Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocol (SSNDP) shall provide the additional error control mechanisms, if any, necessary to assure a residual packet error rate, including misdirected packets, of 1 x 10-6 or less for a standard 128-
octet message. See Section 2.2.3.1.2.2.1 Receiver Sensitivity for more information on this requirement. The SSNDP shall operate in accordance with the requirements referenced in this normative appendix. 

 
The SSNDP may include a separate Air-Ground Protocol (AGP) sublayer between peer entities in the AES and GES.  When the Air-Ground Protocol sublayer is included, it shall be defined in this attachment, and the AES shall comply with the defined protocol. 

## 2.2.3.6.3.2 Atn-Compliant Requirements If An Atn-Compliant Snacp Is Provided, The Ssndp Shall Provide Atn-Compliant Subnetwork Services To The Hle.  Atn Compliance Is Achieved By Satisfying The Following Requirements: 1. The Ssndp Shall Be Byte And Code Independent.

 
2. The SSNDP shall maintain the sequence and order of data (i.e. data submitted to the SSNDP 
for transmission shall arrive at the destination peer in the same order it was transmitted or its 
sequence shall be identifiable by the destination peer). 
 
3. The SSNDP shall inform its interworking function whenever its connectivity with the satellite 
network changes. 
2.2.3.6.3.3 ACARS Requirements 
To the extent that the SSNDP is utilized for ACARS transmissions, the following requirements 
shall be met: 1. The SSNDP shall be code and byte independent. 2. The SSNDP shall maintain the sequence and order of data. 3. The SSNDP shall inform the associated DTE when its connectivity with the satellite network 
changes. 

## 2.2.3.6.4 External Physical And Data Link Layer Requirements At The Physical And Data Link Layer Of The Hle/Aes Connection:

1.
The interface shall be "bit-oriented" (i.e., there shall be no restrictions on the sequence, order
or pattern of the bits transferred within a packet between the HLE and the AES).
2.
The interface shall support the transfer of variable length network layer packets.
3.
The data link layer shall provide an undetected bit error rate consistent with the satellite
subsystem performance requirements (reference RTCA DO-215A, Section 3.2.1.1.2).

## 2.2.3.6.5 Avionics Sub-Network Interface Requirements For Iso-8208 Service All Aes Equipment That Supports An Iso-8208-Compliant (Data-3) Packet-Mode Service Shall Have The Packet Layer Protocol (Plp) Interface Specified In Detail In The Iso-8208 Standard, As Modified By Appendix B Of The Do-262 Main Document.

The correspondence between ISO-8208 primitives in Appendix B of the DO-262 main document and SSNDP protocol data units, if any, shall be as defined in this appendix.  There is no required mapping of ISO-8208 primitives to technique-dependent Satellite Sub-network Protocol Data Units.  The use of the underlying satellite communications system is unspecified, providing that the DCE/DTE interface actions act and respond appropriately as defined in ISO-8208 as modified by Appendix B of the DO-262 main document. 

The operation of the AES as specified in this attachment assumes that the HLE performs the following functions: 

a.
Is able to initiate, accept and terminate calls via the interface
b.
Is prepared to accept messages from the AES
c.
Monitors the AES operation in case of unrecoverable error conditions and reinitializes the
AES as necessary
2.2.3.6.6 Alternative ATN-compliant Subnetwork Access Protocols Any manufacturer wishing to implement an ATN-compliant SNAcP that differs from the ISO-
8208 implementation specified in Appendix B to the DO-262 main document shall provide the detailed protocol implementation and associated verification procedures in the technique-specific attachment.  The level of detail included in the SNAcP definition shall be equivalent to or better than the detail provided in Appendix B to the DO-262 main document. 

## 2.2.3.7 Circuit Mode Service Requirements Circuit-Mode Voice And/Or Data Services, If Provided, Shall Comply With This Normative Appendix. The Aes May Provide Voice Communications Capability To The Cockpit And/Or The Passenger Cabin Areas.

The minimum requirements for circuit-mode voice service on the satellite subnetwork, if such service is provided by an AES, shall be the minima specified for that subnetwork in this normative appendix. 

Circuit-mode voice and data service shall comply with the priority, precedence and preemption requirements established in Section 2.2.3.3 of this attachment. 

Notes : 

 
1) Samples of cockpit voice interworking can be found in ARINC-741 Part 2.  These 
interworking connections are installation specific and are not addressed in this 
minimum standard. 
2) Circuit-mode data service, which provides a circuit-switched data channel to support a variety 
of communication applications that require the allocation of dedicated channel capacity for the 
duration of a call (such as interactive or bulk data, encrypted voice/data and facsimile), may optionally be provided in AESs capable of voice communication. Circuit-mode data is not 
approved for FANS/1A messaging but maybe used for non-safety data exchanges with the 
aircraft. 

## 2.2.3.8 Recovery From Primary Power Interruption The Ngss Equipment Shall Conform To The Following Requirements After Encountering Primary Power Interruptions From Any Cause. 1. Power Interruptions Of Less Than 5 Milliseconds Duration Shall Be Indistinguishable From Outages In The Rf Transmission Path Of Equal Duration.

 2. Power interruptions from five to 200 milliseconds duration shall require no more than five 
seconds recovery time, beginning from when primary power has been restored.  Recovery is 
defined as automatically returning to the previous operating state (without user intervention) such that data channels resume in the same configuration they were in before the power interruption occurred.  This assumes a channel signal with at least the minimum quality characteristics specified in Section 2.2.3.1.2.2. 
 
Note: In-transit data service packets which have been acknowledged on either the DTE or DCE 
interface, but not yet transferred to the opposite interface, may be lost.  Higher-layer 
entities that employ end-to-end acknowledgment protocols may choose to retransmit such 
lost data.  Synchronization and RF output power may be lost during the power interruption and recovery time.  There shall be no more than a momentary effect on 
cockpit displays. 

## 2.2.3.9 Failure/Status Indication The Ngss Equipment Shall Provide, Independent Of Any Operator Action, An Indication Of A Failure Of Ngss Equipment Resulting In Loss Of Data Or Voice Communications, As Appropriate. 2.2.3.10 Information Security

The AES shall provide adequate domain segregation to prevent the data stream to or from any interface from influencing the data streams used for the ACARS or priority voice functions. An Information Security Risk Assessment shall be performed in accordance with the methodology provided in DO-326 Airworthiness Security Process Specification, Section 3.2. With respect to the influence on the ACARS service at least the following shall be mitigated in the design of the AES: 
 

|                                     |            | Threat Condition    | Impact Level    |
|-------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Undetected                          | corruption | of                  | FANS            |
| messages (includes spoofing)        |            |                     |                 |
| III (major)                         |            |                     |                 |
| Spoofed FANS messages could result  |            |                     |                 |
| in false CPDLC messages instructing |            |                     |                 |
the flight crew to change heading or flight level, causing a reduction in safety margins. 
Loss of availability of services 
IV (minor) 
Loss of ACARS over Iridium function is 
considered 
to 
be 
a 
minor 
failure condition. 

Notes: 1.

RTCA DO-326 Section 3.3 provides guidance on how the Information Security Risk Assessment should influence the design. 2.

An analysis using the methodology in RTCA DO-326 will be required to determine if a specific design fulfills the requirements. 

## 2.3 Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions 2.3.1 General Requirements

The environmental tests and their associated performance requirements described in this Section are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under environmental conditions representative of those which may be encountered in actual operations. 

Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in RTCA Document DO-160G, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment.  General information regarding the use of the procedures in RTCA DO-160G is contained in Sections 1.0 through 3.0 
of that document.  Also, a method of identifying which environmental tests were conducted and other amplifying information on the conduct of the tests is contained in Appendix A of RTCA DO-160G. Some of the minimum performance requirements in Section 2.2 of this normative appendix are not required to be qualified to all of the conditions contained in RTCA DO-160G.  Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Section 2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these conditions.  There it is sufficient to verify compliance at ambient conditions for many requirements, and then continued compliance is inferred by successfully meeting the requirements. 

Table 2-11 is a compliance matrix that cross-references the RTCA DO-160G environmental test requirements with the performance requirements listed in Section 2.2.3 of this document.  Only those tests specifically identified by "X" or by a numerically referenced footnote need be repeated in the various environments.  Furthermore, unless otherwise noted successful verification of compliance to a requirement section implies compliance to all lesser sections as well. 

In addition to the exceptions above, certain environmental tests contained in this section are not required for minimum performance equipment unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for additional environmental conditions.  If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional conditions, then these tests shall be performed. 

2.3.2 Equipment Configurations This document contains provisions to subject different AES configurations to environmental qualification.  Specific AES performance tests have been included for use in conjunction with the environmental procedures of RTCA DO-160G.  These tests are a subset of the full AES 
performance tests contained in Section 2.4.  Normally, a minimum performance standard does not provide specific equipment performance tests to be used in conjunction with the environmental procedures of RTCA DO-160G.  However, the large number of performance tests in Section 2.4 
indicates that a test procedure that includes all of the performance tests combined with the appropriate environmental procedures would be impractical. 

## 2.3.3 Configuration Control Nominal Environment Testing, Followed By Extreme Environment Testing, Shall Be Conducted On The Aes With The Operational Software Installed According To The Correct Software Version Number As Specified In The Aes Configuration Documentation. Note: The Operational Software May Include Test Utilities In Support Of Do-160G Test Functions.

## 2.3.4 Specific Environmental Test Conditions In Addition To The Specific Functional Tests To Be Performed Under Nominal Ambient Environmental Conditions, The Equipment As A Whole Shall Be Subjected To The Test Conditions As Specified In Rtca Do-160G, In The Sections Identified In Table 2-11 And Table 2-12.  By Performing (And Passing) Those Tests, The Corresponding Requirements Of This Standard Shall Be Met. 2.3.5 Performance Vs. Test Requirements Matrix Detailed Test Procedures For Performance Requirements Contained In Section 2.2 Are Found In Section 2.4.  The Subsection Numbering In Section 2.4, At The Third And Lower Levels, Corresponds Identically To That In Section 2.2.  Consequently, This Document Does Not Provide A Detailed Crossreference Matrix.

Notes to Tables 2-11 and 2-12: 

3.
Due to the difficulties in performing radiating measurements while changing the
environmental conditions of the antenna, acceptable alternative test procedures may be
implemented.  Portions of the antenna subsystem may be measured over the required range of operating environmental conditions.  The measurement data thus obtained may be used in
an analysis to show that the specified antenna performance is achieved under the declared operating environmental conditions.  This analysis shall include the effects of materials and
construction of the individual radiating elements and account for the effects of beam pointing errors versus environmental conditions on other specification requirements within the declared coverage volume.
4.
Performance parameters of the antenna subsystem will not be measured during these environmental tests.  These environmental tests are for survivability and apply only to equipment which is mounted on the outside of the aircraft.  Testing of the antenna RF
performance properties to determine the serviceability of the antenna after exposure is
acceptable.  This test could take the form of a production test procedure or other test and shall verify the antenna RF and control functionality has not degraded compared to any baseline testing performed prior to environmental exposure (within test accuracy limits). If a TSOA antenna is used, only Section 2.2.3.1.1.6, 2.2.3.1.1.6.1 and 2.2.3.1.1.6.2 are required.
5.
These tests are not listed for the receiver and transmitter subsystems and need not be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for the particular environmental condition.  For example, an antenna intended for use under an additional radome (e.g. tail-mounted antennas) may only need to meet the drip-proof category of waterproofness.
6.
The application of the Crash Safety Shock test may result in damage to the equipment under test.  Therefore, this test may be conducted after the other tests have been completed.  In this case, Section 2.1.7, "Effects of Test" does not apply.
7.
This test shall be conducted with the spray directed perpendicular to the equipment.
8.
Applicable requirements: a) At the end of the 24-hour exposure period, the equipment shall function. b)
Following the 2-hour operation period at ambient temperature after the 160-hour
exposure period at elevated temperature, the performance requirements shall be met.
9.
The appropriate test will depend upon whether the equipment is AC or DC powered.
10. The application of the Low Voltage Conditions (DC) (Category B equipment) test may result
in damage to the equipment under test.  Therefore, this test may be conducted after the other tests have been completed.  Section 2.1.7, "Effects of Test," does not apply.
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

11. Select Category A (high degree of protection against voltage spikes required) or Category B
(lower standard of protection acceptable) as applicable for the equipment under test.
12. Excluding frequency to which receiver is tuned and the response within its resonant pass
band.
13. Equipment is not required to meet performance specifications during the application of
HIRF, (Category U, 20 v/m).  The equipment must meet all requirements following the application.
14. Meet requirements of DO-160G except as noted by Section 2.2.3.8.
 
15. According to AC20-136B, lightning protection is not required for systems certified to Design 
Assurance Level D (or lower).  For systems certified to Design Assurance Level C or higher, protection from effects on electrical and electronic systems due to lightning transients induced or conducted onto equipment and wiring is required. For systems certified to 
Design Assurance Level C or higher, equipment is not required to meet performance specifications during the period of application of the Lightning Induced Transient test, but must meet all requirements following the test. 
16. Only required for AMSS antennas. 
17. Applicable to equipment requiring cooling.  Modify test length to three hours.  Verify no 
smoke or fire.  Only essential services, namely one voice channel plus ACARS are required to be provided. 
18. UNUSED 
19. The Altitude tests in DO-160G Sections 4.6.1, 4.6.2 and 4.6.3 are not applicable. 
20. The antenna equipment shall be subjected to vibration and operational shock testing 
exposure equivalent to the qualification levels for which the antenna is being certified prior to subjecting the antenna to intermodulation testing. 
21. See Section 2.4.3.1.2.2.1.1 on the Receiver Sensitivity. For Induced Lightning category, test 
is performed only after subjecting to environment. 
22. UNUSED 
23. UNUSED 
24. After the Lightning Direct Effects test the antenna under test shall be functional if the 
manufacturer specifies this in the product's performance specification.  In all cases it is a requirement that the antenna does not pose a danger to the aircraft after such exposure.  If 
the antenna is limited to installation in positions on the aircraft where lightning strikes are not expected (e.g. under another radome which provides protection) this shall be declared as a limitation. 
25. Circuit mode service: perform test as in Section 2.4.3.7 For DO-160G Section 4, only testing 
over temperature is required, not altitude. 
26. Operational shocks (DO-160G Section 7): Performance is only verified after (not during) 
exposure to shocks 
 
An "X" in Table 2-11 indicates that testing of performance is required before/during/after 
exposure to the environmental tests as specified in DO-160G. 
A "-" in Table 2-11 indicates that no testing of performance is required before/during/after 
exposure to the environmental tests in DO-160G. 

## 2.4 Equipment Performance Verification Procedures

 The following procedures provide guidelines for tests to ensure compliance with the MOPS performance requirements.  Except for Section 3.4.5, these do not require flight testing. Regarding secondary references from this section, any reference to "flight tests" in lower level documents should be ignored. 

Some of the following tests may require additional test equipment not shown in the test setup figures.  Such equipment would be associated with the interface between the satellite system emulator and the AES or radio channel unit.

LNA, HPA, splitter/combiner, and front end filters. 
2.4.2.1.1.2 Special Test Equipment An antenna ground plane shall be used to simulate the conductive mounting surface on the intended aircraft.  The ground plane shall extend at least 0.5 m beyond any active portion of the antenna under test, and shall extend beyond any radome employed.  The ground plane should be curved with a radius of approximately 100 inches in order to simulate the radius of curvature of the portion of the aircraft in which the antenna may be mounted.  Where the antenna is to be installed on an aircraft with a radius of curvature which differs by more than 30% from that used in the antenna tests, the validity of the results shall be justified by analysis and/or measurement.

2.4.2.2 Modulation and Signal in Space Required Test Equipment Compliance with the Iridium Satellite modulation and signal-in-space requirements will be verified by means of a certification from Iridium Satellite LLC that the AES is permitted to operate within the sub-network.  Required test equipment, if any, will be determined by the Iridium Satellite certification procedure, which is not an integral part of this normative appendix. 

## 2.4.2.3 Priority, Precedence And Preemption Test Equipment 2.4.2.3.1 Packet Data

Reference: Section 2.2.3.3.1 
This test requires the ability to initiate and terminate multiple packet data transmissions in order to verify that higher priority packet data is not impacted by lower priority packet data. 

2.4.2.3.2 Circuit Mode Communications This test requires the ability to initiate and terminate N simultaneous circuit-mode calls through the satellite network depending on the number of voice lines available in the avionics. The calls made will test the priority, preemption and precedence of the voice system.  An ATS SIM card is required for use with the avionics LBT transceiver that is being tested for ATS.  Calls will be made a different priority levels to or from the aircraft. 

 
This test, while not intended to verify the ability of the satellite network (or the satellite subnetwork) as a whole, will satisfy the Priority, Precedence and Preemption requirements of the MASPS.   
 
2.4.2.4 Satellite Sub-network Data Protocol Test Equipment Compliance with the overall Iridium satellite sub-network dependent protocol will be verified by means of a certification from Iridium Satellite LLC that the AES is permitted to operate within the sub-network.  Required test equipment, if any, will be determined by Iridium Satellite's certification procedure, which is not an integral part of this normative appendix. 

2.4.2.5 Voice Protocol Required Test Equipment Compliance with the overall Iridium Satellite voice protocol, if applicable, will be verified by means of a certification from Iridium Satellite LLC that the AES is permitted to operate within the sub-network.  Required test equipment, if any, will be determined by the Iridium Satellite certification procedure, which is not an integral part of this normative appendix. 

 
Note: Compliance with the requirements of Section 2.2.3.5.2 requires special test equipment capable of accurately reproducing the required environments.  The tests are complex, and are typically carried out by organizations with expertise in the evaluation of vocoder or voice modem capabilities.

## 2.4.3 Detailed Test Procedures

 The test procedures set forth below constitute a satisfactory method of determining required performance.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred.  Such alternate methods may be used if the manufacturer can show that they provide at least equivalent information.  Therefore, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. For performance verification purposes, this section includes procedures for the transceiver and the antenna.  The term Satellite Sub-network Physical Layer is also used for this subsystem in regard to the layered ISO concepts for data communications protocols.

Note 1:  
The following test procedures anticipate that the antenna performance in both the transmit and receive bands is reciprocal and can be adequately measured by using the 
test setup of Figure 2-3. Depending on the individual antenna design, it may be necessary 
to modify the setup of Figure 2-3 to use the antenna under test as a transmit source and 
the reference antenna as a receiver.  Such modifications are fully compliant with the 
intent of the following test procedures.

## Measurement Procedure This Test Applies Only To Aes'S Capable Of Simultaneous Operation On Multiple Carrier Frequencies. Perform The Following Steps:

1) Connect the equipment as shown on Figure 2-8. 2) Using the transceiver controller, command one of the transceivers to transmit 
a tone-modulated burst signal at maximum power at frequency f 1 = f TMN on 
one channel. 
3) Set the second transceiver to transmit a tone-modulated burst signal at 
maximum power at a  valid Iridium frequency f2 on another channel such that 
a k-th order intermodulation product is formed on frequency fIM = (k+1)/2 x 
f1 + (k-1)/2 x f2 desired within one of the frequency bands defined in Table 2-
6 or Table 2-7, depending on EIRPmax.    
4) The smallest possible odd integer k should be used for each band.  
5) **If it is not** possible to accurately set the timing of the bursts from each 
channel to transmit at the same time, the carrier setting sequence shall be 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
repeated every few seconds for ten minutes, so that statistically, the channels' transmit bursts will be simultaneous - therefore generating intermodulation - 
at least some of the time. Set the spectrum analyzer resolution bandwidth to the bandwidth specified in Table 2-6 or Table 2-7, depending on EIRPmax 
,and set to peak hold mode over the frequency band of interest. Monitor the spectrum analyzer and allow enough time for each pair of frequencies such that the intermodulation products become visible and can be measured. Correct all spectrum analyzer readings to incorporate the power averaging interval specified in Table 2-6 or Table 2-7, depending on EIRPmax. 

6) **If it is** possible to synchronize the timing of the bursts from each channel to
transmit at the same time, the spectrum analyzer can be used to observe the IMD products using zero span.  In this case, observe the average IMD signal level over the burst.   
7) Repeat steps 2 through 6 for all f2 as necessary to measure intermodulation
products of desired order in all the bands specified in Table 2-6 or Table 2-7, 
depending on EIRPmax. 
8) Command both channels to stop transmitting when the testing is done.

## 2.4.3.1.2.1.10 Transmitter Operation In Moving Aircraft Reference: Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.10

Iridium Satellite LLC shall provide evidence that any transceiver approved for AES use meets requirements stated in Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.10.  See Reference H -Iridium Doppler Requirements/ 
Performance for Aeronautical Communication GEN-0020 for analysis. 

## 2.4.3.1.2.2 Receiver Performance 2.4.3.1.2.2.1 Receiver Sensitivity

The DO-270 MASPS Appendix D (Methodology for Computing and Partitioning Communication Integrity) allows for the calculation of a residual packet error rate given the excessive number of test required to validate a packet error rate (PER) of no more than 1 x 10-6.   
See Iridium Reference E -Iridium Packet Error Rate Calculations Paper that provides the full scope of the analysis.  
The following is a summary of the final results of the calculations found in Iridium Reference E: 
CSD maximum PER (calculation)=   3x10-7
SBD maximum PER (calculation) = **5.47x10**-7 
Notes: 

1) These values are a **0dB of link margin** for receiver threshold testing.
2) Even partial amounts of link margin increase shall result in significant PER
performance metrics.
This analysis demonstrates that Iridium AMS(R)S packet data can provide a residual error rate no greater than 10-6, whether it is from-aircraft or to-aircraft. 

In order to establish the basis for the analysis, the 2% BER (bit error rate) point of the AES 
receiver is required. The 2% BER point is established by the Space Vehicle (SV) based on the AES meeting its minimum EIRP requirements of SDS for data and SVS for voice. The procedure for this is listed in Section 2.4.3.1.2.1.1. Once Section 2.4.3.1.2.1.1 has been validated, the sensitivity testing may proceed. 

## Required Equipment

•
96XX SBD modem, or 95XX LBT modem
•
Available serial DPL port and 90ms clock tick (NETWORK AVAILABLE Pin) on the
Iridium modem PC with serial port or USB adaptor
•
Stable function generator with 50% duty cycle, 90 mS period square wave 5 volt CMOS
output.
- 
RF signal generator with DQPSK modulation 
- 
SimpleTPI software 
 
Test Setup Figure 2-10 indicates the required setup for the testing. The following sections describe the components or aspects of the test software used to test the receiver sensitivity. 

 
Iridium Modem The modem is connected to the DPL Serial Port as usual, and supplied with the 90 mS  period 
(11.1 Hz) square wave from the function generator to the NETWORK_AVAILABLE pin on the modem system connector. These connections to the modem under test are required for this testing .  See Iridium technical information on the transceiver being tested for detailed pin-out information on the NETWORK_AVAILABLE pin on Iridium modems. 

SYNCH signal timing It should be noted that all SBER timings are referenced to the **falling** edge of the synch signal. 

The user must enable the RF generator burst start time ~58.4 ms after the falling edge, since this is when the receiver enable period begins.  It has been noted that various Iridium documents refer to rising edges, this is only correct for a specific duty cycle and is a not valid for this test.  As mentioned, the SBER SW uses the falling edge so it should be used to determine the timing delay. 

Signal Generator The RF Vector signal generator can be any model that has the ability to generate a DQPSK 
modulated signal, at a 25 KHz symbol rate, with user defined data.  However, the user must be aware of a few key points as covered in the details below on burst timing, DQPSK Symbol Mapping, and the Frame and Data Pattern. 

 
Burst Timing The Iridium burst consists of 207 data symbols. The start of this burst must occur ~58.4 ms after the falling edge of the synch pulse in order to center the burst in the receive slot window. This can be checked by attaching a scope to the RX EN signal on the modem, and examining the actual RF burst using a pulse trigger unit or RF detector. The burst should be centered in the RX EN slot time.  Different generators will have unique trigger requirements and delays, so this should be checked. 

DQPSK Symbol Mapping Most generators with built-in DQPSK modes use a standard symbol map. This is apparently not the same as the Iridium map.  The user can either use the published map to create the correct Iridium symbol phase from the bits, or use a different unique word, and payload to "fool" the Iridium demodulator. The latter method works by essentially mapping the standard to Iridium symbols.  The Iridium specified *unique word* is 3F C0 C3.  Using standard DQPSK symbol mapping, the *unique word* that maps is 30 30 F3.  The Iridium *data pattern* used for BER testing is 00 FF 4B 4B.  Using standard DQPSK symbol mapping, the *data pattern* that maps is C0 C0 
55 55. 

In other words, SBER looks for the unique word 3F C0 C3 and the data pattern 00 FF 4B 4B.  
The generator with standard DQPSK mapping is programmed with unique word 30 30 F3 and data pattern C0 C0 55 55, which the 9602/9603 module interprets as the correct unique word 3F C0 C3 and data pattern 00 FF 4B 4B. 

Frame and Data Pattern The data pattern is a total of 32 bits, and there are 358 data bits in each frame.  For each frame the complete data pattern is repeated 11 times and the last 6 bits of the frame are the first six bits of the data pattern.  For example, if the data pattern is 00 FF 4B 4B, then the last six bits of the frame will be the first six bits of the pattern, in binary 000000.  If the data pattern is C0 C0 55 55, then the last six bits of the frame will be the first six bits of the pattern, in binary 110000.

… repeat data pattern hex 00 FF 4B 4B for total of 11 times…

SBER command and TPI version number The SimpleTPI.exe is used to setup the DUT for testing and the SBER.exe is used to run the SBER command.  Both SimpleTPI and SBER applications are provided by Iridium.  Details on the SBER command are found in the *9602 TPI Protocol Definition (C7893-S-020v1.8)*.  The SBER command is intended to return the following information:  number of frames received and the number of bit errors in hex.  The SBER application also returns the number of bit errors in decimal, but this is not the percentage BER. See Section *Bit Error Rate Calculation*.   
Commands to Run the Bit Error Rate Measurement The following commands are used to make a bit error rate measurement. 

1.
Run simpleTPI from the command prompt, then enter the following commands
etst
enter test mode 

| uift 01    | use external frame synch                        |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| schn 79 79 | set desired channel in hex (0x79 = Ch 121)      |
| srfp 04    | set receiver on, bursted mode                   |
| quit       | quit SimpleTPI in order to run SBER application |

## 

2. Run SBER application from the command line: SBER <com port> ie SBER 1 
 100 sync <# frames>  00ff4b4b  
run SBER for # of frames with repeating pattern 
 
00 FF 4B 4B.  
example: 100 sync 10 00ff4b4b run SBER for 10 frames The SBER application shows the rsyn response message for each frame with either an "in sync: yes" or "in sync: no" response, followed by the first eight bytes of data received by the DUT.  The last response (RBER message) displays the received number of frames, number of bit errors in hex, and an invalid BER.  Percent BER must be calculated manually using the bit error count as described above.  See Section DQPSK Symbol Mapping for more details on the data pattern transmitted. If rsyn response is "frame in sync: No," the RF burst delay may need to be adjusted.  As stated previously the delay of the RF burst from the falling edge of the sync signal is ~58.4 mS. Bit Error Rate Calculation The SBER application displays the number of bit errors in decimal as "BER: XXX.XX%" but it is NOT a calculated percent BER.  The percent BER must be manually calculated.  The number of received data bits in a frame is equal to 358 (414 bits in a frame minus 56 bits for the preamble and unique word).  Percent BER is calculated using the following formula: 

Number of received bits per frame = 358 
Number of received frames = F 
Total number of bit errors = B 


## Measurement Procedure

1) Setup the test equipment as outlined in Figure 2-10 
2) Read and understand all section regarding the use of the SBER test program 
3) Run the test commands as indicated in Section Commands to Run the Bit Error 
Measurement 
4) Calculate the BER using the formula in Section *Bit Error Rate Calculation* 5) Validate that the transceiver under test satisfies less than 2% BER 
 

## 2.4.3.1.2.2.2 Receiver Sensitivity (Voice)

Reference: Section 2.2.3.1.2.2.1.2 
 
See Section 2.4.3.1.2.2.1. The 2% BER established in Section 2.4.3.1.2.2.1 shall also satisfy the voice sensitivity test requirement. The Iridium Reference E - Iridium Packet Error Rate Calculations Paper provides analysis of the FEC and other error correction aspects of the Iridium network which are based on the 2% BER of the Iridium transceiver.    

## 2.4.3.1.2.2.3 Test Method For Environmental Conditions Reference: Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.11

Receiver sensitivity testing is required to be repeated a large number of times over different environmental conditions (particularly in RF susceptibility and induced signal susceptibility).  
See Table 2-11 and Table 2-12 for information on DO-160G environmental testing requirements. 

As the receiver is mounted inside of "box" or housing, the mounting and housing specifications must protect the transceiver from the adverse environmental conditions as specified in DO-160G 
for the specific category of product. Testing of the AES under DO-160G requirements shall demonstrate baseline of system performance before, during and after environmental condition testing as required.  
See Section 2.4.3.1.2.2.1 for testing procedures while validating DO-160G environmental tests. 

As stated, the FEC in the satellite network is based on the transceiver maintaining less than 2% BER. Meeting this standard while undergoing DO-160G testing as per Section 2.4.3.1.2.2.1 is required. 

## 2.4.3.1.2.2.4 Receiver Bandwidth Reference: Section 2.2.3.1.2.2.2

No separate testing required. The Iridium transceiver is factory tested to verify bandwidth reception prior to shipment. This includes the full spectrum of Iridium bandwidth, including bandwidth that is released only in times of emergency usage.  

## 2.4.3.1.2.2.5 Rejection Of Signals Outside Ngss Receive Band Reference: Section 2.2.3.1.2.2.3

Notes: 1)
Specific testing of this section is available as an additional part of Iridium Certification
procedure. Special DVT testing is required using specific test equipment which is impractical 
for partners to acquire. Contact Iridium for support on the validation of this testing. The process below outlines the testing performed by Iridium. As an alternative, use of the 
operational Iridium constellation is allowable provided the considerations of Section 2.4.1.1.2 are met.

The Transceiver Test Controller, as indicated, is a PC based software package that
allows for frequency control of the Iridium transceiver. As an alternative, use of the operational Iridium constellation is allowable provided the considerations of Section 2.4.1.1.2 are met.

## Measurement Procedure

This is a two-part procedure.  In Part One, the receiver design is analyzed to identify potential analog image and spurious response frequencies and possible digitally-induced aliases.  In Part Two, the receiver is tested to determine if the receiver performance is degraded, causing loss of communications, by any of the signals identified in Part One. 

 

## Part One

1) Prior to the start of the test, analyze the transceiver under test to determine 
required input test frequencies.   
2) All IF and reference frequencies used within the transceiver must be known.   
3) Using these frequencies, calculate all frequencies within the ranges specified 
in Section 2.2.3.1.2.2.3, which have the potential to produce image or spurious signals. 
4) The calculations should include image frequencies and mixer harmonic 
intermodulation distortions through 11th order which are capable of 
producing IF frequencies used within the transceiver, or sub-harmonics of 
these IF frequencies, and such frequencies that may lead to digital aliasing problems or other spurious responses. 
 
Part Two This test will use the operational Iridium constellation where the full bandwidth is tested. Considerations of Section 2.4.1.1.2 must be met.  Tests should be timed to coincide with the worst case satellite geometry declared by the satellite system operator. It is anticipated that some NGSS-based AES equipment may use embedded transceiver devices for the underlying satellite network.  In such cases, transceiver manufacturer test data on the individual transceiver units may be an acceptable alternative to performing the tests at the AES level, provided that such data essentially reproduces the tests described below. Alternative testing using operational Iridium constellation are also indicated below. 

1) Setup the equipment as shown in Figure 2-11.
2) With the sweep generator off, use the Transceiver Test Controller to tune the
receiver to the operational frequency closest to 1

4) Sweep the frequency over the critical frequency sub-ranges identified in Part
One.  
5) Choose the sweep rate so that any satellite sub-network timers designed to
coast through interference bursts time out during the sweep of any specific sub-band.   
6) Verify that communications are not interrupted by observing that voice
connections are not lost and data connections maintain the desired user 
throughput rate.)

manufacturer's discretion to allow for tuning of the notch
7) Measure at Point D to validate specification or measure at Point C and
calculate the value at point D to take into account for the design of the AES.

## 2.4.3.2 Satellite Subnetwork Specific Test Requirements Reference: Section 2.2.3.2

The AES SDU design shall be tested and approved by Iridium Satellite before the SDU is approved for use on the Iridium network.   
SDUs with data capabilities shall be tested and approved by the aviation safety services SP 
(ASSP) before the equipment is authorized for use with the aviation safety service provider's ground server.  
SDUs with ACARS and/or ATN/CPDLC capability must be provided to the ATSP (e.g., ARINC, SITA, or other civil aviation authority approved SP) for qualification testing and approved before the equipment is authorized for use with the respective aviation terrestrial network(s). 

If the SDU fails to gain approval and must be modified, the unit must undergo regression testing by Iridium Satellite and each of the other SP's, as required, before the unit can receive final approval. 

The SDU manufacturer shall make available results of such network testing and approvals to civil aviation authorities as required to facilitate certification for safety services. 

A description of the SDU testing and approval process is shown in Figure 2-13.

## 

2.4.3.3 Priority, Precedence and Preemption The test procedures of the following subparagraphs assume that the AES is capable of serving both AMSS (Priority Level 1 [low] in Table 2-10) and AMS(R)S (Priority Level 2, Priority Level 
3, and Priority Level 4 [high]).  If the system being tested support solely AMS(R)S, references to Priority Level 1 may be replaced with Priority Level 2. Alternatively, compliance may be demonstrated by ensuring that there is no contention for shared channel resources for safety services. 

## 2.4.3.3.1 Packet Data

Reference: Section 2.2.3.3.1 This test shall use the priority establishing mechanism required by 2.2.3.3, as described by the AES manufacturer. 

 
Equipment Required This test requires the ability to establish ND simultaneous packet data channels using the AES 
under test.  This may require multiple AES control units or multiple digital interfaces from a single control unit.  Each interface must be capable of sustaining a bit rate of at 2R*SC-UD*.  If a single interface is used to control all ND packet data channels, that interface must be capable of sustaining a bit rate of 2(ND)R*SC-UD*. 

 

## Measurement Procedure

The precedence and preemption test procedures are designed to verify the AES's ability to determine the precedence of packet-mode data and preempt, if necessary, lower-priority air-toground data units (AGPDUs).  See Iridium Reference E Iridium Packet Error Rate Calculations Paper for more details on AGPDUs 

## 1. Data Communications Setup

Utilizing the appropriate SNAcP interface and commands, create ND independent packet data channels between the AES and either the system test simulator or an appropriate GES.  For the purpose of this test, label these independent channels Channel A, Channel B, etc.  (For the purposes of this test description, we will assume ND=4). 

## 2. Data Packets From Data Packets

This test verifies proper ordering of AGPDUs according to the link layer precedence of the data packets arriving at the AES. 

a.
Using the external interface send a message consisting of L*SNDP* +10 octets of data
over the established channels in the following order: Channel A, Channel C, Channel B, Channel D.  Fill the User Data Field with following patterns:

|           |      For          |     For     |   Pattern  |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| channel D | priority 4 (high) |             |  01010101  |
| channel C | priority 2        | 10101010    |            |
| channel B | priority 3        | 11001100    |            |
| channel A | priority 1 (low)  | 00110011    |            |

These packets shall be sent to the AES interface at the maximum rate supported by the external interface hardware. 

Verify that the AES sends data packets over the subnetwork in priority order, with higher priority packets transmitted first. 

c.
For equipment that does not support Priority Level 1 (low, non-safety)
communications, create a data stream that alternates the data fields from step (a) and the Priority 1 data stream from step (a).  Verify that only Priority 2, 3, and 4 packets are transmitted.

## 2.4.3.3.2 Circuit Mode Communications (Voice) Reference: Section 2.2.3.3.2

 
Equipment Required An ATS SIM card is required for each voice line participating in the ATS voice system in the system under test (Max 2 voice lines for ATS). The ATS SIM cards must be provisioned in the Iridium system for ATS service and, in the case of two ATS SIM cards, they must be linked in the setup as under the same ICAO code. This test, while not intended to verify the ability of the satellite network (or the satellite subnetwork) as a whole, will satisfy the Priority, Precedence and Preemption requirements of the MASPS.   
 
Test Procedure This test assumes that the AES is capable of one or two channels of simultaneous circuit-mode operation.  The number of channels shall be declared before the test is started. Perform the following steps: 
Note:  

1) The use of Priority Level in this procedure agrees with the details in Table 2-10. 2) Actual in use Priority Level convention should be used in place of those given in these 
steps to ensure the same testing of high vs. low priority.  
3) See the Iridium Reference G "ATS Operator Guide" for information on priority. 
4) GtA refers to ground-to-air and AtG refers to air-to-ground 
 
 
1) Establish N voice GtA calls at non-safety circuit-mode priority, Priority 
Level 1 (low), identified in Table 2-10 so that all lines are in use. 
2) While monitoring the Priority Level 1 (low) calls, attempt to establish a GtA 
call at Circuit-Mode Priority 2 identified in Table 2-10.   
3) Verify that one of the non-safety circuits is terminated and made available 
for the safety call, and that the call is completed. 
4) Repeat Step 2 until all channels are consumed by Priority 2 calls. 
5) Repeat Steps 2 and 3 with Priority 3 calls. 6) Repeat Steps 2 and 3 with Priority 4 (high) calls. 7) At the completion of Step 6, there will be N Priority 4 (high) calls established 
8) Attempt to initiate an GtA call at Priority 3, and verify that the call does not 
preempt an existing call and that the call is placed into Call Waiting status 
9) Attempt to initiate an GtA call at Priority 2, and verify that the call does not 
preempt a current in process call nor the call in Call Waiting. 
10) Attempt to initiate an GtA call at Priority 1 (low), and verify that the call 
does not preempt a current call nor the call in Call Waiting.  This step shall be performed for all equipment, including equipment that does not support Priority 1 (low) non-safety communications. 
11) Terminate a current call in process. Verify that the call in Call Waiting is 
connected. 
12) Terminate all calls, and re-establish Step 1 with Priority 1 (low) calls. 13) Repeat Steps 1 but first establish calls from AtG. Repeat steps 2 through 10 
and verify that the same results are obtained. 
 

## 2.4.3.4 Satellite Subnetwork Data Protocol (Satellite Layer 2)

If an algorithm other than the specific algorithm identified in this technique-specific attachment, including version and part number, is selected, it shall be the responsibility of the manufacturer to develop test procedures and documentary evidence that complete interoperability is achieved.  These procedures shall be approved by Iridium Satellite, the satellite network operator, prior to the start of testing.  Because of the complexity of such vocoder design and testing issues, these tests are not specifically identified in this attachment.

## 2.4.3.6 User Data Interfaces The Option Of Providing An Atn-Compliant Protocol Is Tested In Section 2.4.3.6.1.  The Option Of Providing An Acars Interface Is Tested In Section 2.2.3.6.2.  An Aes Utilizing Packet Data  Must Pass Either Or Both Sets Of Tests, Depending On The Capabilities Declared In This Normative Appendix.

If an ISO-8208 compliant interface is provided as the ATN interface, the tests are described in Appendix B of the DO-262 main document.  Satellite subnetwork-dependent validation is discussed in this normative appendix. 

## 2.4.3.6.1 Atn Interfaces Reference: Section 2.2.3.6.1

The requirements established in Section 2.2.3.6.1 concern the implementation of a Data Circuitterminating Equipment (DCE) interface on the digital side of the AES.  To verify the proper functionality of that interface, it is necessary to issue certain commands and analyze certain responses from both a simulated Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) external to the AES and from a corresponding simulated DTE external to the AES and from a corresponding simulated DTE 
 
external to the GES.  The means of verifying compliance involves using the satellite network directly, and examining the data at the output of the GES.  The potential exists to remotely access this information so that the entire testing is performed in a closed loop from a single location, as shown in Figure 2-14.  
 
Note: An alternative means of demonstration would be to probe the radio-frequency emissions of the AES, back out the satellite-network signal-in-space, Layer 1 and Layer 2 and possible Satellite Subnetwork Dependent Protocols, and confirm transmission of the proper DCE-DCE message traffic.  This approach requires the ability to simulate the signal processing of the entire satellite network, including its ground terminals and gateways to the public and private networks. 

 
Note: Use of the Active Satellite Sub-Network for performance testing is subject to the 
restrictions identified in Section 2.4.1.1.2. 

## 2.4.3.6.1.1 Join And Leave Requirements Reference: Section 2.2.3.6.1.1

 Verify that a Join event message in accordance with Section 2.2.3.6.1.1 is transmitted to the routing function upon determination of availability of the air/ground data link.  Similarly, verify that a Leave event message is transmitted upon determination of non-availability of the air/ground data link. 

 

## 2.4.3.6.1.2 Atn-Compliant Mapping For Priority, Precedence And Preemption Reference: Section 2.2.3.6.1.2

 This test establishes only that the satellite subnetwork properly maintains the subnetwork priority field, not that the priority, precedence and preemption mechanisms are implemented.  Perform the following steps: 

 
1) Using the standard packet data test setup up shown in Figure 2-14, use the PAG to 
send packets with values the priority field in the appropriate call set-up packet set to 
the value corresponding to the lowest priority.  Use the PAA to verify that the associated received packet contains the same value.  Verify that the priority is confirmed back to the PAG.  Use the appropriate procedure to clear the resulting call. 

2) Repeat Step 1 with values in the priority field set to increasing levels of priority.  For
systems capable of both safety and non-safety communications, verify that a 
minimum of four levels of priority are supported, in accordance with Table 2-10.  For 
systems capable of only safety communications, verify that a minimum of three 
levels of priority are supported, in accordance with Table 2-10. 
3) Repeat the Step 1 and Step 2 tests with the roles of the PAA and PAG reversed.

## 2.4.3.8 Recovery From Primary Power Interrupt Test Procedure

Reference: Section 2.2.3.8 
 
Equipment Required Oscilloscope Programmable Interruptible Power Supply This test requires access to the satellite network, in accordance with the constraints of Section 2.4.3.1.2.2. 

## Figure 2-15 Power Interruption Test Set-Up

Setup the equipment as shown in Figure 2-15.  Initiate a communications session in every mode 
(i.e., voice, packet data, circuit data) supported by the AES.  While continuously maintaining the communications session, monitor the receiver digital or audio output on the scope.  Apply power interruptions of 5 ms and observe no dropout of output whatsoever.  Apply 200 ms interruptions and verify that the output recovers within 5 seconds and verify the data link functions are unaffected.

## 2.4.3.10 Information Security Test Procedure Reference: Section 2.2.3.10

A plan for Security Verification in accordance with DO-326 Section 3.3.4 shall be developed and executed to verify that the security countermeasures designed in as a result of the Security Risk Assessment are effective. Verification shall include: 

•
Intended function tests for countermeasures
•
Robustness tests
•
Vulnerability tests

## 3 Installed Equipment Performance 3.1 Equipment Installation 3.1.1 Accessibility Controls And Monitors Provided For In-Flight Operation Shall Be Readily Accessible From The Appropriate Operator'S Normal Seated Position.  The Operator/Crew Member(S) Shall Have An Unobstructed View Of The Display(S) Or Controls When In The Normal Seated Position. 3.1.2 Aircraft Environment Equipment Shall Be Compatible With The Environmental Conditions Present In The Specific Location In The Aircraft Where The Equipment Is Installed.

3.1.3 Display Visibility All installed system displays shall be readily visible and readable from the operator's/crew member's normal position in all ambient lighting conditions for which system use is required. 

Note: Visors, glareshields, or filters may be an acceptable means of obtaining daylight visibility. 

## 3.1.4 Inadvertent Turn-Off

Where controls for transceiver operation are provided, they shall be equipped with adequate protection against inadvertent turn off. 

## 3.1.5 Failure Protection Any Probable Failure Of The Equipment Shall Not Degrade The Normal Operation Of Equipment Or Systems That Are Connected To It.  Likewise, The Failure Of Interfaced Equipment Or Systems Shall Not Induce Failures Of This Equipment. 3.1.6 Interface Interference Effects The Equipment Shall Not Be The Source Of Harmful Conducted Or Radiated Interference, And Shall Not Be Affected By Conducted Or Radiated Interference From Other Equipment Or Systems Installed In The Aircraft. 3.1.7 Aircraft Power Source The Voltage And Frequency Tolerance Characteristics Of The Equipment Shall Be Compatible With The Aircraft Power Source Of Appropriate Category As Specified In Rtca Do-160G. 3.1.8 Antenna Location/Installation

 Note: This requirement is only applicable under the conditions described in Section 2.1.8. Due to the potential for harmful interference from a simultaneously transmitting Inmarsat SATCOM transceiver, it is suggested that installers allow a minimum of 45 feet separation between the Inmarsat system antenna and the Iridium system antenna. Unless otherwise authorized by the equipment manufacturer, the Iridium antenna must be mounted on a level horizontal plane, such as on the top centerline of the aircraft fuselage.  Any deviation from this requirement must demonstrate compliance with the weighted average gain requirement of Section 2.2.3.1.1.1.3 when measured over a ground plane with a radius of curvature representative of the intended installation. 

## 3.1.9 Co-Location With Other Iridium Satcom Systems

When co-locating more than one Iridium SATCOM system on one aircraft, the location of antenna required  shall be considered: 

- If more than one exterior mounted antenna needs to be installed, they need to be spaced
far enough apart so as to avoid distortion of the antenna beams. - Advice should be sought from antenna manufactures if planned separation is less than 1m. 

## 3.2 Installed Equipment Performance Requirements

The installed equipment shall meet the requirements of Section 2.0 in addition to the requirements stated below.  To meet the requirements of this section, test results supplied by the equipment manufacturer may be accepted in lieu of tests performed by the equipment installer. 

However, performance characteristics that cannot be tested by the equipment manufacturer shall be tested by the installer.  These include: (1) performance characteristics of equipment required for the transceiver installation that have not been tested or verified by the manufacturer, and (2) interactions with other equipment installed on the aircraft. 

## 3.2.1 Radiated Antenna Intermodulation Products In Ams(R)S Bands

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Note: This requirement is only applicable under the conditions described in Section 2.1.8. 

When operating with two unmodulated carriers anywhere within the frequency band with each carrier TMN
f to TMX
f
, each carrier having the maximum allowable single carrier power permitted by Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2 of this document, the antenna subsystem shall not radiate internally generated intermodulation products in a direction toward a likely location(s) of antenna(s) on the same aircraft serving other AMS(R)S systems so as to cause a average power level that increases the effective noise temperature of the other AMS(R)S system by more than 6%  In this condition, the other antenna is taken to be a quarter-wave monopole antenna matched to its load and the isolation between the AES antenna and the AMS(R)S antenna is taken to be 40 dB.  

## 3.2.2 Declaration Of Additional Isolation

Extensive testing has shown that any intermodulation products generated by two or more Iridium channels operating simultaneously are significantly below the levels that could cause any interference to GNSS systems on the same aircraft if proper installation procedures and guidelines are followed. 

## 3.3 Conditions Of Test

The following Sections define conditions under which the tests specified in Section 3.4 shall be conducted. 

## 3.3.1 Power Input Tests May Be Conducted Either With The Equipment Powered By The Aircraft'S Electrical Power Generation System Or By An Appropriate External Power Source Connected To The Aircraft. 3.3.2 Environment

During the tests, the equipment shall not be subjected to environmental conditions that exceed those in RTCA/DO-160G as specified by the equipment manufacturer. 

## 3.3.3 Adjustment Of Equipment

Iridium systems, by design, incorporate an L-Band Transceiver module that does not provide facilities for alignment or adjustment by the operator.  Therefore, no alignment or adjustment will be performed prior to application of the specified tests. 

## 3.3.4 Warm-Up Period

Unless otherwise specified, tests shall be conducted after a warm-up (stabilization) period of twenty (20) minutes. 

## 3.4 Test Procedures For Installed Equipment Performance

The following test procedures provide one means of determining installed equipment performance.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that the installing activity may prefer alternate procedures, which may be used if they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. 

## 3.4.1 Conformity Inspection

Visually inspect the installed equipment to determine the use of acceptable workmanship and engineering practices.  Verify that proper mechanical and electrical connections have been made and that the equipment has been located and installed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. 

## 3.4.2 Interference Tests

 Unless otherwise specified, all aircraft electrically-operated equipment and systems shall be on, using the aircraft's electrical power generating equipment before conducting interference tests. With the transceiver operating, including transmission of messages and voice calls, individually operate each of the other electrically-operated aircraft equipment and systems to determine that no significant conducted or radiated interference exists.  Evaluate all reasonable combinations of control settings and operating modes.  Operate communication and navigation equipment on at a minimum the low, high, and a mid-band, frequencies. Operate the aircraft controls (e.g., flaps) through their range to activate all associated aircraft systems which may cause electrical power fluctuations. 

 
Notes: 

1. 
Some aircraft contain cooling fans to augment airflow under certain low-speed 
conditions.  These fans are activated with flaps extended and low- to mid-throttle, and cause aircraft power fluctuations when activated. 2. 
See Section 3.4.4 for requirements for message generation. 
 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The equipment shall not be the source of harmful conducted or radiated interference, and shall not be affected by conducted or radiated interference from other equipment or systems installed in the aircraft. 

Adequate protection of on-board GNSS equipment from harmful interference due to equipment meeting the requirements of Section 2 is based on an average power level not exceeding –122 
dBm referenced to the port of the GNSS antenna, the spectral width of the interfering signal(s) lies in the range of 100 to 1000 kHz. 

Notes: 

3.
In a typical installation, this could be achieved if:
a) the transceiver meets all requirements of Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, 2.2.3.1.2.1.4,
2.2.3.1.2.1.5; 
b) the isolation between AMSS and GNSS antennas is not less than 55 dB; and c)
interfering intermodulation products generated external to the transceiver do not
increase the average power level referenced to the port of the GNSS antenna by more than 1.5 dB. 
4.
Interference problems noted upon installation of this equipment may result from such
factors as the design characteristics of previously installed systems or equipment and the 
physical installation itself.  It is not intended that the equipment manufacturer design for all installation environments.  The installing facility will be responsible for resolving any incompatibility between this equipment and previously installed equipment in the aircraft. 
Note: The following requirement is only applicable under the conditions described in Section 
2.1.8. 

If the equipment is installed on an airframe as part of a "dual-dissimilar" satellite communications suite, the following test procedures shall be performed.  In the following discussions, "SATCOM 
A" refers to the system covered by this MOPS, for which installed equipment tests are currently being performed, while "SATCOM B" refers to the other satellite communications system.  It is possible that this document and a particular technique-specific appendix may apply to the SATCOM B system, as well. 

If the SATCOM B system consists of Inmarsat AES equipment compliant with RTCA/DO-210D, all changes, or ARINC Characteristic 741, or ARINC Characteristic 781, owners, operators, and installers are specifically referred to the limitations identified in Section 1.1.4 of this document. The following SATCOM A / SATCOM B interference tests (Sections 3.4.2.2 and 3.4.2.3) shall be performed only when the intention of operation of the equipment(s) is to provide simultaneous independent operation of Iridium AMS(R)S and Inmarsat AMS(R)S and/or AMSS equipment.  If such simultaneous independent operation is not desired, the SATCOM A/SATCOM B interference tests identified in the following sections need not be performed. 

## 3.4.2.1 Antenna Isolation If The Declared Isolation Between The Ams(R)S And Any Gnss Antenna Is Greater Than 55 Db, In Accordance With The Provisions Of Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, The Installed Isolation Shall Be Tested For Each Aircraft Installation. 3.4.2.2 Satcom B Interference To Satcom A Note: This Requirement Is Only Applicable Under The Conditions Described In Section 2.1.8. Perform The Following Steps:

1. 

With SATCOM B inactive, establish a voice call on SATCOM A. Verify that the call is maintained when SATCOM B is switched on and commanded to initiate a packet mode communications session, if appropriate.  Verify that the SATCOM A voice call is maintained when the SATCOM B transfers a package message of 4000 octets containing random binary data.  Terminate the SATCOM B packet mode communications session and verify that the SATCOM A voice call is maintained. 

 
2. 

Repeat the process of Step 1 with SATCOM B circuit mode data communications, if appropriate. 

3. 

Repeat the process of Step 1 with SATCOM B voice communications if, appropriate. 

 
4. 

Repeat the process of Steps 1, 2, and 3, with SATCOM A circuit switched data communications. 

5. 

Repeat the process of Steps 1, 2, and 3, with SATCOM A Short Burst Data (SBD) 
communications.  Test the ability of SATCOM A to perform 10 SBD transactions of at least 220 bytes each. 

6. 

With SATCOM A inactive, initiate a SATCOM B packet mode communications session.  
Transmit a series of test messages of 4000 octets each.  While the transmission is in progress, activate the SATCOM A.  Verify that SATCOM A can acquire the network.  
Verify that the AES can initiate and sustain a SATCOM A voice call lasting 60 seconds during SATCOM B packet mode operations.  Verify that the AES can properly terminate its voice call. 

 
7. 

Repeat Step 6 with SATCOM A operating in circuit switched data mode, if applicable.  
Verify that SATCOM A can initiate and complete a transaction by transmitting a 4000 
octets message.  Verify that the AES can properly terminate it circuit switched data call. 

 
8. 

Repeat Step 6 with SATCOM A operating in SBD mode, if applicable.  Verify that SATCOM A can perform 10 SBD transactions of at least 220 bytes each.  Verify that the AES can properly terminate each SBD transaction. 

3.4.2.3 SATCOM A Interference to SATCOM B 
 
Note:  This requirement is only applicable under the conditions described in Section 2.1.8. Repeat the tests of the previous section with the roles of SATCOM A and SATCOM B reversed.  
This will make SATCOM B the victim and SATCOM A the interferer. 

 

## 3.4.3 Power Fluctuation Tests

Transceiver aircraft power sources shall be cycled through all normal configurations to verify that the transceiver performance for power interruption recovery during and after power changeover is satisfactory with no discernible abnormal operation (Reference Section 2.2.7). 

Note: 
In-transit data service packets which have been acknowledged on either the DTE or DCE interface, but not yet transferred to the opposite interface, may be lost.  Non-transceiver higher layer entities which employ end-to-end acknowledgment protocols may choose to retransmit such lost data. 

## 3.4.4 Ground Test Procedures

Perform the ground test portions of tests defined in manufacturer's installation instructions. 

## 3.4.5 Flight Test Procedures

Flight tests of installed systems are desirable to confirm or supplement bench and ground tests of installed performance.  Flight tests may be defined in the manufacturer's installation instructions. 

## 3.4.6 Installed System Performance Verification 3.4.6.1 Installed Functionality Performance Of The Installed Avionics, Consisting Of The Antenna Subsystem And The Transceiver Subsystem, Should Be Verified In Accordance With The Manufacturer'S Instructions.  The Following General Functional Categories Shall Be Validated:

Subnetwork Physical Layer - Verify by initiating and terminating multiple communications sessions in all applicable modes and with all applicable channels.  This test shall include test of the maximum capability of NV and ND simultaneous communications channels as declared by the manufacturer. 

Network Management Tests - Verify the ability of the AES to acquire and register with the network from a cold start.  Verify that the AES performs the appropriate registration or log-on functions as specified in the technique-specific appendix.  If multiple data channels are available, verify that they can be assigned and released as required. 

Message Transfer Tests - For all operational modes (e.g., voice, circuit switched data, and SBD) ensure that the AES can initiate and receive data and sustain communications in its installed environment.  Voice calls should extend for at least five minutes.  Circuit switched data transfers should include at least 4000 octets in each direction.  SBD transactions should be at least 220 bytes in length. 

Circuit Mode Services - Verify that the mechanism for selecting, dialing, and releasing a circuit are operational.  Verify that the mechanisms for accepting, and rejecting an incoming call are through operator action operational. 

## 3.4.6.2 Installed Antenna Coverage The Antenna Tests Of Section 2.4.3.1.1 Provide Sufficient Verification Of Coverage For Top-Mounted Antenna Installation Using Non-Steered Antennas With Essentially Hemispherical Patterns.  These Installations Are Expected To Be The Common Installation For Most Platforms. 4 Equipment Operational Performance Characteristics

 AMSS AES installations are expected to be accomplished in a variety of ways to fit the aircraft equipment and intended usage.  This will also be the case with associated cockpit interfaces.  The requirements of this section shall be suitably interpreted for the particular installation under consideration. 

## 4.1 Operational Performance Requirements

 The following sections identify requirements to ensure the operator that operations can be conducted safely and reliably in the expected operational environment. 

## 4.1.1 Power Input

Prior to flight, the primary power must be available for proper operation. 

## 4.1.2 Communications Displays

The required display(s) for the selection of various communication modes/functions of operation shall be available for use. 

## 4.1.3 Communications Controls

Cockpit control(s) required for proper operation of the equipment shall be available for use. 

## 4.1.4 System Operational Indication

Communication failure or degradation below minimum acceptable performance shall be readily discernible. 

## 4.1.5 Equipment Operating Limitations

Equipment operating limitations of the aircraft Earth station should be contained in the aircraft flight manual. 

## 4.2 Test Procedures For Operational Performance Requirements

 Operational equipment tests may be conducted as part of normal preflight tests.  For those tests which can only be run in flight, procedures should be developed to perform these tests as early in the flight as possible to verify that the equipment is performing its intended function(s). 

## 4.2.1 Power Input

With the aircraft's electrical power generating system operating, energize the equipment and verify that electrical power is available to the equipment. 

## 4.2.2 Communications Displays

With the equipment operating, verify that the required display(s) are operational. 

## 4.2.3 Communications Controls

The communications control(s) shall be operated, as required, to verify satisfactory equipment response. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 4.2.4 System Operational Indication

System operational readiness shall be monitored either by means of Built-In-Test-Equipment 
(BITE) and/or by suitable preflight tests contained in a check list or flight manual.  All equipment failure annunciators shall be tested during preflight tests to verify proper operation. 

## 5 Aes Classification Configuration And Test Reference

Different classes of AES configurations are outlined in Sections 2.2.1.1 through 2.2.1.3. The classes defined are AES1, AES2 and AES3.  These classes are defined by the antenna type and all are based on a single Iridium antenna for both transmitting and receiving Iridium Satellite signals. AES1 and AES2 require a passive antenna while an AES3 requires either a passive or active antenna. 

## 5.1 Aes Configurations

Developers may desire to include more than one AES class into a single unit for installation in an aircraft.  Such a design will require an independent antenna path for each AES class. Such an installation is different from the AES3 class where N transceivers share a single active antenna. For clarity, the following table identifies the expected combination of AES classes.  
All AES classes shall support AMS(R)S (voice and/or data) services nut may also support AMSS 
non-safety (voice and/or data) communication. See Section 2.2.2 for more information on AES classes. 

## Note:

1) While the table outlines the most likely combinations, in theory a single unit could be
configured with N transceivers with equal number N antenna connections. The same requirements would apply for intermodulation and other for multiple AES configurations.
2) If more than one AES is combined into a design, each AES must be certified
independently and in combination of intermodulation requirements for multi-channel
system given simultaneous transmit capability of separate AES class.

## Appendix E - Normative Requirements For Inmarsat Swiftbroadband Ams(R)S Equipment 1 Introduction 1.1 Scope And Objectives

This appendix to DO-262 provides information and requirements specific to an Aircraft Earth Station (AES) using the Inmarsat SwiftBroadband system for the purpose of providing Aeronautical Mobile Satellite (Route) Service (AMS(R)S). The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) reserve the designation "(Route)" for services related to the "priority and regularity of flights along national and international air routes". This appendix forms a "technique-specific appendix" to DO-262.  It provides information about the Inmarsat SwiftBroadband service provided over the Inmarsat satellite network.  As required by the main body of DO-262, a normative section of the appendix provides the detailed requirements and test procedures for an AES providing SwiftBroadband service to an aircraft. Compliance with these requirements and test procedures is intended to provide one means of providing evidence for certification or other approval of an AES for SwiftBroadband AMS(R)S.  Alternative means of compliance that provide equivalent information are acceptable. 

The performance requirements for the end-to-end communications network, as shown in Figure 1-1, are contained in the MASPS [6].  The MASPS aims to comply with data link requirements in the ICAO Global Operational Data Link Document (GOLD) [7] document and the voice link requirement in the ICAO 
Satellite Voice Guidance Material (SVGM) [8].   This appendix aims to define requirements for the AES which are harmonized with the MASPS, GOLD and SVGM documents. 

The focus of this appendix is on ensuring that the AES will functionally deliver the intended services over the AMS(R)S network, without necessarily exploring all the detail of the underlying mechanisms which enable the service. 

A graphical representation of the requirements for the AES is shown in Figure 1-2.  The focus in this appendix is on ensuring correct behavior of the AES at the services interfaces, where the user avionics interact with the AES, and at the signals-in-space interface, where the AES has desired interaction with the network, and potentially undesired interaction with other aircraft systems and the outside world.  For this reason this appendix contains much detail on the radio characteristics at the physical layer.  Likewise, there is ample detail of the observable behavior of the AES at the AMS(R)S service application level. The details of the protocol layers (Layers 2 and 3) between the physical layer and the service applications are defined in great detail in the Inmarsat SDM [1], and verified by performing Inmarsat MTRs [2].  These layers are verified as part of the Inmarsat Type Approval process.  Evidence of Inmarsat's approval is considered sufficient evidence that these layers operate correctly.  Furthermore, the verification at service level which is provided by this appendix gives further evidence that the underlying layers are operating as intended. 

Key aspects of the MASPS [6] deal with various parameters related to availability and latency of the communication capabilities offered by the end-toend network.  Portions of these key parameters have been allocated to the AES, and are specified in this appendix.  Referring to Figure 1-1, these allocated parameters apply between points B and C in forward (ground-to-air) direction and points F and G in the return (air-to-ground) direction. AES management functions (see Figure 1-2) which are important to AMS(R)S are also described, for example satellite handovers and handling of short power outages. 

The emissions requirements in this appendix ensure compliance to the requirements of ETSI EN 301 473 [9].  This appendix provides requirements conveniently extracted and interpreted from ETSI EN 301 473 [9].  The text of this appendix therefore makes minimal reference to ETSI EN 301 473. 

## 1.2 Document Overview

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Section 1 of this appendix provides an informative description of the Inmarsat SwiftBroadband network, focusing on aspects particular to AMS(R)S (also known as "SBB Priority Services").  Section 1 is aimed at providing background knowledge required to understand the normative requirements for the AES, contained in the subsequent sections.  Section 1 therefore does not include any normative requirements. Section 2 contains the SwiftBroadband-specific normative performance requirements and test procedures for testing of the equipment before installation onto an aircraft.  The section is divided into general requirements (Section 2.1), performance requirements (Section 2.2), performance to be verified under environmental conditions (Section 2.3) and equipment verification procedures (Section 2.4).  These sections are organized based on the numbering and format of the DO-262 document. Section 3 contains requirements that apply when planning and executing an installation and type certification (TC or STC) of a specific AES on a specific aircraft type. Section 4 gives guidance when verifying operational performance of equipment already installed on an aircraft. This appendix makes frequent use of references to the Inmarsat System Definition Manual (SDM) [1] in order to harmonize requirements for Inmarsat Type Approval and MOPS testing.  This is particularly prevalent in Section 2.2.3 
(Detailed Requirements). Similarly, the Inmarsat Mandatory Test Requirements (MTRs) are frequently referenced in individual subsections of Section 2.4 (Equipment Performance Verification Procedures).  This is done to avoid unnecessary duplication of tests. 

## 1.2.1 Applicable Documents

The detailed description of the SwiftBroadband service and the BGAN network is contained in Inmarsat proprietary documents.  The RTCA proprietary disclaimer notice, at the beginning of the DO-262 document, applies to these referenced documents.  The documents may be obtained from Inmarsat PLC in London under a non-disclosure agreement. 

The specific versions of these documents listed below should be used.  Where later versions are used, applicants may be required to ensure that the requirements of the listed versions are still met.

## 1.3 System Design And Description 1.3.1 Swiftbroadband System Overview

This section provides a brief overview of the SwiftBroadband system.  A more complete description is given in the MASPS [6]. 

The Inmarsat SBB-Safety system provides data and voice communication services that will enable widespread implementation of the 30-30nmi separation standards for oceanic operations along international air routes.  Data communication (using ACARS) complies with the RCP240 and RSP180 requirements in GOLD [7], while voice communications complies with the RCP400/V and RSP400/V requirements in SVGM [8]. 

SBB is composed of four segments: 

•
Airborne (or user) segment known as an Aircraft Earth Station (AES).
•
The satellites.
•
The Inmarsat ground infrastructure.
•
The Communication Network Provider's (CNP's) ground infrastructure.
The SBB data and voice communication services described in this appendix are delivered between the AES avionics interface and the CNPs' ATSP interfaces as shown in Figure 1-1.  Although not shown in the figure, the CNPs also deliver voice and data services to airlines, for operational communications with their aircraft fleet. SBB is delivered over the Inmarsat-4 satellites (3 satellites launched between 
2005 and 2008) and the Alphasat satellite (launched in 2013) using user links in the L band and feeder links in C band.  The satellites are geostationary with inclination typically less than 3 degrees, and provide worldwide coverage with the exception of polar regions.  Key aspects of the I4 satellites are a single 9m aperture antenna and a transparent, bent-pipe, digital signal processor (DSP) that performs the channelization and beam forming functions.  Each satellite provides a global beam, 19 regional beams and typically 192 narrow spot beams. 

Alphasat has a similar architecture, but has a larger antenna aperture. Three classes of SBB AES are defined: 

•
AES4 which uses an Enhanced Low Gain Antenna (ELGA).
•
AES7 which uses an Intermediate Gain Antenna (IGA).
•
AES6 which uses a High Gain Antenna (HGA).

Inmarsat owns and operates the satellite ground infrastructure and delivers traffic at Meet Me Points (MMPs) to CNPs such as ARINC and SITA.  The CNPs provide key elements of the end-to-end ACARS and Voice service and deliver traffic to ATSPs and airlines. 

The Aeronautical service offered by the satellites is known as SwiftBroadband (SBB).  SBB shares the same satellite and ground infrastructure that is used to deliver similar services to the land and maritime segments.  Collectively the service is known as BGAN (Broadband Global Area Network) and this term is often used to describe the totality of the system across all market segments.  The maritime service is known as FleetBroadband. 

BGAN is based on UMTS 3G technology and delivers standard 3G voice and IP data services.  In addition, gateway functions are included that utilize the 3G bearer services to provide the ACARS service and the Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) component of the voice service. An AES may be designed to offer automatic reversion to the Classic Aero service as described in Section 1.3.9. The AES provides voice and data communications interfaces to the avionics on the aircraft (see Figure 1-1).  The AES connects to the Satellite Service Provider 
(Inmarsat) ground network through the satellite constellation.  A Communication Network Provider delivers these services to the Air Traffic Service Provider (ATSP).  The AES is responsible for maintaining its allocated portion of the endto-end performance parameters between its boundaries at points F and G for airto-ground communications and points B 
and C 
for ground-to-air communications. 

## 1.3.2 Services Provided By Swiftbroadband

Figure 1-3 gives an overview of the priority services and non-priority services provided by SwiftBroadband.  The priority services are described below in Section 1.3.2.1 and its subsections.  Non-priority services are described in Section 1.3.2.2. 

## 1.3.2.1 Priority Services

The SBB safety system is capable of providing the priority services described in the following subparagraphs to aircraft within the declared antenna coverage volume.  A more detailed description of the priority services may be found in the MASPS [6]. 

## 1.3.2.1.1 Acars Data Service

The ACARS data service is a high availability data service, protected by priority and pre-emption, supporting ATS and AOC ACARS applications.  ACARS precedence is established by a higher level entity, typically the CMU and the ACARS network.  The interface to the CMU is typically Williamsburg protocol over ARINC 429.  Both the air and ground side interfaces are typically the same as for Classic Aero and hence the use of Classic Aero or SBB for ACARS can be transparent to pilots and ground users.  The service handles one ACARS block at a time to an aircraft due to the inherent ACARS limitation of being a 'stop and wait' protocol. 

## 1.3.2.1.2 Voice Service

The voice service provides one or two channels of priority voice to the cockpit. In addition, the following security provisions are provided: ciphering on the air interface to provide confidentiality, and use of PINs on ground to air calls to restrict access to calling the cockpit from non-authorized callers.  The interface to the flight deck avionics is typically analog 4 wire voice and ARINC 429 control from an MCDU or similar function.  Both the air and ground side interfaces are typically the same as for Classic Aero, including addressing using the ICAO 24-
bit aircraft address, and hence the use of Classic Aero or SBB for voice is typically transparent to pilots and ground users.  Calls to and from the cockpit are protected by priority, precedence and preemption - in the AES as well as on the network. 

## 1.3.2.1.3 Priority Ip Service

The Priority IP Data service supports IP based applications that require a timely and prioritized service compared to the non-priority SBB IP service.  Examples are: 

•
Meteorological applications
•
Engine data
•
Flight data downloaded after a critical event
•
ATS applications
•
AOC applications
•
Access to ATN over satellite
Both fixed rate (streaming) and variable bit rate (standard) IPv4 services are provided. The standard IP service class is a variable bit rate IP service, also known as background class.  Capacity is allocated dynamically by the network on the basis of the user's demand, the user's current link quality and the competing demands of other users sharing the same L-Band frequency in the same spot-beam.  The background class connection provides reliable in-order delivery over the satellite, i.e. any data lost due to random errors on the radio link is automatically retransmitted and re-ordered by the SBB infrastructure before being presented to the user. The streaming class IP service is a fixed bit rate IP service.  The user sets the bit rate at the start of the connection and this rate is fixed for the duration of that connection.  This class is designed for real-time applications that benefit from low delay variations but can tolerate a somewhat higher packet error rate. 

## 1.3.2.2 Non-Priority Services

Depending on the configuration of the AES, it may be capable of providing the following non-priority services:  

•
multiple voice calls
•
background class IP data connections
•
streaming class IP data connections
An AES can also be designed or configured to provide non-priority services only.   
Because all AMS(R)S services are supported within the prioritized services, nonpriority services are outside the scope of this appendix. 

## 1.3.3 Space Segment

The Inmarsat I4 network consists of three satellites (in 2012).  A new satellite (Alphasat) is planned to replace the existing Europe- Middle East-Africa 
(EMEA) satellite, which in turn will become an in-orbit spare.  Being geostationary, the satellites are nominally positioned over the equator, approximately equally spaced and in fixed positions.  Each of the three satellites provides three beam types, distinguished by the size of their footprints: Global, regional and narrow spot beams. The satellites provide service specified down to 5 degree satellite elevation, as viewed from the AES.  Near the poles, however, the beams are extended below the 5 degree limit.  This reduces the uncovered area at the poles to a very small percentage of the earth's surface. The global and regional spot beams are used to support some of the older Inmarsat services (including the Aero H+ service) and also support call set-up procedures for the BGAN services.  The narrow spot beams are used by the BGAN services.  A 3-color frequency re-use scheme is used for the regional beams, whilst a 4-color scheme is used on the more densely packed narrow spot beams. Figure 1-4 and Figure 1-5 show examples of global, regional beams and narrow spot beams.  Inmarsat has the ability to reconfigure spot beams based on changing requirements.

## 1.3.4 Airborne Segment

The airborne segment, known as the Aircraft Earth Station (AES), is the subject of this appendix.  Performance requirements for the AES are given in Sections 2, 
3 and 4 of this appendix.  The AES consists of all the functionality to translate between the RF signal in space and the baseband voice and data interfaces to and from the aircraft. 

The key main functions of the AES are: 

- 
Antenna 
- 
Diplexer / Low-noise Amplifier (DLNA) 
- 
High Power RF Amplifier 
- 
Up/ down converters 
- 
Modem, or multiple modems 
- 
ACARS gateway 
- 
VoIP gateway 
- 
Data interfaces 
- 
Voice interfaces 
The AES and its main functions are shown in Figure 1-6.  The main functions are discussed in the remainder of this section. 

Antenna  
For a SwiftBroadband AES, the antenna is required to have directional gain, and therefore a steered beam is required.  The amount of gain required depends on the class of AES.  The beam is pointed at the satellite despite changes in the aircraft's position and attitude.  Typically the AES receives position, altitude, attitude and velocity data from the aircraft's avionics.  Antennas are typically either steered mechanically or electrically using a phased antenna array. 

DLNA 
The SwiftBroadband system uses full duplex communications - transmitting and receiving simultaneously in different frequency bands, as shown in Figure 1-7.  
The diplexer is a pair of filters which prevent the transmitter from interfering with the operation of the receiver.  The low-noise amplifier is typically closecoupled with the receive filter in the diplexer to achieve a low noise figure.  The diplexer also provides out-of-band rejection which prevents mutual interference between the AES and other radio systems on or near the aircraft, for example the GNSS systems on the aircraft. 

High-Power Amplifier (HPA) 
The HPA amplifies the transmitted signal to the appropriate power level.  The output power is carefully managed to achieve near-constant received power density levels at the satellite.  The HPA is linear, to allow transmission of complex modulation schemes.  In the case of a multi-channel AES, increased linearity is required from the HPA to suppress intermodulation products that may be formed in the HPA. 

Modem The modem performs the modulation and demodulation functions in the AES. For SwiftBroadband the modem is required to be agile, switching on command between frequencies, modulation modes and forward error correcting codes.  The modulator is required to transmit bursts of data according to the return burst schedule allocated by the network.  This agility allows the BGAN network to dynamically allocate spectrum and other resources on demand.  It also allows the network to assign resources to priority services, even when demand is high.   
The radio bearer handled by the modem may be used to transfer a multiplexed data stream, providing multiple services like voice, ACARS and IP data over one transmit and one receive bearer at a time. An AES6 or AES7 may have one or more modems for single or multi-channel operation as required.  An AES4 only contains one modem.  Priority services only require one modem.  Additional modems typically provide non-priority services. 

ACARS Gateway The ACARS Airborne Gateway (AAGW) is typically a software function in the AES.  In the air-to-ground direction the AAGW encapsulates ACARS messages sent from the aircraft avionics into data packets which are then sent to the modem for transmission to the ACARS Ground Gateway (AGGW).  The data packets contain additional information for error checking and time stamping of messages. Data packets containing ACARS messages are sent through a dedicated priority background PDP context.  This PDP context is set up when the AES starts up, and forms a virtual connection between the AAGW and the AGGW.   
In the ground-to-air direction the reverse operation is performed by the AAGW. 

Time stamping of data packets allows measurement of latency between the AAGW and the AGGW. The aircraft avionics only send one ACARS message at a time, and then waits for confirmation from the ground.  The ACARS gateway in the AES therefore does not arbitrate on priority of different ACARS messages. 

VoIP Gateway Every SwiftBroadband modem provides a single circuit-switched voice channel using an AMBE+2 voice codec.   Furthermore, at least one voice channel using Voice over IP (VoIP) technology is provided per AES.  These two voice channels enable two voice  calls (telephone calls) for the flight deck. The VoIP facility is provided by a VoIP gateway in the AES, which connects to a VoIP gateway on the ground.  The airborne VoIP gateway sets up a background priority PDP context at start-up for signaling related to the priority VoIP call.  A streaming context is set up on demand to handle the voice sample stream. 

Apart from the two voice channels for the flight deck, an AES may provide for additional VoIP channels, which would typically be used outside the flight deck. 

Data Interfaces ACARS messages are normally sent to and from the aircraft avionics through an ARINC 429 interface.  Ethernet ports are typically used to interface IP data to the AES.  Other formats such as Wi-Fi are also possible. 

Voice Interfaces An industry-standard interface between the AES and the flight deck audio system is described in ARINC 781.  The interface emulates, in broad terms, the speaker / microphone / PTT interface of a VHF radio transceiver.  Additional discrete lines provide for visual and audible indication of incoming calls.  Other interfaces are possible. 

Avionics Interfaces Other interfaces to aircraft avionics may be required for the AES to receive information such as aircraft speed, position and attitude, weight on wheels etc. Additional functions like built-in testing, software loading etc. may be supported. These functions may vary in different AES designs, and are not prescribed in this appendix. 

AES Control The AES control function is responsible for internal AES management, including such tasks as initializing and assigning modem resources, controlling high power amplifier output power, controlling or directing antenna steering, self-test, fault isolation, etc.  The actual implementation of these functions is manufacturerdependent.  Tests for the correct operation of such functions are inherent in the functional tests defined in Section 2.4 of this appendix, therefore, the control function is not separately or explicitly tested. 

AES Configuration The main functions of the AES may be grouped and packaged in a variety of formats.  The format of an AES is not prescribed by this appendix.  ARINC Characteristic 781 describes a typical implementation of the AES which consists, for the large form factor variant, of an antenna, a Diplexer/Low Noise Amplifier (DLNA), a Satellite Data Unit (SDU), an SDU Configuration Module (SCM), and an optional Flange Mount High Power Amplifier (FMHPA).  A small form factor variant is also described in ARINC Characteristic 781 which consists of a small antenna, a Compact Satellite Data Unit (CSDU), an SDU Configuration Module (SCM), and an optional High Power Amplifier/Low Noise Amplifier/Diplexer (HLD). Information security requirements may be found in DO-326 [10] and suggested architectures may be found in ARINC Characteristic 781 Attachment 8, which shows methods of segregation of different information domains that are sharing a common SBB modem or 'channel card'. 

## 1.3.5 Air Interface

The purpose-designed air interface is known as IAI-2 (Inmarsat Air Interface 2).  
Right hand circular polarization is used for both the forward (ground-to-air) and return (air-to-ground) user links. 

## 1.3.5.1 Frequency Range

The forward user link (to aircraft) operates in the frequency range 1518- 1559MHz (Extended plus Standard L-Band).  Some AES equipment and the I4 satellites only support a frequency range of 1525-1559MHz (Standard L-band). The return user link (air-to-ground) operates in the frequency range 1626.5- 1660.5 and 1668-1675MHz (Extended plus Standard L-band).  Some AES equipment and the I4 satellites only support a frequency range of 1626.5- 1660.5MHz. Alphasat supports the full frequency range, known as Extended L-band or "XL 
band" plus Standard L-Band.  The XL band will not be used outside the Alphasat footprint.  Multi-channel equipment is not expected to operate in the XL band. 

The band layout, as well as some neighboring spectrum allocations, is shown in Figure 1-7, although it does not reflect all of the shared service allocations or other services in use in the neighboring bands. 

Note: ICAO WG-F agreed in March 2013 that use of the Extended L Band (1518-
1525 MHz and 1668-1675 MHz) for AMS(R)S operations would require additional study.

## 1.3.5.2 Bearers

The SBB air interface supports a matrix of carriers and bursts of different modulation type, symbol rate and code rate. Inmarsat configuration settings and the Radio Access Network (RAN) determine which bearers and code rate are used on a dynamic basis.  In SBB terminology carriers and bursts are known collectively as bearers. 

SBB RF bearers in the forward (to aircraft) direction are a continuous transmission of time division multiplexed (TDM) carriers shared between a number of users. RF bearers in the return direction (air-to-ground) are based on time division multiple access (TDMA) between a number of users. 

Power efficient QPSK and π/4 QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) and bandwidth efficient 16, 32 and 64 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) is used, together with a number of frame burst durations. Symbol rates between 8.4 kilo symbols per second (kSym/s) and 168 kSym/s are used with each symbol rate being a fraction or multiple of 33.6 kSym/s.  Variable coding rate is used with rates corresponding to 1 dB changes in C/No.  In the main the bearers operate at constant power and as the C/No varies the coding rate (and hence the user data rate) is adjusted accordingly.  Bearers use Root Raised Cosine (RRC) filtering with roll-off of α = 0.13 for T5 and T2.5 bearers and α = 0.25 for other bearers.  Channel spacing for the 151.2 and 168 kSym/s bearers is 200 kHz. Other bearers are spaced at fractions of 200 kHz.  

## 1.3.6 Registration

When an AES is powered up, it follows the following steps: 

•
Determines its geographical position, directly or indirectly from a GPS
receiver or from the aircraft's IRS. 
- 
Determines which satellite is in the best position. 
- 
Points its antenna at the desired satellite, if the antenna is steerable. 
- 
Tunes its receiver to the global beam Primary Shared Access Bearer 
(PSAB) and receive the system information, including the regional beam map and regional beam frequencies. 
- 
Tunes to the best regional beam PSAB and receives the relevant system 
information. 
- 
Transmits on the regional beam to register.  An AES never transmits on 
the global beam. 
- 
Tunes to the appropriate regional beam or narrow spot beam bearer as 
directed by the RAN.  This is usually in response to a demand for bandwidth in either the forward or return direction. 
- 
Sets up required PDP contexts (acting as virtual data channels) over 
which data can be communicated. 
- 
The AAGW uses a priority PDP context to independently register with 
the AGGW for ACARS service. 
- 
The pilot initiates CPDLC communications with the required Flight 
Information Region (FIR). 
- 
ADS-C operation is initiated from the ground. 

## 1.3.7 Mobility And Handoff

Handover between all beams within a satellite is supported within the network. Telephone calls and data connections remain connected. 

Handover between satellites is not supported by the network and hence is implemented by the AES.  During satellite handover there is a loss of data and voice communication between the air and ground.  Data connections, including ACARS, are automatically reestablished by the AES.  A voice call should be reestablished manually.  According to SVGM [8] this should be done by the party that originally established the call. The process described above should not be confused with CPDLC registration performed by a priority services AES when entering a flight information region. 

## 1.3.8 Priority, Precedence And Preemption

SBB uses the 3G principles of Quality of Service (QoS) to provide priority and preemption capability for packet-switched data.  QoS is similar to the ICAO concept of Required Communication Performance (RCP). For network congestion scenarios on the PS domain, the use of Allocation/Retention Priority (ARP) is required for pre-emption of lower priority users.  The ARP level is not negotiated by the mobile terminal, but forms part of the provisioning of a SB-Safety terminal. Access to the highest priority level is authorized only for aeronautical mobile terminals supporting cockpit communications and maritime mobile terminals with distress capabilities - this priority level is not accessible to users via normal mobile terminal interfaces for commercial traffic. In the CS domain the enhanced Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-emption 
(eMLPP) attribute is used to indicate priority.  Admission control and bearer control use eMLPP to prioritize and if necessary preempt lower priority (or nonpriority) users, thus ensuring that an SBB AES achieves the appropriate performance even in congestion situations.  VoIP calls make use of a priority PDP context. For the second (PS) voice channel, the AES creates PDP contexts at the configured priority level.  A PS call to or from a priority AES may therefore preempt calls to or from non-priority AESs or other BGAN terminals. 

In addition when an SBB priority AES requests registration to the Radio Access Network, the AES is identified as a priority AES and is accepted on to the network with priority.  This is particularly relevant during "registration storms" after, for example, ground station site switches. 

## 1.3.9 Redundancy Including Fallback To Classic Aero

The AES and the SBB network are designed to allow an AES to automatically and seamlessly take advantage of additional satellites and ground stations if and when they become available in the network. An AES design may offer the capability for two AESs to be installed together on one aircraft to form a 1+1 hot standby system to improve redundancy. An AES may be designed to offer automatic reversion to the Classic Aero service.  These AESs and the SBB network are designed for tight interoperability with the Classic Aero service operating on the I3 and I4 satellites, and an AES with Classic reversion capability may switch between the three networks.  One possible mode of operation is where services are provided over SBB by default, with the AES automatically reverting to Classic Aero mode over I4 or I3 when the SBB service or an I4 satellite is unavailable.  Aspects of the fallback mechanism are specified in the SBB SDM, while other details are left to the individual manufacturers.  These details are outside the *minimum* requirements of this appendix. The system is designed to make this switching between networks near-seamless.  
ACARS and voice services remain available.  The Classic Aero networks do not support IP services. 

Note: This appendix deals only with the performance requirements for an SBB AES.  The performance requirements of the AES in Classic Aero mode are outside the scope of this appendix, but are covered in DO-210D [5]. 

## 1.3.10 Installation Environment 1.3.10.1 Iridium Ams(R)S On The Same Aircraft

The minimum performance standards contained in this appendix are intended to assure proper operation of Inmarsat priority services on all aircraft, and compatibility of such services with other communication, navigation, and surveillance radios operating on the same aircraft and in the same airspace.  A 
significant caveat to this intent is the ability to support simultaneous independent operation of both Iridium and Inmarsat AESs on the same aircraft without a demonstrated means of cooperation.  Owners, operators and installers are cautioned that simultaneous independent operation of Inmarsat and Iridium AES equipment on the same aircraft has the potential to cause significant interference to all Iridium AMSS and AMS(R)S services on that aircraft.  This caution applies to Inmarsat equipment that is compliant with RTCA DO-210D, including all changes, ARINC Characteristic 741, ARINC Characteristic 761, ARINC Characteristic 781, and any AES complying with this appendix.  At the time of publication of this appendix, simultaneous independent operation of Inmarsat and Iridium equipment on the same aircraft had been reported in special cases.  
However, no generally applicable and technically feasible means of mitigating the potential for interference could be identified. 

This caveat specifically excludes installations where Inmarsat and Iridium are intended for use in a non-simultaneous mode of operation.  For example, no special installation or other considerations are required for Iridium use in polar airspace that is outside of the coverage volume of the Inmarsat services described in this appendix. At the time of publication of this appendix, there is no regulatory guidance nor AMS(R)S operational need to require Inmarsat and Iridium systems to work simultaneously on the same aircraft.  Some operators may choose to use Iridium and Inmarsat as backup or in a non-simultaneous mode of operation. 

## 1.3.10.2 Iridium Ams(R)S In The Same Procedural Airspace

The caveats of the previous paragraph apply to simultaneous independent operation of Inmarsat and Iridium AMS(R)S or AMSS on the same aircraft. ICAO Aeronautical Communications Panel, Working Group M in 2008 accepted analyses indicating that Inmarsat safety and non-safety communication services do not induce harmful interference to Iridium AMS(R)S equipment on other aircraft operating under 30/30 nautical mile separation in procedural airspace. 

## 1.3.10.3 Co-Location With Gps / Gnss Systems

The ARINC 741 and ARINC 781 standards give guidance on the required isolation between antennas of Inmarsat and GNSS systems.  The GNSS system can potentially be affected mainly by two mechanisms: 

- 
Intermodulation products of two carriers transmitted by the Inmarsat 
system falling in the GNSS band may affect the GNSS receiver.  This 
effect does not occur in single channel SwiftBroadband systems. Intermodulation products can be formed either in the transmitter of the Inmarsat system or in the receiver chain of the GNSS receiver. 
- 
The GNSS receiver chain may be saturated by signals transmitted from 
the Inmarsat system.  This problem is common to co-location of any 
transmitter with any other receiver.  This effect can be mitigated by isolation between the antennas combined with adequate filtering in the receiver chain. 
Interference may be very dependent on the frequencies allocated by the network. This calls for special care during interference tests. 

Interference from the GNSS antenna to the satcom antenna is not regarded as a high risk. Requirements for emissions from the AES for GNSS compatibility are given in sections 2.2.3.1.2.6.1 and 2.2.3.1.3.1.3. 

The declared isolation between the AES antenna and a GNSS antenna may differ for different GNSS systems (e.g. GPS and GLONASS).  The standard assumption in GPS and GLONASS documents is an antenna port-to-antenna port isolation of 40 dB.  The requirements in Section 2.2.3.1.2.6.1 do not provide sufficient protection of the upper 5 MHz of the GLONASS frequency band (1605 to 1610 MHz) for a GLONASS receiver on the same aircraft with this standard isolation, but can achieve appropriate protection with the larger spatial isolations typical of large aircraft. 

1.3.10.4 
Co-location with Other Inmarsat Satcom Systems 
Co-location of multiple Inmarsat satcom systems may be achieved.  Installation guidance is given in Section 3.1.10. 

## 2 Equipment Performance Requirements And Test Procedures 2.1 General Requirements 2.1.1 Airworthiness

The design and manufacture of the equipment shall provide for an installation that does not impair the airworthiness of the aircraft. 

## 2.1.2 Intended Function

The equipment shall perform its intended function, as defined by the manufacturer, and its proper use shall not create a hazard to users of procedural airspace. 

## 2.1.3 Federal Communications Commission'S Rules

The equipment shall comply with all applicable rules of the Federal Communication Commission (FCC).5 

## 2.1.4 Fire Protection

All materials used shall be self-extinguishing except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire. 

Note: One means of showing compliance is contained in the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Part 25, Appendix F. 

                                                          

## 2.1.5 Operation Of Controls

The operation of controls intended for use during flight, in all possible combinations and sequences, shall not result in a condition detrimental to the continued performance of the equipment.  Controls shall be designed to maximize operational suitability and minimize pilot workload.  Reliance on pilot memory for operational procedures shall be minimized. 

## 2.1.6 Accessibility Of Controls

Controls that are not normally adjusted in flight shall not be readily accessible to flight personnel.  Controls that are normally adjusted in flight shall be readily accessible and properly labeled as to their intended function.  The controls shall be operable with the use of only one hand. 

## 2.1.7 Effects Of Tests

The equipment shall be designed so that the application of specified test procedures will not be detrimental to equipment performance following the application of these tests, except as specifically allowed. 

## 2.1.8 Performance In A Shared Environment

All requirements for data integrity and timing shall consider the effect of other active aircraft data links performing transfer operations in both directions at their nominal rates. In the case of simultaneous and independent operation of dissimilar AMS(R)S equipment on different aircraft in the same airspace, 30 nmi minimum lateral separation and 30 nmi along-track separation between aircraft at the same altitude shall be assumed. In the case of simultaneous and independent operation of dissimilar AMS(R)S equipment on the same aircraft, sufficient isolation between equipment must be established.  This may be difficult to achieve, particularly if sufficient guard band does not exist.  Solutions may include operating procedures or mechanisms which disable transmission from one system while the other system is being used to provide AMS(R)S services. 

## 2.1.9 Aes Availability

Note: Appendices B and C of ICAO GOLD [7] specify the availability for the data link capability on the aircraft as 0.999, assuming an average flight of 6 hours.  Allocating 50% of the unavailability to the AES yields an availability requirement for the AES of 0.9995.  Availability = 1 - (MTTR/MTBF).  Failures 
(on average) occur halfway through the flight.  The MTTR = 3 hours because failed equipment is repaired or replaced after the flight.  This implies that an MTBF of 6000 hours or better is required for the AES to achieve the 0.999 availability requirement for the aircraft.  Evaluating this number at the time of MOPS testing is considered impractical.  In-service MTBF measurement and reliability management may be required.  Meaningful specification of MTBF and reliability management is considered beyond the scope of this MOPS. 

## 2.2 Equipment Performance Requirements - Standard Conditions 2.2.1 Swiftbroadband Aes Classes, Subsystem Definitions And Overall Requirements 2.2.1.1 Definition Of Swiftbroadband Aes Classes

This appendix contains performance requirements for three classes of AES equipment, designated AES4, AES6 and AES7.  The three AES classes are listed with their descriptions in Sections 2.2.1.1.1 to 2.2.1.1.3.  An AES is a complete satcom terminal as installed on an aircraft.  It includes the transceiver, DLNA, SCM and antenna functions, as shown in Figure 2-1, Figure 2-2 and Figure 2-3.  
The three classes are mainly differentiated based on the gain (and by implication, size) of the antenna. In addition, this appendix contains requirements for major components of the AES6 and AES7 classes of equipment.  These major components are listed in Sections 2.2.1.1.4 to 2.2.1.1.11.  The class and component identifiers in these sections are frequently used in this appendix to unambiguously refer to these systems and system components.

## 2.2.1.2 Valid Combinations Of System Components

Table 2-1 below lists the valid combinations of major components that may be combined to form an AES. Adherence to this list is particularly important to control unwanted emissions.

•
ACARS packet data services over a single radio channel.
 
Optionally the AES may also provide any or all of the following services: 

- 
AMS(R)S IP data service ("Priority IP")  
- 
Additional non-AMS(R)S voice channels 
- 
Additional non-AMS(R)S IP data and voice services  
 
Note: At the time of publication of this appendix the Priority IP service has not been approved for operational AMS(R)S communications. 

## 2.2.1.4 Rf Interconnecting Cables

In addition to the system components listed in sections 2.2.1.1.4 to 2.2.1.1.11, three RF co-axial cables are required to interconnect the standard subsystems of an AES6 or AES7.  As cable lengths and types may be dependent on the AES design and the installation, these cables are not assigned equipment class identifiers. For multicarrier operation, when operating with two CW carriers, each of power 9.4 dBW anywhere in the band 1626.5 to 1660.5, the intermodulation products generated by the DLNA to antenna cable shall satisfy the following requirements: 

- 
Third and fifth order intermodulation products shall be below -100 dBm 
in the frequency range of 1559 to 1605 MHz and 
- 
Seventh or higher order intermodulation products shall be below -133 
dBm in the frequency range of 1525 to 1559 MHz. 
The L-band cable losses in Table 2-2 and passive intermodulation characteristics above are assumed in this appendix for AES6 and AES7 and are required for proper interoperation of subsystems defined in this appendix.  The cable characteristics should be verified before installation, as required in Section 3.1.9. 

| Cable                              | Loss at L-band                |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Antenna to DLNA                    | Not to exceed 0.3 dB          |
| Not to exceed 1.4 dB               | Transceiver to DLNA (transmit |
| path)                              |                               |
| DLNA to Transceiver (receive path) | Within the range 6 to 25 dB   |

 Where the transceiver consists of an SDU and an HPA, the interconnecting cable between these units shall be specified by the manufacturer. Cables for an AES4 shall be specified by the manufacturer.

## 2.2.3 Detailed Requirements 2.2.3.1 Aes Application Requirements

This section and its subsections contain requirements for an AMS(R)S terminal and subsystems.  Where possible, reference is made to the Inmarsat System Definition Manual (SDM) [1] and Mandatory Test Requirements (MTRs).  The aim is to achieve commonality between requirements and test methods in this appendix and those required to obtain access to the Inmarsat network through the Inmarsat Type Approval process. 

## 2.2.3.1.1 Inmarsat And Service Provider Type Approval

Type Approval (TA) of a system by Inmarsat is required before a terminal can access the Inmarsat network.  
The objectives of Type Approval are two fold; to ensure that the system does not interfere with either the Inmarsat network, other users or other systems - "noninterference" and also to ensure (to the maximum reasonable extent) that the system is 'Fit for Purpose' for its intended application (availability, reliability, performance). The Type Approval process consists of the following elements, each of which has its own test requirements and pass/fail criteria: 

•
Physical Layer 1 MTR testing
•
Protocol Layer 2/3 MTR Testing
•
Functional testing
•
System testing
•
Environmental MTR testing
•
On-air Performance benchmark testing (Alpha)
•
Flight Trial (Beta)
Note: The MTRs listed in Table 1-3 constitute Inmarsat Type Approval / Type Assessment as required in the succeeding paragraphs. 

The diagram below illustrates how all of the testing elements come together to form an Inmarsat Type Approval. 

2.2.3.1.1.1 
Complete AES Systems 
In addition to any other requirements stated in this appendix, any complete AES 
seeking to demonstrate compliance with this MOPS shall achieve Inmarsat Type Approval as evidenced by a Type Approval Certificate issued by Inmarsat. Furthermore the AES shall be approved, in writing, by a relevant Communication Network Provider as being fit for use on their network (e.g. ARINC AQP or SITA VAQ testing). 

2.2.3.1.1.2 
Separately Approved Antenna Subsystems 
 In addition to any other requirements stated in this appendix, any HGA, IGA, DMA or DF equipment seeking to demonstrate compliance with this MOPS shall achieve a successful Inmarsat Type Assessment as evidenced by a Type Assessment Letter issued by Inmarsat. 

2.2.3.1.1.3 
Separately Approved Transceiver Systems 
In addition to any other requirements stated in this appendix, any 6MA, 6F, 7MA 
or 7F transceiver seeking to demonstrate compliance with this MOPS shall achieve a successful Inmarsat Type Assessment as evidenced by a Type Assessment Letter issued by Inmarsat.  In addition it shall achieve Inmarsat Type Approval as part of a complete AES6 or AES7, as evidenced by a Type Approval Letter issued by Inmarsat for an AES which includes the particular transceiver. Furthermore the transceiver shall be approved as part of at least one AES combination, in writing, by a relevant Communication Network Provider as being fit for use on their network (e.g. ARINC AQP or SITA VAQ testing). 

2.2.3.1.2 
Antenna 
This section covers the requirements for the HGA and IGA antenna, as well as antenna-related characteristics for an AES4. 

There is a large similarity between requirements in this appendix for the HGA 
and IGA and corresponding requirements in DO-210D.  The main differences are 

- 
For HGA and IGA antennas used in systems capable of transmitting on 
more than one carrier at a time, there are increased PIM requirements. 
- 
A new single channel ELGA antenna with extended frequency of 
operation has been created. 
Antenna types which have previously been accepted as meeting the requirements of DO-210D, may therefore be accepted as meeting the requirements of this appendix by only preforming additional tests related to the new passive intermodulation requirement in Section 2.2.3.1.2.6 and its subsections. 

Note:  HGA and IGA antennas, in the context of this appendix, are expected to be suitable for use in multi-channel systems. Extended L-band operation is therefore not required, and PIM requirements apply.  HGA and IGA antennas may also be capable of extended L-band operation for single-channel use, thereby exceeding the requirements of this appendix.  AES4 systems are restricted to single-channel operation and therefore are not subject to PIM requirements, and operation over the Extended L-band and Standard L-Band is required. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.1 Coverage Volume, Polarization And Antenna 2.2.3.1.2.1.1 Coverage Volume

The coverage volume of an antenna type represents the percentage of the solid angle contained in the sub-hemisphere above the antenna from 5° elevation 
(above the horizontal in level flight) to the zenith (90° or broadside to the antenna) over which the antenna being tested meets its requirements.  The requirements and the percentage of the hemisphere which must be compliant vary from one antenna type to another. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.1.1.1 Hga Coverage Volume

The HGA shall simultaneously satisfy the requirements for G/T, *EIRP*, ARA and D/U for at least 75% of the solid angle of the sub-hemisphere described above. 

The gain used to compute the coverage performance requirements shall be right hand circularly polarized per ITU-R Recommendation 573. When computed with the maximum cable losses given in Table 2-2 and the DLNA noise figure given in Section 2.2.3.1.4.2, an HGA intended for operation in an AES6 shall achieve a G/T of not less than -13 dB/K within its declared coverage volume. If a DLNA with a noise figure better than that listed in Section 2.2.3.1.3.2 is required to meet the minimum coverage volume, this shall be declared as a limitation of the equipment under test. 

Note: For example, such a declaration might be a part of an application for a TSO. 

The G/T performance shall include the effects of IM/PIM products generated by the antenna by converting the intermodulation product level to an equivalent noise temperature (T).  For this purpose it shall be assumed that the power of the CW intermodulation product will be spread over a bandwidth of 172 kHz for 7th order intermodulation products and 192 kHz for 9th order intermodulation products during normal operation. When computed with the maximum cable losses given in Table 2-2 and the characteristics of the appropriate high power amplifier (HPA), an HGA intended for operation in an AES6 shall achieve an EIRP of not less than EIRPNOM - 
TOLLOW dBW as given in Table 2-3 for an AES6. 

The axial ratio of the HGA (ARA) shall be less than 6dB when referenced to a right hand circularly polarized source. If the axial ratio exceeds 6 dB, it may be compensated for with excess gain with the following assumptions: 

•
the satellite axial ratio (ARSV) is per Table 2-3
•
the polarization ellipses are orthogonal
The satellite discrimination (D/U) shall be greater than 13dB for geostationary arc locations spaced 45° or more in longitude from the wanted satellite. The coverage volume, as declared by the antenna manufacturer shall include all effects of:  

- 
installation on a surface representative of the mounting surface on which 
it is intended to operate the antenna,  
- 
beam-pointing errors within the antenna subsystem including those due 
to implementation of the beam steering algorithm, and  
- 
the radome and/or other protective devices such as rain erosion coatings 
or lightning diversion systems. 
The maximum gain of the HGA shall not exceed GMAX for any steering angle. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.1.1.2 Iga Coverage Volume

The IGA shall simultaneously satisfy the requirements for G/T, *EIRP* and, ARA for at least 85% of the solid angle contained in the sub-hemisphere above 5 degrees elevation. The gain used to compute the coverage performance requirements shall be right hand circularly polarized gain per ITU-R Recommendation 573.  
When computed with the maximum cable losses given in Table 2-2 and the DLNA noise figure in Section 2.2.3.1.4.2, an IGA intended for operation in an AES7 shall achieve a G/T of not less than  -19 dB/K.  If a non-standard DLNA 
with a noise figure better than that listed in Section 2.2.3.1.4.2 is required, this shall be declared as a limitation of the equipment under test. 

Note: For example, such a declaration might be a part of an application for a TSO. 

The G/T performance shall include the effects of IM/PIM products generated by the antenna by converting the intermodulation product level to an equivalent noise temperature (T).  For this purpose it shall be assumed that the power of the CW intermodulation product will be spread over a bandwidth of 172 kHz for 7th order intermodulation products and 192 kHz for 9th order intermodulation products during normal operation. When computed with the maximum cable losses given in Table 2-2 and the characteristics of the appropriate high power amplifier (HPA), an IGA intended for operation in an AES7 shall achieve an EIRP of not less than EIRPNOM - 
TOLLOW dBW as given in Table 2-3 for an AES7. 

The axial ratio of the IGA (ARA) shall be less than 6dB when referenced to a right hand circularly polarized source. If the axial ratio exceeds 6 dB it may be compensated for with excess gain with the following assumptions: 

- 
the satellite axial ratio (ARSV) is per Table 2-3. 
- 
the polarization ellipses are orthogonal. 
 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The satellite discrimination (D/U) shall be greater than 7 dB for geostationary arc locations spaced 80° or more in longitude from the wanted satellite for 85% of the solid angle of the sub-hemisphere above 5 degrees elevation. 

The coverage volume, as declared by the antenna manufacturer shall include all effects of:  

•
installation on a surface representative of the mounting surface on which
it is intended to operate the antenna,
•
beam-pointing errors within the antenna subsystem including those due
to implementation of the beam steering algorithm, and
•
the radome and/or other protective devices such as rain erosion coatings
or lightning diversion systems.
The maximum gain of the IGA shall not exceed GMAX for any steering angle. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.1.1.3 Aes4 Coverage Volume

The AES4 shall simultaneously satisfy the requirements for G/T and EIRP for at least 98% of the solid angle of the sub-hemisphere above 5 degrees elevation. 

The following data shall be used to calculate the coverage volume: 

•
Measured antenna characteristics.
•
Measured characteristics of the rest of the system.  The system may be
subdivided further as required, e.g. the diplexer may be measured separately from the transceiver, and the measurements then combined mathematically.
•
An integrated AES4 antenna (containing an HPA and DLNA) may be
separated internally in order to characterize the antenna portion for gain and noise temperature and to characterize the rest of the electronics for transmit power and noise figure.
Note: The measurements referenced in the previous bullet points may not be possible on an assembled production antenna.  Special test items may therefore be required for this purpose.  Such special test items are permitted when necessary. 

The gain used to compute the coverage performance requirements shall be right hand circularly polarized per ITU-R Recommendation 573. 

The antenna shall be characterized for radiation pattern performance using measurements in the sub-hemisphere above the antenna from 5° elevation up to 90° elevation. The AES4 shall meet the following requirements over its declared coverage volume, under conditions specified in SDM [1] Vol.5 Ch.3 Sections 2.3.1 and 
2.4.1:

Notes: 

 
33. The antenna gain of the ELGA used in an AES4 is not specified.  Instead the 
performance of the complete system is specified in terms of EIRP and G/T. Nominally the antenna gain is 2.5 dB.   
34. Unlike the LGA specified in DO-210D, the ELGA typically implements a 
means of beam steering, allowing better gain and coverage volume than the LGA. 
 When computed with the installation losses as specified by the manufacturer an AES4 shall achieve an EIRP of not less than EIRPNOM - TOLLOW dBW as given in Table 2-3 for a Class 4 system. 

The axial ratio of the AES4 shall be less than 6dB when referenced to a right hand circularly polarized source. If the axial ratio exceeds 6 dB it may be compensated for with excess gain with the following assumptions: 

- 
the satellite axial ratio (ARSV) is per Table 2-3. 
- 
the polarization ellipses are orthogonal. 
 
except that over any 8% of the 98%, a further relaxation of no more than 2 dB in both G/T and EIRP is permitted. 

The EIRP shall not exceed 15 dBW in any direction.

An ELGA shall achieve all single-carrier specifications when handling a carrier having average power equal to the maximum average RF power rating of the antenna in the transmit band at maximum operational altitude.

When measured at the single RF port of an HGA or IGA, the Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) shall not exceed 1.5:1 when correctly mated with the appropriate connector for any selected beam. The nominal characteristic impedance shall be 50 ohms. There is no VSWR requirement for the AES4 antenna, as its effect is internal to the system. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.6 Antenna Intermodulation Products

The following sub-sections are applicable to multi-channel systems only. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.6.1 Radiated Antenna Intermodulation Products In The Gnss Band

For multi-carrier operation, when operating two unmodulated carriers, each with a power of 8 dBW (HGA) or 9.1 dBW (IGA), anywhere in the antenna's declared transmit band, the antenna shall not generate intermodulation products with levels and frequencies as follows: In the frequency range 1559 to 1585 MHz, the level of the intermodulation product shall not exceed -158.5 dBW. 

In the frequency range 1585 to 1605 MHz, the level of the intermodulation product shall not exceed -157 dBW. 

Intermodulation levels should be referenced to the output port of an external 1/4- wave monopole GNSS antenna mounted on a common ground plane with the HGA under test. The isolation between the monopole and the HGA shall be 40 dB or other declared antenna isolation applicable to GPS and GLONASS respectively, or suitable compensation to the measurement shall be applied. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.6.2 Antenna Intermodulation Products In The Ams(R)S Bands

The antenna intermodulation products of 9th order or higher shall be taken into account when calculating G/T for the purpose of calculating coverage, as described in sections 2.2.3.1.2.1.1.1 and 2.2.3.1.2.1.1.2 for HGA and IGA 
respectively. 

Note:  Guidance related to installations and selection of cables is given in ARINC 781 Section 2.3.6. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.7 Carrier-To-Multipath Discrimination

With the aircraft in horizontal flight over sea in median sea condition (see note below), the AES antenna shall attenuate the reflected signal from the sea surface relative to the main signal in the direction of the satellite, so as to achieve a minimum C/M of 10 dB at 5o elevation and 12 dB at 20o elevation. 

Note: The C/M over median sea (C/Mmed) is defined on the basis of the C/M for rough sea (C/Mrough corresponding to sea states with Beaufort Number 3 or higher) and on the C/M for smooth sea (C/Msmooth corresponding to the sea state with Beaufort Number 0), by C/Mmed = (0.3 x C/Msmooth) + (0.7 x C/Mrough) (all values in dB). 

This agrees with the methodology used in the SDM and DO-210D. 

## 2.2.3.1.2.8 Pattern Discrimination

Not applicable.  See Section 2.2.3.1.2.9.4.

## 2.2.3.1.2.10 Manufacturer-Defined Antenna Tests

For the purposes of environmental qualification the manufacturer shall define test procedures which do the following: 

•
Stimulate the antenna under test in such a manner that the beam steering
and operational control interface are exercised and BITE responses 
monitored during the DO-160G environmental exposures listed in Table 
2-25 as is required for tests which require that the antenna under test be 
powered and active.  This is intended to be a design qualification test. 
•
Test the antenna's RF performance and control/BITE interfaces to the
degree that the manufacturer can say with a high degree of confidence 
that the antenna performance/behavior is unchanged after the 
environmental exposure in Table 2-25.  This assumes that the antenna 
under test was a properly functioning antenna before environmental exposure.  This is intended to be a production test. 
Results from this test (summary RF performance measurements or BITE response data) should be included with the antenna environmental qualification data. 

## 2.2.3.1.3 Transceiver Subsystem 2.2.3.1.3.1 Transmitter Function

The value of N should be declared by the manufacturer for the system being certified, but may not exceed the value of N in Table 2-3.  If a manufacturer has a mechanism to preempt non-priority channels in the event of lack of HPA power then the value of N can be made 1 for this test, however the manufacturer is required to prove the power preemption using the optional test defined in Section 2.4.2.3 and its subsections. The maximum cable loss between the Class 6D / 7D transceiver and the antenna, as specified in Table 2-2, shall be included in this measurement, or compensated for by calculation.

If a manufacturer has a mechanism to preempt non-priority services in the event of lack HPA power then the value of N shall be made 1 for this test, however the manufacturer is required to prove the power preemption using the optional test defined in Section 2.2.3.3. The cable between the Class 6MA/6F/7MA/7F transceiver and the DLNA, the insertion loss of the DLNA and the cable between the DLNA and antenna are accounted for in the calculations based upon the maximum cable losses in Table 2-2 and the DLNA filter responses detailed in sections 2.2.3.1.4.3.2 and 
2.2.3.1.4.3.3.

## 2.2.3.1.3.1.3 Maximum Total Transmitter Output Power

The maximum total average transmit power from all channels of an AES shall be limited to no more than 18 dBW (63 W), referenced to the connector of the antenna.  This is based on 40 dB isolation between the AES antenna and the GNSS antenna.  If a different isolation level is declared by the manufacturer the maximum total average transmit power limit shall be adjusted accordingly.  All channels shall be assumed to be transmitting with the maximum duty cycle. Where an AES offers non-SBB services (e.g. Aero H+) simultaneously with SBB, this limit shall apply to the total power of all channels from all services which can transmit simultaneously. 

Note:  This requirement maintains compatibility with GNSS susceptibility requirements as stated in the ICAO GNSS SARPs.   
A Class 6F or 6MA transceiver shall be capable of limiting its transmit power to below 17.8 dBW (60 W) average power, referenced to the connector of the antenna. 

A Class 7F or 7MA transceiver shall be capable of limiting its transmit power to below 14.8 dBW (30 W) average power, referenced to the connector of the antenna. 

## 

Note:  This requirement maintains compatibility with the power handling of an ARINC 741 or ARINC 781 antenna. If the antenna and installation allow a higher power level, this limit may be set to a different value for that installation. 

 

## 2.2.3.1.3.1.4 Transmitter Intermodulation Performance.

## 2.2.3.1.3.1.5 Transmitter Harmonics, Discrete Spurious And Noise Density

Note: This section excludes the requirements for intermodulation products in multi-channel AESs, which are covered in Section 2.2.3.1.3.1.4.  This section also excludes requirements for emissions in the transmit band, which are covered in Section 2.2.3.1.3.1.9.

Notes to Table 2-6. 

44. Sections marked "linear" are linearly interpolated in dB vs. frequency.
45. The values in the "Transmit Power Limit" column refer to power at the
connector of the antenna.
46. The values in the "EIRP Limit" column shall be converted to equivalent
Transmit Power Limits, referred to the connector of the antenna, using the appropriate antenna gain as described in the test procedure in Section 2.4.3.1.2.1.5. 
47. All measurements shall use an averaging detector.
48. In the band 3253.0 MHz to 3321.0 MHz the maximum EIRP in one, and only
one, 300 kHz measurement bandwidth shall not exceed -38 dBW. Elsewhere
in this band the power limit in Table 2-6 shall be applied.
49. In each of the bands 4 879.5 MHz to 4 981.5 MHz, 6 506.0 MHz to 6 642.0
MHz and 8 132.5 MHz to 8 302.5 MHz the maximum EIRP in one, and only one, 300 kHz measurement bandwidth shall not exceed -48 dBW. Elsewhere in this band the power limit in Table 2-6 shall be applied.
50. In the band 9 759.0 MHz to 9 963.0 MHz the maximum EIRP in one, and only
one, 300 kHz measurement bandwidth shall not exceed -59 dBW. Elsewhere
in this band the power limit in Table 2-6 shall be applied.
51. If measured on one channel of a multi-channel system, this level shall be
reduced by 10*log(N) dB, where N is the number of channels the system is capable of transmitting on simultaneously.

## 2.2.3.1.3.1.6 Protection Of Radio Astronomy

Requirements for protection of the radio astronomy bands are included in Section 
2.2.3.1.3.1.5. 

Note: It may be assumed that the BGAN network will not allocate transmit frequencies to the transmitter of an AES in or adjacent to the radio astronomy band in geographic areas which are sensitive to emissions in the Radio Astronomy band. 

## 2.2.3.1.3.1.7 Carrier-Off Level

After the transmitter has not transmitted for more than two seconds, the transmitted EIRP, referred to the connector of the antenna, shall be below the levels specified in Table 2-7 and Table 2-8.   
Note: The tables are consolidated from applicable sections of ETSI EN 301 473 [9], including protection of GNSS bands and protection of Radio Astronomy bands. Requirements for interoperability of on-aircraft systems were added from DO210D change 3 as applicable.

AES antenna and a GNSS antenna on the same aircraft.  Where different antenna isolation is declared, these limits may be adjusted accordingly. 
53. The specified levels between 1605 and 1610 MHz provides for protection of 
GLONASS on the same aircraft, with an antenna isolation of 55 dB assumed. Where different antenna isolation is declared, these limits may be adjusted accordingly. 
54. The values in the "EIRP Limit" column shall be converted to equivalent 
Transmit Power Limits, referred to the connector of the antenna  using the appropriate antenna gain as described in the test procedure in Section

Note 1: The limits in this table may be exceeded provided that the sum in watts of the spectrum components exceeding the limits of the table does not exceed -30 dBW. Note 2: E (in dB) is the excess EIRP of the AES compared with 15 dBW.  In cases where the antenna directivity of the AES is greater than 15 dBi then the factor E shall be limited to a maximum value of +15 dB.  In all other cases, the factor E 
shall be limited to a maximum value of +10 dB. 

The parameters AB, CD and EF are defined as a proportion of the 3dB Bandwidth as follows: 
AB = (55 kHz) or (100 % of the B3dB), whichever is the greater; CD = (95 kHz) or (200 % of the B3dB), whichever is the greater; EF = (125 kHz) or (300 % of the B3dB), whichever is the greater.

## 2.2.3.1.3.1.14 Manufacturer-Defined Transmitter Test

The manufacturer shall define a test that will verify the correct operation of the transmit sub-systems.  The test will then be used to verify the Transceiver operates correctly over a wide range of DO-160G [3] categories without adding excessive test time or cost that may have been incurred if many of the other tests were required to be repeated over environment.  The aim is to detect degradation in performance during or after (depending on the environmental category) environmental tests. Measuring error vector magnitude (EVM) is one possible method to achieve this. Measuring only one fast bearer type (e.g. T4.5) should suffice.

interference signal of +3 dBm in the frequency range 470 to 18,000 MHz, excluding the band: 1449 to 1626.5 MHz. Within the excluded band, the level of the CW interference signal shall be reduced linearly, in dB, from +3 dBm at 1449 MHz to –72 dBm at 1524 MHz and from +3 dBm at 1626.5 MHz to –72 dBm at 1560 MHz.   
Note: Frequencies between 1524 and 1560 MHz are considered "in band" for the purpose of this section.  Performance is subject to the requirements of Section 2.2.3.1.3.2.1. 

Class 4  
The receiver shall acquire and track a satellite downlink signal with a minimum signal level given by the minimum of SV and SD in the presence of a CW 
interference signal of -6.5 dBm in the frequency range 470 to 18,000 MHz, excluding the band: 1400 to 1626.5 MHz.  The signal level is referred to the connector of the antenna array. Within the excluded band, the level of the CW interference signal shall be reduced linearly, in dB, from -6.5 dBm at 1400 MHz to –72 dBm at 1517 MHz and from -6.5 dBm at 1626.5 MHz to –72 dBm at 1560 MHz.   
Note: Frequencies between 1524 and 1560 MHz are considered "in band" for the purpose of this section. Performance is subject to the requirements of Section 2.2.3.1.3.2.1. 

## 2.2.3.1.3.2.4 Rejection Of Carrier Signals Generated By Other Ams(R)S Equipment

Not applicable. 

Note: This is not applicable because this requirement is already addressed by the following two factors: 

- 
Transmissions in the SBB transmit band are much lower than the SBB 
AES' own transmitted signal.  The definition for coverage volume is already determined while transmitting at full power. 
- 
Transmissions outside of the SBB transmit band are covered by section 
2.2.3.1.3.2.3. 

## 2.2.3.1.3.2.5 Receiver Operation In Moving Aircraft

The receiver shall meet its requirements with a Doppler shift on the received signal of up to ± 2.5 kHz and peak rate of change of up to ± 30 Hz/s.  (Reference: SDM [1] Vol.5 Ch.3 Section 2.3.5.)

Sections 2.3.9.1 and 2.3.9.2. 

## 2.2.3.1.4 Dlna (Diplexer / Low Noise Amplifier)

NOTE: Although there is no corresponding section in the main body of the DO-
262 document, this additional section covers the requirements for the DLNA. 

This section describes the requirements for two types of DLNA.  These broadly correspond to two DLNA types described in ARINC 741 and 781 as follows: 

| Equipment Class    | ARINC 741 Type       |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Identifier         |                      |
| DMA                | Modified Type A DLNA |
| DF                 | Type F DLNA          |

Notes: 

55. Differences between diplexer requirements in this appendix and the ARINC
741 and 781 documents include the extension of the receive frequency range of the 'DMA' down to 1525 MHz, and adding a PIM requirement for the DMA.
56. The DLNAs are both intended for use in multi-channel systems.  The
requirements therefore exclude the Extended L-band.

## 2.2.3.1.4.1 Dlna Vswr

The DLNA's Antenna, Receive and Transmit ports shall have a nominal impedance of 50 ohms.  The DLNA Antenna and Transmit ports' VSWR shall be 1.3:1 maximum. The LNA output port (receive port) VSWR shall be 1.5:1 maximum.  During any measurement the other two RF ports shall be terminated into 50 ohms. 

## 2.2.3.1.4.2 Dlna Noise Figure

The noise figure of the receive path of the DLNA shall be less than 1.2 dB at temperatures up to 25 degrees C.  It may increase at higher temperatures to a maximum of 1.6 dB at 70°C.

With two CW carriers, each of power 10.2 dBW anywhere in the band 1626.5 to 1660.5 MHz, the 5th and higher intermodulation products shall each be less than -100 dBm in the band 1555 to 1595.42 MHz as measured at the antenna port. 

Note: Levels are explained in ARINC 781 Section 2.2.4.5.2 

## 2.2.3.1.4.5 Dlna Maximum Transmit Power

With two CW carriers, each of power 16 dBW anywhere in the band 1626.5 to 1660.5 MHz, the insertion loss in the transmit path of the diplexer shall be within its specification. 

Note: This requirement is to verify that no arcing occurs at maximum transmit power.  Arcing is expected to cause a severe increase in insertion loss. 

## 2.2.3.1.4.6 Dlna Receive Port Output Power

The DLNA receive port shall have a 1 dB compression point of at least 10 dBm. 

2.2.3.1.4.7 
Manufacturer Defined DLNA Test 
The manufacturer may define a test to test for gross failures during environmental testing. 

2.2.3.1.5 
Required Aircraft Interfaces 
The AES shall make provision for the following interfaces to connect to surrounding equipment on the aircraft: 

•
Interfaces required for ACARS, Voice and IP services (as described in
other sections).
•
Interface or interfaces to receive position and attitude data from the
aircraft avionics.  This data shall be used to select the correct satellite, steer the antenna and report the geographic position of the aircraft.  Data shall be updated at least once per second.  The data required is:
•
Latitude and longitude, to a precision of 1 second of arc or better.
•
Altitude.  Absolute altitude is preferred although pressure altitude is
acceptable.
•
Track angle.
•
Speed over ground.
•
Aircraft attitude.  Roll pitch and yaw, to a precision of no more than one degree.
•
Interface to receive the 24-bit ICAO address of the aircraft (as used for
the Mode S transponder) from the aircraft.  The ICAO address is used in conjunction with the IMSI and MSISDN as the addressing mechanism for the AES within the SBB system.  While the AES is required to make provision for this, the use of this input in a specific installation is not
compulsory where the aircraft does not have this information available on a suitable data bus, provided that other means is provided to enter this data into the configuration settings of the AES.
All these interfaces shall operate without degradation over the declared environmental specification of the AES.  

## 2.2.3.2 User Link Modulation And Signal In Space (Physical Layer)

The AES receiver chain, from after the antenna connector, shall accept a signalin-space with signal characteristics and receiver performance as specified in the Inmarsat SDM [1] Vol.5 Ch.3 sections 2.3.2 to 2.3.14. The transmitter chain, up to before the antenna connector, shall transmit a signal with the signal format and transmitter performance as specified in the Inmarsat SDM [1] Vol.5 Ch.3 sections 2.4.1 to 2.4.8 and 2.4.8.2 to 2.4.11.   

## 2.2.3.3 Priority, Precedence And Preemption

The SB-Safety service is designed principally for the elements in the ACD (Aircraft Control Domain), but with proper segregation other domains may be served (see Section 2.2.3.10). 

The AES shall provide mechanisms to enable prioritization of priority-related communications over lower priority and non-priority communications.  The diagram in Figure 2-7 shows the key logical elements in the data path for both voice and data communications in an SB-Safety AES.  It also shows the three primary points of contention that need to be considered when applying the rules of priority, precedence and preemption.  Each AES shall have a mechanism to detect when contention - in at least each of these three areas - is likely or has occurred and to favor the higher priority communications over lower priority communications.  Specific requirements are listed the following subsections. 

NOTES: 1. ACD (Aircraft Control Domain) must use SB-Safety channel. 2. AISD (Aircraft Information Services Domain) may use either SB-Safety or Standard SB channel. Must use lower priority context than ACD. 3. PIESD  (Passenger Information & Entertainment Domain) shall not use the SB-Safety Channel

## 2.2.3.3.1 Packet Data

The APN for each function or IP port (e.g. ACARS, priority VoIP, Priority IP and non-priority IP Ethernet ports) shall be configurable at installation time. The AES shall ensure that data to and  from the various data sources (e.g. priority IP port, EFB, ACARS, VoIP) are transferred to and from the BGAN Protocol Stack in such a way that higher priority data is not affected by lower priority data.  
Note: This requirement is considered a subset of the requirements for protection from a Denial-Of-Service (DOS) attack.  This requirement is more thoroughly covered in the Information Security Section 2.2.3.10. 

The level of network priority associated with individual PDP contexts is governed by the APN being utilized.  The AES has no involvement in requesting or modifying the priority of a PDP context; it is only responsible for the initial establishment of the PDP context with the appropriate APN identifier. The AES 
must be authorized for use against any APN that it attempts to access to obtain the relevant network resource. 

The BGAN network utilizes the 3G concept of Allocation/Retention Priority 
(ARP) in providing the priority and pre-emption of network resources. Each APN has an associated ARP value which translates to a priority level on the physical radio access bearers. The BGAN RAN is capable of providing 15 different levels of priority and therefore scope for introducing future priority cockpit IP services can be accommodated without affecting ACARS traffic. Once PDP contexts have been set up by the AES, the BGAN network is wholly responsible for prioritizing the IP data across the air interface, including in the AES' transmit direction by using the correct priorities when allocating network resources.  Defining this functionality is therefore not included in this section. 

## 2.2.3.3.2 Circuit Mode Communications (Voice)

The AES shall apply priority and preemption mechanisms to air-to-ground and ground-to-air voice calls.  Each call shall be assigned one of four levels of priority as follows: 

| Call Application            | Priority Identifier    |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| Distress                    | 1  (High)              |
| Air Traffic Service         | 2                      |
| Airline Operational Control | 3                      |

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

| Airline Administrative Control    | 3        |
|-----------------------------------|----------|
| Airline Passenger Communications  | 4  (Low) |

System resources (e.g. available voice circuits) shall be assigned to calls with a higher priority (lower priority identifier) in preference to calls of a lower priority, even if this means prematurely terminating a lower priority call. 

Note : A configuration setting may be provided to disable prioritization of voice calls.  In this case all calls shall be treated as non-priority (level 4).  This option is intended for installations where priority voice is not required. 

If an AES provides voice interfaces to the cabin, (e.g. 2-wire POTS for cabin crew or passengers), calls to or from these interfaces shall be assigned a priority level of 3 or 4 as appropriate for the application.  In multi-channel systems such calls may also be serviced through an independent non-priority channel in the same AES. 

Notes:   

57. The priority identifiers in the table above agree with ARINC 741, ARINC 781
and ICAO SVGM.  These identifiers should therefore be used in the interface to the flight crew if compatibility with existing Classic Aero systems is to be preserved.  The generic section of this appendix shows an opposite
numbering scheme in Table 2-7, which is intended as a logical scheme only.
58. For Ground-To-Air calls: The Inmarsat Oceanic Safety SDM [1] defines the 
four level priority scheme for voice calls dialed from the ground side. It provides a table mapping the digits to be dialed to the corresponding Call Application. 
59. For Air-To-Ground Calls: The interface to the pilot is User Terminal 
dependent and the naming and or numerical priority level convention is not intended to be standardized by this appendix. Nonetheless, a conformant implementation shall enable the user to specify these four logical call priorities when initiating an A2G call. 
60. BGAN Emergency Calls as defined in SDM V1Ch4 are not part of the SBB-
Safety system. These calls are detected by the BGAN terminal when the user dials one of a specific predefined set of emergency numbers (e.g., 999, 911, etc). The BGAN terminal sets an emergency tag to the call and the BGAN 
network diverts the call based on the location. SwiftBroadband priority 
service provides a more rigorously defined system for dealing with emergency situations; therefore it is not a requirement for this approval. 
Further the capability to make one of these emergency calls when no USIM is present is not applicable to the installation environment on an aircraft and is not required to be implemented. 

## 2.2.3.3.3 Acars Communications

The AES shall allocate its own resources in a way that prioritizes ACARS messaging over non-safety data. 

A facility shall be provided to configure the APN of the PDP context for the ACARS service at installation time. All ACARS messages shall be handled by the AES at the same priority level. 

Note:  ACARS messaging is affected by two different prioritization mechanisms: 

## Prioritization Between Acars Messages, E.G. Atc Vs. Aoc Messages.

The ACARS protocol itself does not capture or convey priority information, therefore the AES and the SwiftBroadband network both handle all ACARS messages transparently at the same priority level.  Connected avionics (e.g. 

CMU) and ground routing equipment may provide their own level of prioritizing, but such prioritization is beyond the scope of this AES MOPS. 

Prioritization between ACARS data and other data on the network.  
The ACARS protocol itself does not capture or convey priority information, therefore the AES and the SwiftBroadband network both handle all ACARS messages transparently at the same priority level.  Connected avionics (e.g. CMU) and ground routing equipment may provide their own level of prioritizing, but such prioritization is beyond the scope of this AES MOPS. The level of priority access to system resources in the AES and in the BGAN network is such that ACARS messages are assured of obtaining a communications path regardless of congestion caused by lower-priority communication services. To assign the appropriate priority to the ACARS service, the BGAN network distinguishes the ACARS data from other network traffic on the basis of the APN 
of the PDP context used for ACARS data.  The AES is responsible for setting up the PDP context using the correct APN.  The BGAN network is responsible for the allocation of system resources based on the APN name.  This mechanism is described in Section 2.2.3.3.1. 

## 2.2.3.4 Satellite Subnetwork Data Protocol

The AES shall implement all functionality required to interact with the Inmarsat SwiftBroadband network protocol.  This shall include (but not be limited to): 

•
AES acquiring and registering on the satellite network.
•
Dynamically negotiating appropriate bearers.
•
Dynamically negotiate FEC parameters to maximize throughput while
maintaining target packet error rate.
•
Negotiating spot-beam handovers.
•
Connecting to circuit-switched services (voice).
•
Connecting to packet-switched services.
•
Creating PDP contexts.
Note:  The SwiftBroadband protocol and control mechanisms aim to maintain a packet error rate of 10-3 after error correction.  This is followed by a 16-bit CRC 
which will reject almost all packets with errors, giving a residual packet error rate of 16 x 10-9.  This exceeds the requirement of 10-6 in the generic part of this appendix.  A packet in this context is an FEC block.  A standard 128 octet message is typically contained in an FEC block.  The lost packet rate of 10-3 after the CRC is improved to 10-12 by the retry mechanism used with background connections. 

## 2.2.3.4.1 Atn-Compliant Protocol Requirements

Not applicable.  ATN is not supported. 

## 2.2.3.4.2 Acars Protocol Requirements

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The AES shall implement an ACARS Airborne Gateway (AAGW) function and support ACARS communications as described in the Inmarsat SDM [1] V3C03, Section 2.  The failover function to Classic Aero is, however, not a mandatory function. If the AES is configured to handle ACARS, the AAGW shall automatically register with the AGGW after start-up. 

Messages shall be passed transparently as binary payload data, independent of their content. 

## 2.2.3.5 Voice Protocol

The AES shall implement all protocol features to set up and maintain two voice calls, one through the AMBE+2 vocoder, and one using VoIP, in accordance with the Inmarsat SDM [1]. 

## 2.2.3.5.1 Vocoder Interoperability With Satellite Subnetwork

The AES shall implement an AMBE+2 vocoder and associated CS voice protocols as specified in the Inmarsat SDM [1] V5C02 . 

In addition, the AES shall implement a G729A vocoder and associated VoIP protocols as specified in the Inmarsat SDM [1] V3C02. Digital test ports, either physical or virtual, shall be provided to test each voice codec with the Voice Codec Test Set (VCTS) or a functionally equivalent test using test vectors to verify that each voice codec executes it algorithm correctly as designed. 

## 2.2.3.5.2 Vocoder Performance In An Aeronautical Environment

Note:  The two vocoders (or voice codecs) are specified in the Inmarsat SDM [1].  AES designers have no choice regarding the vocoder algorithms, but should ensure correct implementation and functioning of these algorithms (e.g. by using known test vector sets).  Attention should be paid to effects of aircraft acoustic noise during integration on the aircraft.  See Section 3.4.6.3. 

## 2.2.3.6 User Data Interfaces 2.2.3.6.1 Atn-Compliant Service Interface

Not applicable. 

## 2.2.3.6.2 Acars Interface

The AES shall provide transmit and receive ports to interface to at least one CMU (optionally two CMUs) or equivalent function in the aircraft. 

ACARS interface shall provide ACARS service through the ACARS Airborne Gateway (AAGW) function as defined in Section 2.2.3.4.2. 

Note: A typical interface implementation uses an ARINC 429 port to connect to at least one CMU.  Alternate implementations achieving the same functionality (e.g. ARINC 664) are acceptable. 

The AES shall contribute negligible delay to ACARS messages (air-to-ground and ground-to-air). 

Note:  No formal allocation of the allowable delay has been done.  However, end-to-end through the network, delays of less than 10 seconds are expected.  
The delay in the AES should be less than 0.5 seconds.  Only the end-to-end delay will be verified.  It is important that separate data queues are implemented to allow proper prioritization of air-to-ground ACARS data. 

2.2.3.6.3 
External Physical and Data Link Layer Requirements 
Not applicable. 

2.2.3.6.4 
Avionics Subnetwork Interface Requirements for ISO-8208 Service 
Not applicable. 

2.2.3.6.5 
Alternative ATN-compliant Subnetwork Access Protocols 
Not applicable. 

## 2.2.3.6.6 Ip Data Interface

The AES may optionally provide one or more interfaces to on-board computer equipment supporting Internet Protocol (IP). If an IP interface is provided, facilities shall be provided for the AES to establish, either automatically or otherwise, a connection (PDP context) with a required APN on the ground to handle traffic to and from the IP interface.   
Note: Information security requirements related to this interface are given in Section 2.2.3.10. 

## 2.2.3.7 Circuit Mode Service Requirements 2.2.3.7.1 Required Services

The AES shall provide interfaces for at least two priority-service voice calls. 

The priority of the voice calls shall be selectable, using four priority levels, similar to those in Table 2-20.   
The AES shall provide for both air-to-ground and ground-to-air voice calls. 

If a new voice call is established while no other calls are in progress, it shall use the AMBE+2 voice codec and the SBB CS connection.  If a second voice call is established while another voice call is in progress it shall use the G729A vocoder and a VoIP connection, through a special PDP connection. The AES shall have the ability, when so configured, to block all incoming nonpriority calls. (ref. MASPS V130) 
The AES shall have the ability, when so configured, to display the priority and calling line identity (CLI) to the flight crew.  The CLI shall be displayed as a phone number or a name looked up from an on-board phone book. (ref. MASPS 
V140).   

## 2.2.3.7.2 Voice Quality

The AES shall provide digital test ports, either physical or virtual, to allow testing of the processing of the voice signal paths from the analogue input port of the AES to the input of the voice codec, and the path from the output port of the voice codec to the analogue output port of the AES.  A typical configuration is shown in Figure 2-8. 

The AES shall furthermore provide for a digital loopback at the digital test points above to enable measurement of the characteristics of the voice input circuit and output circuit in cascade. The input and output voice circuits shall each meet the following criteria: 
 

## 2.2.3.7.2.1 Audio Frequency Response

The relative attenuation shall fall within the following mask. 

| Frequency    | Relative attenuation (dB)    |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Minimum      | Maximum                      |
| 300 to 400   | -2.0                         |
| 400 to 600   | -1.2                         |
| 600 to 2400  | -1.2                         |
| 2400 to 2700 | -1.2                         |
| 2700 to 3400 | -1.2                         |

## 2.2.3.7.2.2 Total Audio Noise Including Quantization Noise

With a sinusoidal frequency of 1020 Hz applied to the input port, the overall baseband signal to noise power ratio, measured with psophometric noise weighting (according to ITU-T O.41), shall be above the following values. 

| Input level (dBm0)    | Baseband Signal to Noise Ratio (dB)    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 0                     | > 27                                   |
| -10                   | > 26                                   |
| -20                   | > 26                                   |
|                       |                                        |

## 2.2.3.7.2.3 Spurious In-Band Audio Signals

With the input and output ports terminated in their nominal impedance, the sum of all the in-band spurious and noise (including any 400 Hz and other in-band spurious signals), measured through a psophometric filter (according to ITU-T 
O.41), shall not exceed -64 dBm0. 

## 2.2.3.7.2.4 Spurious And Image Audio Signals

With a sinusoidal signal in the range 300 to 3400 Hz applied to the digital input port of the audio output path at a level of 0 dBm0, the level of any resultant spurious out-of-band signal above 4 kHz (e.g. image) appearing at any audio output port shall not exceed -30 dBm0. With a sinusoidal signal in the range 20 Hz to 20 kHz applied to the analogue input of the audio input path, at a level corresponding to 0 dBm0 in the digital domain at 1 kHz, the level of any resultant spurious product at the digital output shall not exceed -30 dBm0. 

## 2.2.3.7.2.5 Audio Amplitude Jitter

With a sinusoidal signal of 1020 Hz applied to any input port at any level between 0 dBm0 and -20 dBm0, the overall baseband amplitude jitter shall not exceed 13% peak-to-peak (i.e. amplitude jitter < 0.13 * Vp-p). 

## 2.2.3.7.2.6 Audio Phase Jitter

With a sinusoidal signal of 1020 Hz applied to any input port at any level between 0 dBm0 and -20 dBm0, the overall baseband phase jitter shall not exceed 10% peak to peak. (i.e. phase uncertainty < +/- 18 degrees from phase center). 

## 2.2.3.7.2.7 Voice Latency

The sum of the latencies in the forward and return directions, which an AES adds to a voice call, shall not exceed the following values: 

•
CS or VoIP call over AES6 or AES7: 300 ms.
•
CS or VoIP call over AES4, using bearers having 80 ms interleaving:
460 ms.
These values are measured from the time the first symbol of a frame is received through the antenna to the time the first symbol of a frame is transmitted through the antenna.  Self-imposed delay (SID) is included. (ref. MASPS V80). 

## 2.2.3.7.2.8 Call Setup Time

The AES shall not add more than 1 second to the call setup time for a new air-toground or ground-to-air call.  This shall be achieved for 99% of calls.  (ref. 

MASPS V30 & V40). 

 

## 2.2.3.8 Recovery From Primary Power Interruption

The AES shall conform to the following requirements after encountering primary power interruptions from any cause. 

- 
Power interruptions of less than five milliseconds duration shall cause 
data or voice interruptions of less than 180 ms in either direction. 
- 
For power interruptions from 5 to 200 milliseconds duration the AES 
shall meet the following performance criteria: 
- 
The AES shall require no more than five seconds recovery time, 
beginning from when primary power has been restored. "Recovery" is defined as automatically returning to the previous operating state (without user intervention) such that priority voice and data services resume in the same configuration they were in before the power interruption occurred. This assumes stable transmit and receive bearers with at least the minimum quality characteristics with channel impairments specified in the SDM [1] Vol.5 Ch.3 Section 2.3.10, as well as established priority services. 
- 
In-transit data service packets which have been acknowledged on either the DTE or DCE interface, but not yet transferred to the opposite interface, may be lost. Non-AES higher-layer entities that 
employ end-to-end acknowledgement protocols may choose to 
retransmit such lost data.  
- 
Synchronization and RF output power may be lost during the power interruption and recovery time. 
- 
Calls and PDP contexts which are in the process of being set up may be lost. 
- 
There shall be no more than a momentary effect on cockpit displays. 
- 
For power interruptions longer than 200 milliseconds duration the AES 
shall recover to an operational state without manual reset.  The equipment shall register on the network for voice, data and ACARS 
service (as applicable) automatically. 

## 2.2.3.9 Failure/Status Indication

The AES equipment shall provide, independent of any operator action, an indication of the AES resulting in  

- 
loss of data communications 
- 
loss of voice communications 
Note: An industry-standard method for reporting these failures may be implemented by transmitting Label 270 on an ARINC 429 output port, as described in ARINC 741, part 2, Section 4.7.3.1. 

## 2.2.3.10 Information Security

The AES shall provide adequate domain segregation to prevent the data stream to or from any IP interface from influencing the data streams used for the ACARS or priority voice functions. An Information Security Risk Assessment shall be performed in accordance with the methodology provided in DO-326 Section 3.2. With respect to the influence of any IP interface on the ACARS service at least the following threats (as identified in ARINC 781 Attachment 8 Section 4.5) shall be mitigated in the design of the AES: 

|                                      |            | Threat Condition    | Impact Level    |
|--------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Undetected                           | corruption | of                  | FANS            |
| messages (includes spoofing)         |            |                     |                 |
| III (major)                          |            |                     |                 |
| Spoofed FANS messages could result   |            |                     |                 |

| flight level, causing a reduction in |            |                     |                 |
| safety margins.                      |            |                     |                 |
| Loss of availability of services     | IV (minor) |                     |                 |
| Loss of ACARS over SBB is mitigated  |            |                     |                 |
| via fallback to ACARS over Classic   |            |                     |                 |

## Notes:

61. The aim of this requirement is to enable passing the ACARS, voice and IP
data streams through a single modem.  This would probably require that the IP data be handled transparently in the modem, so that it cannot influence
the behavior of the modem in any way.  This implies that the IP data shall not
be able to control PDP contexts in the modem.  It also implies that IP data shall be treated with a lower priority and be queued and throttled by the segregation function in favor of the ACARS and voice data streams.
62. RTCA DO-326[10] Section 3.3 provides guidance on how the Information
Security Risk Assessment should influence the design.
63. ARINC 781-6 Attachment 8 describes a reference design which is likely to
fulfill these requirements if implemented correctly, as well as an analysis showing how the requirements are fulfilled.  Actual design details of any AES will probably differ from the reference design.  Other independent solutions may also be possible.  An analysis using the methodology in RTCA DO-
326[10] will be required to determine if a specific design fulfills the
requirements.

## 2.3 Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions 2.3.1 General Requirements

The environmental tests and their associated performance requirements described in this Section are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under environmental conditions representative of those which may be encountered in actual operations. Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in RTCA Document DO-160G [3], Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment.  General information regarding the use of the procedures in RTCA DO-160G [3] is contained in Sections 1.0 through 3.0 of that document.  Also, a method of identifying which environmental tests were conducted and other amplifying information on the conduct of the tests is contained in Appendix A of RTCA DO-160G [3]. 

DO-160G frequently gives different levels of environmental conditions.  The equipment manufacturer is required to select the environmental categories suitable for intended airframes and installation environment. Some of the minimum performance requirements in Section 2.2 of this normative appendix are not required to be qualified to all of the conditions contained in RTCA DO-160G [3].  Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Section 2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these conditions.  In those cases it is sufficient to verify compliance at ambient conditions for many requirements, and then continued compliance is inferred by successfully meeting the requirements. Table 2-9 is a compliance matrix that cross-references the RTCA DO-160G [3] environmental test requirements with the performance requirements listed in Section 2.2.3 of this appendix.  Only those tests specifically identified by "X" or by a numerically referenced footnote need be repeated in the various environments.  Furthermore, unless otherwise noted successful verification of compliance to a requirement section implies compliance to all lesser sections as well. In addition to the exceptions above, certain environmental tests contained in this section are not required for minimum performance equipment unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for additional environmental conditions.  If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional conditions, then these tests shall be performed. 

## 2.3.2 Equipment Configurations

The procedures in this appendix may be used to establish conformance of complete AES systems or major components of an AES, as listed in Section 2.2.1.  However, even when a complete system is tested, it is allowable to demonstrate conformance by performing tests on individual major components, and then obtaining final results by calculation.  Specifically, the filter characteristics of the DLNA may be measured separately from the rest of the transmitter function and the total result obtained by calculation.  This avoids the very high dynamic range required for the spurious and harmonics measurements. Similarly, the antenna's characteristics may be measured separately. Measuring major components individually also allows measurement results to be reused where performance of different combinations of major components is to be established. 

## 2.3.3 Configuration Control

Nominal environment testing, followed by extreme environment testing, shall be conducted on the AES with the operational flight software installed according to the correct software version number as specified in the equipment configuration documentation.  Hardware shall conform to the configuration of the hardware version number specified in the equipment configuration documentation. 

## 2.3.4 Specific Environmental Test Conditions

In addition to the specific functional tests to be repeated in various operational environments, the equipment as a whole shall be subjected to the test conditions as specified in RTCA DO-160G [3], in the sections identified in Table 2-23 and Table 2-24.  By performing (and passing) those tests, the corresponding requirements of this standard shall be met.

64. Due to the difficulties in performing radiating measurements while changing the 
environmental conditions of the antenna, acceptable alternative test procedures may be implemented.  Portions of the antenna subsystem may be measured over the required range of operating environmental conditions.  The measurement data thus obtained may be used in an analysis to show that the specified antenna performance is achieved under the declared operating environmental conditions.  This analysis shall include the effects of materials and construction of the individual radiating elements and account for the effects of beam pointing errors versus environmental 
conditions on other specification requirements within the declared coverage volume. 
65. Performance parameters of the antenna subsystem will not be measured during these 
environmental tests.  These environmental tests are for survivability and apply only to equipment which is mounted on the outside of the aircraft.  Testing of the antenna RF 
performance properties to determine the serviceability of the antenna after exposure 
is acceptable.  This test could take the form of a production test procedure or other test and shall verify the antenna RF and control functionality has not degraded compared to any baseline testing performed prior to environmental exposure (within test accuracy limits). 
66. These tests are not listed for the receiver and transmitter subsystems and need not be 
performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for the particular environmental condition.  For example: An antenna intended for use under an 
additional radome (e.g. tail-mounted antennas) may only need to meet the drip-proof 
category of waterproofness. 
67. The application of the Crash Safety Shock test may result in damage to the equipment 
under test.  Therefore, this test may be conducted after the other tests have been completed.  In this case, Section 2.1.7, "Effects of Test" does not apply. 
68. This test shall be conducted with the spray directed perpendicular to the equipment. 
69. Applicable requirements: 
a)   At the end of the 24-hour exposure period, the equipment shall function. b)  Following the 2-hour operation period at ambient temperature after the 160-hour exposure period at elevated temperature, the performance requirements shall be met. 
70. The appropriate test will depend upon whether the equipment is AC or DC powered. 71. The application of the Low Voltage Conditions (DC) (Category B equipment) test 
may result in damage to the equipment under test.  Therefore, this test may be conducted after the other tests have been completed.  Section 2.1.7, "Effects of Test," does not apply. 
72. Select Category A (high degree of protection against voltage spikes required) or 
Category B (lower standard of protection acceptable) as applicable for the equipment under test. 
73. Excluding frequency to which receiver is tuned and the response within its resonant 
pass band.

74. Equipment is not required to meet performance specifications during the application
of HIRF, (Category U, 20 v/m).  The equipment must meet all requirements following the application.
75. Meet requirements of DO-160G [3] except as noted by Section 2.2.3.8.
76. Phase Noise (Section 2.2.3.1.3.1.11) performed under normal conditions only.
77. Not required for systems certified to Design Assurance Level D.  For systems
certified to Design Assurance Level C or higher, equipment is not required to meet performance specifications during the period of application of the Lightning Induced
Transient test, but must meet all requirements following the test. (Ref AC 20-136B)
78. Only required for AMSS antennas.
79. Applicable to equipment requiring cooling.  Modify test length to three hours.  Verify
no smoke or fire.  Only essential services, namely one voice channel plus ACARS at 8
kb/s minimum, are required to be provided.
80. Not used 81. The Altitude tests in DO-160G sections 4.6.1, 4.6.2 and 4.6.3 are not applicable.
82. The antenna equipment shall be subjected to vibration and operational shock testing
exposure equivalent to the qualification levels for which the antenna is being certified prior to subjecting the antenna to intermodulation testing.
83. A reduced subset of receiver sensitivity tests may be conducted under indicated
environmental conditions.  See Section 2.4.3.1.2.2.1.1. During the RF Susceptibility tests the receiver frequency is stepped through the full receive band.  For Induced Lightning category, test is performed only after subjecting to environment. For Temperature and Altitude category (DO-160G Section 4) the reduced receiver
sensitivity test does not apply, as the Inmarsat MTRs require a full Packet Error Rate test.  Regardless of this table the mandatory test in the MTRs need to be executed for Inmarsat type approval.
84. Not used. 85. Only response between 1.5 and 1.7 GHz needs to be monitored.
86. After the Lightning Direct Effects test the antenna under test shall be functional if the
manufacturer specifies this in the product's performance specification.  In all cases it
is a requirement that the antenna does not pose a danger to the aircraft after such exposure.  If the antenna is limited to installation in positions on the aircraft where lightning strikes are not expected (e.g. under another radome which provides protection) this shall be declared as a limitation.
87. Circuit mode service.  Perform test for Total Noise Including Quantization Noise test
as in Section 2.4.3.7.2. For DO-160G Section 4, only testing over temperature is
required, not altitude.
88. Operational shocks (DO-160G Section 7):  Performance is only verified after (not
during) exposure to shocks.
An "X" in Table 2-23 indicates that testing of performance is required before/during/after exposure to the environmental tests as specified in DO-160G [3]. 

A "-" in Table 2-23 indicates that no testing of performance is required before/during/after exposure to the environmental tests in DO-160G [3]. 

If an antenna has previously been approved for Classic Aero operation in terms of TSO- C132 and DO-210D, then only the following tests (as applicable to the Class of antenna) 
in the Antenna Subsystem section of Table 2-23 are required to be performed:  Sections 2.2.3.1.2.6, 2.2.3.1.2.6.1 and 2.2.3.1.2.6.2.  The other antenna tests are then not applicable. 

## 2.4 Equipment Performance Verification Procedures

The following procedures provide guidelines for tests to ensure compliance with the MOPS performance requirements.  Except for Section 3.4.5, these do not require flight testing.  Regarding secondary references from this section, any reference to "flight tests" in lower level documents should be ignored. Some of the following tests may require additional test equipment not shown in the test setup figures.  Such equipment would be associated with the interface between the satellite system emulator and the AES or radio channel unit. 

## 2.4.1 Definitions Of Terms And Conditions Of Test The Following Are Definitions Of Terms And The Conditions Under Which The Tests Described In This Section Should Be Conducted: A. Power Input Voltage. Unless Otherwise Specified, All Tests Shall Be Conducted With The Power Input Voltage Adjusted To Design Voltage +2%.  The Input Voltage Shall Be Measured At The Input Terminals Of The Equipment Under Test. B. Power Input Frequency

(1) In the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC source of essentially 
constant frequency (e.g., 400 Hz), the input frequency shall be adjusted to design frequency +2%. 
(2) In the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC source of variable 
frequency (e.g., 300 to 1,000 Hz), unless otherwise specified, tests shall be conducted with the input frequency adjusted to within 5% of a selected frequency and within the range for which the equipment is designed.

26. Set the frequency synthesizer and the spectrum analyzer to 1.645GHz. 27. Set the spectrum analyzer to zero span with a sweep time of 10s.  A faster sweep 
time may be used for electronically steered antennas (≈0.5s or less). 
28. Setup the AUT relative to the source antenna so that the AUT can be steered 
directly at the source antenna by steering the AUT to approximately 5° elevation.   
29. Steer the AUT to the source horn.  Note the azimuth and elevation or beam 
number of this beam. 
30. Set a convenient level (approx. 80% of full scale) and record the marker level. 
31. Steer the AUT to El=90° 32. Set the spectrum analyzer to external trigger, single sweep. 33. Steer the AUT back to the source horn co-ordinates recorded earlier.

## 2.4.3.1.1.2 Aes4 Antenna Test Requirements 2.4.3.1.1.2.1 Radiation Pattern Measurements (Gain, Axial Ratio)

Reference: 2.2.3.1.2.1.1.3 
Special Test Equipment Test Range/Chamber and test positioner, compliant with Section 2.4.2.1.1.1 of this appendix. Ground plane, compliant with Section 2.4.2.1.1.2 of this appendix. Antenna controller (if required). Antenna test set.  Refer to Section 2.4.2.1.1.2. 

All test equipment shall hold a valid calibration status.  Cables, adaptors and other ancillary items need not be calibrated. Definitions and conditions defined in Section 2.4.1 of this appendix apply. 

Test Frequencies The AES 4 antenna shall be characterized at the Extended plus Standard L-band frequencies listed in Table 2-25 and Table 2-26. 

Test Facility This test procedure assumes that a conventional far field range or anechoic chamber will be used to determine compliance of the AES 4 antenna.  Equivalent compact range or near field techniques may also be used if they provide an equivalent level of accuracy and angular resolution.  This shall be supported with measurement or analytical data as evidence. 

Gain Standard Measurement Prior to antenna radiation pattern measurements a measurement shall be conducted on a standard gain horn in the vertical and horizontal plane and the levels associated with the required test frequencies recorded for gain calibration of the test range.  These should be retained as the gain standard should be re-measured at the end of the AES 4 antenna characterization to ensure that the test setup is stable and that no changes have occurred as a result of positioner movement, equipment drift, setup errors or cable damage. 

Once the gain standard measurement has been completed it may be removed and the ground plane and AES 4 antenna (antenna under test or AUT) may be installed.  Note that the center of rotation of the positioner shall be adjusted so that any parallax angle associated with the positioner rotation is removed.  See Figure 2-13 for recommended typical setup details.   
Radiation Pattern Measurement The AUT shall be characterized over the INMARSAT sub-hemisphere extending from 5° elevation (above the plane associated with the plane of an aircraft in level flight) to 90° elevation (directly above the aircraft).  The AUT shall be characterized at approximately 4820 points corresponding to grid of constant 2° elevation steps with the number of azimuth steps at each elevation angle being determined by  
Nsteps(*elevation*) = ceil(180*cos(*elevation*)) 
This distributes the sampling evenly over the solid angle occupied by the measurement sub-hemisphere. 

At each measurement point the complex (magnitude and phase) RF signals received by the AUT are measured for each of the two polarizations (H and V), at each of the nine test frequencies and for each beam to be tested.  A typical test setup is in Figure 1.  Note that the test setup is reciprocal and the AUT may transmit to the "source" horn in which case the H and V signals from the "source" horn are measured and recorded for each beam/frequency/measurement point. Once the data is collected it shall be organized for analysis for gain and axial ratio for each frequency, beam and measurement point.  Right hand circularly polarized gain shall be computed and used to determine antenna compliance to the performance requirements in Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.3 for gain and axial ratio. All differences in system/cable losses between the measurement of the gain standard and the measurement of the AUT shall be accounted for in the final antenna gain computation. 

## 2.4.3.1.1.2.2 Carrier To Multipath (C/M) Ratio Reference: 2.2.3.1.2.7

The anechoic chamber/far field range described in Section 2.4.3.1.1.2.1 shall be used for this measurements.  A compact range or near field range (cylindrical or spherical) may be used if it can be shown that the same angular coverage accuracy can be achieved.  Planar scanners are not suitable.  Roll plane symmetry is assumed for this measurement.  Data is collected from ϕb = 0° to 180° in 22.5° steps. 

The requirement is for the C/M rejection of the antenna to be greater than 10dB at ϴb = 
5° elevation and 12dB at ϴb = 20° elevation for a median sea state.  Based on measurements this is computed as follows: 

•
C/M (smooth sea) is calculated for the specific specular point pattern
measurement by using an equation. 
•
C/M (rough sea) is calculated by integration using the pattern measurements and
multipath power densities. 
•
C/M (median sea) is calculated as the weighted average of C/M (smooth sea) and
C/M (rough sea). 
For a beam-pointing direction at elevation angle, θb = 5° and azimuth angle, φb = 0°, measure the elevation cuts for horizontal and vertical polarizations (Gh(θ,θb,φb) and Gv(θ,θb,φb) respectively) in the elevation range from θb to -45°. Measure the circular polarization gain at θb (Gc(θb,φb)).  This is to be done for the test frequencies in Table 
2-27 and Table 2-28. 

The value of C/M for smooth sea state shall then be calculated as follows: 

Where:

is 1.59 for $\Theta_{\rm b}=5^{\circ}$ elevation and 1.07 for $\Theta_{\rm b}=20^{\circ}$
 is the RCP power gain at ϴb elevation (5° or 20° depending on the case) at the specific azimuth and frequency being evaluated 
  is the horizontally polarized power gain at -ϴb elevation when the beam is pointed to (ϴb,ϕb) at the specific azimuth and frequency being evaluated 
  is the vertically polarized power gain at -ϴb elevation when the beam is pointed to (ϴb,ϕb) at the specific azimuth and frequency being evaluated 
  
is the magnitude of the "horizontal" reflection coefficient of seawater at ϴb incidence (0.983 at 5° and 0.932 at 20° elevation). 

  is the magnitude of the "vertical" reflection coefficient of seawater at ϴb incidence (0.15 at 5° and 0.55 at 20° elevation). 

If the smooth sea result for a measured point complies with the limits in Section 
2.2.3.1.2.7 then further analysis is not required. 

The C/M computation in the rough sea case is computed using scattered power densities listed in Table 2-29 for elevation angles of 10° and 20°. The densities at 10° elevation angle shall be used for the computation of C/M at 5° elevation, i.e., Dh(θ,10°) ≈ Dh(θ,5°) 
and Dv(θ,10°) ≈ Dv(θ,5°).

## 2.4.3.1.1.2.3 Constituent Component Characterization For Eirp And G/T

Reference: 2.2.3.1.2.1.1.3 
These are measurements conducted on the internal interconnects and sub-assemblies within the AES 4 antenna and are used in the computation of the G/T of the integrated antenna.  Assemblies expected to be measured in this procedure include but are not limited to: 

- 
Baluns 
- 
Switching networks 
- 
Phase shifters 
- 
Power splitters/combiners 
- 
Coaxial interconnects or feed-throughs 
- 
Filters 
- 
LNA 
Note that the filters and LNA together are referred to as the DLNA and may be characterized as one component.  In that case the noise performance of the LNA will include the receive filter losses.  They need not be characterized separately.  The transmit filter losses must be characterized separately however for EIRP calculations. Note that in general most of these components (baluns, feed etc.) are included in the antenna used for radiation pattern measurements since they are used to control the radiation pattern and to form the beam in space.  Exceptions to this would likely be any coaxial feed-through/interconnects, the filters and the LNA which could be housed within the AES 4 antenna LRU.  The effects of these components must be accounted for for EIRP and G/T computations.  Note also that only ohmic loss contributes to Tsys; not mismatch loss. This is not intended to be a detailed measurement procedure but a generalized guide to what must be taken into account.  It is also assumed that the antenna manufacturer has qualified staff available to perform these types of measurements and to adjust the procedure for their specific equipment. All measurements shall be conducted using a network analyzer and/or noise figure meter as applicable to the specific device under test.  A typical equipment list and setup are given below.  All test equipment shall hold a valid calibration status.  Cables, adaptors and other ancillary items need not be calibrated, however where their loss performance is required they shall be measured with calibrated equipment. 

Required Equipment: 
Vector Network Analyzer: HP8753A/B/C, HP 8720D, Wiltron 360 or eq. SMA/3.5mm Calibration Kit : HP85052 or eq. 

SMA/3.5mm coaxial cables: various, 50Ω; Micro Coax, Aeroflex etc. 

Miscellaneous 3.5mm PCB connectors and adaptors (if required). Power Supply for active devices (LNA, switches, phase shifter): various Noise Figure Meter (for LNA measurement): HP8970, 8973 or eq. Noise Source: HP346B or eq. as required for the test instrument. Groundplane. Antenna test set.  Refer to Section 2.4.2.1.1.2 
Synthesized signal generator, spectrum analyzer, power meter, calibrated power attenuator rated at 5 to 10 times the HPA output power Measurement Procedure for antenna components (cables, feed-throughs, filters) 

35. Setup and calibrate the network analyzer (a full two port calibration) per the
manufacturer's instructions for the frequency range to be tested (1.5 to 1.7GHz is a good range). 
36. Insert the device under test (DUT) and measure the insertion loss and return loss
for the DUT. If a power supply or bias voltage/current is required then the levels of bias shall be as per the design values used in the actual antenna.  It is not recommended that the DLNA gain be measured with a network analyzer.
37. If the DUT is not a connectorized device such as a PCB assembly then the
insertion loss associated with those connectors added may be subtracted from the measured data.  This applies to adaptors as well.  This may require a back-toback measurement of a pair of connectors/adaptors or use of manufacturer's published data.
38. Record the insertion loss (dBS(21)) and return loss (dBS(11)) at all of the
relevant frequencies in Table 2-27 and Table 2-28.
DLNA Measurement/Characterization Procedure For characterization of the DLNA a noise source and noise figure test setup are typically used.  These are used with the Y-Factor method and give acceptable accuracy for DLNA 
noise figure and gain.  Some modern network analyzers have the capability of measuring noise as well.  Noise figure and gain shall be collected for the receive band frequencies in Table 2-28. 

Test Procedure 

39. Calibrate the noise figure meter per the manufacturer's instructions.  This may 
require that the user input the ENR (Excess Noise Ratio) values for the noise source into the instrument memory.  The measurement averaging should be set to a convenient value (eg. 8 or 16). 
40. Set the test frequency as follows: 
a. **START** = 1518MHz 
b. **STOP** = 1559 MHz 
c. **STEP** = 1MHz 
Note that test data will not be taken at each 1MHz frequency step; this step size is required for the 8970A in order to allow all of the receive frequencies in Table 2-28 to be tested.  Newer instruments may not require this. 

41. Connect a suitable cable for connection to the DLNA to the RF input on the noise 
figure meter. 
42. Connect the noise source to the RF input cable. 
43. Push the **CALIBRATE** button on the 8970. 
44. Verify the calibration state by checking that the direct connection of the noise 
source to the instrument yields a gain of 0.0 (±0.1) and a noise figure of 0.0 
(±0.1. 
45. Insert the DLNA and ensure that all connections are secure. 
46. Power up the DLNA to the nominal power supply values used in the antenna. 
47. Step through the receive band test frequencies and record the DLNA gain and 
noise figure at each frequency.  Ensure that averaging is restarted and finished for each frequency. 
48. Measurements may include the receive filter at the DLNA input.

HPA Measurements Measurement of a built-in power amplifier (HPA) used in the AES 4 antenna shall be performed to determine the HPA gain and output power at the five transmit frequencies listed in Table 2-27.  The test setup is shown below.  The HPA output power should be measured using a spectrum analyzer protected with a high power attenuator of precisely known loss.  The HPA output power should be measured at a level at which the HPA is still operating with acceptable linearity for use with the I-4/Alphasat system. 

## Test Procedure

49. Measure the insertion loss of the attenuator at the transmit frequencies in Table
2-27 using a calibrated network analyzer.  The attenuator shall be measured to a 
precision of 0.1dB at each test frequency.  These values should be recorded as 
LATTEN for each frequency. 
50. Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 5.  Set the frequency of the signal
generator to the first transmit frequency to be tested (1.6265 GHz).  Set the output power of the signal generator to -30dBm.  Ensure that the signal generator
RF output is off.
51. Apply power to the HPA so that it is operating at its nominal power supply 
voltage. 
52. Turn on the signal generator RF output and increase the power to the input of the 
HPA until the spectrum analyzer display indicates a power level such that the following is satisfied: 
 
Where: 
 is the displayed power on the spectrum analyzer. 

 is the loss of the attenuator (in dB) recorded in Step 1. 

 is the HPA output power to be recorded for use in EIRP computations. 

As a target value; PHPA should exceed that required to achieve the minimum EIRP for an AES4 terminal taking in to account installation losses.  For example: 
EIRP ≥10 dBW 
GANT ≥ 2.5dB 
Installation Losses ≤ 2.5dB (A typical aircraft installation maximum) 
 
From the above; the minimum amplifier power must be greater than 7.5dBW (5.62W) to meet the EIRP requirement of 10dBW.  With a bit of margin one might decide that 7.1W (8.5dBW) is the minimum.  If installation losses are known to be greater than 2.5dB due to cable type or run length or even transmit filter performance then the HPA target power shall be adjusted to maintain the 10dBW EIRP requirement. 

53. Repeat for all remaining transmit frequencies.  Record the HPA power for each 
test frequency for EIRP computation at each frequency. 

## 2.4.3.1.1.2.4 Measurement And Computation Of System Noise Temperature Tsys

The system noise temperature may be determined by one of three methods: 

- 
The test procedure in DFL document MTR A.1; DFLD2253206, Issue A8, 
Section 7.5 
- 
The test procedure in Inmarsat MTR 05; Issue 2, Section 6.5 
- 
The method detailed below. 
CAUTION: This test requires clear-sky radiation of RF energy and may require authorization from government agencies and/or relevant satellite operators. 

The antenna gain and coverage volume requirements for AES4 antenna is to be satisfied by demonstrating that the overall AES4 system G/T requirement of Section 2.2.3.1.1.1.1.3 over the coverage volume as defined therein is met. In order to specify this in terms of performance at the single RF port of the antenna, it is necessary to use the temperature of the AES4 DLNA connected to this port. In this G/T test, first the antenna noise temperature is measured at the test frequencies in Table 2-23. Then the receiver G/T is calculated using these temperatures together with the antenna gain values measured per the procedures in Section 2.4.3.1.1.2.1. 

 
Equipment Required Antenna Ground Plane AES4 antenna under test with internal DLNA (access required to the internal DLNA input) 
Noise Figure Meter (HP 8970B or equivalent). Noise Source (HP 346C or equivalent) RF Power Source (capable of maximum RF power for this test). 

Measurement Requirements The objective is to simulate as far as is practical the sky noise environment experienced during actual AES operation. The following conditions apply when performing antenna noise temperature measurements: 

•
The antenna shall be viewing a clear-sky condition (no or nearly no clouds) with
a site that offers little or no obstruction of sky visibility over the upper hemisphere;
•
The radome to be installed as part of the antenna shall be installed during the
measurements;
•
The antenna shall be mounted on the ground plane and positioned relative to the
Earth in a manner that simulates nominally horizontal level aircraft flight;
•
The ambient temperature shall be in the range of 290 ± 30 K, where (0° C =
273.15 K);
•
The noise source and noise figure meter shall be operated within the temperature
range for which their calibration is valid and that the correct ENR data from the noise source has been entered into the 8970B.
Step 1: 
As shown in Figure 2-12, connect the HP346B Noise Source to the (test equipment) DLNA cable input using the interconnect normally used in the AES4 antenna, connect the DLNA output to the HP8970B Noise Figure Meter using the same test cable to be used for rooftop measurement, and record the ambient temperature at the antenna, load, and noise source, TC.  
If the RF Source is used for a diplexer transmit load, assure that it remains turned off during this test.  The DLNA or LNA shall be the same unit built into the AES4 antenna under test. 

 
Step 2:  
Preset the HP8970B by pressing the "Preset" button. 

 
Step 3: 
Under "Smoothing" press "Increase" three times to increase the averaging from one sample to eight samples for smoothing. Press "Frequency" and enter the lowest receive test frequency by pressing "1518" on the numeric keypad followed by "Enter". Press "1.0" followed by the special function key "SP" to set up the test for measurement without an external oscillator. 

 
Step 4: 
Press "14.4 SP" to turn on the noise source, and "62 SP" and "72 SP" to hold the RF and IF attenuators during the measurement.  Record the value displayed on the far-right display, which is proportional to power in decibels. This value is PHot. 

Press "14.3 SP" to turn off the noise source. Record the value for cold source power, which is P*Cold*. Calculate: 
                                                                (1) Convert this dB value to a numerical factor and record it for use in equation (6). 

Disconnect the HP346B Noise Source and attach the antenna output to the DLNA. Terminate the transmit port of the DLNA or connect the RF power source to the transmit port of the DLNA. 

Ensure that the source is tuned either to the mid-transmit band or whichever frequency was coordinated with authorities and operators and that there is a CW 
power level at the single RF port of the antenna that is equal to the maximum power handling capability of the AES4 antenna.  Note that one of the previously agreed frequencies for PIMBIT may be used here as these are already reserved for testing. 

PAnt data shall be collected for the following beams to be used in the normal operation of the AES4 antenna.  Symmetry of the antenna by quadrants is assumed and data shall be collected for Az = 0, 45 and 90° and for elevations of 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90°. This results in 19 test points for each frequency. Record the value on the far-right display on the Noise Figure meter for each measurement. These values are defined as PAnt.  From these values, calculate:  

$$\mathrm{(2)}$$
Convert this dB value to a numerical factor and record it for use in equation (7). 

Repeat Steps 1 and 4 to obtain PHot, P*Cold*, and PAnt at the nearest receive band frequencies in Table. 

In the following analysis, the test receiver noise temperature (TRx) and the antenna noise temperature (TAnt) are calculated from the basic definitions of the 
"Y" factors: 

## 

                                                                        (3) 

 

                                                                        (4) 

 
Calculate the system noise temperature in the following manner. Use the recorded ambient temperature for T*Cold*. Find the value for THot using: 

                                                            (5) 

 
where T0 is 290K and ENR is the Excess Noise Ratio of the noise source in dB. 

Calculate the test receiver noise temperature TRx referred to its input, derived from Equation (3), as follows: 

                                                               (6)     

## 

Calculate the antenna noise temperature TA1, derived from Equation (4), as follows: 

## 

                                                 (7) 

Step 5: 
For the antenna under test, TAnt shall be corrected for temperature by calculating the internal dissipation loss of the antenna by means of the expression: 
 
                                             (8) 
 
Where L represents the internal dissipation loss of the AES4 antenna as a value > 1. 

TSky is the external noise temperature, assumed to be 100K for this calculation. 

TAnt values are obtained from Equation (7). 

 
From these values for L, corrected values of TAnt may be obtained by using a value of 290K for T*Cold* and substituting these values into Equation (9): 

$$(9)$$
Where TAntCorr are temperature-corrected values raw TAnt values.  Convert these values to dB. 

Step 6: 
Use the appropriate TAnt values to the corresponding sectors and frequencies of the antenna measured gain.  
Perform this computation for each sector and verify compliance with Table 2-6 in Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.1.3. 

## Eirp Computation Eirp Shall Be Calculated As Follows:

Where: 
PHPA is the HPA power in dBW 
 is the RCP gain at the sector being evaluated at the specific frequency in dB. Ins. Loss is any insertion loss in the transmit path which was not present when the antenna gain was measured (in dB). 

Perform this computation for each sector and verify compliance with Table 2-6 in Section 
2.2.3.1.2.1.1.3. 

Max EIRP Determination for installed HPA Power This is determined by evaluating all of the EIRP results (above) and verifying that none of them exceed the EIRP limit associated with GMAX in Table 2-3. 

## 2.4.3.1.1.3 Manufacturer-Defined Antenna Tests

Reference: 2.2.3.1.2.10 
The test procedure and pass/fail limits for this test shall be determined by the manufacturer.

Reference:  2.2.3.1.3.1.1 
This requirement shall be tested using the procedure defined in MTR 14, using test script MTR14b.  An AES that is capable of supporting high data rate (HDR) services shall also be tested using test scripts MTR 14i.  The required test frequencies are specified in the MTR.

This shall be done by subtracting the following antenna gain from the specified EIRP level: 

- 
If the system being qualified includes an antenna, and the transceiver and DLNA 
will not be used with another antenna, then the maximum gain of the antenna, as measured in Section 2.4.3.1.1.1.1 shall be used. 
- 
If the system excludes an antenna, the specified maximum gain (GMAX) for an 
IGA from Table 2-3 shall be used.

and 
-

- 
specified loss and isolation data of the DF DLNA as given in Section 
2.2.3.1.4.3.3, in the case of a Class 6F or 7F transceiver, or 
- 
specified loss and isolation data of the DMA DLNA as given in Section 2.2.3.1.4.3.2, in the case of a Class 6MA or 7MA transceiver, and 
-

- 
1.4 dB loss for the transmitter to DLNA cable, except for Equipment Class AES4 
- 
Worst case cable losses in the range of losses specified by the manufacturer for an AES4. 
- 
If cables with different losses are used during the measurements, the difference in cable losses shall be compensated for by calculation. 
Notwithstanding the above, it is permissible to measure the output spectrum of the transmitter and diplexer combined, provided the spectrum analyzer has the required dynamic range.

The transmitter shall be set up at the required test frequencies as specified in the MTR.  Emissions shall be measured over the frequency bands listed in Table 2-7 or Table 2-8 (as appropriate to the AES class), using the measurement bandwidth and detector type in the same table. For an AES4: Measurements shall be made at the connector of the antenna (or equivalent improvised test point on a specially prepared unit), using the minimum cable length between antenna and diplexer specified by the manufacturer. Compliance shall be determined by calculation using the data measured during the test and the maximum boresight gain of the antenna as determined during the tests carried out in Section 2.4.3.1.1.1.1. For an AES7: If the Transceiver and DLNA are being qualified together (Class 7D subsystem), measurements shall be made at the DLNA antenna port and compliance shall be determined by calculation using the data measured during the test and the following fixed data points: 

•
Minimum DLNA to Antenna cable loss per Table 2-2.
•
Maximum gain of an IGA antenna (GMAX_IGA) as per Table 2-3.
If a Transceiver is being qualified without a DLNA (Class 7F or 7MA transceiver), measurements shall be made at the Transceiver transmit port and the following assumed values included by calculation: 

•
minimum cable loss between the Transceiver and DLNA
•

•
minimum cable loss between the Transceiver and DLNA
•
specified loss  data of the DLNA as given in Section 2.2.3.1.4.3.2 for a 6MA

minimum cable loss between the DLNA and Antenna,
•
maximum gain of an IGA antenna (GMAX_HGA) as per Table 2-3.
Note:  For AES4, 7D and 6D systems, due to test equipment limitations it may not be possible to measure some of the very low levels of harmonics noise and spurious at the output of the DLNA.  In these cases it is acceptable to make the performance measurement prior to the diplexer and also measure the diplexer and demonstrate compliance by calculation.

Reference: 2.2.3.1.3.2.1; 2.2.3.1.3.2.2; 2.2.3.1.3.2.5 
This test shall test receiver sensitivity, receiver bandwidth and receiver operation in a moving aircraft. These requirements shall be tested using the procedure defined in the Inmarsat MTR [2]; MTR 8a, 8c, 8w, 10a, 10c, 10w.  The system shall be tested at the frequencies defined in 0 based upon the declared system type. For system types AES4, 6D and 7D the performance of the system (except for the antenna is measured.  The receive antenna gain parameter, within the PLT shall be used to compensate for: 

•
GNOM (from Table 2-3) based upon the defined system antenna type.
For system types 6MA, 6F 7MA and 7F the performance of the Transceiver only shall be measured.  The receive antenna gain parameter, within the PLT shall be used to compensate for:

For system types 6MA, 6F 7MA and 7F the noise figure shall be measured for the Transceiver only.  The specified noise figure and gain of the intended DLNA, as well as the specified cable losses, shall then be used to calculate the system noise figure. 

## 2.4.3.1.2.2.1.1 Test Methodology For Environmental Conditions

Receiver sensitivity testing is required to be repeated a large number of times over different environmental conditions (particularly in RF susceptibility and Induced signal susceptibility).  To reduce the test burden only one modulation type and sub-type is required to be tested.  This shall be F80T45X-8B at the H4 code rate under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) conditions. 

The manufacturer may choose to further reduce the test time by measuring the equivalent channel error rate (pre-error correction) instead of the packet error rate.  If the manufacturer wishes to implement this, then they shall provide measurement evidence linking channel error rate to packet error rate.  A minimum of 200k data bits or 2000 bit errors must be tested for each channel error rate measurement. 

For this test a fixed pattern for data bits (e.g. all zeroes) is acceptable as the channel scrambler is considered sufficient to ensure random symbols over the channel. 

## 2.4.3.1.2.2.2 Receiver Bandwidth

Reference: 2.2.3.1.3.2.2 
No separate test required. 

Note:  Receiver bandwidth is tested in other tests, e.g. by modulated adjacent channel interferers during receiver sensitivity tests in 2.4.3.1.2.2.1.

## 2.4.3.1.2.2.3.1 Identification Of Test Frequencies

The assessment of interfering frequencies shall be made for the following RF input frequencies: 

|      | Lowest Frequency    | Center Frequency    | Highest Frequency    |

identified in Table 2-20. 
65. While monitoring the Priority Level 4 (low) calls, attempt to establish an air-toground call at Circuit-Mode Priority 3.  Verify that one of the non-safety circuits is terminated and made available for the safety call, and that the call is 
completed.  This test is applicable only if the number of voice circuits Nv is less 
than the number of voice interfaces. 
66. Repeat Step 2 until all channels are consumed by Priority 3 calls. 
67. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 with Priority 2 calls. 
68. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 with Priority 1 (high) calls. 69. At the completion of Step 5, there will be N Priority 1 (high) calls established.  
Attempt to initiate an air-to-ground call at Priority 2, and verify that the call is 
not accepted. 
70. Attempt to initiate an air-to-ground call at Priority 3, and verify that the call is 
not accepted. 
71. Attempt to initiate an air-to-ground call at Priority 4 (low), and verify that the 
call is not accepted.  This step shall be performed for all equipment, including equipment that does not support Priority 4 (low) non-safety communications. 
72. Terminate all calls, and re-establish Step 1 with Priority 4 (low) calls. 
73. Repeat Steps 2 through 8 using ground-to-air calls and verify that the same 
results are obtained.

an audio sine wave of between 0.9 and 2.5 kHz form one side of the call to the
other.

Note: Visors, glareshields, or filters may be an acceptable means of obtaining daylight visibility. 

## 3.1.4 Inadvertent Turn-Off

Where controls for transceiver operation are provided, they shall be equipped with adequate protection against inadvertent turn off. 

## 3.1.5 Failure Protection

Any probable failure of the equipment shall not degrade the normal operation of equipment or systems that are connected to it.  Likewise, the failure of interfaced equipment or systems shall not induce failures of this equipment. 

## 3.1.6 Interface Interference Effects

The equipment shall not be the source of harmful conducted or radiated interference, and shall not be affected by conducted or radiated interference from other equipment or systems installed in the aircraft. 

## 3.1.7 Aircraft Power Source

The voltage and frequency tolerance characteristics of the equipment shall be compatible with the aircraft power source of appropriate category as specified in RTCA DO-160G 
[3]. 

## 3.1.8 Antenna Location/Installation

Isolation between the satcom antenna and any GNSS antennas shall be planned to be consistent with the isolation declared in Section 2.2.3.1.2.6.1.  Isolation measurements may be required in marginal cases. Isolation between the satcom antenna and antennas for other systems, such as radar transponders and ACAS/TCAS systems shall be considered carefully.  Some measurements, analysis and additional information from manufacturers may be required to establish compatibility. 

In installations where a second satcom system is installed on the same aircraft, potential radio interference between the systems shall be considered.   In particular, interferencefree operation of the satcom system used for priority services shall be ensured by the installation configuration. Antenna placement shall take into account that part of the airframe, such as the wings or empennage, will obstruct the radio signals between the AES antenna and the satellite at some combinations of aircraft attitude and satellite position.  While such obstruction is often not totally avoidable, the choice of antenna position should aim to minimize it, particularly for level flight. 

## 3.1.9 Rf Cable Requirements

Cable losses and intermodulation products require careful attention to ensure correct operation of the system.  In a case where a TSO approval was issued for the complete system, the cables shall comply to the manufacturer's specifications.   
Where the system consists of individual LRUs for which individual approvals were obtained, installed cable losses shall comply with Table 2-2. 

For multicarrier systems, the cable between the DLNA and the antenna shall meet the requirements in Section 2.2.1.4. 

## 3.1.10 Co-Location With Other Inmarsat Satcom Systems

When co-locating more than one Inmarsat satcom system on one aircraft the following issues shall be considered 

•
Antennas should be spaced far enough apart so as to avoid distortion of the
antenna beams due to mutual coupling between the antennas.  Advice should be sought from the antenna manufacturers if the planned separation is less than approximately 18 inches. 
•
Potential intermodulation due to a signal from one system coupling in to the HPA
of the other system should also be considered.  An HPA designed for multichannel operation normally represents a low risk in this regard, as it is designed to maintain intermodulation products within limits while transmitting multiple carriers.  Adding an additional carrier at a substantially lower power level (due to the isolation between the antennas) should therefore be acceptable.  The behavior 
of single channel HPAs can vary greatly, and should therefore be measured, either in laboratory conditions or on the aircraft. 

- 
Intermodulation products from a multi-channel system coupling into the receive 
path of a second system is normally not a concern, as intermodulation products 
have to be suppressed enough that the first system's own receiver is not affected.  
 

## 3.1.11 Co-Location Of Dissimilar Satcom Systems

Installation of dissimilar satcom systems (e.g. a SwiftBroadband and an Iridium system) on the same aircraft may present specific problems.  Particular attention should be paid to intermodulation products generated by multichannel systems.  Refer to Section 3.2.1. 

 

## 3.1.12 System Component Interoperability

Where components of the AES have been approved individually, installations shall only be made with valid combinations of equipment.  Refer to Table 2-1. As this appendix does not specify interface details, interoperability of AES components from different manufacturers is not ensured by conformance of components to this appendix alone.  Verifying interoperability of new combinations of AES components is therefore strongly recommended before commencing a new installation configuration. Manufacturers should also be consulted. 

## 3.1.13 Configuration Of Priority For Data Services

The use of priority data services (ACARS and IP) shall be planned and configured for each new installation configuration. To enable access to the ACARS and Priority IP APNs, it is required that the USIM of the priority service channel of the AES be activated with the service provider for Aeronautical Priority Services. As part of the installation process the AES shall be configured to use the correct APN when setting up a PDP context for ACARS service. A ground test that confirms that ACARS messages can be sent and received by a specific aircraft is sufficient to ensure that ACARS messages also gets the right priority on the network.  (ACARS messages cannot flow if the AES is accidentally configured for the wrong APN). For IP services, care must be taken that the AES is configured to use the correct APN (priority or non-priority, as provided by the service provider) for each context.  Unlike ACARS, it is possible to successfully test for interchange of IP data, while the AES might be configured the incorrect APN.  In such a case the wrong priority level would be applied. It is possible for an AES to simultaneously provide Priority and Non-priority IP services for different purposes through separate PDP contexts connected to separate APNs.  The AES would typically distinguish between priority and non-priority IP data on the basis of the physical port through which the data flows, but details may differ depending on the AES design. Example: The AES may be configured to handle all IP data to and from an EFB as either priority or non-priority data, depending whether the applications on the EFB are essential for the safety of the flight.  The choice between priority or non-priority should be in line with the standard operating procedures of the aircraft operator. 

Applications which do not contribute directly to flight safety should not be allowed to use Priority IP. 

## 3.1.14 Configuration Of Priority For Voice Calls

The priority of all voice services shall be planned and configured for each new installation.  Priority calls shall only be allowed from appropriate ports. 

## 3.2 Installed Equipment Performance Requirements

The installed equipment shall meet the requirements of Section 2.0 in addition to the requirements stated below.  To meet the requirements of this section, test results supplied by the equipment manufacturer may be accepted in lieu of tests performed by the equipment installer. However, performance characteristics that cannot be tested by the equipment manufacturer shall be tested by the installer.  These include: (1) performance characteristics of equipment required for the transceiver installation that have not been tested or verified by the manufacturer, and (2) interactions with other equipment installed on the aircraft. 

## 3.2.1 Radiated Antenna Intermodulation Products In Ams(R)S Bands 3.2.1.1 Self-Interference By A Multi-Channel Sbb Aes

While the AES components have individual requirements for intermodulation products, a new multi-channel installation can introduce new sources of intermodulation.  The chief concern is intermodulation products appearing in the AES receive band, which may drastically reduce receiver sensitivity at specific receive frequencies.  The affected receive frequencies are very dependent on the transmit frequencies allocated by the network.  Intermodulation may be caused by poor antenna cables and metal structures near the antenna with intermittent contact. Performing a multi-channel communication test over the satellite network (even if multichannel) is a poor mitigation for this risk, as the combinations of transmit and receive frequencies may not reveal even major problems.  An on-aircraft intermodulation test should be performed after every single aircraft installation.  A "PIMBIT" function is included in a multi-channel SBB AES for this purpose.  Following the manufacturer's instructions is recommended. 

## 3.2.1.2 Dissimilar Aes Installations On The Same Aircraft

When installing more than one AES on the same aircraft, where AESs use different satellite networks, the following general requirement applies. When transmitting two modulated carriers anywhere within the frequency band with each carrier fTMN to fTMX , each carrier having the maximum allowable single carrier power permitted by Section 2.2.3.1.3.1.2, and its subsections, of this appendix, the antenna subsystem shall not radiate internally generated intermodulation products in a direction toward a likely location(s) of antenna(s) on the same aircraft serving other AMS(R)S systems so as to cause an average power level that increases the effective noise temperature of the other AMS(R)S system by more than 6%.  In the absence of details of the second system, the other antenna may be assumed to be a quarter-wave monopole antenna matched to its load, and the isolation between the AES antenna and the second antenna is taken to be 40 dB, or different value as applicable to the specific installation. 

When assessing the increase in noise temperature at the affected AES, two effects shall be taken into account separately: 

- 
Intermodulation products when multiple carriers are transmitted 
- 
Transmitter noise floor when one or more carriers are transmitted.  (This may be 
particularly problematic when the SBB transmitter is transmitting near the lower edge of the transmit frequency band while an Iridium receiver is tuned to the upper end of its receive band.) 
- 
This requirement shall be verified by analysis using 
- 
calculated or measured antenna isolation data for the specific installation configuration, 
- 
intermodulation performance of the transmitting AES, from the results previously measured for the transmitter, 
- 
calculated spreading factor, taking into account the worst case combination of transmitted waveform and receiver bandwidth and 
- 
previously measured transmitter noise floor, combined with the worst case of transmitting and receiving frequencies. 
- 
This requirement shall specifically be verified by analysis, as it is possible that 
the potential problems will not be detected during an on-air test, when the 
combinations of frequencies cannot be easily controlled. 
Note: Simultaneous operation of a SwiftBroadband AES and an Iridium AES on the same aircraft is a known to be problematic.  Refer to Section 1.3.10.1.  This phenomenon affects the Iridium AES receiver on the aircraft, operating in the band 1616 to 1626.5 
MHz. This is independent of the Aireon service (hosted on Iridium satellites) which uses a different frequency band. 

## 3.2.2 Declaration Of Non-Standard Antenna Isolation

If the AES design is based on a declaration of antenna isolation greater than 40 dB, as allowed by Section 2.2.3.1.3.1.3 or Section 3.2.1.2, then all installations shall provide at least the declared minimum isolation.  This applies to isolation between the AES antenna and GNSS antennas, as well as between the AES antenna and the antenna of a second dissimilar satcom system. The antenna isolation should be verified by measurement, either on the aircraft or on a suitable simulated installation. For GNSS antennas the measurement shall be done in the GNSS frequency band. For a second dissimilar AES, the measurement shall be made in the frequency band of the receiver which is likely to be interfered with (possibly therefore the frequency bands of the receivers of both AESs). 

## 3.3 Conditions Of Test

The following Sections define conditions under which the tests specified in Section 3.4 shall be conducted. 

## 3.3.1 Power Input

Tests may be conducted either with the equipment powered by the aircraft's electrical power generation system or by an appropriate external power source connected to the aircraft. 

## 3.3.2 Environment

During the tests, the equipment shall not be subjected to environmental conditions that exceed those in RTCA/DO-160G as specified by the equipment manufacturer. 

## 3.3.3 Adjustment Of Equipment

Circuits of the equipment under test shall be properly aligned and otherwise adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practices prior to application of the specified tests. 

## 3.3.4 Warm-Up Period

Unless otherwise specified, tests shall be conducted after a warm-up (stabilization) period of twenty (20) minutes. 

## 3.4 Test Procedures For Installed Equipment Performance

The following test procedures provide one means of determining installed equipment performance.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that the installing activity may prefer alternate procedures, which may be used if they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. 

## 3.4.1 Conformity Inspection

Visually inspect the installed equipment to determine the use of acceptable workmanship and engineering practices.  Verify that proper mechanical and electrical connections have been made and that the equipment has been located and installed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. 

## 3.4.2 Interference Tests 3.4.2.1 Interference With General Aircraft Systems

This test is required to verify that the AES does not interfere with general aircraft systems, and that these systems do not interfere with the AES. 

127. 
List all electrically-operated aircraft equipment which is considered 
potentially vulnerable to radio transmissions, as well as aircraft equipment that may potentially interfere with the AES. 
128. 
Unless otherwise specified, all aircraft electrically-operated equipment 
and systems shall be switched on, using the aircraft's electrical power generating equipment, before conducting interference tests. 
129. 
With the AES transceiver operating, including transmission of messages 
and voice calls and using all available channels, individually operate each of the other potentially vulnerable electrically-operated aircraft equipment and systems to determine that no significant conducted or radiated interference are caused to 
such equipment.  Evaluate all reasonable combinations of control settings and operating modes.  Operate communication and navigation equipment on at a minimum the low, high, and a mid-band, frequencies. 
130. 
With all equipment which may potentially interfere with the AES 
powered off (where possible), operate the AES and establish a voice call to a 
nearby ground phone (such as a mobile). Monitor the voice quality of the call, both at the aircraft and at the ground phone. Power on all the equipment which may potentially interfere with the AES, and repeat the check on the voice quality, both on the aircraft and at the ground phone, and note any signs of impaired reception. 
131. 
Operate the aircraft control surfaces (e.g. flaps, ailerons) through their 
range to activate all associated aircraft systems which may cause electrical power fluctuations (e.g. pumps or linear actuators). 
The AES shall not be the source of unintentional harmful conducted or radiated interference, and shall not be affected by conducted or radiated interference from other equipment or systems installed in the aircraft. 

## 3.4.2.2 Interference To Gnss

Adequate protection of on-board GNSS equipment from harmful interference shall be verified using this procedure. 

132. 
Verify that the expected antenna isolation (between the AES and any 
GNSS antenna) is more than the required isolation declared in terms of Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, 
133. 
If a margin of less than 10 dB is expected between the actual antenna 
isolation (between the AES and any GNSS antenna) and the required isolation declared in terms of Section 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, the installed isolation shall be measured for each new installation configuration. 
134. 
Operate the AES while transmitting on all available channels.  Verify 
that the operation of the GNSS equipment is not degraded by comparing the following parameters reported by the GNSS equipment, with transmission on and transmission off respectively: 
- 
GNSS position  
- 
Number satellites accessed 
- 
C/No of received satellites 
 
Notes: 1. 
In a typical installation, this should be achieved if: 
- 
the transceiver meets all requirements of Sections 2.2.3.1.2.1.2, 
2.2.3.1.2.1.4, and 2.2.3.1.2.1.5; 
- 
the isolation between AES and GNSS antennas is not less than the distance declared by the manufacturer in terms of Section 2.2.3.1.3.1.3. 
2.

Interference problems noted upon installation of this equipment may result from such factors as the design characteristics of previously installed systems or equipment and the physical installation itself.  It is not intended that the equipment manufacturer design for all installation environments.  Compatibility between this equipment and previously installed equipment in the aircraft shall be ensured during the design of the specific installation configuration. 

## 3.4.2.3 Interference Between Dissimilar Satcom Systems

If the AES is installed on an airframe as part of a "dual-dissimilar" satellite communications suite, the test procedures in the following sub-sections shall be performed.  In the following sections, "SATCOM A" refers to the SwiftBroadband AES covered by this MOPS, while "SATCOM B" refers to the other satellite communications system.  It is possible that another technique-specific appendix of this appendix may apply to the SATCOM B system. Although these on-aircraft tests are required, passing them shall not be acceptable motivation to waive the intermodulation requirements of Section 3.2.1.2, as the onaircraft tests are unlikely to be done with the worst-case frequency combinations. 

## 3.4.2.3.1 Satcom B Interference To Satcom A

Perform the following steps: 1.

With SATCOM B inactive, establish a background class data connection and perform a TCP transfer on the SBB AES (SATCOM A), if appropriate (e.g. using a tool like IPERF).  Verify that this session is maintained when SATCOM B is switched on and commanded to initiate a packet mode communications session, if appropriate.  Verify that the SATCOM A communications session is maintained when the SATCOM B transfers a package message of 4000 octets containing random binary data.  Terminate the SATCOM B packet mode communications session and verify that the SATCOM A communications session is maintained. 2.

Repeat the process of Step 1 with SATCOM B circuit mode data communications, if appropriate. 3.

Repeat the process of Step 1 with SATCOM B voice communications, if appropriate. 4.

Repeat the process of Steps 1, 2, and 3, with SATCOM A maintaining two voice calls, instead of the data connection. 

5.

With SATCOM A inactive, initiate a SATCOM B packet mode communications session.  Transmit a series of test messages of 4000 octets each.  While the transmission is in progress, activate SATCOM A.  Verify that SATCOM A can acquire the network. Verify that the SBB AES (SATCOM A) can initiate and sustain two voice calls for a period of 60 seconds during SATCOM B packet mode operations.  Verify that the AES can properly terminate its voice call. 6.

Repeat Step 5, but with SATCOM A transferring TCP data over a background class data connection instead of the two phone calls. 

## 3.4.2.3.2 Satcom A Interference To Satcom B

Perform the following steps: 
 1. 

With SATCOM A inactive, establish a circuit-mode data communications session on SATCOM B, if appropriate.  Verify that this session is maintained when SATCOM A is switched on and commanded to initiate TCP transfer over a background class data connection.  Verify that the SATCOM B communications session is maintained when the SATCOM A transfers a package message of 4000 octets containing random binary data.  Terminate the SATCOM A communications session and verify that the SATCOM B communications session is maintained. 

2. 

Repeat Step 1 with SATCOM B maintaining packet-mode data communications session, if appropriate. 3. 

Repeat Step 1 with SATCOM B maintaining a circuit mode voice call, instead of the data connection. 4. 

With SATCOM B inactive, initiate a TCP transfer over a background data connection over SATCOM A.  Transmit a series of test messages of 4000 octets each. While the transmission is in progress, activate SATCOM B.  Verify that SATCOM B can acquire the network.  Verify that the SATCOM B can initiate and sustain a voice call for a period of 60 seconds during SATCOM A data transfers.  Verify that the SATCM B can properly terminate its voice call. 

5. 

Repeat Step 4, but with SATCOM B operating in circuit data mode, if applicable.  
Verify that SATCOM B can initiate and complete a transaction by transmitting a 4000 octet message.  Verify that the SATCOM B can properly terminate its circuit mode call. 

6.  
Repeat Step 4, but with SATCOM B operating in packet data mode, if applicable.  
Verify that SATCOM B can initiate and complete a transaction by transmitting a 4000 octet message.  Verify that the SATCOM B can properly terminate its packet data mode call. 

## 3.4.3 Power Fluctuation Tests

Transceiver aircraft power sources shall be cycled through all normal configurations to verify that the transceiver performance for power interruption recovery during and after power changeover is satisfactory with no discernible abnormal operation. In-transit data service packets which have been acknowledged on either the DTE or DCE interface, but not yet transferred to the opposite interface, may be lost.  Non-transceiver higher layer entities which employ end-to-end acknowledgment protocols may choose to retransmit such lost data. 

## 3.4.4 Ground Test Procedures

Perform the following minimum ground tests: 

- 
With the aircraft parked within line-of-sight of the satellite, power on the AES.  
Verify that the AES logs onto the satellite.  The aircraft's inertial reference system may need to be active. 
- 
Verify that the AES logs onto the AGGW, indicated by "ACARS link available" 
indication. 
- 
Send test ACARS messages in both directions.  If the aircraft is FANS equipped, 
send FANS messages. 
- 
If the AES can be controlled from multiple stations (e.g. multiple MCDUs) then 
verify operation of each of these. 
- 
Make voice calls to and from the aircraft.  Repeat from left seat and right seat. 
- 
If the AES is capable of multiple channels, verify the passive intermodulation 
(PIM) performance of the installation.  The AES' PIMBIT test should be used for this purpose. 
•
Verify IP connection operational (e.g. EFB connection and data transfer)
If the manufacturer's manual prescribes any further ground tests, perform these as well. 

## 3.4.5 Flight Test Procedures

Flight tests of installed systems are desirable to confirm or supplement bench and ground tests of installed performance. The following points are recommended if a flight test is undertaken: 

•
Verify ACARS messaging in-flight.
•
Verify phone calls in flight.
•
Verify spot beam handover.
•
Verify satellite handover.
•
Verify coverage performance, particularly at low elevation.
•
Verify GPS non-interference in flight.
•
If automatic or manual fallback to Classic Aero services is offered by the AES,
verify that performs as required.
Further in-flight tests may be defined in the manufacturer's installation instructions. 

## 3.4.6 Installed System Performance Verification 3.4.6.1 Installed Functionality

Performance of the installed avionics, consisting of the Antenna Subsystem and the Transceiver Subsystem, should be verified in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.  The following general functional categories shall be validated: 
Network Management Tests  -  Verify the ability of the AES to acquire and register with the BGAN network from a cold start.  Verify the following items: 

•
The AES starts up, registers on the network and on the AGGW.  Evidenced by
"ACARS link available indication. 
•
ACARS messages can be sent and received
•
FANS messages can be sent and received
IP Data Transfer Tests  -  Ensure that the AES can send and receive data and sustain communications using a background context.  Transfer data of at least 100 KB each way. 

Voice Services  -  Verify that the mechanisms for  

•
selecting, dialing, and releasing a circuit from aircraft side.
•
accepting, and rejecting an incoming call through operator action.
•
second voice channel operation.
•
priority and preemption.
Subnetwork Physical Layer - Most of physical layer operation is verified by previous tests.  Additionally the maximum capability of ND simultaneous communications channels as declared by the manufacturer shall be verified. 

## 3.4.6.2 Installed Antenna Coverage

The antenna tests of Section 2.4.3.1.1 and its subsections provide sufficient verification of coverage for top-mounted antenna installation using steered antennas and non-steered antennas with essentially hemispherical patterns.  These installations are expected to be the common installation for most platforms. 

## 3.4.6.3 Installed Audio System Functionality

Voice quality of phone calls shall be assessed under operational noise conditions applicable to the specific aircraft.  Depending on the aircraft this may require an engine run-up on the ground, or in-flight testing.  Attention should be paid to: 

- 
Excessive background noise on the outgoing audio signal due to acoustic 
background noise.  The successful integration of noise cancelling microphones and other audio cancellation techniques with the AES may be required to avoid this. 
- 
Spurious audio interfering signals from electrical sources, such as hum or whine.  
Sources may be due to induced interference in wiring or inadequately cancelled ground voltage differences. 
- 
Outgoing speech breaking up due the voice codec being unable to cope with 
environmental noise in the cockpit. 
- 
Incoming audio levels being dissimilar from other radio sources, particularly 
when routed to a headset through an audio panel or audio management system. 
- 
Outgoing audio level being unacceptably dissimilar from normal telephone voice. 
Perform the following tests: 

- 
Make air-to-ground calls. 
- 
Make ground-to-air calls. 
- 
Clear (end) calls from the ground side. 
- 
Clear calls form the aircraft side. 
- 
While a call is in progress, make a second call from the aircraft. 
- 
While a call is in progress, make a second call from the ground. 
- 
While two priority 3 calls are in progress, make a priority 2 call from the aircraft.  
Verify that one call is pre-empted (dropped) in favor of the new call. 
- 
While two priority 2 calls are in progress, make a priority 1 call from the aircraft. 
Verify that one call is pre-empted (dropped) in favor of the new call. 
- 
Repeat, with the last call made from the ground.

## 4 Equipment Operational Performance Characteristics

This section is intended to verify correct operation of the AES on any aircraft.  It provides guidance for ground testing after each installation on an individual aircraft, for pre-flight testing or for return-to-service testing after maintenance work.   
AMS(R)S AES installations are expected to be accomplished in a variety of ways to fit the aircraft equipment and intended usage.  This will also be the case with associated cockpit interfaces.  The requirements of this section shall be suitably interpreted for the particular installation under consideration. 

## 4.1 Operational Performance Requirements

The following sections identify requirements to ensure the operator that operations can be conducted safely and reliably in the expected operational environment. 

## 4.1.1 Power Input

Prior to flight, the primary power shall be available for proper operation. Communications Displays The required display(s) for the selection of various communication modes/functions of operation shall be accessible and available for use, both prior to and during flight.   
Note: This may be accomplished with additional equipment connected to the AES, such as MCDUs. 

## 4.1.2 Communications Controls

## 4.2 Test Procedures For Operational Performance Requirements

Operational equipment tests may be used after installation or return to service after maintenance. 

A subset of operational equipment tests may be conducted as part of normal preflight tests.  For those tests which can only be run in flight, procedures should be developed to perform these tests as early in the flight as possible to verify that the equipment is performing its intended function(s).

## 4.2.4 System Operational Indication

System operational readiness shall be monitored either by means of Built-In-Test-
Equipment (BITE) and/or by suitable preflight tests contained in a check list or flight manual.  All equipment failure annunciators shall be tested during preflight tests to verify proper operation. Examples:   

- 
Built-in test 
- 
CMU indicates satcom link available 
- 
Satcom status indicates logged onto satellite 
- 
Satcom status indicates voice and ACARS available 
 
- 
Pre-flight test 
- 
Make a test phone call 
- 
Send a test ACARS AOC message.
