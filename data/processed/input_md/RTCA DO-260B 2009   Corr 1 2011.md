## Foreword

This document was prepared by Special Committee 186 (SC-186) and approved by the RTCA Program Management Committee (PMC) on December 13, 2011. RTCA, Incorporated is a not-for-profit corporation formed to advance the art and science of aviation and aviation electronic systems for the benefit of the public.  The organization functions as a Federal Advisory Committee and develops consensus based recommendations on contemporary aviation issues.  RTCA's objectives include but are not limited to: 
- 
coalescing aviation system user and provider technical requirements in a manner that helps government and industry meet their mutual objectives and responsibilities; 

- 
analyzing and recommending solutions to the system technical issues that aviation faces as it continues to pursue increased safety, system capacity and efficiency; 
- 
developing consensus on the application of pertinent technology to fulfill user and provider 
requirements, including development of minimum operational performance standards for electronic systems and equipment that support aviation; and 
- 
assisting in developing the appropriate technical material upon which positions for the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Telecommunications Union and other appropriate international organizations can be based. 
 The organization's recommendations are often used as the basis for government and private sector decisions as well as the foundation for many Federal Aviation Administration technical Standard Orders. Since RTCA is not an official agency of the United States Government, its recommendations may not be regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the U.S. government organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations relate.

## 1.0 Purpose And Scope 1.1 Introduction

This document contains Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for airborne equipment for Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B) utilizing 1090 MHz Mode-S Extended Squitter 
(1090ES).  The supporting hardware can be incorporated within other on-board equipment, or alternatively, the ADS-B equipment may be a separate avionics unit. 

Note: Definitions of acronyms (e.g., MOPS, ADS-B, 1090ES) and of many other terms 
(e.g., "Extended Squitter") can be found in Appendix B of these MOPS.  
Throughout this document, the term "TIS-B" refers to the Fundamental TIS-B 
Service as defined in the TIS-B MASPS, RTCA/DO-286B, Â§1.4.1.  The acronym 
"ADS-R" refers to the ADS-B Rebroadcast Service as defined in the TIS-B MASPS, RTCA/DO-286B, Â§1.4.1.  The Fundamental TIS-B Service provides traffic information that is derived from ground surveillance (e.g., radar) systems.  The ADS-B Rebroadcast Service provides the Rebroadcast on 1090 MHz of an ADS-B Message from an alternate data link using the same TYPE Codes and Message Formats as are defined for Downlink Format (DF) = 17 ADS-B Messages, with the exception of bits modified as identified in Â§2.2.18.   
Compliance with these standards by manufacturers, installers and users is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will satisfactorily perform its intended functions under conditions encountered in routine aeronautical operations.  The regulatory application of these standards is the responsibility of appropriate government agencies.  For example, in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publishes and maintains a Technical Standard Order (TSO C166) for 1090ES ADS-B equipment to reference the requirements and bench test procedures in Section 2 of this document.  In the European Union, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) publishes and maintains a Eurpoean Technical Standard Order (ETSO C166) for 1090ES ADS-B equipment to reference the requirements and bench test procedures in Section 2 of this document. Since the equipment implementation includes a computer software package, the most recent version of the *Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification*, (RTCA DO-178B/EUROCAE ED-12B) is applicable.  When determining the level of software requirements, as defined in RTCA DO-178B/EUROCAE ED-12B, or subsequent versions, the equipment manufacturer should consider the criticality appropriate for the installation certification, equipment failure analysis, and the fault monitoring being accomplished. In addition, since the measured values of equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the measurement method, standard test conditions and methods of test are recommended in this document. 

Section 1 of this document provides information and assumptions needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated in the remaining sections.  It describes typical equipment applications and operational goals and, along with RTCA DO- 242A, *Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards for ADS-B*, forms the basis for the standards stated in Sections 2 and 3.   
Section 2 contains the minimum operational performance standards for the equipment.  
These standards define required performance under standard operating conditions and stressed physical environmental conditions.  Also included are recommended bench test procedures necessary to demonstrate equipment compliance with the stated minimum requirements. 

Section 3 describes the performance required of the installed equipment.  Tests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. Section 4 describes the operational characteristics of the installed equipment, self test features, and controls.

## 1.2 System Overview 1.2.1 Definitions

ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast) is a function for airborne or surface aircraft, or other surface vehicles operating within the airport surface movement area, that periodically transmits its state vector (horizontal and vertical position, horizontal and vertical velocity) and other information.  ADS-B is *automatic* because no external stimulus is required; it is *dependent* because it relies on on-board navigation sources and onboard broadcast Transmitting Subsystems to provide *surveillance* information to other users. The aircraft or vehicle originating the *broadcast* may or may not have knowledge of which users are receiving its broadcast; any user, either aircraft or ground-based, within range of this broadcast, may choose to receive and process the ADS-B surveillance information.  
ADS-B supports improved use of airspace, reduced ceiling/visibility restrictions, improved surface surveillance, and enhanced safety such as conflict management. The ADS-B Rebroadcast Service (ADS-R) provides the Rebroadcast on 1090 MHz of an ADS-B Message from an alternate data link.   The ADS-R information is transmitted  from ground-based ADS-B Ground Stations.  ADS-R information is received by the Ground Station from ADS-B-equipped aircraft/vehicle on a particular ADS-B radio data link and transmitted on an alternate ADS-B data link.  
TIS-B (Traffic Information Service - Broadcast) is a function in which transmitters on the ground provide aircraft with information about nearby aircraft.  The TIS-B information is likely to come from ground-based surveillance sensors such as air traffic control radars or multilateration systems.  However, TIS-B information broadcast on a particular radio data link might also be derived from the reception on the ground of ADS-B Messages that were transmitted on a different data link.  For example, 1090 MHz TIS-B transmitters might broadcast information about nearby aircraft based on ground reception of ADS-B Messages on other data links. For the purposes of this document, the term *Aircraft/Vehicle* (A/V) will refer to either 1) a machine or device capable of atmospheric flight, or 2) a vehicle on the airport surface movement area (i.e., runways and taxiways).  For simplicity, the word *aircraft* is used to refer to aircraft and vehicles, where appropriate. 

Figure 1-1 shows the extent of the 1090 MHz ADS-B system and its major components. 

This figure is adapted from the ADS-B MASPS, RTCA DO-242A. As indicated in the figure, the ADS-B system includes the following components: message generation/transmission by the source A/V, propagation medium, and message reception/report assembling by the user.  The ADS-B system does not include the sources of the data to be sent by the source subsystem on board the transmitting aircraft. Neither does it include the client applications, which use the information received by the ADS-B user subsystem on board the receiving aircraft.   Some ADS-B participants may be able to transmit but not receive.  In addition, some ground-based users may be able to receive but not to transmit. 

Figure 1-2 shows the extent of the 1090 MHz TIS-B system and its major components.  As indicated in Figure 1-2, only the 1090 MHz TIS-B Messages and airborne TIS-B Receiving Subsystem are described in these MOPS. 

## 1.2.2 1090 Mhz Ads-B System

The "ADS-B Messages" transmitted on 1090 MHz are the Mode S Extended Squitters (Airborne Position squitter, Airborne Velocity squitter, Surface Position squitter, etc.) described in ICAO Doc 9871, and Appendix A of this document. The source 1090 MHz Transmitting Subsystem may or may not be implemented in conjunction with a Mode S transponder. The user 1090 MHz Receiving Subsystem may or may not be implemented in conjunction with a TCAS (Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System).   

## 1.2.3 Ads-B Avionics Integrity

The integrity requirements for the total system to support ADS-B related applications are determined for a particular airborne architecture by conducting a functional hazard assessment and system safety assessment.  For each application, the classification (typically expressed in terms of a category such as hazardous, major, minor etc.) of unannunciated and unmitigated failure conditions of ADS-B avionics that cause out-of-tolerance error conditions will be derived from these assessments. Guidance on the above assessments can be found in:   

ï· 
SAE 
ARP4761 -- Guidelines and Methods for Conducting the Safety Assessment 
Process on Civil Airborne Systems and Equipment;   
ï· 
SAE 
ARP4754/ED79 -- Certification Considerations for Highly-Integrated or 
Complex Aircraft Systems;

AC 25.1309-1A - Advisory Circular, System Design and Analysis. 
Presuming that all 24 parity check bits (Â§2.2.3.2.1.7) are employed for error detection, the 
1090 MHz ADS-B Message formats have been designed to support an undetected error rate of less than 1 undetected error per 107 
ADS-B Messages. 

## 1.2.4 1090 Mhz Ads-B Subsystem Implementations 1090 Mhz Ads-B & Tis-B Receiving Subsystem 1.2.4.1 Source 1090 Mhz Ads-B Transmitting Subsystem

The source subsystem consists of a message generation function and a transmitting message exchange function.  The 1090 MHz ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem takes PVT (Position, Velocity, Time), status, and intent inputs from other systems onboard the aircraft and transmits this information on the 1090 MHz frequency as Mode S Extended Squitter messages.  The message generation function includes the input interface, message assembly, and encoding subfunctions.  The message exchange function includes the radio equipment (modulator/transmitter) and 1090 MHz transmitting antenna subfunctions. 

The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem may be implemented either: (a) using a Mode S 
secondary surveillance radar transponder, or (b) using Non-Transponder-Based 1090 MHz transmitting equipment. 

## 1.2.4.1.1 Transponder-Based Subsystems

In a Mode S Transponder-Based Subsystem, the ADS-B Message generation function and the modulator and 1090 MHz transmitter are present in the Mode S transponder itself.  The transmit antenna subfunction consists of the Mode S antenna(s) connected to that transponder.   

## 1.2.4.1.2 Non-Transponder-Based Subsystems

Non-Transponder-Based ADS-B Subsystems might be installed in general aviation aircraft that have Mode A/C ATCRBS transponders rather than Mode S transponders.  In such Non- Transponder-Based ADS-B Subsystems, the message generation function and the modulator and 1090 MHz transmitter will be housed together in the transmitting unit.  The transmitting antenna subfunction may be separate from the transmitter unit or may also be incorporated in the unit.   

## Notes:

1. The term "Non-Transponder-Based" within the context of these MOPS is not intended 
to preclude an avionics configuration with a 1090 MHz ADS-B capability integrated with a Mode A/C ATCRBS Transponder. 
2. Installation of Non-Transponder-Based 1090 MHz ADS-B equipment in airplanes 
equipped with Mode-S transponders is prohibited.  The transmission of squitters in 
addition to TCAS interrogation responses contributes unnecessary RF energy to the spectral environment.  TCAS systems (in other airplanes) cannot take advantage of hybrid surveillance on the ADS-B data, since the non-transponder-based data cannot be 
validated by TCAS interrogation.  ADS-B data is not directly available to ground interrogators as when it is read from transponder registers.   

## 1.2.4.2 1090 Mhz Ads-B & Tis-B Receiving Subsystem

The 1090 MHz ADS-B and TIS-B Receiving Subsystem consists of a receiver message exchange function and a Report Assembly function.  The 1090 MHz Receiving Subsystem takes ADS-B and TIS-B Mode S Extended Squitter messages and outputs information to other systems onboard the aircraft.  The message exchange function includes the 1090 MHz receiving antenna and radio equipment (receiver/demodulator) subfunctions.  The Report Assembly function includes the message decoding, report assembly, and output interface subfunctions. Several configurations of ADS-B Receiving Subsystems, which include the reception portion of the ADS-B Message Exchange Function and the ADS-B Report Assembly Function, are defined: 

- 
Type 1 ADS-B and TIS-B Receiving Subsystems receive ADS-B and TIS-B Messages 
and produce application-specific subsets of ADS-B reports.  Type 1 Receiving 
Subsystems are customized to the particular applications using ADS-B reports.  Type 1 ADS-B Receiving Subsystems may additionally be controlled by an external entity to 
produce installation-defined subsets of the reports that those subsystems are capable of producing. 

- 
Type 2 ADS-B and TIS-B Receiving Subsystems receive ADS-B and TIS-B Messages 
and are capable of producing complete ADS-B and TIS-B reports in accordance with 
the ADS-B equipment class. Type 2 Receiving Subsystems may be controlled by an 
external entity to produce installation-defined subsets of the reports that those subsystems are capable of producing. 
- 
The ADS-B/TIS-B Message reception function may be physically partitioned into separate avionics from those that implement the ADS-B/TIS-B report assembly 
function. 

## 1.2.4.2.1 Type 1 Report Assembly Function

In *Type 1* the Report Assembly Function may be closely coupled to the client application using the information provided by the ADS-B system.  In this case, the ADS-B Report Assembly Function might reside together with the associated client application in one piece of equipment. An advantage of a closely coupled assembler and application is that the Report Assembly function can be customized for the needs of the particular client application with which it is associated.  If the client application does not require all of the State Vector elements listed in the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A), then its associated Report Assembly function can customize the report by not providing the unneeded State Vector elements.  Again, if the client application is only concerned with certain targets, then its Report Assembly function can optimize performance by filtering out targets that have no relevance to that application. 

In a *Type 1* configuration, any further control of output reports (beyond the customization) 
would require a control interface by which the client application(s) can specify which and how reports are to be assembled or output. The *Type 1* configuration has the advantage that it places only minimal processing requirements on the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem. 

## 1.2.4.2.2 Type 2 Report Assembly

In *Type 2* the Report Assembly Function is of a general nature and is capable of supporting the needs of a variety of applications. An advantage of *Type 2* is that it can support the needs of a variety of client applications, as it includes a generalized Report Assembly Function that can output reports that contain all the elements of the SV, MS, and OC reports as described in RTCA DO-242A. In a *Type 2* configuration, any control of output reports would require a control interface by which the client application(s) can specify which and how reports are to be assembled or output. 

## 1.2.4.3 Major Operating Characteristics

The 1090 MHz ADS-B/TIS-B System uses the Mode S Extended Squitter defined in the ICAO Annex 10, Volumes III and IV, to broadcast the Aircraft/Vehicle position, intent and other relevant information over the RF medium. 

For ADS-B Messages, ICAO Doc 9871 provides the Mode S Transponder Register definitions as well as the 56-bit data formats required for the ADS-B Messages.  Appendix A to this document specifies the formats contained in ICAO Doc 9871, plus those eventdriven messages that are now defined.  The transmission rate for each of the defined broadcast messages is defined in the subparagraphs of Â§2.2.3.3 and in Appendix A.       
TIS-B Messages are defined in Â§2.2.17 and Â§A.2 of this document and in ICAO Doc 9871.   
The ADS-B Extended Squitters sent from a Mode S transponder use Downlink Format 17 (DF=17).  Each squitter contains 112 bits, of which 56 bits contain the various navigation, intent, and other data comprising the ADS-B information.  The other 56 bits include the 5- bit DF (Downlink Format) field, the 3-bit CA (Capability) field, the 24-bit AA (Announced Address) field, and the 24-bit PI (Parity/Interrogator ID) field. Non-Transponder-Based ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems and TIS-B Transmitting equipment use DF=18.  By using this format instead of DF=17, an ADS-B/TIS-B Receiving Subsystem will know that the message comes from equipment that cannot be interrogated. The transmitter power is based on the classification of the ADS-B equipment.  For example, ADS-B class A0 equipment may transmit at a lower power than class A3 equipment.   
The operating range of the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter receiver is tailored to the classification of the equipment as well.  Class A0 equipment may have a less sensitive receiver and thus support a comparatively short operating range.  Class A3 equipment requires a more sensitive receiver, in order to receive ADS-B Messages from aircraft that are farther away. The operation of the 1090 MHz ADS-B System must not have an adverse effect on other on-board systems.  The ADS-B System may be used in conjunction with these other systems for increased accuracy and integrity of an aircraft's current navigational position and/or intent information. 

## 1.2.5 Typical System Operation

A departing aircraft on the ground begins broadcasting its position and velocity via the 1090 MHz ADS-B System.  This broadcast is received by other aircraft and the ground based receivers.  The broadcasting aircraft also receives other aircraft broadcasts.  The aircraft processes this information for use by applications that may involve Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI).  As the aircraft taxis to its holding area, it monitors the movement of other aircraft on the surface as well as those in final approach.  The aircraft on approach can also monitor the ground traffic and watch for a potential runway incursion and/or a blunder on a parallel approach area. Once in the en route airspace, the aircraft broadcasts not only its position and velocity, but depending on the equipment classes, additional intent information.  The aircraft performs various applications with the received broadcasts from other aircraft within range.  These applications may include the use of CDTI, situational awareness, and de-confliction planning. As the aircraft approaches its destination (terminal area), it monitors other proximate aircraft in order to maintain the desired separation for approach and landing.   

## 1.2.6 Ads-B Message Content

The ADS-B Message refers to the transfer of data via 1090 MHz.  An ADS-B Message is formatted data that conveys information used in the development of ADS-B reports.  State Vector source data is provided by the platform dynamic navigation systems and sensors.  
For the transponder case, the information for the state vector is contained in various registers.  When broadcast, the contents of a register are inserted in the 56-bit message field of a 112-bit squitter transmission.  The remaining 56 bits contain the aircraft address as well as required forward error correcting parity information.  Appendix A to this document defines the contents of the various transponder registers.   

## 1.2.7 Ads-B Report Content

The ADS-B Report refers to the restructuring of ADS-B Message data received from a 1090 
MHz broadcast into various reports that can be used directly by other on-board applications.  
Four report types are defined for ADS-B outputs to applications.  These report types are State Vector (SV), Mode Status (MS), Target State Report (TSR), and Air Referenced Velocity (ARV) Report.   

## 1.2.7.1 State Vector Report

The State Vector report contains information about an aircraft or vehicle's current kinematic state as well as a measure of the accuracy of the State Vector.  Specific requirements for the customization of this type of report may vary according to the needs of the client applications of each participant.  The State Vector data is the most dynamic of the four ADS-B reports; hence, the applications require frequent updates of the State Vector to meet the required accuracy for the operational dynamics of the typical flying aircraft or ground operations of aircraft and surface vehicles. 

## 1.2.7.2 Mode Status Report

The Mode Status report contains current operational information about the transmitting participant.  This information may include current call sign, address, and other information that may be needed at a lower update rate than the information in the State Vector.  Specific requirements for a participant to transmit data for, and/or customize, this report type will vary according to the ADS-B equipage class of each participant. 

## 1.2.7.3 Target State Report

The Target State Report contains information that will be broadcast (in Aircraft Target State and Status Messages, Â§2.2.3.2.7.1) when current Target State information is available.  The Target State Report contains information that is required from only certain classes of ADS-
B equipped aircraft.  (See Â§2.2.8.3.1 for the format of the Target State Report.) 
Note: The ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A) describes a more general "On Condition" 
class of reports of which the Target State Report and the Air Referenced Velocity Report are the only instances that have so far been defined. 

## 1.2.7.4 Air Referenced Velocity Report

The Air Referenced Velocity Report (Â§2.2.8.3.2) contains velocity information that is required from only certain classes of ADS-B equipped aircraft.  This report is only generated when Air Referenced Velocity information is being broadcast in the Airborne Velocity Message (Â§2.2.3.2.6).   
Note: Air Referenced Velocity Messages may be received from airborne aircraft that are also broadcasting messages containing ground referenced velocity information. ADS-B Receiving Subsystems conformant to these MOPS are required to receive and process ground referenced and Air Referenced Velocity Messages from the same aircraft and output the corresponding reports.  Although not required in these MOPS, future versions of these MOPS will specify under what conditions both ground referenced and air referenced velocity would be transmitted.  This is intended to provide compatibility with anticipated future requirements for the transmission of both types of velocity information. 

## 1.3 Operational Applications

The various equipment classes defined within this document are intended to provide a level of capability appropriate to a set of expected operational applications.  Operational approval for specific applications should consider the total capability of all associated equipment installed in the aircraft.  All airborne equipment will require a source of state vector data, such as a GNSS (GPS) receiver, an inertial/multisensor navigation system, or Flight Management System (FMS).  Additional concepts, algorithms, procedures, and standards not defined within this document will also be required.  This section describes several examples of applications that make use of ADS-B supplied information.  Further examples may be found in RTCA DO-242A. 

## 1.3.1 General Support For Surveillance

ADS-B is a cooperative system.  All participating Aircraft and Vehicles (A/V) are required, at a minimum, to broadcast ADS-B Messages as specified in Section 2.2 of this document for each applicable equipment class.  The broadcast of these messages provides the basic surveillance data necessary to support all other ADS-B applications.   

## 1.3.2 Cockpit Display Of Traffic Information (Cdti)

The CDTI provides the pilot with awareness of proximate traffic.  A minimum system provides only the relative position and velocity vector of nearby traffic.  Displays to support advanced applications may be required to supply additional information, pilot cues, or advanced alerting functions. 

## 1.3.2.1 Aid To Visual Acquisition

An aid to visual acquisition application provides the pilot with information that supports visual acquisition as part of the normal see-and-avoid operations.  Visual acquisition is applicable under visual meteorological conditions (VMC) regardless of whether the operations are being conducted under IFR or VFR. 

## 1.3.2.2 Enhanced Traffic Situational Awareness

With the ability to display the full population of proximate aircraft, the CDTI may be used as an overall situational awareness tool.  The CDTI is also seen as a key element to Free Flight operations.  With mature Free Flight, and mutual controller/pilot agreement, separation responsibility may be delegated to the pilot.  In this case, the ability to electronically "see and avoid" proximate aircraft becomes a necessary technology to enable the Free Flight concept.  For example, the CDTI may be used for "Electronic VFR," with pilots applying "Rules of the Air" (as stated in ICAO Annex 2 to the Convention of International Aviation) to maintain safe separation. 

## 1.3.3 Improvements To Aircraft-Based Collision Avoidance

ADS-B is seen as a valuable technology to enhance operation of the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS).  ADS-B data may be used to improve surveillance performance.  It might also be used within the collision avoidance logic to reduce the number of unnecessary alerts. 

## 1.3.4 Conflict Management And Airspace De-Confliction

Conflict management and airspace de-confliction functions may be provided both by ground and aircraft automation systems.  Aircraft conflict management functions will be used to support cooperative separation during the periods that separation responsibility has been delegated to the aircraft, such as in Free Flight.  Ground conflict management functions will also be in place, both as a backup and as the primary tool to monitor aircraft for conflict detection.  Airspace de-confliction based on the exchange of intent information will be used for strategic separation. 

## 1.3.5 Ats Conformance Monitoring

ADS-B may be used to support and enhance ATS conformance monitoring, which is the process of ensuring that an aircraft maintains conformance to its agreed-to trajectory.  The degree of deviation from the trajectory, or the conformance bounds, is based on factors such as the aircraft's navigation capability and the separation standards in place.  Conformance monitoring occurs for all controlled aircraft or airspace, and applies to all operational airspace domains.  In the case of protected airspace or Special Use Airspace (SUA), conformance monitoring is performed to ensure that an aircraft does not enter or leave a specific airspace.  Conformance monitoring includes monitoring of simultaneous approaches to multiple runways, and surface operations. 

## 1.3.5.1 Simultaneous Approaches

A specific example of conformance monitoring is the monitoring of simultaneous instrument approaches, a task that enables closer separation between aircraft on adjacent approach courses due to monitoring of each approach path by an ATS controller. Parallel approaches that are not individually monitored require a stagger between aircraft on adjacent approaches, thus reducing arrival rates.  Conformance monitoring of simultaneous approaches using a dedicated ATS controller for each approach stream allows simultaneous approaches to be flown.  No stagger is required and the potential arrival rate can be 40 percent higher than for staggered approaches.  Simultaneous approaches can be flown as close as 5000 ft (three runways) and 4300 ft (dual runways) with controllers using conventional sensors and displays, and as close as 3400 ft when controllers use PRM, which is a specialized sensor for simultaneous approaches.  Simultaneous approaches may also be flown to converging runways, and in the future may be flown along curved or segmented courses that are tailored for local airport noise and arrival procedures.  ADS-B may offer a viable alternative to expensive PRM technology to support simultaneous approaches, and may allow simultaneous approaches at airports that cannot currently justify the cost of a PRM or conventional equipment for simultaneous approach monitoring. 

## 1.3.5.2 Incursion Monitoring

ADS-B information may be used to support incursion monitoring for both airborne and surface operations.  Specific zones may be defined including: 

ï§ 
special use airspace, 
ï§ 
restricted airspace, 
ï§ 
hazardous weather locations, 
ï§ 
runways and taxiways, 
ï§ 
lighting control areas (areas where lighting is under ATS control) 
ï§ 
weight limited or wingspan limited areas, and 
ï§ 
other operational control zones such as noise sensitive areas. 
Projected position information based on ADS-B State Vectors, when used in combination with zone incursion monitoring, can provide early warnings to ATS and the pilot. 

## 1.3.6 Other Applications

Other applications for ADS-B may not be directly related to ground-based surveillance, CDTI, or a Traffic Situation Display (TSD), but still offer many users a direct economic or operational benefit.  These should be developed and exploited as a means to encourage users to promptly and voluntarily equip with ADS-B systems.  Some examples of these other applications are as follows:

## 1.4 Ads-B Functions

The 1090 MHz ADS-B System can be viewed as being comprised of three major functions. These functions are the ADS-B Message Generation Function, the ADS-B Message Exchange Function, and the ADS-B Report Assembly Function. 

The ADS-B Message Generation Function is responsible for assembling and structuring the data to be delivered via the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter.  The ADS-B Message Exchange Function is then responsible for transferring this data at the required rate across the 1090 MHz frequency link.  This function encompasses both the transmission and reception of the data.  The ADS-B Report Assembly Function is responsible for structuring the received data into the appropriate ADS-B Reports for use by onboard applications. 

## 1.4.1 Ads-B Message Generation Function 1.4.1.1 Avionics Input Bus

The information required for the various ADS-B reports are provided to the message generation function via avionics digital communication buses or a General Aviation interface.  The majority of the information for air carrier installations may be obtained from avionics buses that contain ARINC 429 data labels for the required information.   

## 1.4.1.2 Input Interface

For the transponder case, the Mode S transponder will provide the input interface for the required ADS-B Message data.  This input may come directly from the source that supplies the data, i.e., an FMS unit, or from a data concentrator.  The data concentrator would serve as the input for all source data and transfer this data to the transponder in the case of the 1090 MHz ADS-B System. 

## 1.4.1.3 Message Assembly/Encoder

These subfunctions accept input data from other avionics sources and process this data into the appropriate format.  For a Mode S Transponder-Based ADS-B system, this formatted data will then be inserted into DF=17 for transmission over the 1090 MHz frequency link.  
For a Non-Transponder-Based ADS-B system, the formatted data will be inserted into DF=18 for transmission.   

## 1.4.2 Ads-B Message Exchange Function

The ADS-B Message Exchange Function provides for transmission and reception of the ADS-B Message over the 1090 MHz medium.  The message exchange function also provides suitable integrity for ADS-B Messages.   

## 1.4.2.1 Modulation/Transmission Subfunction

The modulation of the ADS-B Message transmission is Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) as specified in RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E).  This modulation scheme is inherently resistant to ATCRBS interference.  The information content of the transmission is further protected by parity check bits generated by a cyclic coding algorithm.   
The transmitter subfunction generates the 1090 MHz carrier frequency and impresses the ADS-B information onto the carrier frequency.  For Mode S Transponder-Based implementations, the transmitter requirements for transmission of the ADS-B data are defined in ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, and also RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E). For Non-Transponder-Based implementations, transmitter requirements are contained in this document.   

## 1.4.2.2 Transmit/Receive/Antenna Subfunction

The ADS-B transmit and receive subfunctions should be supported by one or two antennas depending upon aircraft installation for the operational unit.  Two antennas are required if the transponder is coupled with an on-board TCAS, or if the aircraft's weight or maximum airspeed is such that diversity is specified in ICAO Annex 10.  The diversity installation should be such that one antenna is mounted on the top of the fuselage and the other on the underside.  The antennas should be capable of receiving and transmitting the 1090 MHz frequency (D-Band). 

For best coverage in the yaw plane, the ADS-B antennas should be designed to radiate and receive vertically polarized RF signals.  The antennas should be designed such that the ADS-B System is capable of performing its intended functions.  This includes all azimuth headings with respect to any radial direction from another ADS-B System receiver when in the transmit mode or to another ADS-B transmitter when in the receive mode. 

Note: For the transponder case, the antenna should also be capable of receiving the 1030 
MHz frequency for use in the ATCRBS/Mode S environment. 

These subfunctions should be designed to receive the RF signals of airborne aircraft and Aircraft/Vehicles operating on the ground.  Detailed requirements are given in Section 2.2 to establish a receive antenna suitable for the ADS-B function. 

## 1.4.2.3 Receiver/Demodulator Subfunction

The ADS-B Message is received over the 1090 MHz frequency link, demodulated, and output to the Report Assembly function.  The minimum trigger level (MTL) defines the minimum input power that results in reliable reception and is suitable for receiving the information necessary for an ADS-B report.  The MTL may vary to effectively increase or reduce the range depending on the phase of flight.  Dynamic MTL may be used to reject low level multipath and interference. 

## 1.4.3 Ads-B Report Assembly Function 1.4.3.1 Decoder/Report Assembly

Once the ADS-B Message is received, the decoder and message assembly subfunctions provide all control, decoding, and formatting functions needed to convert the received messages into the appropriate formatted reports for use by client applications.  These subfunctions may be performed in the 1090 MHz receiver unit itself or an external processing unit that interfaces to the receiver. Since the ADS-B information will be transmitted in multiple messages, the message assembler may require the use of a tracker.  The message assembly and tracking processor will structure the received messages into the appropriate output data reports.  It also verifies that the output data reports are valid prior to delivery to the Output Interface subfunction. 

## 1.4.3.2 Output Interface

The Report Assembly function will output information through the interface for use by client applications that may involve CDTI.  The Report Assembly/output processor serves as the output control for ADS-B Message data and transfers this data to client applications. 

## 1.4.3.3 Avionics Output Bus

The information required for the various client applications is provided by the Report Assembly function, via avionics digital communication buses or a General Aviation interface.  The majority of the information for air carrier installations may be delivered with avionics buses that contain ARINC 429 data labels for the required information.   

## 1.5 Operational Goals

The aviation industry has articulated the goal of leveraging ADS-B equipage, in conjunction with technologies/services such as GPS, Traffic Information ServiceâBroadcast (TIS-B), Flight Information ServiceâBroadcast (FIS-B), and two-way digital aeronautical data link, to support operational enhancements leading toward free flight [Joint Government/Industry Plan for Free Flight Operational Enhancements, August 1998, RTCA Flight Select Committee].   A number of the operational applications cited in Section 1.3 are involved in this effort, most notably to support Improved Terminal Operations in Low Visibility Conditions, Enhanced Visual Operations and Situational Awareness, Enhanced Operations for En Route and Oceanic Air-to-Air, Improved Surface/Approach Operations, a Surface and Airport Vicinity Display for the Controller, Use of ADS-B in Non-Radar Airspace, and Use of ADS-B to Enhance Radar and Automation Performance. ADS-B is a technical linchpin for supporting seven of the ten identified operational enhancements. Operational scenarios have been developed for each of the above Free Flight Enhancements, and more detailed operational concepts are being completed.  The detailed operational concepts are being used to develop a comprehensive roadmap for surveillance airborne and ground system development and interoperability.  

## 1.6 Assumptions And Rationale

Throughput requirements for ADS-B Message reception have been developed so that the equipment can process the maximum number of messages that can be supplied on the 1090 MHz medium.  The ADS-B Report Assembly function, whether or not physically collocated with the ADS-B Message reception function, will similarly be required to be capable of accepting this number of messages as output by the ADS-B receiver function.   

## 1.7 Test Procedures

The test procedures specified in Sections 2.4 and 3 are intended to be used as recommended means of demonstrating compliance with the minimum acceptable performance parameters specified herein.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be suitable.  These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures.   

## 1.7.1 Environmental Tests

Environmental tests are specified in Section 2.3.  These tests, like bench tests, are performed at the equipment level.  The procedures and their associated requirements provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under conditions expected to be encountered in actual aeronautical operations. Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance, in preparation of installation instructions and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture.   

## 1.7.2 Qualification Tests

The test procedures specified in Section 2.4 provide a means to demonstrate equipment performance in a simulated environment.  Test results may be used as design guidance for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture.   
Test procedures contained in Section 2.4 apply to the minimum system requirements in accordance with the minimum performance parameters specified in these MOPS. 

## 1.7.3 Installed Tests

The installed test procedures and their associated limit requirements are in Section 3. Although bench and environmental test procedures are not a part of installed tests, their successful completion is normally a precondition to the completion of the installed tests. Installed tests are normally performed on the ground and in flight.   
The test results may be used to demonstrate equipment functional performance in the environment in which it is intended to operate and with the minimum service to be provided.

## 2.1.9 Design Assurance

The equipment **shall** be designed to the appropriate design assurance level(s) based on the intended application of the equipment and aircraft class in which it is to be installed.  The appropriate design assurance level(s) are determined by an analysis of the failure modes of the equipment and a categorization of the effects of the failure on the operation of the aircraft.  For the purpose of this analysis, a failure is defined as either a loss of function or the output of misleading information.  Additional guidance is contained in Advisory Circulars AC 23.1309-1D and AC 25.1309-1A. 

Software included as part of the equipment **shall** be developed in compliance with the appropriate software level as specified in Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, RTCA DO-178B (EUROCAE ED-12B). 

## 2.1.10 Integration And Interoperability With A Mode S Transponder

181E) (EUROCAE ED-73E). 

If the ADS-B equipment is designed as a stand-alone system, it **shall** be interoperable within the Mode S environment. 

## 2.1.11 Equipage Class Definitions

ADS-B equipment is categorized into aircraft system equipage classes as defined in Table 3-
1 of RTCA DO-242A (ADS-B MASPS).  For 1090 MHz ADS-B equipment, those definitions are repeated in these MOPS in Table 2-1. 

The Class "A" Aircraft/Vehicle Classes (A0, A1, A2, and A3) are as defined in RTCA DO- 242A.  Class A equipment is interactive, transmit and receive equipment, used for both aircraft and vehicles.  The ADS-B MASPS "A1" equipment has been further divided into two classes, based on antenna diversity.  For A1 installations using a single antenna, the 
"A1 Single" class is created, and abbreviated throughout this document as "A1S."  A1 installations with diversity antennas are abbreviated throughout this document as "A1."  The only equipment difference between classes A1 and A1S is antenna diversity. The ADS-B MASPS "B0" class (broadcast-only aircraft) is defined as having transmitter characteristics and payload capability identical to the 1090 MHz A0 interactive aircraft class.  The ADS-B MASPS "B1" class (broadcast-only aircraft) is defined as having transmitter characteristics and payload capability identical to the 1090 MHz A1 interactive aircraft class.  The ADS-B MASPS "B1" equipment has been further divided into two classes, based on antenna diversity.  For B1 installations using a single antenna, the "B1 Single" class is created, and abbreviated throughout this document as "B1S." B1 installations with diversity antennas are abbreviated throughout this document as "B1."  The only equipment difference between classes B1 and B1S is antenna diversity. The characteristics of the 1090 MHz "B2" class (broadcast-only ground vehicle) are defined in Table 2-1. The characteristics of the 1090 MHz "B3" class (broadcast-only fixed or moveable obstacle) 
are defined in Table 2-1.  The payload capability supports the surface position, height of highest point, and identification (including Emitter Category) of the obstacle, so that both State Vector and Mode Status reports must be supported.  Moveable obstacles require a position source.  A moveable obstacle is one that can change its position, but only slowly, such that its horizontal velocity may be ignored. 

Requirements for Class 'C' ground-based receive-only equipment are not addressed in this document. 

## 2.1.12 Equipage Class Categories

ADS-B equipment is categorized into aircraft system equipage classes as specified in the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A) and as summarized in Table 2-1.  These class categories are based on both the aircraft's on-board transmitter and receiver capabilities.  The system classes are then broken down into subsystem equipment classes that are based on the individual unit specifications (refer to Â§2.1.12.1 and Â§2.1.12.2).  Table 2-2 lists the different types of ADS-B Messages in the 1090 MHz ADS-B system.   
It is recognized that since Class "A" includes both Transmitting and Receiving Subsystems, there may very well be implementations that consist of separate equipment for the transmit and receive functions.   Implementing the transmitter function of Class "A" can be satisfied by providing the capabilities included in Â§2.1.12.1.  Similarly, implementing the receiver function of Class "A" can be satisfied by providing the capabilities included in Â§2.1.12.2.

## 2.2 Minimum Performance Standards - Standard Conditions And Signals 2.2.1 Definition Of Standard Conditions

Unless otherwise noted, the signal levels specified for transmitting devices in this subsection exist at the antenna end of a transmitter to antenna transmission line of loss equal to the maximum for which the transmitting function is designed. Likewise, unless otherwise noted, the signal levels specified for receiving devices in this subsection exist at the antenna end of an antenna to receiver transmission line of loss equal to the maximum for which the receiving function is designed. 

Note: Transmitting or receiving equipment may be installed with less than the designed 
maximum transmission line loss.  Nevertheless, the standard conditions of this document are based on the maximum design value.  Insertion losses internal to the antenna should be included as part of the net antenna gain. 

## 2.2.2 Ads-B Transmitter Characteristics 2.2.2.1 Mode S Transponder-Based Transmitters

a. Transmitters for Class A1, A1S, B1 and B1S systems **shall** be based on Mode S 
transponders with RF Peak Output Power levels as specified in Â§2.2.2.1.1.2.  
Transmitters for Class A2, A3 systems **shall** be based on Mode S transponders with RF 
Peak Output Power levels as specified in Â§2.2.2.1.1.3, or Â§2.2.2.1.1.4, respectively, for 
the class of equipment.   
b. Transmitters for Class A0 and Class B0 systems may also be based on Mode S 
transponders with RF Peak Output Power levels as specified in Â§2.2.2.2.10.   
c. If the ADS-B transmitter is based on Mode S transponders, then for transponder 
functions it **shall** comply with RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E) for each class of 
transponder specified in the latest version of FAA TSO C112 (ETSO 2C112).   

## 2.2.2.1.1 Rf Peak Output Power (Minimum)

The minimum RF peak output power of each pulse of each transmitted message at the terminals of the antenna **shall** be as provided in the following subparagraphs for each class of equipment addressed.   

2.2.2.1.1.1 
Class A0 ADS-B Transponder-Based Transmitter Power 
The minimum RF peak output power for Class A0 ADS-B Transponder-Based equipment shall be 18.5 dBW (70 W). 

## 2.2.2.1.1.2 Class A1S And A1 Ads-B Transponder-Based Transmitter Power

The minimum RF peak output power for Class A1S and A1 ADS-B Transponder-Based equipment **shall** be 21.0 dBW (125 W).   

## 2.2.2.1.1.3 Class A2 Ads-B Transponder-Based Transmitter Power

The minimum RF peak output power for Class B0, B2 and B3 ADS-B Transponder-Based equipment **shall** be 18.5 dBW (70 W).  The minimum RF peak output power for Class B1S and B1 ADS-B Transponder-Based equipment **shall** be 21.0 dBW (125 W). 

## 2.2.2.1.2 Rf Peak Output Power (Maximum)

The maximum RF peak output power of each pulse of each transmitted message at the terminals of the antenna **shall** be fixed at 27.0 dBW (500 W) for all classes of Transponder-
Based equipment.   

## 2.2.2.2 Stand Alone Transmitters

Stand Alone Transmitters for Class A0 and Class B0 equipment are those implemented independent of a Mode S transponder.  Such transmitters **shall** meet the requirements specified in the following subparagraphs.   
Note: A 1090 MHz Non-Transponder-Device (NTD) is intended to provide the lowest cost implementation of Extended Squitter for low-end General Aviation (GA) users.  A NTD implementation does not use the 1090 MHz spectrum as efficiently nor provide all of the system benefits as a Mode S Transponder implementation.  For this reason, its use is restricted to class A0 operation in order to limit the number of such devices.  Examples of the spectrum efficiency and system benefit issues related to NTDs are as follows: 

1. TCAS will not be able to benefit from the ADS-B information from the NTD.  
TCAS will only monitor ADS-B data reported in DF=17 squitters (as emitted by a Mode S transponder).  DF=18 squitters from NTDs are not monitored since TCAS must assume that it cannot interrogate the aircraft (via Mode S) to validate the range and approximate bearing via active interrogations through a process called hybrid surveillance. 
2. Mode S interrogators will not be able to benefit from the ADS-B information 
from the NTD.  Mode S interrogators will not be able to read Extended Squitter 
messages via direct air-ground readout.  Such readout requires that the ADS-B data is available in the transponder registers.  This will not be the case for a NTD. 
3. More interference is generated.  An aircraft equipped with a NTD and a Mode 
A/C transponder will generate more interference than a Mode S transponder implementation of Extended Squitter.  Examples are as follows: (a) For a transponder implementation, TCAS will (after validation) maintain an aircraft on passive surveillance unless it becomes a near threat or a threat.  For the 
NTD case, the aircraft will emit Extended Squitters and be regularly 
interrogated by TCAS.  (b) A Mode S transponder implementation of Extended Squitter offers a surface surveillance system the possibility of controlling the 
squitter rate to reduce un-necessary transmissions.   

## 2.2.2.2.1 Transmission Frequency

The carrier frequency of ADS-B Message transmissions **shall** be 1090 Â±1 MHz. 

Note: This requirement is consistent with ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, fourth edition, July 
2007, Â§3.1.2.2.1, and RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.3.1 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.3.1).

## 2.2.2.2.10 Rf Peak Output Power

The RF peak output power requirements of each pulse of each transmitted message at the terminals of the antenna are provided in the following subparagraphs for each class of equipment addressed. 

## 2.2.2.2.10.1 Class A0 And B0 Equipment Rf Peak Output Power

The minimum RF peak output power for Class A0 and B0 equipment **shall**: 

a. not be less than 18.5 dBW (70 W) for aircraft (or other installations) not capable of 
operating at altitudes exceeding 15000 feet (4570 meters); 
b. not be less than 21.0 dBW (125 W) for aircraft (or other installations) capable of 
operating above 15000 feet (4570 meters); 
c. not be less than 21.0 dBW (125 W) for aircraft (or other installations) with a maximum 
cruising speed exceeding 175 knots (324 km/h). 
Note: These requirements are consistent with the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, fourth edition, July 2007, Â§3.1.2.10.2, as well as with the requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.3.2 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.3.3).   

## 2.2.2.2.10.2 Class B2 And B3 Equipment Rf Peak Output Power

The minimum RF peak output power for Class B2 and B3 equipment **shall not** be less than 
18.5 dBW (70 W).   

## Notes:

1. ADS-B equipment that meets all requirements of Class B2 with the exception of this RF 
peak output power requirement is identified by the use of the "B2 Low" Capability Class Code as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.3.7.   
2. It is noted that the 70 W minimum RF peak output power requirement for Class B2 
equipment is overly stringent to meet the 5NM operational range required for airport surface operations in RTCA DO-242A.  Future revisions of these MOPS may reduce the minimum power output requirement on B2 equipment to better reflect the 5NM operational range.   

## 2.2.2.2.10.3 Rf Peak Output Power (Maximum)

The maximum RF peak output power of each pulse of each transmitted message at the terminals of the antenna **shall** be fixed at 27.0 dBW (500 W) for all classes of stand-alone transmitter based equipment.   
Note: These requirements are consistent with the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, fourth edition, July 2007, Â§3.1.2.10.2, as well as with the requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.3.2 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.3.3).  

## 2.2.2.2.11 Unwanted Output Power

When the ADS-B transmitter is in the inactive state, the RF output power at 1090 Â±3.0 MHz at the terminals of the antenna shall not exceed -70 dBm. 

## Notes:

1.  
The inactive state is defined to include the entire period between ADS-B Message transmissions less 10-microsecond transition periods, if necessary, preceding and 
following the extremes of the transmissions. 
2.  
This unwanted power requirement is necessary to insure that the ADS-B transmitter does not prevent closely located 1090 MHz receiver equipment from meeting its requirements.  It assumes that the isolation between the ADS-B transmitter antenna and the 1090 MHz receiver equipment antenna exceeds 20 dB.  The resultant interference level at the 1090 MHz receiver equipment antenna should then be below -90 dBm. 
3.  
This unwanted power requirement is consistent with the requirements provided in: 
a. ICAO, Annex 10, Volume 4, Fourth Edition, July 2007, Â§3.1.2.10.2.1. 
b. RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.3.3 and Â§2.2.22.f (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.3.4 and 
Â§3.27.f), and 
c. RTCA DO-185B, Â§2.2.3.2 (EUROCAE ED-143, Â§2.2.3.2).   

## 2.2.2.2.12 Broadcast Rate Capability

The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem must be capable of the broadcast rates specified for each message type in Â§2.2.3.3.  These rates must be maintained along with whatever other transmit functions that the transmitting device may be required to perform. 

## 2.2.3 Broadcast Message Characteristics 2.2.3.1 Ads-B Message Characteristics

The ADS-B Message data block is formed by Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) encoding of the message data.  A pulse transmitted in the first half of the interval represents a ONE 
while a pulse transmitted in the second half represents a ZERO (see Figure 2-1). 

Note: These requirements are consistent with the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, fourth edition, July 2007, Â§3.1.2.3.1.2, as well as with the requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.4.2 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.6).   

## 2.2.3.1.1 Ads-B Message Preamble

The preamble **shall** consist of 4 pulses, each having duration of 0.5 Â±0.05 microseconds.  
The second, third and fourth pulses **shall** be spaced 1.0, 3.5 and 4.5 microseconds, respectively, from the first transmitted pulse.  The spacing tolerance **shall** be in accordance with Â§2.2.3.1.4. 

Note: These requirements are consistent with the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, fourth edition, July 2007, Â§3.1.2.2.4 and Â§3.1.2.2.5, as well as with the requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.4.2 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.6.1).   

## 2.2.3.1.2 Ads-B Message Data Pulses

The block of message data pulses **shall** begin 8.0 microseconds after the first transmitted pulse.  112 one-microsecond intervals **shall** be assigned to each ADS-B Message transmission.  A pulse with a width of 0.5 Â±0.05 microseconds **shall** be transmitted either in the first or the second half of each interval.  If a pulse transmitted in the second half of one interval is followed by another pulse transmitted in the first half of the next interval, the two pulses **shall** merge and a 1.0 Â±0.05 microsecond pulse **shall** be transmitted. 

Note: These requirements are consistent with the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, fourth edition, July 2007, Â§3.1.2.2.5.1.2, as well as with the requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.4.2.2 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.6.2).   

## 2.2.3.1.3 Ads-B Message Pulse Shape

a. The pulse amplitude variation between one pulse and any other pulse in a message 
transmission shall not exceed 2 dB. 
b. The pulse rise time shall not be less than 0.05 microseconds or greater than 0.1 
microsecond. 
c. The pulse decay time shall not be less than 0.05 microseconds or greater than 0.2 
microseconds. 
d. The spectrum of the message transmission shall not exceed the bounds in Table 2-7:   

Frequency Difference 
Maximum Relative Response 
(MHz from 1090 MHz) 
(dB Down From Peak) 
    >  1.3  and   <     7 
3 
    >     7  and   <   23 
20 
    >   23  and   <   78 
40 
    >  78 
60 

Note: These requirements are consistent with the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, fourth edition, July 2007, Â§3.1.2.2, Table 3-2, and Figure 3-5, as well as with the requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.4.2.2 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.6.4).   

## 2.2.3.1.4 Ads-B Message Pulse Spacing

ADS-B Message transmission pulses **shall** start at a defined multiple of 0.5 microsecond from the first transmitted pulse.  The pulse position tolerance **shall** be Â±0.05 microseconds, measured from the first pulse of the transmission. 

Note: These requirements are consistent with the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, fourth edition, July 2007, Â§3.1.2.2.5.1, as well as with the requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.4.2.4 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.6.5).   

## 2.2.3.2 Ads-B And Tis-B Message Baseline Format And Structures

Figure 2-2 shows the overall format structure that **shall** be used for ADS-B and TIS-B 
Messages.  The first 5 data bits in each transmission are called the DF (Downlink Format) field, while the next three bits are called: 

1. the CA field if DF=17, 2. the CF field if DF=18, or 
3. the AF field if DF=19.

## Notes For Figure 2-2:

1. "[#]" provided in a field indicates the number of bits in the field. 2. DF=19 messages are intended for Military Applications systems only. 
3. For DF=19, if the AF field is equal to 0, then bits 9-32 are used for the AA field, bits 
33-88 are used for the "ME" field, and bits 89-112 are used for the PI field.  If the AF field is not 0 (that is, is in the range 1 to 7) then bits 9-112 are used for the "Reserved 
for Military Applications" field.  (This format is reserved for military use only.) 
The DF=17 format is used for ADS-B Messages from Mode S transponders.  If DF=17, the CA field describes the capabilities of the Mode S transponder, the AA field holds the transponder's 24-bit ICAO address, the "ME" field holds the body of the ADS-B Message, and the PI field holds parity check bits. The DF=18 format is used for ADS-B or TIS-B Messages from transmitting devices that are not Mode S transponders.  If DF=18, then the 3-bit CF (Code Format) field designates whether the "ME" field holds an ADS-B Message or a TIS-B Message.  For DF=18 
transmissions in which CF=0 or 1 (that is, DF=18 Extended Squitters that carry ADS-B 
Messages), the CF field also specifies what type of address is contained in the AA field. 

ADS-B Messages **shall** use Extended Squitter formats in which DF=17, or in which DF=18 
and CF=0 or 1, or in which DF=19 and AF=0.  The DF=19 format is reserved for military applications; non-military ADS-B participants **shall not** transmit Extended Squitter formats in which DF=19. 

ADS-B Airborne Receiving Subsystems **shall** accept, and process as ADS-B Messages, any Extended Squitter transmissions in which DF=17, or in which DF=18 and CF=0, 1 or 6.  
ADS-B Airborne Receiving Subsystems may accept and process ADS-B Messages in which DF=19 and AF=0, but need not do so.  ADS-B Airborne Receiving Subsystems **shall not** 
process as ADS-B Messages any Extended Squitter receptions in which DF=18 and CF is not equal to 0, 1 or 6, or any Extended Squitter receptions in which DF=19 and AF is not equal to 0. 

ADS-B Airborne Receiving Subsystems **shall** accept TIS-B Messages that use 1090 MHz Extended Squitter formats in which DF=18 and CF=2, 3 or 5.  ADS-R Messages are ADS-B Messages from an alternate data link that are rebroadcast by ground equipment with DF=18 and CF=6, and use the same TYPE Codes and Message formats as are defined for DF=17 ADS-B Messages, with the exception of bits modified as identified in Section Â§2.2.18. 1090 MHz Extended Squitter Messages with DF=18 and CF=4 convey management information for TIS-B and ADS-R.  Receiving equipment **shall not** process as TIS-B 
Messages any Extended Squitter receptions in which DF is not equal to 18, or in which CF is not in the range from 2 to 5. 

Note:  A primary purpose of the TIS-B/ADS-R Management Messages (i.e., DF=18 and 
CF=4) is to convey the TIS-B/ADS-R service status.  A detailed description of TIS- B/ADS-R service status and  data contents of the TIS-B/ADS-R Management Messages are defined in RTCA DO-317. 

## 2.2.3.2.1 Ads-B Message Baseline Field Descriptions

The following subparagraphs describe the fields that were listed in Figure 2-2 above. 

## 2.2.3.2.1.1 "Df" Downlink Format Field

a. The "DF" field is the first field in all downlink formats and provides the transmission 
descriptor coded in accordance with RTCA DO-181E, Figure 2-5 (EUROCAE ED-73E, 
Figure 3-4). 
b. The "DF" field **shall** be set to DF=17 (binary 1 0001) for all ADS-B Message 
transmissions from Mode-S Transponder-Based transmission devices. 
c. The "DF" field **shall** be set to DF=18 (binary 1 0010) for all ADS-B Message 
transmissions from transmission devices that are not Mode-S Transponder-Based 
systems.  The DF=18 is also used for all TIS-B Message transmissions. 
d. The "DF" field **shall** be set to DF=19 (binary 1 0011) for all ADS-B Message 
transmissions from transmission devices that are Military Application based systems. 
Note: Encoding of the "DF" field is consistent with Â§3.1.2.3.2 and Figure 3-8 in ICAO 
ANNEX 10, Volume IV, Fourth Edition, July 2007.   

## 2.2.3.2.1.2 "Ca" Capability Field (Used In Df=17)

a. Definition: -- The "CA" field is a 3-bit (Message bits 6 - 8) field used to report the 
capability of an ADS-B transmitting installation that is based on a Mode-S transponder.  
The "CA" field is used to report the capability and notice of a transponder condition that requires interrogation by the ground of a transponder.  It is used in Mode-S downlink 
format DF=11, i.e., the Mode-S All Call reply and acquisition squitter, and DF=17. Therefore, the codes used in the "CA" field are as specified in Table 2-8:   

Coding 
Meaning 
(Binary) 
(Decimal) 
000 
0 
Signifies Level 1 transponder (surveillance only), and no ability to set "CA" code 7, and either on the ground or airborne 
001 
1 
Reserved 
010 
2 
Reserved 
011 
3 
Reserved 
100 
4 
Signifies Level 2 or above transponder, and the ability to set "CA" code 7, and on the ground 
101 
5 
Signifies Level 2 or above transponder, and the ability to set "CA" code 7, and airborne 
110 
6 
Signifies Level 2 or above transponder, and the ability to set "CA" code 7, and either on the ground or airborne 
111 
7 
Signifies the "DR" field is NOT equal to ZERO (0), or the "FS" field equals 2, 3, 4, or 5, and either on the ground or airborne. 

When the conditions for "CA" Code 7 are not satisfied, Level 2 or above transponders in installations that do not have automatic means to set on-the-ground condition **shall** 
use "CA" Code 6.  Aircraft with automatic on-the-ground determination **shall** use "CA" 
Code 4 when on the ground, and "CA" Code 5 when airborne.  Data Link capability reports (RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.19.1.12.6) (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.23.1.12.e) **shall** be available from aircraft installations that set "CA" codes 4, 5, 6 and 7.   

## Notes:

1. "CA" codes 1 to 3 are reserved to maintain backward compatibility. 2. These requirements are consistent with the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, Volume 
IV, Â§3.1.2.5.2.2.1, as well as with the requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.14.4.6 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.18.4.5).   
b. Transponder Use -- The "CA" code definitions provided herein are intended for use 
when implemented with the Mode-S Transponder functions.   
Note: Since a Transponder supporting Extended Squitter is required to be at a minimum of Level 2 or greater, the CA field can only support values equal to 4, 5, 6 or 7.   

## C. Air/Ground Determination

(1). If a transmitting ADS-B participant is not equipped with a means, such as a weighton-wheels switch, to determine whether it is airborne or on the surface, and that 
participant's Emitter Category (Â§2.2.3.2.5.2) is one of the following, then it **shall** set 
its Air/Ground State to "Airborne," and broadcast the Airborne Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.3): 
- 
Unknown Emitter Category 
- 
Light Aircraft 
- 
Rotorcraft 
- 
Glider or Sailplane 
- 
Lighter Than Air 
- 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle 
- 
Ultralight, Hang Glider or Paraglider 
- 
Parachutist or Skydiver 
- 
Point Obstacle 
- 
Cluster Obstacle 
- 
Line Obstacle 

## 

Notes: 
1. Because of the unique operating capabilities of "Lighter-Than-Air" vehicles, 
i.e., balloons, an operational "Lighter-Than-Air" vehicle will always report the "Airborne" State, unless the "ON-GROUND" State is specifically declared in compliance with subparagraph "(4)" below. 
2. Because of the fact that it is important for Fixed Ground or Tethered Obstacles 
to report altitude, such objects will always report the "Airborne" state. 
3. Because of the unique capabilities of Rotorcraft, i.e., hover, etc., an operational 
Rotorcraft will always report the "Airborne" state unless the "ON-GROUND" 
state is specifically declared in compliance with subparagraph "(4)" below. 
4. An automatic means of determining air/ground status may include Weight-on-
Wheels discrete, Airspeed, Ground Speed, Radio Altitude, or other appropriate data sources. 
 
(2). If a transmitting ADS-B participant's Emitter Category (Â§2.2.3.2.5.2) is one of the 
following, then that participant **shall** set its Air/Ground State to the "ON-
GROUND" condition and broadcast the Surface Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.4): 
 

- 
Surface Vehicle - Emergency  
- 
Surface Vehicle - Service  
 

(3). If a transmitting ADS-B participant is not equipped with a means, such as a weighton-wheels switch, to determine whether it is airborne or on the surface, and its ADS-B Emitter Category (Â§2.2.3.2.5.2) is not one of those listed under tests (1) or 
(2) above (i.e., the participant's Emitter Category is either: Small, Large, High Vortex Large, Heavy, Highly Maneuverable, or Space/Trans-Atmospheric), then the 
following tests will be performed to determine whether to broadcast the Airborne or Surface Position Messages. a. If the participant's Radio Height (RH) parameter is available, and RH<50 feet, 
and at least Ground Speed (GS) or Airspeed (AS) is available, and the available 
GS<100 knots, or the available AS<100 knots, then that participant **shall** 
broadcast the Surface Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.4). 
If all three parameters are available, the decision to broadcast the Airborne or Surface Position Messages **shall** be determined by the logical "AND" of all three parameters. 

b. Otherwise, if Radio Height (RH) is not available, and if the participant's 
Ground Speed (GS) and Airspeed (AS) are available, and GS<50 knots and 
AS<50 knots, then that participant **shall** broadcast the Surface Position Message 
(Â§2.2.3.2.4). 
c. Otherwise, the participant **shall** broadcast the Airborne Position Message 
(Â§2.2.3.2.3). 
(4). If a transmitting ADS-B participant is equipped with a means, such as a weight-onwheels switch, to determine automatically whether it is airborne or on the surface, 
then such information **shall** be used to determine whether to broadcast the Airborne 
Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.3), or the Surface Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.4). 

## D. Validation Of Ground Status:

Note: For aircraft with an automatic means of determining vertical status (i.e., weighton-wheels, strut switch, etc.) the "CA" field reports whether the aircraft is airborne or on the ground.  TCAS acquires aircraft using the acquisition squitters or extended squitters, both of which contain the "CA" field.  If an aircraft reports that it is on the ground, that aircraft will not be interrogated by TCAS in order to reduce unnecessary interrogation activity.  The 1090 MHz ADS-B Message formatter may have information available to validate that an aircraft reporting "on-the-ground" is actually on the surface. 

If the automatically determined Air/Ground status is not available or indicates that the Airborne Position Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.3) **shall** be broadcast, then the Airborne Position Message **shall** be broadcast in accordance with subparagraph c. 

If Ground Speed > 100 knots OR Airspeed >100 knots OR Radio Altitude > 50 feet, then the Air/Ground status **shall** be changed to "Airborne" and the Airborne Position Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.3) **shall** be broadcast irrespective of the automatically determined Air/Ground status. 

Note: Modern aircraft with integrated avionics suites commonly contain sophisticated 
algorithms for determining the air/ground status based on multiple aircraft sensors. These algorithms are customized to the airframe and designed to overcome individual sensor failures.  These algorithms are an acceptable means to determine the air/ground status and do not require additional validation.   
 

## 2.2.3.2.1.3 "Cf" Field (Used In Df=18)

The "CF" field of DF=18 messages is a 3-bit field (Message bits 6 - 8) used by installations in which the ADS-B or TIS-B transmitting device is not based on a Mode S transponder. The CF field serves to classify DF=18 messages between ADS-B Messages and TIS-B 
Messages.  For ADS-B Messages, the CF field also specifies whether or not the AA field (Â§2.2.3.2.1.5) holds a 24-bit ICAO address.  For TIS-B Messages, the CF field serves to categorize the TIS-B Message as being a "fine format" TIS-B Message, a "coarse format" 
TIS-B Airborne Position and Velocity Message, a Fine TIS-B Message that uses non-ICAO 
24-bit addresses, or a TIS-B/ADS-R Management Message.  The coding of the CF field shall be as specified in Table 2-9.

111 
7 
Reserved 

 
ADS-B Messages from ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems that are not based on Mode S 
transponders **shall** use CF=0 or 1, according to the type of address conveyed in the AA 
field.  TIS-B Messages use CF=2, 3 or 5.  ADS-R Messages are ADS-B Messages from an alternate data link that are rebroadcast by ground equipment with DF=18 and CF=6, and the same 1090ES TYPE Codes and Message formats as are defined for DF=17 ADS-B Messages, with the exception of bits modified as identified in section Â§2.2.18.  CF code 7 is reserved for future standardization and **shall not** be transmitted by equipment that conforms to these MOPS.    

## 2.2.3.2.1.4 "Af" Field (Used In Df=19)

The "AF" ("Application Field") field of DF=19 messages is a 3-bit field (Message bits 6 - 
8) used by all ADS-B Message transmissions from transmission devices that are Military Application based systems.  The coding of the "AF" field **shall** be as specified in Table 2-
10.  Refer to Â§2.2.3.2.1.2 for determining On-Ground Status.

## 2.2.3.2.1.5 "Aa" Address Field, Announced

The "AA" field is a 24-bit (Message bits 9 - 32) field that **shall** contain the address of the transmitting installation.  This is intended to provide unambiguous identification of the A/V being described in the ADS-B or TIS-B Message. 

The type of address (whether a 24-bit ICAO address or some other kind of address) 
contained in the AA field depends on the value of the DF field, and the CF or AF fields when DF=18 or 19, and the IMF (ICAO/Mode A flag) subfield of the "ME" field for TIS-B 
Messages.  The type of address in the AA field **shall** be as specified in Table 2-11.

## 

For Extended Squitter transmissions in which DF=17, or in which DF=18 and CF=0, or in which DF=19 and AF=0, the AA field contains the 24-bit ICAO address of the transmitting participant. The TIS-B/ADS-R Management Messages (i.e., DF=18 and CF=4) do not relate to an aircraft but rather relate to the coverage and availability of the TIS-B or ADS-R service that is being provided by the local ground infrastructure.  Therefore, the coding of the AA field for TIS-B/ADS-R Management Messages is used to convey additional information in the TIS-B/ADS-R Management Message and must be included in the data delivered to ADS-B 
applications.   

## Notes:

1. For Extended Squitter transmissions in which DF=18 and CF=1, the CF field indicates 
that the "ME" field holds an ADS-B Message and that the AA field holds an address 
other than the standard ICAO 24-bit address of the transmitting ADS-B participant.   
2. For Extended Squitter transmission in which DF=18 and CF=2, 3 or 5, the CF field 
indicates that the "ME" field holds a TIS-B Message.  In these cases, the meaning of the 
AA field - whether or not it contains the ICAO 24-bit address of the aircraft being described in the TIS-B Message - depends on the value of the CF field, as described in 
Â§2.2.3.2.1.3.   
3. These requirements are consistent with the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, 
as well as the requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.14.4.1 (EUROCAE ED-73E, 
Â§3.18.4.1).   
The ADS-B transmitter **shall** declare a transmitter failure in the event that its own ICAO 24-
bit Address is all "ZEROs" or all "ONEs." 
Note: This requirement is consistent with the requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.10.3. 

## 2.2.3.2.1.6 "Me" Message, Extended Squitter

The "ME" field is a 56-bit field (Message bits 33 - 88) that occurs in every 1090 MHz Extended Squitter Message (that is, in the relevent messages specified in Figure 2-2).  The 
"ME" field carries the bulk of the data in ADS-B and TIS-B Messages. 

The first five bits of the "ME" field comprise the TYPE Code subfield.  For certain values of the TYPE Code subfield, the next three bits ("ME" bits 6 - 8) comprise a Subtype Code subfield.  The values in the TYPE subfield and, if present, the Subtype subfield, determine which of several ADS-B or TIS-B Messages is being conveyed in the remainder of the 
"ME" field.  The TYPE and Subtype subfields are described in Â§2.2.3.2.2. The "ME" field formats for the various ADS-B Messages are described in Â§2.2.3.2.3 
through Â§2.2.3.2.7 below.  The formats for the various TIS-B Messages are described in Â§2.2.17 and its subparagraphs. 

## 2.2.3.2.1.7 "Pi" Parity / Identity

The "PI" field is a 24-bit (Message bits 89 - 112) downlink field that contains the parity overlaid on the Code Label ("CL") and Interrogator Code ("IC") fields, that **shall** be in accordance with Â§2.2.14.4.30 and Â§2.2.18.2.1 of RTCA Document DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.18.4.27 and Â§3.22.2.1).   
Note:  In ADS-B and TIS-B Messages (those transmitted with downlink format DF=17, or with DF=18 and CF in the range from 0 to 6, or with DF=19 and AF=0) both CL=0 and IC=0.  In other words, in ADS-B and TIS-B Messages the parity is overlaid with a 24-bit pattern of ALL ZEROs.   

## 2.2.3.2.2 Determining Ads-B And Tis-B Message Types

All ADS-B and TIS-B transmissions have the baseline structure specified in Â§2.2.3.2.1.  The subfields of the "ME" field are defined for each of the ADS-B Message types in the following subparagraphs. In ADS-B and TIS-B Extended Squitter Messages, the TYPE Code subfield of the "ME" field occupies "ME" bits 1 - 5 (Message bits 33 - 37).  The Subtype field, if present for a particular message type, occupies "ME" bits 6 - 8 (Message bits 38 - 40).  The "TYPE 
Code" subfield, together with the "Subtype" subfield for some message types, is used to identify the ADS-B or TIS-B Message and to differentiate the messages into several message types.   
 is "Unknown."   
The format TYPE Code differentiates the 1090ES Messages into several classes: Airborne Position, Airborne Velocity, Surface Position, Identification and Category, Aircraft Intent, Aircraft Status, etc.  In addition, the format TYPE Code also encodes the Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) value of the source used for the position report.  The NIC value is used to allow surveillance applications to determine whether the reported geometric position has an acceptable level of integrity containment region for the intended use.  The NIC integrity containment region is described horizontally using the Radius of Containment 
(RC).  The format TYPE Code also differentiates the Airborne Messages as to the type of their altitude measurements: barometric pressure altitude or GNSS height (HAE).  The 5-bit encoding for the format TYPE Code and NIC values conforms to the definition contained in Table 2-14.  If an update has not been received from an on-board data source to allow for the determination of the NIC value within the past 2 seconds, then the NIC value is encoded to indicate that RC
For ADS-B Messages (those for which DF=17, or DF=18 and CF=0, 1 or 6, or DF=19 and AF=0), the possible Message Types are those listed in Table 2-12.  ADS-R Messages are ADS-B Messages from an alternate data link that are rebroadcast by ground equipment with DF=18 and CF=6, and uses the same 1090ES TYPE Codes and Message formats as are defined for DF=17 ADS-B Messages, with the exception of bits modified as identified in section Â§2.2.18.  In Table 2-12, the word "*Reserved*" indicates ADS-B Message Types for which ADS-B Message formats have not yet been defined, but which may be defined in future versions of these MOPS.  The TYPE Code, together with the Subtype Code (if present for a given TYPE Code value), identifies the TYPE of ADS-B Message being broadcast, in accordance with Table 2-12. 

Note: ADS-B Receiving Subsystems should not generate ADS-B Reports based on the receipt of ADS-B Message Types that are indicated as "**Reserved**" in Table 2-12.

In the case of ADS-B Airborne Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.3), the Message TYPE Code subfield (Â§2.2.3.2.2) is also used in the following ways: 

a. The TYPE Code subfield indicates the altitude type (barometric pressure altitude, 
Â§2.2.3.2.3.4.1, or geometric altitude, Â§2.2.3.2.3.4.2) being communicated in the 
Airborne Position Message. 
b. Together with the NIC Supplement-A subfield (described in conjunction with the 
Aircraft Operational Status Message, Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6), and the NIC Supplement-B 
subfield (described in conjunction with the Airborne Position Messages, Â§2.2.3.2.3.3), the TYPE Code subfield allows the encoding of the Navigation 
Integrity Category (NIC) (see Table 2-69).   
For Surface Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.4), the TYPE Code subfield, together with the NIC 
Supplement-A subfield (described in conjunction with the Aircraft Operational Status Message, Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6), and the NIC Supplement-C subfield (described in conjunction with the Aircraft Operational Status Message in surface format Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.3.10), allows the encoding of the NIC - but not altitude type, since altitude is not reported in Surface Position Messages.   
Detailed definition of the "TYPE" Code subfield encodings that **shall** be used for all ADS-B 
Airborne Position and Surface Position Messages are provided in Table 2-14.  For Airborne Position Messages and Surface Position Messages, Table 2-14 also shows how the NIC 
value can be determined from the value of the TYPE Code subfield and the NIC 
Supplement-A, NIC Supplement-B and NIC Supplement-C subfields in the Airborne Position and Operational Status Messages. 

The ADS-B Airborne Position Messages **shall** use only "TYPE" Code values 0, 9 through 
18, and TYPE Codes 20 through 22 as indicated in Table 2-14.

## Notes For Table 2-14:

1. "Baro Altitude" means barometric pressure altitude, relative to a standard pressure of 1013.25 millibars (29.92 in.Hg.).  It does not mean 
baro corrected altitude. 
2. TYPE codes 20 to 22 or TYPE Code 0 are to be used when valid "Baro Altitude" is not available. 
3. After initialization, when horizontal position information is not available but altitude information is available, the Airborne Position Message 
is transmitted with a TYPE Code of ZERO in bits 1-5, the barometric pressure altitude in bits 9 - 20, and bits 22 - 56 set to ZERO (0).  If 
neither horizontal position nor barometric altitude information is available, then all 56 bits of Register 0516
 are set to zero.  The ZERO (0) 
TYPE Code field indicates that latitude and longitude information is not available, while the Zero altitude field indicates that altitude information is not available.  (See Appendix A). 
4. If the position source is an ARINC 743A GNSS receiver, then the ARINC 429 data "Label 130" data word from that receiver is a suitable 
source of information for R
C
, the horizontal integrity containment radius.  (The Label 130 data word is variously called HPL (Horizontal 
Protection Limit) or HIL (Autonomous Horizontal Integrity Limit) in different documents.   
5. The "NIC Supplement-A" in the Aircraft Operational Status Message (Â§
2.2.3.2.7.2.6) enables the Report Assembly Function in ADS-B 
Receiving Subsystem to determine whether the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is announcing NIC=8 (RC < 0.1 NM) or NIC=9 (RC < 75 m). 
 < 4 NM). 
6. The "NIC Supplement-B" field in the Airborne Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.3.3), and NIC Supplement-A in the Aircraft Operational Status 
Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6) enables the Report Assembly Function in ADS-B Receiving Subsystem to determine whether the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem is announcing NIC=2 (RC < 8 NM) or NIC=3 (RC

The "NIC Supplement-B" field in the Airborne Position Message (Â§
 < 0.6 NM.  
2.2.3.2.3.3) and the "NIC Supplement-A" in the Aircraft Operational 
Status Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6) enables the Report Assembly Function in ADS-B Receiving Subsystem to determine whether the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem is announcing RC < 0.3 NM, or RC < 0.5 NM or RC

Function in ADS-B Receiving Subsystem to determine whether the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is announcing NIC=7 with either (RC < 0.2 
NM) or  NIC=6 (RC < 0.3 NM) or  NIC=6 with (RC < 0.6 NM) or NIC=0 with (RC
9. Future versions of these MOPS may limit transmission of Surface Position Messages at lower NIC and/or NAC

 values for Transponder-
Based systems. 

## 2.2.3.2.3.1.1 Airborne Position Message Type Code If Radius Of Containment Is Available Notes:

), is ARINC 429 label 130 from that GNSS receiver. 

1. If the position information comes from a GNSS receiver that conforms to the ARINC 
743A characteristic, a suitable source of information for the radius of containment 
(RC
2. Although these requirements do not require HPL limiting, it is expected that some 
regulators will only accept installations that limit HPL.  This may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.   
If Radius of Containment (RC
) information is available from the navigation data source, then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** determine the TYPE Code (the value of the TYPE Code subfield) of Airborne Position Messages as follows. 

2.2.3.2.3.1.3.2 below. 

a. If current valid horizontal position information is not available to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem, then the TYPE Code subfield of Airborne Position 
Messages **shall** be set to ZERO (0) as described in Â§
b. If valid horizontal position and barometric pressure altitude information are both 
available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, then the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem **shall** set the TYPE Code subfield of Airborne Position Messages to a 
value in the range from 9 to 18 in accordance with Table 2-14. 
c. If valid horizontal position information is available to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem, but valid barometric pressure altitude information is not available, and 
valid geometric altitude information is available, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem 
shall set the TYPE Code subfield of Airborne Position Messages to a value in the 
range from 20 to 22 depending on the radius of containment RC in accordance with 
Table 2-14. 
d. If valid horizontal position information is available to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem, but neither valid barometric altitude information nor valid geometric 
altitude information is available, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** set the 
TYPE Code subfield in Airborne Position Messages to a value in the range from 9 to 
18 depending on the radius of containment RC in accordance with Table 2-14.  (In 
that case, the ALTITUDE subfield of the Airborne Position Messages would be set to 
ALL ZEROs in accordance with Â§2.2.3.2.3.4.3 below, in order to indicate that valid 
altitude information is not available.) 

## 2.2.3.2.3.1.2 Airborne Position Message Type Code If Radius Of Containment Is Not Available

If RC
 (radius of containment) information is NOT available from the navigation data source, then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** indicate NIC=0 by selecting a TYPE Code of 0, 18, or 22 in the Airborne Position Messages, as follows: 

a. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** set the TYPE Code subfield to ZERO (0) 
if valid horizontal position information is not available, as described in 
Â§
2.2.3.2.3.1.3.2 below.   
b. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** set the TYPE Code subfield to 18 if valid 
pressure altitude information is available, or if neither valid pressure altitude nor 
valid geometric altitude information is available.   
If valid pressure altitude *is not* available, but valid geometric altitude information is available, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** set the TYPE Code subfield to 22. 

## 2.2.3.2.3.1.3 Special Processing For Type Code Equal To Zero 2.2.3.2.3.1.3.1 Significance Of Type Code Equal To Zero

As shown in Table 2-14, TYPE Code equal to ZERO (0) is labeled "No Position Information."  This type of message is intended to be used when horizontal position information is not available or is invalid, and still permit the reporting of barometric altitude, when it is available and valid.  As such, the principal use of this message case is to provide TCAS the ability to passively receive altitude information. 

Airborne Position Messages may be transmitted with a TYPE Code of ZERO (0) under the following condition:   
An Airborne Position Message with a TYPE Code of ZERO (0) **shall** set all 56 bits of the 
"ME" field bits to ZERO (0) if NO barometric pressure Altitude data is available.  If valid pressure Altitude data is available, then the "Altitude" subfield, "ME" bits 9 - 20, Message bits 41 - 52, **shall** report the altitude in accordance with Â§2.2.3.2.3.4.3. 

Note: Special processing is required for Airborne Position Messages because a CPR 
encoded value of ALL ZEROs in the latitude and longitude field is considered to be a valid encoding.   

## 2.2.3.2.3.1.3.2 Broadcast Of Type Code Equal To Zero

The TYPE Code Equal to ZERO message may be required as a consequence of the following events:   

a. An ADS-B Airborne Position or Surface Position Message register has not been 
loaded with data in the last 2 seconds.  In this case, the ADS-B Message register 
shall be cleared (i.e., all 56 bits set to ZERO) once it has timed out.  Transmission of the ADS-B Message that broadcasts the contents of the register **shall** be terminated if 
the ADS-B Message register has not been loaded in 60 seconds, except that transmission termination of Surface Position Messages does not apply to Non-
Transponder-Based Devices on aircraft that are on the surface, on surface vehicles, or if barometric altitude information is available.  Broadcast of the ADS-B Airborne 
Position or Surface Position Message **shall** resume once data has been loaded into the 
ADS-B Message register. 
b. The data management function responsible for loading the ADS-B Message registers 
determines that all navigation sources that can be used for the Airborne or Surface Position Message are either missing or invalid.  In this case the data management 
function **shall** clear (set all data fields to ALL ZEROs) the TYPE Code and all other 
fields of the Airborne or Surface Position Message and insert the ZEROed message into the appropriate ADS-B Message register.  This should only be done once in 
support of the detection of the loss of data insertion and **shall** result in the suppression of the broadcast of the related ADS-B Message. 

c. Note that in all of the cases discussed above, a TYPE Code of ZERO infers a 
message of ALL ZEROs.  The only exception is that the Airborne Position Message 
format **shall** contain barometric altitude code as set by the transponder when so 
implemented.  There is no analogous case for the other Extended Squitter Message Types, since a ZERO value in any of the fields indicates that no valid information is available. 

## 2.2.3.2.3.1.4 Type Code Based On Horizontal Position And Altitude Data

a. If valid horizontal position information is available, and valid pressure altitude 
information is available, then the "TYPE" Code in the Airborne Position Message 
shall be set in the range from "9" to "18."   
b. If valid horizontal position information is available, valid pressure altitude is NOT 
available, and GNSS Height Above the Ellipsoid (HAE) data is available, then the 
"TYPE" Code in the Airborne Position Message **shall** be set in the range from "20" 
to "22." 
c. If valid horizontal position information is available, but neither valid pressure altitude 
information nor valid GNSS Height Above Ellipsoid (HAE) information is available, 
then the "TYPE Code in the Airborne Position Message **shall** be set in the range from 
"9" to "18." 
d. In all three cases, "a," "b," and "c" above, the "TYPE" Coding **shall** be selected in 
accordance with the Radius of Containment (RC) given in Table 2-14. 

## 2.2.3.2.3.1.5 Type Code Based On Fault Detection And Exclusion (Fde) Conditions While Airborne

Under normal operating conditions, the RC
 can be directly determined from Horizontal Protection Limit (HPL) or Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL) inputs to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem from the GPS/GNSS receiver.  However, there are times when the Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) function of the GPS/GNSS receiver has detected a satellite failure but has not excluded the satellite from the navigation data solution.  For the purposes of these MOPS, the condition just described will be referred to as an "FDE Fault" which is typically annunciated by the GPS/GNSS receiver by an appropriate method.  For example, ARINC 743A compliant GPS/GNSS receivers will set Label "130" bit "11" to ONE (1) to indicate the "FDE Fault."  If an "FDE Fault" does not exist, then bit "11" is set to ZERO (0).  Of importance is the situation that even though an "FDE Fault" indication has been set, the GPS/GNSS typically continues to provide HPL or HIL data as well as Latitude, Longitude, and Velocity data while continuing to declare them to be valid on the interface.  As the "FDE Fault" condition represents a condition where the position and accuracy data cannot be guaranteed by the GPS/GNSS receiver, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** apply the following process upon detection of the "FDE Fault" annunciation:   

Note 1: 
If position sources can be demonstrated to overcome this degraded state of integrity when the "FDE Fault" condition occurs, then the following requirements do not apply. 
 is UNKNOWN. 
a. The "TYPE" Code of Airborne Position Messages **shall** be set to either "18" or "22," 
whichever is applicable in order to indicate that RC
Note 2: 
The "TYPE" Code is not required to be set to ZERO (0), as to do so would 
indicate that there is NO Position Data which will result in the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem declaring an ADS-B Function Failure (see Â§
2.2.11.6). 
b. Valid Latitude and Longitude Position data **shall** continue to be processed and 
reported in the Airborne Position Message as required. 
c. The NIC Supplement-B subfield in the Airborne Position Message **shall** be set to 
ZERO (0) in accordance with Table 2-69 for a NIC Value of ZERO (0) when 
"TYPE" Code is set to either "18" or "22."   
d. The NIC Supplement-A subfield in the Airborne Aircraft Operational Status Message 
(TYPE=31, Subtype=0) **shall** be set to ZERO (0) in accordance with Table 2-69 for a 
NIC Value of ZERO (0) when "TYPE" code is set to either "18" or "22."   
e. The NACP subfield in the Aircraft Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, 
Subtype=0) **shall** be set to ZERO (0) in accordance with Table 2-70 in order to 
specify that the accuracy is UNKNOWN.   
f. 
The NACV
 subfield in the Airborne Velocity Message (TYPE=19) **shall** be set to 
ZERO (0) in accordance with Â§
 and Table 2-22.    
2.2.3.2.6.1.5
Note 3: 
Factors such as surface multi-path have been observed to cause intermittent 
annunciation of "FDE Faults" by the GPS/GNSS receiver.  Such occurrences will result in the intermittent settings of the subfields addressed in subparagraphs "a," "c" and "d" above.  These intermittent conditions should 
be taken into account by ADS-B and Air Traffic Services that are using the data provided by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems.    

## 2.2.3.2.3.2 "Surveillance Status" Subfield In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages

The "Surveillance Status" subfield is a 2-bit ("ME" bits 6 and 7, Message bits 38 and 39) 
field that **shall** be used to encode information from the aircraft's Mode-A transponder code as provided in Table 2-15.

The setting of the "Surveillance Status" is a transponder function and is appropriately specified in RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.18.2.7 & Â§2.2.23.1.8 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.23.1.6 
& Â§3.28.8).   
When not implemented in a Mode-S Transponder-Based system, the ADS-B function shall set the "Surveillance Status" subfield to ZERO.   

## 2.2.3.2.3.3 "Nic Supplement-B" Subfield In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages

The NIC Supplement-B subfield in the Airborne Position Message is a one-bit subfield 
("ME" bit 8, Message bit 40) that, together with the TYPE Code subfield, **shall** be used to encode the Radius of Containment (RC
) and the Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) 
of the transmitting ADS-B participant.  The NIC Supplement-A subfield is also broadcast in the Aircraft Operational Status Message (Â§
).   
2.2.3.2.7.2.6
Note: The Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) is reported so that surveillance applications may determine whether the reported geometric position has an acceptable level of integrity for the intended use.  See Â§2.1.2.12 of RTCA DO-
242A, the ADS-B MASPS, for a fuller description of the Navigation Integrity Category.  
If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for the determination of the NIC value within the past 2 seconds, then the NIC Supplement-B subfield **shall** be encoded to indicate the larger Radius of Containment (RC).   
Table 2-69 lists the possible NIC codes and the values of the TYPE Code subfield of the Airborne and Surface Position Messages, and of the NIC Supplement-A, NIC 
Supplement-B and NIC Supplement-C subfields that **shall** be used to encode those NIC 
codes in messages on the 1090 MHz ADS-B data link.   

## 2.2.3.2.3.4 "Altitude" Subfield In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages

The "Altitude" subfield is a 12-bit ("ME" bits 9 - 20, Message bits 41 - 52) field that shall contain the altitude of the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as provided in the following subparagraphs.  

## 2.2.3.2.3.4.1 "Barometric Altitude" In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages

Barometric Pressure Altitude relative to a standard pressure of 1013.25 millibars (29.92 
in.Hg.) **shall** be reported in the "Altitude" Subfield of Airborne Position Messages having "TYPE" Codes 9 through 18 (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.1 and Table 2-14) under the following condition: Barometric Pressure Altitude is selected for reporting via a control selection process and such Barometric Pressure Altitude data is valid. 

Note: "Barometric Pressure Altitude" specifically **DOES NOT** refer to "Barometric Corrected Altitude." 
Encoding of the Barometric Pressure Altitude data into the "Altitude" subfield **shall** be in accordance with Â§2.2.3.2.3.4.3.   

## 2.2.3.2.3.4.2 "Gnss Height Above The Ellipsoid (Hae)" In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages

GNSS Height Above the Ellipsoid (HAE) **shall** be reported in the "Altitude" Subfield of the Airborne Position Message having "TYPE" Codes 20 through 22 (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.1 
and Table 2-14) under the following condition:   
GNSS Height Above the Ellipsoid (HAE) is selected for reporting via a control selection process and such GNSS Height Above the Ellipsoid (HAE) data is valid. 

Encoding of the GNSS Height Above the Ellipsoid (HAE) data into the "Altitude" 
subfield **shall** be in accordance with Â§2.2.3.2.3.4.3.   
Note: GNSS height may be useful for integrity checking of altitude and in future ATC 
concepts.   

## 2.2.3.2.3.4.3 "Altitude Encoding" In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages

Altitude data **shall** be encoded into the "Altitude" subfield as follows: 

a. Bit 16 (i.e., Message bit 48) **shall** be designated as the "Q" bit.  "Q" equals ZERO 
(0) **shall** be used to indicate that the Altitude is reported in 100 foot increments as specified in paragraph "b" below.  "Q" equals ONE (1) **shall** be used to indicate that 
the altitude is reported in 25 foot increments as specified in paragraph "c" below. 
b. If "Q" is equal to ZERO (0), then the Altitude **shall** be coded in 100 foot increments 
by selection of pulses in accordance with ICAO ANNEX 10, Volume IV, fourth 
edition, July 2007, Appendix 1 to Chapter 3, (see RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.13.1.2.a.(2).(c)) (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.17.1.b.1.ii and 3.18.4.2).  The 
appropriate mapping for the sequence of pulses **shall** be as shown in Figure 2-4.

c. If "Q" is equal to ONE (1), then the Altitude **shall** be coded such that "ME" bits 9 - 
15, and 17 - 20 (Message bits 41 - 47, and 49 - 52) represent a binary-coded field 
whose least significant bit has a value of 25 feet.  The binary value of the decimal 
number "N" **shall** be used to report Pressure Altitudes in the range (25 * N - 1000 + 
12.5 feet). 
The most significant bit of this field is bit 9.  This code is able to provide code values only between -1000 feet and +50175 feet.  The coding used for Altitudes that are greater than 50175 feet **shall** conform to the coding principles described in paragraph 
"b" above. 

d. If altitude data is not available, then all bits of the Altitude subfield **shall** be set to 
ZERO.   

Note: These requirements are consistent with the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, 
       Volume IV, fourth edition, July 2007, Â§3.1.2.6.5.4, as well as with the 
       requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.13.1.2 (EUROCAE ED-73E, 
       Â§3.17.1.b).   

## 2.2.3.2.3.5 "Time" (T) Subfield In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages

The "TIME" (T) subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 21, Message bit 53) field that **shall** indicate whether or not the epoch of validity for the horizontal position data in an Airborne Position Message is an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch.  If the time of applicability of the position data is synchronized to an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch, the "TIME" (T) subfield shall be set to "1;" otherwise, the "TIME" (T) subfield **shall** be set to ZERO (0). 

## Notes:

1. An ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem that sets the "TIME" (T) subfield to ONE (1) 
must accept a GNSS TIME MARK input from the navigation data source in order to be able to update the position data from the navigation data source to an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch (See Â§2.2.5.1.6). 
2. An arithmetic description of the intended synchronization implementation is provided 
in the **"Commentary"** paragraphs provided in Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.2 for precision Latitude 
Position Extrapolation and in Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.2 for precision Longitude Position 
Extrapolation. 

## 2.2.3.2.3.6 "Cpr Format" (F) Subfield In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages

The "CPR Format" (F) subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 22, Message bit 54) field that **shall** be used to indicate which Compact Position Reporting (CPR) Format type ("**even**" or 
"odd") is used to encode the latitude and longitude data (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.7 and 
Â§2.2.3.2.3.8).  The bit **shall** be set to "ZERO" to indicate the "**even**" encoding of such data, or to "ONE" to indicate the "odd" encoding of such data. 

a. When "TIME" (T) = 0: 
The "CPR Format" (F) subfield functions ONLY to indicate the "**even**" or "odd" 
CPR encoding.  In this case, the CPR encoding type **shall** alternate between "**even**" 
and "odd," and the "CPR Format" (F) subfield **shall** alternate between ZERO (0) and ONE (1) respectively, each time the Airborne Position Message register is updated with new position data. 

Note: When the "TIME" (T) subfield is "ZERO," the Airborne Position Message 
register must be updated at least as frequently as every 200 milliseconds: however, it may be updated more frequently, for example, every 100 milliseconds, etc.  In such cases, the CPR encoding should alternate between 
"**even**" and "odd" each time that the register is updated with new position 
data. 
b. When "TIME" (T) = 1: 
The "CPR Format" (F) subfield functions to indicate the "**even**" or "odd" CPR 
encoding and also indicates whether the epoch of applicability of the position data is an "**even**" or "odd" 0.2 second UTC epoch.   

## Notes:

1. Although the Airborne Position Message register may be updated more 
frequently than five times per second, the "CPR Format" (F) subfield alternates between ZERO (0) and ONE (1) only as the epoch of applicability of the data 
being loaded into the register alternates between "**even**" and "odd" 0.2 second 
UTC epochs. 
2. An "even 0.2 second UTC epoch" is defined as that moment on the UTC time 
scale that occurs at an even number of 200-millisecond intervals after an exact even-numbered UTC second.  Likewise, an "odd 0.2 second UTC epoch" is defined as that moment on the UTC time scale that occurs at an odd number of 200 millisecond intervals after an even numbered UTC second.  Examples of even 0.2 second epochs are 12.0 seconds, 12.4 seconds, 12.8 seconds, 13.2 seconds, 13.6 seconds, etc.  Examples of odd 0.2 second epochs are 12.2 seconds, 12.6 seconds, 13.0 seconds, 13.4 seconds, 13.8 seconds, etc. 

## 2.2.3.2.3.7 "Cpr Encoded Latitude" Subfield In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages

The "CPR Encoded Latitude" subfield is a 17-bit ("ME" bits 23 - 39, Message bits 55 - 
71) field containing the CPR encoded latitude of the airborne position.   

## 2.2.3.2.3.7.1 Airborne Latitude Data Encoding

The airborne latitude position data **shall** be encoded in accordance with Â§A.1.4.2.2 and 
Â§A.1.7 of Appendix A.  

## 2.2.3.2.3.7.2 Gps/Gnss Time Mark Coupled Case ("Time" (T)="1")

If "TIME" (T) = 1 (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.5) in an Airborne Position Message, then the transmit time of applicability (see Appendix U) of the latitude field in that message **shall** be an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch.      

a. Specifically, the position data in the latitude field **shall** be extrapolated forward from 
the time of validity of the position fix to the transmit time of applicability of the 
Airborne Position Message.    
b. The Airborne latitude data registers and the encoded latitude subfield **shall** be 
updated every 200 milliseconds to the next 0.2 UTC Epoch using the velocity data 
provided for the position fix. 

## Notes:

1. The time of validity of the fix is provided with the fix data from the navigation data 
source and is indicated by the leading edge of the GNSS Time Mark (see Â§2.2.5.1.6).  
The transmit time of applicability of the position message is the exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch to which the transmitted position data is extrapolated.   
2. The latitude position registers and encoded latitude subfield should be updated at a 
time about 100 milliseconds before the time of applicability of the data being loaded into that register (see Â§2.2.5.2.1 and Appendix A, Â§A.1.4.2.3.1). 
3. One method of estimating the position to an exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch is 
described in the following "Commentary." 

## Commentary:

The following example provides one method (not the only method) that latitude given in the Airborne Position Message may be extrapolated from the time of validity of the fix (included with the fix from the navigation data source) to the time of applicability of the Airborne Position Message.  In the example, it is assumed that the "TIME" (T) subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.5) is "ONE," indicating that the time of applicability of the extrapolated position is an exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch.  See Appendix U for a discussion of timing.

The earth may be modeled as a sphere with radius such that one nautical mile equals one minute of arc along a great circle.  Using that approximation, yields: 

$\phi_{message}$$=$$\phi_{fix}$$+$$\Delta\phi$

$=$$\phi_{fix}$$+$$($$\nu_{NS}/60)(\Delta t/3600000)$

$=$$\phi_{fix}$$+$$($$\nu_{NS}$$\Delta t)/(2.16$$x$$10^{8})$
(We divide Î½
NS
 by 60 to convert from knots in the N-S direction to degrees of latitude per hour, and divide ât by 3600 x 1000 to convert from milliseconds to hours.) 
The result, Ï
message, is to be encoded in the latitude field of the Airborne Position Message using the CPR algorithm described in Appendix A, Â§A.1.7.

The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem provides position in the non-GNSS Time Mark coupled case ("TIME" (T)="0") that is understood by receiving systems to be  applicable at the time of reception rather than UTC synchronized points in time.  Therefore, in the non-GNSS Time Mark coupled case, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem attempts to provide the position data accurate to within a specified time tolerance of the time of transmission.  For such transmitted position data, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is not required to accept and process the GPS/GNSS Time Mark information. The true time of applicability of the Latitude information provided to the variable data input interface (Â§2.2.5.1.7) is unknown to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  The encoded latitude in a transmitted Airborne Position Message may be updated to a computed time of applicability through extrapolation or estimation within the accuracy criteria specified below based on the assumption that the time of applicability of the position data is the time that the data is received at the input interface.  Whatever means are implemented, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem must, at a minimum, update the position data to account for the delay between the time it arrived at the data interface and the time it is transmitted. The following represents the minimum performance requirement: 
The time of applicability to which the encoded latitude in an Airborne Position Message is computed **shall** be within 100 milliseconds of the time of transmission. 

## Notes:

1. It is not acceptable to compute the extrapolated position based on any assumption 
that the true time of applicability of the position provided at the input to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem is later than the time it arrives at the input.  Any delays between the data arriving at the input and being recognized by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem must either be accounted for by extrapolation or understood to comprise a portion of the 100 millisecond budget allowed by the requirements.  
2. It is acceptable to compute the extrapolated position based on an assumption that the 
true time of applicability of the position provided at the input to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem is earlier than the time it arrives at the input.  To accomplish this, a verifiable estimation of the delay between the true time of applicability of the position fix and the provision of that fix to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem's data interface is needed.  Such methods are beyond the minimum requirements and will 
need to be certified using appropriately modified test procedures.   
ADS-B Airborne Position Messages may implement estimation techniques such as alphabeta trackers or Kalman filters to satisfy the intent of the 100 millisecond position requirement.  Such techniques provide the capability to decouple the position computation from the message transmission timing provided that the timing of the sampled data and the output rate of the estimator are sufficient to satisfy the 100 millisecond requirement. An acceptable method of implementing the position computation is to perform the extrapolation directly to a pre-computed time of transmission.  However, Transponderbased systems must also meet the Ground-Initiated Comm-B (GICB) register update timing performance so that periodic update of position data registers is necessary.   
Note: Appendix A defines the formats and coding for Extended Squitter ADS-B 
Messages.  When Extended Squitter capability is incorporated into a Mode S 
transponder, the registers used to contain the Extended Squitter messages are part of the transponder's GICB service.  The Mode S ground interrogator can extract the information from any of these registers at any time and pass it to the ground-based application. In the case of Extended Squitter, the information in the registers defined for ADS-B are spontaneously broadcast as specified in RTCA DO-181E.  Periodic loading of data into Registers 0516 and 0616

                                                                                   for 
airborne and surface position data is necessary to meet the TOA timing 
requirements between GICB register data and Extended Squitter Position 
Messages.    

For Mode S Transponder-based Transmitting Subsystems, the position Register shall be 
reloaded with position data at intervals that are no more than 200 milliseconds apart.  The 
position being loaded into the Register shall have a time of applicability that is never 
more than 200 milliseconds different from any time during which the Register holds that 
data.   

## Commentary:

The following example provides one method (not the only method) that latitude given in the Airborne Position Message may be extrapolated from the time that the data arrives at the input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to the time of applicability of the position data at the time of transmission.  In the example, it is assumed that the "TIME" (T) subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.5) is "ZERO," indicating that the transmit time of applicability of the extrapolated position is the time of transmission.  No attempt is made to compensate for delays prior to the delivery of latitude data to the appropriate variable interface.  See Appendix U for a discussion of timing.

The earth may be modeled as a sphere with radius such that one nautical mile equals one minute of arc along a great circle.  Using that approximation, yields: 

$$\begin{array}{c c c}{{\phi_{m e s s a g e}}}&{{=}}&{{\phi_{f i x}+\Delta\phi}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\phi_{f i x}+(\,\nu_{N S}/60)(\,\Delta\,t\,\,/36000000)}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\phi_{f i x}+(\,\nu_{N S}\,\Delta t)\,/(2.16\,x\,10^{8})}}\end{array}$$
(We divide Î½NS
 by 60 to convert from knots in the N-S direction to degrees of latitude per hour, and divide ât by 3600 x 1000 to convert from milliseconds to hours.) 
The result, Ï
message
, is to be encoded in the latitude field of the Airborne Position Message using the CPR algorithm described in Appendix A, Â§A.1.7. 

## Notes:

1. The amount of compensation performed by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, 
ât, is required to differ from tmessage - tinterface
 by not more than 100 ms.  
Acceptable means for accomplishing this include appropriately updating the position registers at sufficient rates, or extrapolating directly to a pre-computed time of transmission 
2. In order not to introduce excessive error in the estimated latitude, Ï
message, the 
latency, tinterface - tfix
, in the delivery of PVT data from the navigation data source 
should not be excessive. 

## 2.2.3.2.3.7.4 Airborne Latitude Position Data Retention

In the event that the latitude position data is no longer available, the extrapolation or estimation of, and update of latitude data and fields specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.1 through 
Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.3 **shall** be limited to no more than two seconds. At the end of two seconds, the latitude data registers and the encoded latitude field **shall** 
be set to ALL ZEROs. 

## 2.2.3.2.3.8 "Cpr Encoded Longitude" Subfield In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages

The "CPR Encoded Longitude" subfield is a 17-bit ("ME" bits 40 - 56, Message bits 72 
- 88) field that **shall** contain the encoded longitude of the airborne position. 

## 2.2.3.2.3.8.1 Airborne Longitude Data Encoding

The airborne longitude position data **shall** be encoded in accordance with Â§A.1.4.2.2 and 
Â§A.1.7 of Appendix A.  

## 2.2.3.2.3.8.2 Gps/Gnss Time Mark Coupled Case ("Time" (T)="1")

If "TIME" (T) = 1 (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.5) in an Airborne Position Message, then the transmit time of applicability (see Appendix U) of the longitude field in that message **shall** be an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch. 

a. Specifically, the position data in the longitude field **shall** be extrapolated forward 
from the time of validity of the position fix to the transmit time of applicability of the Airborne Position Message.   
b. The Airborne longitude data registers and the encoded longitude subfield **shall** be 
updated every 200 milliseconds to the next 0.2 UTC Epoch using the velocity data 
provided for the position fix. 

## Notes:

1. The time of validity of the fix is provided with the fix data from the navigation data 
source and is indicated by the leading edge of the GNSS Time Mark (see Â§2.2.5.1.6). The transmit time of applicability of the position message is the exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch to which the transmitted  position data is extrapolated. 
2. The longitude position registers and encoded longitude subfield should be updated at 
a time about 100 milliseconds before the time of applicability of the data being loaded into that register (see Â§2.2.5.2.1 and Appendix A, Â§A.1.4.2.3.1). 
3. One method of estimating the position to an exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch is

The following example provides one method (not the only method) that longitude given in the Airborne Position Message may be extrapolated from the time of validity of the fix (included with the fix from the navigation data source) to the time of applicability of the Airborne Position Message.  In the example, it is assumed that the "TIME" subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.5) is "ONE," indicating that the time of applicability of the extrapolated position is an exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch.  See Appendix U for a discussion of timing.

The result, Î»

, is to be encoded in the longitude field of the Airborne Position Message using the CPR algorithm described in Appendix A, Â§A.1.7. 

## 2.2.3.2.3.8.3 Non-Gps/Gnss Time Mark Coupled Case ("Time" (T)="0")

The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem provides position in the non-GNSS Time Mark coupled case ("TIME" (T)="0") that is understood by receiving systems to be applicable at the time of reception rather than UTC synchronized points in time.  Therefore, in the non-GNSS Time Mark coupled case, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem attempts to provide the position data accurate to within a specified time tolerance of the time of transmission.  For such transmitted position data, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is not required to accept and process the GPS/GNSS Time Mark information. 

The true time of applicability of the Longitude information provided to the variable data input interface (Â§2.2.5.1.8) is unknown to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  The encoded longitude in a transmitted Airborne Position Message may be updated to a computed time of applicability through extrapolation or estimation within the accuracy criteria specified below based on the assumption that the time of applicability of the position data is the time that the data is received at the input interface.  Whatever means are implemented, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem must, at a minimum, update the position data to account for the delay between the time it arrived at the data interface and the time it is transmitted. The following represents the minimum performance requirement: 
The time of applicability to which the encoded longitude in an Airborne Position Message is computed **shall** be within 100 milliseconds of the time of transmission.   

## Notes:

1. It is not acceptable to compute the extrapolated position based on any assumption 
that the true time of applicability of the position provided at the input to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem is later than the time it arrives at the input.  Any delays between the data arriving at the input and being recognized by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem must either be accounted for by extrapolation or understood to comprise a portion of the 100 millisecond budget allowed by the requirements.  
2. It is acceptable to compute the extrapolated position based on an assumption that the 
true time of applicability of the position provided at the input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is earlier than the time it arrives at the input.  To accomplish this, a verifiable estimation of the delay between the true time of applicability of the position fix and the provision of that fix to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem's data interface is needed.  Such methods are beyond the minimum requirements and will 
need to be certified using appropriately modified test procedures.   
ADS-B Airborne Position Messages may implement estimation techniques such as alphabeta trackers or Kalman filters to satisfy the intent of the 100 millisecond position requirement.  Such techniques provide the capability to decouple the position computation from the message transmission timing provided that the timing of the sampled data and the output rate of the estimator are sufficient to satisfy the 100 
millisecond requirement. An acceptable method of implementing the position computation is to perform the extrapolation directly to a pre-computed time of transmission.  However, Transponderbased systems must also meet the Ground-Initiated Comm-B (GICB) register update timing performance so that periodic update of position data registers is necessary.   
Note: Appendix A defines the formats and coding for Extended Squitter ADS-B 
Messages.  When Extended Squitter capability is incorporated into a Mode S transponder, the registers used to contain the Extended Squitter messages are part of the transponder's GICB service.  The Mode S ground interrogator can extract the information from any of these registers at any time and pass it to the ground-based application.  In the case of Extended Squitter, the information in the registers defined for ADS-B are spontaneously broadcast as specified in RTCA DO-181E.  Periodic loading of data into Registers 0516 and 0616

                                                                                   for 
airborne and surface position data is necessary to meet the TOA timing 
requirements between GICB register data and Extended Squitter Position 
Messages.   

For Mode S Transponder-based Transmitting Subsystems, the position Register **shall** be reloaded with position data at intervals that are no more than 200 milliseconds apart.  The position being loaded into the Register **shall** have a time of applicability that is never more than 200 milliseconds different from any time during which the register holds that data.   

## Commentary:

The following example provides one method (not the only method) that longitude given in the Airborne Position Message may be extrapolated from the time that the data arrives at the input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to the time of applicability of the position data at the time of transmission.  In the example, it is assumed that the "TIME" (T) subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.5) is "ZERO," indicating that the transmit time of applicability of the extrapolated position is the time of transmission.  No attempt is made to compensate for delays prior to the delivery of longitude data to the appropriate variable interface.

 by 60 cos (Ï) to convert from knots in the E-W direction to degrees of longitude per hour, and divide ât by 3600 x 1000 to convert from milliseconds to hours.) 
The result, Î»
message
, is to be encoded in the longitude field of the Airborne Position Message using the CPR algorithm described in Appendix A, Â§A.1.7. 

## Notes:

1. The amount of compensation performed by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, 
ât, is required to differ from tmessage - tinterface
 by not more than 100 ms.  
Acceptable means for accomplishing this include appropriately updating the position registers at sufficient rates, or extrapolating directly to a pre-computed time of transmission.   
2. In order not to introduce excessive error in the estimated longitude, Î»
message, the 
latency, tinterface - tfix
, in the delivery of PVT data from the navigation data source 
should not be excessive.   

## 2.2.3.2.3.8.4 Airborne Longitude Position Data Retention

The extrapolation or estimation, and update of longitude data and fields specified in 
Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.1 through Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.3 **shall** be limited to no more than two seconds, in the event that the longitude position data is no longer available. At the end of two seconds, the longitude data registers and the encoded longitude field shall be set to ALL ZEROs.

## 2.2.3.2.4.1 "Type" Code Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages

The "TYPE" Code subfield was previously specified for the Airborne Position Message in Â§2.2.3.2.3.1 and remains the same for the ADS-B Surface Position Message, which shall use TYPE Codes 5, 6, 7 and 8 only.   
Detailed definition of the "TYPE" Code subfield encodings that **shall** be used for all ADS-B Messages are provided in Table 2-14.   

## 2.2.3.2.4.1.1 Surface Position Message Type Code If Radius Of Containment Is Available

If RC (horizontal radius of containment) information is available from the navigation data source, then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** use RC to determine the TYPE 
Code used in the Surface Position Message in accordance with Table 2-14. 

Notes: 
), is ARINC 429 label 130 from that GNSS receiver.   

1. If the position information comes from a GNSS receiver that conforms to the ARINC 
743A characteristic, a suitable source of information for the radius of containment 
(RC
2. Although these requirements do not require HPL limiting, it is expected that some 
regulators will only accept installations that limit HPL.  This may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.   

## 2.2.3.2.4.1.2 Surface Position Message Type Code If Radius Of Containment Is Not Available

If RC
 (horizontal radius of containment) information is NOT available from the navigation data source, then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** indicate NIC=0 by selecting a TYPE Code of 0 or 8 in the Surface Position Messages, as follows: 
2.2.3.2.3.1.3.2 above. 

a. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** set the TYPE Code subfield to ZERO if 
valid horizontal position information is NOT available, as described in 
Â§
b. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** set the TYPE Code subfield to 8, the NIC 
Supplement-A to ZERO (0) and NIC Supplement-C to ZERO (0) if valid horizontal position information IS available.  (This TYPE Code together with the NIC Supplement-A set equal to ZERO (0) and NIC Supplement-C set equal to ZERO (0) 
indicates that the radius of containment, RC
, is either unknown or greater than or 
equal to 0.6 NM.)   

## 2.2.3.2.4.1.3 Special Processing For Type Code Equal To Zero 2.2.3.2.4.1.3.1 Significance Of Type Code Equal To Zero

As shown in Table 2-14, TYPE Code equal to ZERO (0) is labeled "No Position Information."  This type of message is intended to be used when the latitude and/or longitude information is not available, or is invalid. 

A Surface Position Message with a TYPE Code equal to ZERO (0) **shall** have all 56 bits of the "ME" field set to ZERO. Special processing is required for Surface Position Messages because a CPR encoded value of ALL ZEROs in the latitude and longitude field is considered to be a valid encoding. 

## 2.2.3.2.4.1.3.2 Broadcast Of Type Code Equal To Zero

The requirements provided in Â§2.2.3.2.3.1.3.2 apply equally to the ADS-B Surface Position Message except that subparagraph "c" is modified to read as follows: 
c. Note that in all of the cases, a TYPE Code equal to ZERO infers a message of ALL ZEROs. 

## 2.2.3.2.4.1.4 Type Code Based On Horizontal Protection Level

a. If valid horizontal position information is available, then the "TYPE" Code in the 
Surface Position Message **shall** be set in the range from "5" to "8." 
b. If RC (Horizontal Radius of Containment) information is available from the 
navigation data source, the "TYPE" Coding **shall** be selected according to the RC 
value, in accordance with Table 2-14. 
c. If RC is not available from the navigation data source, then the "TYPE" Code **shall** 
be set to 8, and NIC Supplement-A and NIC Supplement-C set to ZERO (0).   

## 2.2.3.2.4.1.5 Type Code Based On Fault Detection And Exclusion (Fde) Conditions While On The Surface

Under normal operating conditions, the RC
 can be directly determined from Horizontal Protection Limit (HPL) or Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL) inputs to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem from the GPS/GNSS receiver.  However, there are times when the Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) function of the GPS/GNSS receiver has detected a satellite failure but has not excluded the satellite from the navigation data solution.  For the purposes of these MOPS, the condition just described will be referred to as an "FDE Fault" which is typically annunciated by the GPS/GNSS receiver by an appropriate method.  For example, ARINC 743A compliant GPS/GNSS receivers will set Label "130" bit "11" to ONE (1) to indicate the "FDE Fault."  If an "FDE Fault" does not exist, then bit "11" is set to ZERO (0).  Of importance is the situation that even though an "FDE Fault" indication has been set, the GPS/GNSS typically continues to provide HPL or HIL data as well as Latitude, Longitude, and Velocity data while continuing to declare them to be valid on the interface.  As the "FDE Fault" condition represents a condition where the position and accuracy data cannot be guaranteed by the GPS/GNSS receiver, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** apply the following process upon detection of the "FDE Fault" annunciation: 

Note 1: 
If position sources can be demonstrated to overcome this degraded state of integrity when the "FDE Fault" condition occurs, then the following requirements do not apply.    
 is UNKNOWN.   

a. The "TYPE" Code of Surface Position Messages **shall** be set to "8" in order to 
indicate that RC
Note 2: 
The "TYPE" Code is not required to be set to ZERO (0), as to do so would indicate that there is NO Position Data which will result in the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem declaring an ADS-B Function Failure (see Â§
2.2.11.6).   
b. Valid Latitude and Longitude Position data **shall** continue to be processed and 
reported in the Surface Position Message as required. 
c. The NIC Supplement-A and NIC Supplement-C subfields in the Surface Aircraft 
Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, Subtype=1) **shall** be set to ZERO (0) in 
accordance with Table 2-69 for a NIC Value of ZERO (0) when "TYPE" Code is set 
to "8."   
d. The NACP subfield in the Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, 
Subtype=1) **shall** be set to ZERO (0) in accordance with Table 2-70 in order to 
specify that the accuracy is UNKNOWN.   
e. The NACV
2.2.3.2.7.2.3.8
 CC subfield in the Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message 
(TYPE=31, Subtype=1) **shall** be set to ZERO (0) in accordance with Â§
 
and Table 2-22. 
Note 3: 
Factors such as surface multi-path have been observed to cause intermittent 
annunciation of "FDE Faults" by the GPS/GNSS receiver.  Such occurrences will result in the intermittent settings of the subfields addressed in subparagraphs "a," "c" and "d" above.  These intermittent conditions should be taken into account by ADS-B and Air Traffic Services that are using the data provided by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems. 

## 2.2.3.2.4.2 "Movement" Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages

The "Movement " subfield is a 7-bit ("ME" bits 6 - 12, Message bits 38 - 44) field that shall be used to encode information regarding the status of "Movement" of the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem in accordance with the coding provided in Table 2-16.

## Notes:

1. The data encoding represented in Table 2-16 represents a non-linear encoding:  
therefore, encoding is performed exactly as specified in Table 2-16.    

2. The last three movement encodings (125, 126, 127) are reserved to indicate high 
levels of ground speed change, etc.  The precedence of the codes is not defined yet as inputs that would be required are not currently available. 
3. The "Aircraft Stopped" encoding is selected when the "Low" broadcast rate is 
selected (see Â§2.2.5.1.9.b) based on the criteria defined in Â§2.2.3.3.2.3.c.   

## 2.2.3.2.4.3 "Status Bit For Heading/Ground Track" Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages

The "Status Bit for Heading/Ground Track" subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 13, Message bit 
45) field that **shall** be used to indicate the validity of the Heading or Ground Track as specified in Table 2-17. 

|   Coding  | Meaning                                |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
|        0  | Heading/Ground Track data is NOT VALID |
|        1  | Heading/Ground Track data is VALID     |

Note: If a source of A/V Heading **is not** available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, but a source of Ground Track angle is available, then Ground Track angle may be used instead of Heading, provided that the "Status Bit for Heading/Ground Track" subfield is set to ZERO whenever the Ground Track angle is not a reliable indication of the A/V's heading.  (The Ground Track angle is not a reliable indication of the A/V's heading when the A/V's ground speed is close to ZERO.  Some regulators have already established such limits.  These limits may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.)   

## 2.2.3.2.4.4 "Heading/Ground Track" Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages

The "Heading/Ground Track" Subfield is a 7-bit ("ME" bits 14 - 20, Message bits 46 - 
52) field that **shall** be used to report the Heading, or motion of the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, Clockwise from North (i.e., Heading Sign Bit = 0).  Encoding of the 
"Heading/Ground Track" Subfield is specified in Table 2-18.

## Notes:

1. The encoding shown in the table represents an Angular Weighted Binary encoding in 
degrees clockwise from True or Magnetic North.  The MSB represents a bit weighting of 180 degrees, while the LSB represents a bit weighting of 360/128 degrees.  
2. Raw data used to establish the Heading or Ground Track subfield will normally have 
more resolution (i.e., more bits) than that required by the Heading/Ground Track Subfield.  When converting such data to the Heading/Ground Track Subfield, the accuracy of the data must be maintained such that it is not worse than Â±Â½ LSB where the LSB is the weight of the least significant bit of the Heading subfield. 
3. The reference direction for Heading (whether True North or Magnetic North) is 
indicated in the Horizontal Reference Direction (HRD) field of the Aircraft Operational Status Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.13). 

## 2.2.3.2.4.5 "Time" (T) Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages

The "TIME" (T) subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 21, Message bit 53) field that **shall** be used to indicate whether or not the epoch of validity for the horizontal position data in a Surface Position Message is an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch.  If the time of applicability of the position data is synchronized to an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch, the "TIME" (T) 
subfield **shall** be set to ONE (1); otherwise, the "TIME" (T) subfield **shall** be set to ZERO (0).   

## Notes:

1. An ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem that sets the "TIME" (T) subfield to ONE (1) 
must accept a GNSS TIME MARK input from the navigation data source in order to be able to update the position data from the navigation data source to an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch (see Â§2.2.5.1.6). 
2. An arithmetic description of the intended synchronization implementation is provided 
in the "Commentary" paragraphs provided in Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.2 for precision Latitude 
Position Extrapolation and in Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.2 for precision Longitude Position 
Extrapolation. 

## 2.2.3.2.4.6 "Cpr Format" (F) Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages

The "CPR Format" (F) subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 22, Message bit 54) field that **shall** 
be used to indicate which Compact Position Reporting (CPR) format type ("**even**" or 
"odd") is used to encode the latitude and longitude data (see Â§2.2.3.2.4.7 and 
Â§2.2.3.2.4.8).  The bit **shall** be set to "ZERO" to indicate the "**even**" encoding of such data, or to "ONE" to indicate the "odd" encoding of such data. 

a. When "TIME" (T) = 0: 
The "CPR Format" (F) subfield functions ONLY to indicate the "**even**" or "odd" 
CPR encoding.  In this case, the CPR encoding type **shall** alternate between "**even**" 
and "odd," and the "CPR Format" (F)" subfield **shall** alternate between ZERO (0) 
and ONE (1) respectively, each time the Surface Position Message register is updated with new position data. 

Note: When the "TIME" (T) subfield is "ZERO," the Surface Position Message 
       register must be updated at least as frequently as every 200 milliseconds:  
       however, it may be updated more frequently, for example, every 100 
       milliseconds, etc.  In such cases, the CPR encoding should alternate between 
       "even" and "odd" each time that the register is updated with new position 
       data. 

b. When "TIME" (T) = 1: 
The "CPR Format" (F) subfield functions to indicate the "**even**" or "odd" CPR 
encoding and also indicates whether the epoch of applicability of the position data is an "**even**" or "odd" 0.2 second UTC epoch.  

## Notes:

1. Although the Surface Position Message register may be updated more frequently 
than five times per second, when T=1, the "CPR Format" (F) subfield alternates between ZERO (0) and ONE (1) only as the epoch of applicability of the data being 
loaded into the register alternates between "**even**" and "odd" 0.2 second UTC 
epochs. 
2. An "even 0.2 second UTC epoch" is defined as that moment on the UTC time scale 
that occurs at an even number of 200-millisecond intervals after an exact evennumbered UTC second.  Likewise, an "odd 0.2 second UTC epoch" is defined as that 
moment on the UTC time scale that occurs at an odd number of 200 millisecond intervals after an even numbered UTC second.  Examples of even 0.2 second epochs are 12.0 seconds, 12.4 seconds, 12.8 seconds, 13.2 seconds, 13.6 seconds, etc.  
Examples of odd 0.2 second epochs are 12.2 seconds, 12.6 seconds, 13.0 seconds, 13.4 seconds, 13.8 seconds, etc. 

## 2.2.3.2.4.7 "Cpr Encoded Latitude" Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages

The "CPR Encoded Latitude" subfield is a 17-bit ("ME" bits 23 - 39, Message bits 55 - 
71) field that **shall** contain the encoded latitude of the Surface position.  

## 2.2.3.2.4.7.1 Surface Latitude Data Encoding

The surface latitude position data **shall** be encoded in accordance with Â§A.1.4.2.2 and 
Â§A.1.7 of Appendix A.  

## 2.2.3.2.4.7.2 Gps/Gnss Time Mark Coupled Case ("Time" (T)="1")

If "TIME" (T) = 1 (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.5) in a Surface Position Message, then the transmit time of applicability (see Appendix U) of the latitude field in that message **shall** be an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch.   

a. Specifically, the position data in the latitude field **shall** be extrapolated forward from 
the time of validity of the position fix to the transmit time of applicability of the 
Surface Position Message. 
b. The Surface latitude data registers and the encoded latitude subfield **shall** be updated 
every 200 milliseconds to the next 0.2 UTC Epoch using the velocity data provided for the position fix.   

## Notes:

1. The time of validity of the fix is provided with the fix data from the navigation 
data source and is indicated by the leading edge of the GNSS Time Mark (see Â§2.2.5.1.6).  The transmit time of applicability of the position message is the exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch to which the transmitted position data is 
extrapolated. 
2. The latitude position registers and encoded latitude subfield should be updated 
at a time about 100 milliseconds before the time of applicability of the data being loaded into that register (see Â§2.2.5.2.2 and Appendix A, Â§A.1.4.2.3.1). 
3. One method of estimating the position to an exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch is 
described in the following "Commentary." 

## Commentary:

The following example provides one method (not the only method) that latitude given in the Surface Position Message may be extrapolated from the time of validity of the fix (included with the fix from the navigation data source) to the time of applicability of the Surface Position Message.  In the example, it is assumed that the "TIME" (T) subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.4.5) is "ONE," indicating that the time of applicability of the extrapolated position is an exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch.  See Appendix U for a discussion of timing.

The earth may be modeled as a sphere with radius such that one nautical mile equals one minute of arc along a great circle.  Using that approximation, yields:

(We divide Î½

 by 60 to convert from knots in the N-S direction to degrees of latitude per hour, and divide ât by 3600 x 1000 to convert from milliseconds to hours.) 
The result, Ï

, is to be encoded in the latitude field of the Surface Position Message using the CPR algorithm described in Appendix A, Â§A.1.7. 

2.2.3.2.4.7.3 
Non-GPS/GNSS Time Mark Coupled Case ("TIME" (T) = "0") 
The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem provides position in the non-GNSS Time Mark coupled case ("TIME" (T)="0") that is understood by ADS-B Receiving Subsystems to be applicable at the time of reception rather than UTC synchronized points in time. Therefore, in the non-GNSS Time Mark coupled case, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem attempts to provide the position data accurate to within a specified time tolerance of the time of transmission.  For such transmitted position data, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is not required to accept and process the GPS/GNSS Time Mark information.   
The true time of applicability of the Latitude information provided to the variable data input interface (Â§2.2.5.1.7) is unknown to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  The encoded latitude in a transmitted Surface Position Message may be updated to a computed time of applicability through extrapolation or estimation within the accuracy criteria specified below based on the assumption that the time of applicability of the position data is the time that the data is received at the input interface.  Whatever means are implemented, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem must, at a minimum, update the position data to account for the delay between the time it arrived at the data interface and the time it is transmitted. The following represents the minimum performance requirement: 
The time of applicability to which the encoded latitude in a Surface Position Message is computed **shall** be within 100 milliseconds of the time of transmission.   

## Notes:

1. It is not acceptable to compute the extrapolated position based on any assumption 
that the true time of applicability of the position provided at the input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is later than the time it arrives at the input.   Any delays 
between the data arriving at the input and being recognized by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem must either be accounted for by extrapolation or understood 
to comprise a portion of the 100 millisecond budget allowed by the requirements.  
2. It is acceptable to compute the extrapolated position based on an assumption that the 
true time of applicability of the position provided at the input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is earlier than the time it arrives at the input. To accomplish 
this, a verifiable estimation of the delay between the true time of applicability of the position fix and the provision of that fix to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem's data interface is needed.  Such methods are beyond the minimum requirements and will 
need to be certified using appropriately modified test procedures. 
ADS-B Surface Position Messages may implement estimation techniques such as alphabeta trackers or Kalman filters to satisfy the intent of the 100 millisecond position requirement.  Such techniques provide the capability to decouple the position computation from the message transmission timing provided that the timing of the sampled data and the output rate of the estimator are sufficient to satisfy the 100 millisecond requirement. An acceptable method of implementing the position computation is to perform the extrapolation directly to a pre-computed time of transmission.  However, transponder based systems must also meet the Ground-Initiated Comm-B (GICB) register update timing performance so that periodic update of position data registers is necessary.   
Note: Appendix A defines the formats and coding for Extended Squitter ADS-B 
Messages.  When Extended Squitter capability is incorporated into a Mode S transponder, the registers used to contain the Extended Squitter messages are part of the transponder's GICB service.  The Mode S ground interrogator can extract the information from any of these registers at any time and pass it to the ground-based application.  In the case of Extended Squitter, the information in the registers defined for ADS-B are spontaneously broadcast as specified in RTCA DO-181E.  Periodic loading of data into Registers 0516 and 0616 for Surface and surface position data is necessary to meet the TOA timing requirements between GICB register data and Extended Squitter Position Messages. 

For Mode S Transponder-based Transmitting Subsystems, the position register **shall** be reloaded with position data at intervals that are no more than 200 milliseconds apart.  The position being loaded into the register **shall** have a time of applicability that is never more than 200 milliseconds different from any time during which the register holds that data.   

## Commentary:

The following example provides one method (not the only method) that latitude given in the Surface Position Message may be extrapolated from the time that the data arrives at the input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to the time of applicability of the position data at the time of transmission.  In the example, it is assumed that the "TIME" (T) subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.4.5) is "ZERO," indicating that the transmit time of applicability of the extrapolated position is the time of transmission.  No attempt is made to compensate for delays prior to the delivery of latitude data to the appropriate variable interface.  See Appendix U for a discussion of timing.

The earth may be modeled as a sphere with radius such that one nautical mile equals one minute of arc along a great circle.  Using that approximation, yields: 

$$\begin{array}{c c c}{{\phi_{m e s s a g e}}}&{{=}}&{{\phi_{f i x}+\Delta\phi}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\phi_{f i x}+(\,\nu_{N S}/60)(\,\Delta\,t\,\,/36000000)}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\phi_{f i x}+(\,\nu_{N S}\,\Delta t)\,/(2.16\,x\,10^{8})}}\end{array}$$
(We divide Î½
NS
 by 60 to convert from knots in the N-S direction to degrees of latitude per hour, and divide ât by 3600 x 1000 to convert from milliseconds to hours.) 
The result, Ï
message
, is to be encoded in the latitude field of the Surface Position Message using the CPR algorithm described in Appendix A, Â§A.1.7. 

## Notes:

1. The amount of compensation performed by the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem, ât, is required to differ from tmessage - tinterface
 by not more than 100 
ms.  Acceptable means for accomplishing this include appropriately updating the position registers at sufficient rates, or extrapolating directly to a precomputed time of transmission.   
2. In order not to introduce excessive error in the estimated latitude, Ï
message, 
the latency, tinterface - tfix
, in the delivery of PVT data from the navigation data 
source should not be excessive.   
 

## 2.2.3.2.4.7.4 Surface Latitude Position Data Retention

The extrapolation and update of latitude data and fields specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.1 
through Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.3 **shall** be limited to no more than two seconds, in the event that the latitude position data is no longer available.  At the end of two seconds, the latitude data registers and the encoded latitude field **shall** be set to ALL ZEROs. 

## 2.2.3.2.4.8 "Cpr Encoded Longitude" Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages

The "CPR Encoded Longitude" subfield is a 17-bit ("ME" bits 40 - 56, Message bits 72 - 
88) field that **shall** contain the encoded longitude of the Surface position.  

## 2.2.3.2.4.8.1 Surface Longitude Data Encoding

The surface longitude position data **shall** be encoded in accordance with Â§A.1.4.2.2 and 
Â§A.1.7 of Appendix A.  

## 2.2.3.2.4.8.2 Gps/Gnss Time Mark Coupled Case ("Time" (T)="1")

If "TIME" (T) = 1 (see Â§2.2.3.2.4.5) in a Surface Position Message, then the transmit time of applicability (see Appendix U) of the longitude field in that message **shall** be an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch.   

a. Specifically, the position data in the longitude field **shall** be extrapolated forward 
from the time of validity of the position fix to the transmit time of applicability of the 
Surface Position Message. 
b. The Surface longitude data registers and the encoded longitude subfield **shall** be 
updated every 200 milliseconds to the next 0.2 UTC Epoch using the velocity data 
provided for the position fix.   

## Notes:

1. The time of validity of the fix is provided with the fix data from the navigation data 
source and is indicated by the leading edge of the GNSS Time Mark (see Â§2.2.5.1.6). The transmit time of applicability of the position message is the exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch to which the transmitted position data is extrapolated.   
2. The longitude position registers and encoded longitude subfield should be updated at 
a time about 100 milliseconds before the time of applicability of the data being loaded into that register (see Â§2.2.5.2.2 and Appendix A, Â§A.1.4.2.3.1). 
3. One method of estimating the position to an exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch is 
described in the following "Commentary." 

## Commentary:

The following example provides one method (not the only method) that longitude given in the Surface Position Message may be extrapolated from the time of validity of the fix (included with the fix from the navigation data source) to the time of applicability of the Surface Position Message.  In the example, it is assumed that the "TIME" subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.4.5) is "ONE," indicating that the time of applicability of the extrapolated position is an exact 0.2 second UTC Epoch.  See Appendix U for a discussion of timing.

The earth may be modeled as a sphere with radius such that one nautical mile equals one minute of arc along a great circle.  Using that approximation, yields:

(We divide Î½
EW
 by 60 cos (Ï) to convert from knots in the E-W direction to degrees of longitude per hour, and divide ât by 3600 x 1000 to convert from milliseconds to hours.) 
The result, Î»
message
, is to be encoded in the longitude field of the Surface Position Message using the CPR algorithm described in Appendix A, Â§A.1.7. 

## 2.2.3.2.4.8.3 Non-Gps/Gnss Time Mark Coupled Case ("Time" (T)="0")

The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem provides position in the non-GNSS Time Mark coupled case ("TIME" (T)="0") that is understood by ADS-B Receiving Subsystems to be applicable at the time of reception rather than UTC synchronized points in time. Therefore, in the non-GNSS Time Mark coupled case, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem attempts to provide the position data accurate to within a specified time tolerance of the time of transmission.  For such transmitted position data, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is not required to accept and process the GPS/GNSS Time Mark information.   
The true time of applicability of the Longitude information provided to the variable data input interface (Â§2.2.5.1.8) is unknown to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  The encoded longitude in a transmitted Surface Position Message may be updated to a computed time of applicability through extrapolation or estimation within the accuracy criteria specified below based on the assumption that the time of applicability of the position data is the time that the data is received at the input interface.  Whatever means are implemented, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem must, at a minimum, update the position data to account for the delay between the time it arrived at the data interface and the time it is transmitted.   
The following represents the minimum performance requirement: 
The time of applicability to which the encoded longitude in an Surface Position Message is computed **shall** be within 100 milliseconds of the time of transmission.   

## Notes:

1. It is not acceptable to compute the extrapolated position based on any assumption 
that the true time of applicability of the position provided at the input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is later than the time it arrives at the input.   Any delays 
between the data arriving at the input and being recognized by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem must either be accounted for by extrapolation or understood 
to comprise a portion of the 100 millisecond budget allowed by the requirements.   
2. It is acceptable to compute the extrapolated position based on an assumption that the 
true time of applicability of the position provided at the input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is earlier than the time it arrives at the input. To accomplish 
this, a verifiable estimation of the delay between the true time of applicability of the position fix and the provision of that fix to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem's data 
interface is needed.  Such methods are beyond the minimum requirements and will need to be certified using appropriately modified test procedures.   
ADS-B Surface Position Messages may implement estimation techniques such as alphabeta trackers or Kalman filters to satisfy the intent of the 100 millisecond position requirement.  Such techniques provide the capability to decouple the position computation from the message transmission timing provided that the timing of the sampled data and the output rate of the estimator are sufficient to satisfy the 100 millisecond requirement. An acceptable method of implementing the position computation is to perform the extrapolation directly to a pre-computed time of transmission.  However, transponderbased systems must also meet the Ground-Initiated Comm-B (GICB) register update timing performance so that periodic update of position data registers is necessary.   
Note: Appendix A defines the formats and coding for Extended Squitter ADS-B 
Messages.  When Extended Squitter capability is incorporated into a Mode S transponder, the registers used to contain the Extended Squitter messages are part of the transponder's GICB service.  The Mode S ground interrogator can extract the information from any of these registers at any time and pass it to the ground-based application.  In the case of Extended Squitter, the information in the registers defined for ADS-B are spontaneously broadcast as specified in RTCA DO-181E.  Periodic loading of data into Registers 0516 and 0616

                                                                                   for 
Surface and surface position data is necessary to meet the TOA timing 
requirements between GICB register data and Extended Squitter Position 
Messages.   

For Mode S Transponder-based Transmitting Subsystems, the position Register **shall** be reloaded with position data at intervals that are no more than 200 miiliseconds apart.  The position being loaded into the Register **shall** have a time of applicability that is never more than 200 millisefconds different from any time during which the register holds that data.   

## Commentary:

The following example provides one method (not the only method) that longitude given in the Surface Position Message may be extrapolated from the time that the data arrives at the input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to the time of applicability of the position data at the time of transmission.  In the example, it is assumed that the "TIME" (T) subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.4.5) is "ZERO," indicating that the transmit time of applicability of the extrapolated position is the time of transmission.  No attempt is made to compensate for delays prior to the delivery of longitude data to the appropriate variable interface. See Appendix U for a discussion of timing.

## Notes:

1. The amount of compensation performed by the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem, ât, is required to differ from tmessage - tinterface
 by not more than 100 
ms.  Acceptable means for accomplishing this include appropriately updating the position registers at sufficient rates, or extrapolating directly to a precomputed time of transmission.   
2. In order not to introduce excessive error in the estimated longitude, Î»

the latency, tinterface - tfix
, in the delivery of PVT data from the navigation data 
source should not be excessive.

## 2.2.3.2.6.1 Ads-B Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=1

a. The Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=1 is illustrated in Figure 2-7 and **shall** be 
transmitted by the Airborne ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem when Velocity Over Ground information is available, and the transmitting device is installed in an environment having NON-supersonic airspeed capability.  
b. The Supersonic Version of the Airborne Velocity Message (i.e., Subtype=2) **shall** be 
used if either the East/West velocity OR the North/South velocity exceeds 1022 
knots.  A switch to the normal velocity message (i.e., Subtype=1) **shall** be made if 
both the East/West and the North/South velocities drop below 1000 knots. 
c. The Airborne Velocity Message shall not be broadcast if the only valid data is the 
Intent Change Flag.    
(1). Transponder-Based ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems **shall** suppress the 
broadcast by loading Register 0916
 with "ALL ZEROs" and then discontinuing 
updating of the Register until data input is available again.  The Transponder will ZERO the Airborne Velocity Message after 2.6 seconds and terminate the 
broadcast.   
2.2.3.3.2.11 and Â§2.2.3.3.2.12. 

(2). Non-Transponder-Based ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems **shall ZERO** the 
Airborne Velocity Message after 2.6 seconds and terminate the broadcast as 
specified in Â§
Each of the subfields of the Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=1 is specified in the following subparagraphs.    

## 2.2.3.2.6.1.1 "Type" Code Subfield In Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=1

The "TYPE" Code subfield was previously specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3.1 and remains the same for ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 that use TYPE Code 19 only. 

## 2.2.3.2.6.1.2 "Subtype" Code Subfield In Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=1

The "Subtype" Code subfield is a 3-bit ("ME" bits 6 - 8, Message bits 38 - 40) field that shall be used to identify the subtypes of Airborne Velocity Messages as specified in Table 2-20.

"1." 

## 2.2.3.2.6.1.3 "Intent Change Flag" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1

The "Intent Change Flag" subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 9, Message bit 41) field that **shall** 
be used to indicate a change in intent as specified in Table 2-21, and transmitted in the Airborne Velocity Message.   

|   Coding  | Meaning             |
|-----------|---------------------|
|        0  | No Change in Intent |
|        1  | Intent Change       |

## A. Mode-S Transponder Implementations

An Intent Change event **shall** be triggered 4 seconds after the detection of new information being inserted in GICB Registers 4016 to 4216
.  This results in the "Intent Change Flag" being set to ONE (1) and the code remains set for 18 Â±1 seconds following the intent change. 

## Notes:

1. GICB Register 4316
 is not included since it contains dynamic data that will be 
continuously changing. 
2. A four second delay is required to provide for settling time for intent data 
derived from manually set devices. 

## B. Non-Transponder-Based Implementations

Non-Transponder-Based transmission devices do not implement the Target State and Status Messages and therefore do not set the "Intent Change Flag."  Therefore, such devices **shall** set the "Intent Change Flag" to ZERO at all times.   

## 2.2.3.2.6.1.4 "Reserved Bit-A" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1

The "Reserved Bit-A" subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 10, Message bit 42) field that **shall** be set to ZERO (0) in all ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems that comply with these MOPS. This "Reserved Bit-A" subfield was identified in RTCA DO-260A as the "IFR Capability Flag" subfield, and was required to be set to ONE only for transmitting aircraft that had the capability for applications requiring ADS-B equipage Class "A1" or above.  The "IFR 
Capability Flag" has been eliminated from the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242B), and so has been removed from these requirements for the 1090ES MOPS.   

## " Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 2.2.3.2.6.1.5 "Nacv

The "NAC
V" subfield is a 3-bit ("ME" bits 11 - 13, Message bits 43 - 45) field that **shall** 
be used to indicate the Navigation Accuracy Category for Velocity as specified in Table 
2-22.   
The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** accept, via an appropriate data interface, data from which the own-vehicle Navigation Accuracy Category for Velocity (NACV) may be inferred, and it **shall** use such data to establish the NACV
 subfields in transmitted ADS-B 
Airborne Velocity Messages.   
V
If the external data source provides 95% accuracy figures of merit for horizontal velocity, then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** determine the value of the NAC
2.2.3.2.6.1
 field in the Airborne Velocity Messages, Subtypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Â§
, Â§2.2.3.2.6.2, 
Â§2.2.3.2.6.3 and Â§2.2.3.2.6.4, respectively) according to Table 2-22. 

Note: Appendix J describes the manner in which GNSS position sources, which do not output velocity accuracy, can be characterized so that a velocity accuracy value associated with the position source can be input into ADS-B equipment as part of the installation process.

The "East/West Velocity" subfield is a 10-bit ("ME" bits 15 - 24, Message bits 47 - 56) 
field that **shall** be used to report the East/West subsonic Velocity (in knots) of the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem. 

Range, Resolution, and No Data encoding of the "East/West Velocity" subfield **shall** be as shown in Table 2-24.

## Notes:

1. The encoding shown in the table represents Positive Magnitude data only.  Direction 
is given completely by the East/West Direction Bit. 
2. Raw data used to establish the East/West Velocity Subfield will normally have more 
resolution (i.e., more bits) than that required by the East/West Velocity Subfield. When converting such data to the East/West Velocity Subfield, the accuracy of the data must be maintained such that it is not worse than Â±Â½ LSB where the LSB is that 
of the East/West Velocity subfield. 
3. All velocity vector components are to be referenced to WGS-84 or to a coordinate 
system consistent with WGS-84. 

## 2.2.3.2.6.1.8 "North/South Direction Bit" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1

The "North/South Direction Bit" subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 25, Message bit 57) field that **shall** be used to indicate the direction of the North/South Velocity Vector as shown in Table 2-25.

## 2.2.3.2.6.1.13 "Reserved Bits-B" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1

The "Reserved Bits-B" subfield is a 2-bit ("ME" bits 47 - 48, Message bits 79 - 80) field that **shall** be set to ZERO (binary 00) in all ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems that comply with these MOPS. This "Reserved Bits-B" subfield was identified in RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 as the "Turn Indicator" subfield, and was required to be set to ZERO (binary 00) for all ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving Subsystems that comply with that document also.  
The "Turn Indicator" was eliminated from the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A), and so has been removed from the requirements for the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter data link.   

## 2.2.3.2.6.1.14 "Difference From Barometric Altitude Sign Bit" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1

The "Difference From Barometric Altitude Sign Bit" subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 49, Message bit 81) field that **shall** be used to indicate the direction of the GNSS Altitude Source data as shown in Table 2-30.

## 2.2.3.2.6.1.15 "Difference From Barometric Altitude" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1

The "Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield is a 7-bit ("ME" bits 50 - 56, Message bits 82 - 88) field that is used to report the difference between Geometric (GNSS or INS) Altitude Source data and Barometric Altitude when both types of Altitude Data are available and valid.  The difference between barometric altitude and GNSS Height Above Ellipsoid (HAE) is preferred.  However, GNSS Altitude (MSL) may be used when airborne position is being reported using TYPE Codes 11 through 18. If airborne position is being reported using TYPE Codes 9 or 10, only GNSS Height Above the Ellipsoid (HAE) may be used.  For TYPE Codes 9 and 10, if GNSS Height Above the Ellipsoid (HAE) is not available, then the Difference from Barometric Altitude subfield **shall** be set to ALL ZEROs. 

## Notes:

1. The basis for the barometric altitude difference (either GNSS HAE or Altitude MSL) 
must be used consistently for the reported difference.   
2. Although the above requirements allows this subfield to be based on MSL in certain 
cases, it is expected that some regulators will only accept installations that report based on WGS-84 HAE.  HAE will be required for some State mandates and the manufacturer must ensure that when converting from HAG (e.g., MSL) to HAE, the same model used by the position source is used.  This may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.   
Range, Resolution, and No Data encoding of the "Difference From Barometric Altitude" 
subfield **shall** be as shown in Table 2-31.

## 2.2.3.2.6.2 Ads-B Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=2

a. The Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=2 is illustrated in Figure 2-7 and **shall** be 
transmitted by the Airborne ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem when Velocity Over Ground information is available, and the transmitting device is installed in an environment having a Supersonic airspeed capability. 
b. The Supersonic Version of the Airborne Velocity Message (i.e., Subtype=2) **shall** be 
used if either the East/West Velocity OR the North/South Velocity exceeds 1022 
knots.  A switch to the normal Airborne Velocity Message (i.e., Subtype=1) **shall** be 
made if both the East/West and the North/South Velocities drop below 1000 knots. 
c. The Airborne Velocity Message shall not be broadcast if the only valid data is the 
Intent Change Flag.   
(1). Transponder-Based ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems **shall** suppress the 
broadcast by loading Register 0916
 with "ALL ZEROs" and then discontinuing 
updating of the Register until data input is available again.  The Transponder 
will ZERO the Velocity Message after 2.6 seconds and terminate the broadcast.   
2.2.3.3.2.11 and Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.   

(2). Non-Transponder-Based ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems **shall ZERO** the 
Velocity Message after 2.6 seconds and terminate the broadcast, as specified in Â§
Each of the subfields of the Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=2 is specified in the following subparagraphs.   

## 2.2.3.2.6.2.1 "Type" Code Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=2

## 2.2.3.2.7 Ads-B Periodic Status And Event-Driven Messages 2.2.3.2.7.1 "Target State And Status" Messages

The "Target State and Status" Message is used to provide the current state of an airborne aircraft in navigating to its intended trajectory and the status of the aircraft's navigation data source and TCAS/ACAS systems.  For this version of these MOPS the Target State and Status Message with Subtype=1 is defined to convey information on the aircraft's target heading and altitude (i.e., Target State information) as well as information on the status of the navigation data being used by ADS-B and the status of the aircraft TCAS 
systems.  The format of the Target State and Status Message **shall** be as specified in Figure 2-9, while further definition of each of the subfields **shall** be as specified in the subsequent paragraphs. 

Note: The provisions of RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 related to TCP/TCP+1 
were removed from the initial publication of RTCA DO-260A, and provisions for a Target State and Status Message were defined using the same message TYPE 
Code value (i.e, TYPE Code = 29) as previously defined by RTCA DO-260 for the Aircraft Trajectory Intent Messages that conveyed TCP/TCP+1 information. It is not expected that any implementation based on RTCA DO-260 would have implemented the messages for TCP and TCP+1.  However, for purposes of backward compatibility RTCA DO-260A required for a TYPE Code=29 message that "ME" bit 11 always be set to ZERO (0), which would result in a RTCA DO- 260 conformant ADS-B receiver not attempting to make use of the remaining contents of the message.  Likewise, any TYPE Code=29 message transmitted by an implementation based on RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 that has incorrectly set "ME" bit 11 set to ONE (1) (i.e., indicating a valid TCP/TCP+1 Message is being transmitted) should be discarded.

## 2.2.3.2.7.1.3.1 "Sil Supplement" Subfield In Target State And Status Messages

The "SIL Supplement" (Source Integrity Level Supplement) subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 
8, Message bit 40) field that **shall** define whether the reported SIL probability is based on a "per hour" probability or a "per sample" probability as defined in Table 2-41.   

|   Coding  | Meaning                                                                     |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        0  | Probability of exceeding NIC radius of containment is based on "per hour"   |
|        1  | Probability of exceeding NIC radius of containment is based on "per sample" |

 

âº  **Per Hour:** 
The probability of the reported geometric position laying outside the 
NIC containment radius in any given hour without an alert or an alert longer than the allowable time-to-alert.     
 per hour.   
Note: The probability of exceeding the integrity radius of 
containment for GNSS position sources are based on a per 
hour basis, as the NIC will be derived from the GNSS Horizontal Protection Level (HPL) which is based on a 
probability of 1x10-7
âº  **Per Sample:** 
The probability of a reported geometric position laying outside the 
NIC containment radius for any given sample.   
Note: The probability of exceeding the integrity radius of 
containment for IRU, DME/DME and DME/DME/LOC position sources may be based on a per sample basis.   

## 2.2.3.2.7.1.3.2 "Selected Altitude Type" Subfield In Target State And Status Messages

a. The "Selected Altitude Type" subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 9, Message bit 41) field 
that **shall** be used to indicate the source of Selected Altitude data that is being used to 
encode "ME" bits 10 - 20 (Message bits 42 - 52).  Encoding of the "Selected 
Altitude Type" **shall** be in accordance with Table 2-42.

## 

b. Whenever there is no valid MCP / FCU or FMS Selected Altitude data available, then 
the "Selected Altitude Type" subfield ("ME" bit 9, Message bit 41) **shall** be set to 
ZERO (0).   
Note: Users of this data are cautioned that the selected altitude value transmitted by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem does not necessarily reflect the true intention of the airplane during certain flight modes (e.g., during certain VNAV or Approach modes), and does not necessarily correspond to the target altitude (the next altitude level at which the aircraft will level off). In addition, on many airplanes, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem does not receive selected altitude data from the FMS and will only transmit Selected Altitude data received from a Mode Control Panel / Flight Control Unit (MCP / FCU). 

## 2.2.3.2.7.1.3.3 "Mcp/Fcu Selected Altitude Or Fms Selected Altitude" Subfield In Target State And Status Messages

("ME" bits 10 - 20, Message bits 42 - 52) field that **shall** contain either MCP / FCU 
Selected Altitude or FMS Selected Altitude data in accordance with the following subparagraphs.  
b. Whenever valid Selected Altitude data is available from the Mode Control Panel / 
Flight Control Unit (MCP / FCU) or equivalent equipment, such data **shall** be used to 
encode "ME" bits 10 - 20 (Message bits 42 - 52) in accordance with Table 2-43.  
Use of MCP / FCU Selected Altitude **shall** then be declared in the "Selected Altitude 
Type" subfield as specified in Table 2-42.   
c. Whenever valid Selected Altitude data is NOT available from the Mode Control 
Panel / Flight Control Unit (MCP / FCU) or equivalent equipment, but valid Selected 
Altitude data is available from the Flight Management System (FMS), then the FMS 
Selected Altitude data **shall** be used to encode "ME" bits 10 - 20 (Message bits 42 - 
52) in accordance with Table 2-43 provided in paragraph "d."  Use of FMS Selected 
Altitude **shall** then be declared in the "Selected Altitude Type" subfield as specified 
in Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.3.2, Table 2-42. 
d. Encoding of Selected Altitude data in "ME" bits 10 - 20 (Message bits 42 - 52) **shall** 
be in accordance with Table 2-43.  Encoding of the data **shall** be rounded so as to 
preserve accuracy of the source data within  Â±Â½ LSB.

## Notes:

1. On many airplanes, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem receives Selected Heading 
from a Mode Control Panel / Flight Control Unit (MCP / FCU).  Users of this data are cautioned that the Selected Heading value transmitted by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem does not necessarily reflect the true intention of the airplane during certain flight modes (e.g., during LNAV mode).   
2. The Selected Heading parameter does not have a source bit in this version of these 
MOPS to indicate its reference orientation (True North or Magnetic North). Implementers of the Target State and Status Message are encouraged whenever possible to use input parameters to populate this field that utilize Magnetic North orientation, as that is the de facto standard utilized by most users of this data. However since many aircraft have flight decks that can operate in either True North 
or Magnetic North orientation, this field should be encoded with the current active value in the flight deck, regardless of orientation.  Users of the Selected Heading data should be aware that there is no method defined in this version of these MOPS to indicate its reference orientation.   

## " Subfield In Target State And Status Messages 2.2.3.2.7.1.3.8 "Nacp

The Navigation Accuracy Category for Position (NAC
P) subfield is a 4-bit ("ME" bits 40 
- 43, Message bits 72 - 75) subfield of the Target State and Status Message that **shall** 
announce 95% accuracy limits for the horizontal position that is being currently broadcast in Airborne Position and Surface Position Messages.  Table 2-70 specifies the accuracy limits for each NACP value.  If an update has not been received from an onboard data source for NACP within the past 2 seconds, then the NACP
 subfield **shall** be encoded as a value of ZERO (0) indicating "Unknown Accuracy." 

## Notes: .

1. The Navigation Accuracy Category for Position (NACP) is reported so that 
surveillance applications may determine whether the reported geometric position has an acceptable level of accuracy for the intended use.  See Â§2.1.2.13 of the ADS-B 
MASPS, RTCA DO-242A, for a fuller description of NACP
2. A non-excluded satellite failure requires that the NAC
P and NACV
 parameters be set 
to ZERO  along with the NIC parameter to indicate that the position has been 
determined to be invalid (see Â§
 and Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.5).

" (Barometric Altitude Integrity Code) subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 44, Message bit 76) field that **shall** be used to indicate whether or not the barometric pressure altitude being reported in the Airborne Position Message (Â§
) has been crosschecked against another source of pressure altitude.  The "NICBARO " subfield **shall** 
be encoded in accordance with Table 2-73, as specified in the Aircraft Operational Status Message.  If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for NICBARO 
within the past 2 seconds, then the NICBARO
 subfield **shall** be encoded as a value of ZERO 
(0). 

## 2.2.3.2.7.1.3.10 "Source Integrity Level (Sil)" Subfield In Target State And Status Messages

The "SIL" (Source Integrity Level) subfield is a 2-bit ("ME" bits 45 and 46, Message bits 
77 and 78) field that **shall** be used to define the probability of the reported horizontal position exceeding the radius of containment defined by the NIC, without alerting, assuming no avionics faults.  Although the SIL assumes there are no unannunciated faults in the avionics system, the SIL must consider the effects of a faulted Signal-in-Space, if a Signal-in-Space is used by the position source.  The probability of an avionics fault causing the reported horizontal position to exceed the radius of containment defined by the NIC, without alerting, is covered by the System Design Assurance (SDA) parameter (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.4.6).   
The SIL probability can be defined as either "per sample" or "per hour" as defined in the SIL Supplement (SILSUPP
2.2.3.2.7.1.3.1
) in Â§
.   

## Notes:

1. For GNSS position sources the HIL or HPL is provided with a probability of 1x10-7
 
per hour, which should be used to set the SIL to 3. 
2. The GPS defined HPL probability rate of 10
-7 per hour is based on the GPS 
constellation fault rate of 10-4 per hour and a 10-3 probability of missed detection, 
given that the fault occurs.  Different containment radii indicated by the HPL are all 
defined at the missed detection probability of 10-3
.    
3. Fault detection is an essential consideration in determining the SIL parameter.  Fault 
detection assures, at a specified probability of missed detection, that the error is no greater than a specified limit without an alert.   
4. For alternate ADS-B position sources to report integrity, they will need to be 
certified for their fault detection characteristics.   
The "SIL" subfield **shall** be encoded in accordance with Table 2-72, as specified in the Aircraft Operational Status Message.  For installations where the SIL value is being dynamically updated, if an update has not been received from an on-board data source for SIL within the past 2 seconds, then the SIL subfield **shall** be encoded as a value of ZERO 
(0), indicating "Unknown."   

Note: The SIL and NIC should be set to unknown if the ADS-B position source does not 
supply an output certified to provide an indication of the integrity of the reported position (e.g., such as HPL from GNSS systems).

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.3 "Capability Class (Cc)" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The Capability Codes (CC) subfield of the ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Message shall occupy 16 bits in the "airborne" format of that message and 12 bits in the "surface" 
format of the message.  In the airborne format (messages with TYPE=31, Subtype=0), the CC codes **shall** occupy "ME" bits 9 - 24 (Message bits 41 - 56).  In the surface format (TYPE=31, Subtype=1), the CC codes **shall** occupy "ME" bits 9 - 20 (Message bits 41 - 
52).  The format of this subfield depends on the value of the ADS-B Version Number subfield (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.5).  Moreover, for ADS-B Messages transmitted from a "Version 
2" ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, the CC format depends on whether the ADS-B 
Aircraft Operational Status Message Subtype field is has a value of 0 or 1. If the ADS-B Version Number subfield (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.5) is TWO (2) (for ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystems conformant to RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A), and the Aircraft Operational Status Message Subtype subfield is ZERO (0) (for Airborne Participants), then the format of the CC Code subfield **shall** be as specified in Table 2-56.   
If the ADS-B Version Number subfield (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.5) is TWO (2) (for ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystems conformant to RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A), and the Aircraft Operational Status Message Subtype subfield is ONE (1) (indicating Surface Participants), then the format of the CC Code subfield **shall** be as specified in Table 2-57.

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.3.7  "B2 Low" Cc Code Subfield In Surface Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The "B2 Low" subfield ("ME" bit 15) of the CC Code subfield in the "surface" version of the Aircraft Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, Subtype=1) is a one-bit Boolean flag that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** set to ONE (1) if the Transmitting Subsystem is a Non-Transponder-Based Transmitting Subsystem on a Ground Vehicle that meets the requirements of Class B2, except that it transmits with less than 70 watts of power.  Otherwise, this bit **shall** be set to ZERO (0). 

Note: Setting the "B2 Low" CC Code bit indicates to airborne participants that any transmissions from that surface participant are at lower than the minimum 70 watts power required of Class B2 participants by these MOPS.

The "UAT IN" CC Code in Aircraft Operational Status Messages **shall** be set to ZERO 
(0) in Aircraft Operational Status Messages if the aircraft is NOT fitted with the capability to receive ADS-B UAT Messages.  The "UAT IN" CC Code Subfield in Aircraft Operational Status Messages **shall** be set to ONE (1) if the aircraft has the capability to receive ADS-B UAT Messages.   
Note: If the aircraft is fitted with ADS-B UAT receive equipment but such equipment is not functional, then the encoding should be set to "ZERO" (0), e.g., the same as if the aircraft were NOT fitted with the receive capability.   

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.3.10 "Nic Supplement-C" Cc Code Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The NIC Supplement-C subfield in the Aircraft Operational Status Message is a one-bit subfield ("ME" bit 20, Message bit 52) that, together with the TYPE subfield in Surface Position Messages and the NIC Supplement-A in the Operational Status Message ("ME" 
Bit 44, Message Bit 76), **shall** be used to encode the Radius of Containment (RC
) of the transmitting ADS-B participant.   
If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for the determination of the NIC value within the past 2 seconds, then the NIC Supplement-C subfield **shall** be encoded to indicate the larger Radius of Containment (R
C).  
Table 2-69 lists the possible NIC codes and the values of the TYPE Code subfield of the Airborne and Surface Position Messages, and of the NIC Supplement-A, NIC 
Supplement-B and NIC Supplement-C subfields that **shall** be used to encode those NIC 
codes in messages on the 1090 MHz ADS-B data link.   

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.4 "Operational Mode (Om)" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The "Operational Mode (OM)" subfield is a 16-bit subfield ("ME" bits 25 - 40, Message bits 57 - 72) that **shall** indicate Operational Modes that are active on board the A/V in which the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem resides.  The format of the OM subfield in Aircraft Operational Status Messages, with Subtype=0 for airborne participants **shall** be as specified in Table 2-63.  The format of the OM subfield in Aircraft Operational Status Messages, with Subtype=1 for surface participants shall be as specified in Table 2-64.

The first two bits of the OM subfield ("ME" bits 25 and 26, Message bits 57 and 58) 
shall be reserved for selecting one of up to four OM subfield formats.  For this version of these MOPS, the OM subfield format code **shall** be set to ZERO (binary 00). 

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.4.2 "Tcas/Acas Resolution Advisory Active" Om Code Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Message

The "TCAS/ACAS Resolution Advisory Active" (RA Active) Operational Mode Code is a one-bit subfield ("ME" bit 27, Message bit 59) of the OM subfield in Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, Subtype=0 or 1).  The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** set this code to ONE (1) so long as a TCAS II or ACAS Resolution Advisory is known to be in effect (i.e., an update has been received within the last 2 
seconds that indicates a "TCAS/ACAS Resolution Advisory is Active"); otherwise, it shall set this OM code to ZERO (0).   

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.4.3 "Ident Switch Active" Om Code Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Message

The "IDENT Switch Active" Operational Mode code is a one-bit subfield ("ME" bit 28, message bit 60) of the OM Code subfield in Aircraft Operational Status Messages.  
Initially, the "IDENT Switch Active" OM Code **shall** be set to ZERO.  Upon activation of the IDENT switch, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** set this code to ONE for a period of 18 Â± 1 seconds; thereafter, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** set this OM Code to ZERO. 

Note: The requirement for an interface by which the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem may be informed when the IDENT switch is active is given in Â§2.2.5.1.30. 

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.4.4 Reserved For "Receiving Atc Services" Om Code Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Message

"ME" bit 29, Message bit 61 of the OM Code subfield in Aircraft Operational Status Messages **shall** be reserved for the "Receiving ATC Services" Operational Mode Code.  
If implemented into future versions of these MOPS, an ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem would set this OM Code to ONE when the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is Receiving ATC Services, as indicated by an update having been received via an appropriate interface on board the transmitting aircraft within the past 2 seconds.  Otherwise, in this version of these MOPS, this OM Code bit **shall** be set to ZERO.   
Note: The requirement for an interface by which the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem may be informed when the aircraft is receiving ATC services is given in 
Â§2.2.5.1.31.   

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.4.5 "Single Antenna Flag" Om Code Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The "Single Antenna" subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 30, Message bit 62) field that **shall** be used to indicate that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is operating with a single antenna.  The following conventions **shall** apply both to Transponder-Based and Stand Alone ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems: 

a. Non-Diversity, i.e., those transmitting functions that use only one antenna, **shall** set 
the Single Antenna subfield to "ONE" at all times.   
b. Diversity, i.e., those transmitting functions designed to use two antennas, **shall** set 
the Single Antenna subfield to "ZERO" at all times that both antenna channels are functional. 
At any time that the diversity configuration cannot guarantee that both antenna channels are functional, then the Single Antenna subfield **shall** be set to "ONE."   
Note: Certain applications may require confirmation that each participant has functioning antenna diversity for providing adequate surveillance coverage. 

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.4.6 "System Design Assurance" Om Code Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The position transmission chain includes the ADS-B transmission equipment, ADS-B 
processing equipment, position source, and any other equipment that processes the position data and position quality metrics that will be transmitted. 

The "System Design Assurance" (SDA) subfield is a 2-bit ("ME" bits 31 - 32, Message bits 63 - 64) field that **shall** define the failure condition that the position transmission chain is designed to support as defined in Table 2-65.   
The supported failure condition will indicate the probability of an position transmission chain fault causing false or misleading position information to be transmitted.  The definitions and probabilities associated with the supported failure effect are defined in AC-25.1309-1A, AC-23.1309-1D, and AC 29-2C.  All relevant systems attributes should be considered including software and complex hardware in accordance with RTCA DO-

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.4.7 "Gps Antenna Offset" Om Code Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The "GPS Antenna Offset" subfield is an 8-bit ("ME" bits 33 - 40, Message bits 65 - 72) 
field in the OM Code Subfield of surface format Aircraft Operational Status Messages that **shall** define the position of the GPS antenna in accordance with the following.   

## A. Lateral Axis Gps Antenna Offset:

"ME" bits 33 - 35 (Message bits 65 - 67) **shall** be used to encode the lateral distance of the GPS Antenna from the longitudinal axis (Roll) axis of the aircraft.  Encoding shall be established in accordance with Table 2-66.

## Notes:

1. Left means toward the left wing tip moving from the longitudinal center line of the 
aircraft. 
2. Right means toward the right wing tip moving from the longitudinal center line of the 
aircraft. 
3. Maximum distance left or right of aircraft longitudinal (roll) axis is 6 meters or 
19.685 feet.    If the distance is greater than 6 meters, then the encoding should be set to 6 meters. 
4. The "No Data" case is indicated by encoding of "000" as above, while the "ZERO" 
offset case is represented by encoding of "100" as above. 
5. The accuracy requirement is assumed to be better than 2 meters, consistent with the 
data resolution. 

## B. Longitudinal Axis Gps Antenna Offset:

"ME" bits 36 - 40 (Message bits 68 - 72) **shall** be used to encode the longitudinal distance of the GPS Antenna from the NOSE of the aircraft.  Encoding **shall** be established in accordance with Table 2-67.  If the Antenna Offset is compensated by the Sensor to be the position of the ADS-B participant's ADS-B Position Reference Point (RTCA DO-242A, Â§3.4.4.9.7), then the encoding is set to binary "00001" in Table 2-67.

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.4.8 "Reserved" Om Code Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

"Reserved" bits, ("ME" bits 33 - 40, Message bits 65 - 72) in the OM Code Subfield of Airborne format Aircraft Operational Status Messages are reserved for future assignment.  
Until such future assignment, these bits **shall** be set to "ZERO" (0).   

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.5 Ads-B "Version Number" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Message

The ADS-B "Version Number" (VN) subfield is a 3-bit ("ME" bits 41 - 43, Message bits 
73 - 75) field that **shall** be used to indicate the ADS-B Version Number of the formats and protocols in use on the aircraft installation.  Encoding of the ADS-B Version Number subfield **shall** be as shown in Table 2-68.  Airborne ADS-B systems conformant to the initial version of the 1090 MHz ADS-B MOPS (RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102) do not broadcast an explicit ADS-B Version Number.  Therefore, ADS-B Receiving Subsystems conformant with this version of these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE 
ED-102A) **shall** initially assume a ADS-B Version Number of ZERO (binary 000), until a received ADS-B Version Number data indicates otherwise.

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.6 "Nic Supplement-A" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The NIC Supplement-A subfield in the Aircraft Operational Status Message is a one-bit subfield ("ME" bit 44, Message bit 76) that, together with the TYPE subfield in Airborne Position and Surface Position Messages, **shall** be used to encode the Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) of the transmitting ADS-B participant.  In ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems with ADS-B Version Number=2, or later, the NIC Supplement-B is also broadcast in the Airborne Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.3.3).   
Note: The Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) is reported so that surveillance applications may determine whether the reported geometric position has an acceptable level of integrity for the intended use.  See Â§2.1.2.12 of RTCA DO-242A, the ADS-B MASPS, for a fuller description of the Navigation Integrity Category. 

If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for the determination of the NIC value within the past 2 seconds, then the NIC Supplement-A subfield **shall** be encoded to indicate the larger Radius of Containment (RC).  
Table 2-69 lists the possible NIC codes and the values of the TYPE Code subfield of the Airborne and Surface Position Messages, and of the NIC Supplement-A, NIC 
Supplement-B and NIC Supplement-C subfields that **shall** be used to encode those NIC 
codes in messages on the 1090 MHz ADS-B data link.

## Notes:

1. "N/A" means "This NIC value is not available in the ADS-B Surface Position 
Message formats." 
2. NIC Supplement-A is broadcast in the Aircraft Operational Status Message, "ME" 
bit 44 (Message bit 76, see Figure 2-11).  NIC Supplement-B is broadcast in the 
Airborne Position Message, "ME" bit 8 (Message bit 40, see Figure 2-3).  NIC Supplement-C is broadcast in the Surface Capability Class (CC) Code Subfield of the 
Aircraft Operational Status Message, "ME" bit 20 (Message bit 52, see Table 2-57).   
3. A non-excluded satellite failure requires that the RC be set to Unknown along with 
the NACP and NACV
2.2.3.2.3.1.5
 parameters being set to ZERO to indicate that the position 
accuracy and integrity have been determined to be invalid (see Â§
 and 
Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.5).  Factors such as surface multi-path, which has been observed to 
cause intermittent setting of Label 130 bit 11, should be taken into account by the ADS-B application and ATC.   

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.7 "Navigation Accuracy Category For Position (Nacp )" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The Navigation Accuracy Category for Position (NAC
P) is a 4-bit subfield of the ADS-B 
Aircraft Operational Status Message ("ME" bits 45 - 48, Message bits 77 - 80) that **shall** 
announce 95% accuracy limits for the horizontal position that is being currently broadcast in airborne position and surface position messages.  Table 2-70 specifies the accuracy limits for each NACP value.  If an update has not been received from an onboard data source for NACP within the past 2 seconds, then the NACP
 subfield **shall** be encoded as a value of ZERO (0) indicating "Unknown Accuracy." 
Note: The Navigation Accuracy Category for Position (NAC
. 

P) is reported so that surveillance applications may determine whether the reported geometric position has an acceptable level of accuracy for the intended use.  See Â§2.1.2.13 of the ADS-B MASPS, RTCA DO-242A, for a fuller description of NACP

## Notes For Table 2-70:

1. The Estimated Position Uncertainty (EPU) used in the table is a 95% accuracy 
bound on horizontal position.  EPU is defined as the radius of a circle, centered on the reported position, such that the probability of the actual position lying outside the circle is 0.05.  When reported by a GPS or GNSS system, EPU is commonly called HFOM (Horizontal Figure of Merit). 
 only refers to horizontal position error uncertainty. 
2. RNP accuracy includes error sources other than sensor error, whereas horizontal 
error for NACP
3. A non-excluded satellite failure requires that the NAC
P and NACV parameters be set 
to ZERO along with RC
2.2.3.2.3.1.5
 being set to Unknown to indicate that the position accuracy 
and integrity have been determined to be invalid (see Â§
 and 
Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.5).  Factors such as surface multi-path, which has been observed to 
cause intermittent setting of Label 130 bit 11, should be taken into account by the ADS-B application and ATC. 

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.8 "Geometric Vertical Accuracy (Gva)" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The "Geometric Vertical Accuracy (GVA)" subfield of Subtype=0 Aircraft Operational Status Message is a 2-bit field ("ME" bits 49-50, Message bits 81-82) defined in Table 2-
71.  The GVA field **shall** be set by using the Vertical Figure of Merit (VFOM) (95%) 
from the GNSS position source used to report the geometric altitude.   
Note: The geometric altitude may be reported directly in the altitude field in the Airborne Position Message or indirectly using the Difference From Barometric Altitude subfield (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.15) in the Airborne Velocity Message (Â§2.2.3.2.6) 
when barometric altitude is reported in the altitude field in the Airborne Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.3.4).

| 3               | Reserved                |

Note: For the purposes of these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A) values for 0, 1 and 2 are encoded.  It is expected that ADS-B transmitting subsystems with ADS-B Version Numbers greater than 2 will define the GVA encoding of "3" as a value less than 45 meters at some point in the future.  Therefore, ADS-B Version 2 receiving subsystems should treat the GVA encoding of "3" as less than 45 meters for data received from ADS-B Version Numbers 2 or greater.   

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.9 "Source Integrity Level (Sil)" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The "SIL" (Source Integrity Level) subfield is a 2-bit ("ME" bits 51 and 52, Message bits 
83 and 84) field that **shall** be used to define the probability of the reported horizontal position exceeding the radius of containment defined by the NIC, without alerting, assuming no avionics faults.  Although the SIL assumes there are no unannunciated faults in the avionics system, the SIL must consider the effects of a faulted Signal-in-Space, if a Signal-in-Space is used by the position source.  The probability of an avionics fault causing the reported horizontal position to exceed the radius of containment defined by the NIC, without alerting, is covered by the System Design Assurance (SDA) parameter (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.4.6). 

The SIL probability can be defined as either "per sample" or "per hour" as defined in the SIL Supplement (SILSUPP
2.2.3.2.7.1.3.1
) in Â§
.   

## Notes:

1. For GNSS position sources the HIL or HPL is provided with a probability of 1x10-7
 
per hour, which should be used to set the SIL to 3. 
2. The GPS defined HPL probability rate of 10
-7 per hour is based on the GPS 
constellation fault rate of 10-4 per hour and a 10-3 probability of missed detection, 
given that the fault occurs.  Different containment radii indicated by the HPL are all 
defined at the missed detection probability of 10-3
.    
3. Fault detection is an essential consideration in determining the SIL parameter.  Fault 
detection assures, at a specified probability of missed detection, that the error is no greater than a specified limit without an alert.   
4. For alternate ADS-B position sources to report integrity, they will need to be 
certified for their fault detection characteristics.   
The "SIL" subfield **shall** be encoded in accordance with Table 2-72.  For installations where the SIL value is being dynamically updated, if an update has not been received from an on-board data source for SIL within the past 2 seconds, then the SIL subfield shall be encoded as a value of ZERO (0), indicating "Unknown."   
Note: The SIL and NIC should be set to unknown if the ADS-B position source does not supply an output certified to provide an indication of the integrity of the reported position (e.g., such as HPL from GNSS systems).

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.10 "Barometric Altitude Integrity Code (Nicbaro ) Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The "NIC
BARO
2.2.3.2.3
" (Barometric Altitude Integrity Code) is a 1-bit subfield of "Subtype 0" 
ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Messages ("ME" bit 53, Message bit 85) that **shall** be used to indicate whether or not the barometric pressure altitude being reported in the Airborne Position Message (Â§
) has been cross-checked against another source of pressure altitude.  The "NICBARO " subfield **shall** be encoded in accordance with Table 2-
73.  If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for NICBARO within the past 2 seconds, then the NICBARO
 subfield **shall** be encoded as a value of ZERO (0). 

| Coding                                                          |

|                                                                 |

| The barometric altitude that is being reported in the           |

| input that has not been cross-checked against another source    |
| of pressure altitude                                            |
| 1                                                               |
| The barometric altitude that is being reported in the           |
| Airborne Position Message is either based on a Gilham code      |
| input that has been cross-checked against another source of     |
| pressure altitude and verified as being consistent, or is based |
| on a non-Gilham coded source                                    |

## Notes:

1. The NIC value itself is conveyed within the ADS-B Position Message. 
2. The NICBARO subfield provides a method of indicating a level of data integrity for 
aircraft installed with Gilham encoding barometric altitude sources.  Because of the potential of an undetected error when using a Gilham encoded altitude source, a comparison will be performed with a second source and only if the two sources 
agree will the NICBARO subfield be set to a value of ONE (1).  For other barometric 
altitude sources (Synchro or DADS) the integrity of the data is indicated with a 
validity flag or SSM.  No additional checks or comparisons are necessary.  For these 
sources the NICBARO 
subfield will be set to a value of ONE (1) whenever the 
barometric altitude is valid. 
3. The use of Gilham type altimeters is strongly discouraged because of the potential 
for undetected altitude errors. 

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.11 "Aircraft/Vehicle Length And Width Code" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The Aircraft/Vehicle (A/V) Length and Width Code Subfield is a four-bit field ("ME" bits 21 - 24, Message bits 53 - 56) of the Aircraft Operational Status Messages 
(Subtype=1, for Surface Participants).  This field **shall** describe the amount of space that an aircraft or ground vehicle occupies.  The A/V Length and Width Code is based on the actual dimensions of the transmitting aircraft or surface vehicle as specified in Table 2-
74.  Once the actual Length and Width of the A/V has been determined, each A/V **shall** 
be assigned the smallest A/V Length and Width Code from Table 2-74 for which the actual length is less than or equal to the upper bound length for that Length/Width Code, and for which the actual width is less than or equal to the upper bound width for that Length/Width Code.   
Note: For example, consider a powered glider with overall length of 24 meters and wingspan of 50 meters.  Normally, an aircraft of that length would be in length category 1 (that is, have a length code of 1).  But since the wingspan exceeds 34 meters, it does not qualify for even the "wide" subcategory (width code = 1) of length category 1.  Such an aircraft would be assigned length code = 4 and width code = 1, meaning "length less than 55 meters and width less than 52 meters."

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.12 "Track Angle/Heading" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The Track Angle/Heading subfield is a 1-bit field ("ME" bit 53, Message bit 85) of the ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Message (Subtype=1, for Surface Participants) that allows correct interpretation of the data contained in the Heading/Ground Track subfield of the ADS-B Surface Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.4) when the Air/Ground status is determined to be in the "On-Ground" state as defined in Â§2.2.3.2.1.2.  The encoding of the Track Angle/Heading subfield **shall** be as specified in Table 2-75. 

|   Coding  | Meaning     |
|-----------|-------------|
|        0  | Track Angle |
|        1  | Heading     |

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.13 "Horizontal Reference Direction (Hrd)" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The Horizontal Reference Direction (HRD) subfield of the ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Messages is a 1-bit field ("ME" bit 54, message bit 86) that **shall** indicate the reference direction (true north or magnetic north) for horizontal directions such as heading, track angle.  The Horizontal Reference Direction subfield **shall** be encoded as specified in Table 2-76.   
Note: The HRD flag only applies to the Heading/Ground Track subfield in the Surface Position Message, or the Heading subfield in the Airborne Velocity Message (Subtypes 3 & 4).    

|   Coding  | Meaning        |
|-----------|----------------|
|        0  | True North     |
|        1  | Magnetic North |

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.14 "Sil Supplement" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Messages

The "SIL Supplement" (Source Integrity Level Supplement) subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 
55, Message bit 87) field that **shall** define whether the reported SIL probability is based on a "per hour" probability or a "per sample" probability as defined in Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.3.1, with the encoding specified in Table 2-41.   

## 2.2.3.2.7.2.15 "Reserved" Subfield In Aircraft Operational Status Message

There are two "Reserved" subfields in the Aircraft Operational Status Message.  The first is a 2-bit field ("ME" bits 49 and 50, Message bits 81 and 82) of the Aircraft Operational Status Message (Subtype=1, for Surface Participants).  The second "Reserved" subfield is a 1-bit field ("ME" bit 56, Message bit 88) that **shall** be reserved for future applications. 

## 2.2.3.2.7.3 Type Code "23" Ads-B Messages For "Test"

TYPE "23" ADS-B Messages **shall** be used for Test Purposes.  "TEST" Messages **shall** 
be used exclusively for the broadcast of information in support of bench and/or certification testing of 1090 MHz ADS-B systems, or for the broadcast of information of interest only to local ADS-B ground applications.  "TEST" Message broadcasts will not result in an ADS-B report being generated onboard any other ADS-B equipped aircraft, nor is the specific information being included in the "TEST" Message expected to be generally codified within internationally accepted standards.  "TEST" Messages containing information of interest only to local ADS-B ground applications are intended to be used in support of technical or operational evaluations, or in support of local operational requirements.   
These MOPS define only one category of use for the "TEST" Messages, Subtype=0.  
"TEST" Messages of Subtypes 1 through 7 are reserved. 

"TEST" Messages with Subtype=0 **shall** be used only for messages in support of bench and/or certification testing of 1090 MHz ADS-B systems.  The format for "TEST"

Note: The "Surveillance Status" subfield value of ONE corresponds to the emergency condition activated by Mode A Code 7500, 7600 or 7700 and the change from the value of ONE signals the termination of the emergency condition (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.2).   

e. If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for the 
"Emergency/Priority Status" within the past 2 seconds, then the "Emergency/Priority 
Status" subfield in the Aircraft Status Message **shall** be encoded with a value of 
ZERO (binary 000) indicating "No Emergency."   
Note: The encoding of the "Emergency/Priority Status" subfield values 2, 3 and 6 do 
not have a corresponding Mode A Code value that denotes the emergency 
condition.  The establishment of these emergency conditions by providing a pilot interface to activate them is optional in this version of these MOPS.   

## 2.2.3.2.7.8.1.2 "Mode A (4096) Code" Subfield In Aircraft Status Messages

a. The Mode A (4096) Code subfield in the Aircraft Status Message **shall** be encoded as 
defined in RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.4.1.2 and Â§2.2.13.1.2.b (EUROCAE ED-73E, 
Â§3.5.2 and Â§3.5.6.b).   
b. Starting with "ME" bit 12, the code sequence **shall** be C1, A1, C2, A2, C4, A4, 
ZERO, B1, D1, B2, D2, B4, D4. 
Note: The broadcast of the Mode A (4096) Code in the Aircraft Status Message with 
Subtype=1 is provided as a transitional feature to aid operation of ATC automation systems that use Mode A Code for Flight Plan correlation.  
Provisions are included in these MOPS to disable the broadcast of the Mode A Code.  The requirement for the broadcast of the Mode A Code may be removed from future versions of these MOPS. 
The entry of the Mode A (4096) Code of "1000," disables the broadcast of the Mode A 
(4096) Code as specified in Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1.   

## 2.2.3.2.7.8.2 1090Es Tcas Resolution Advisory (Ra) Broadcast Message (Subtype=2)

The Extended Squitter Aircraft Status Message (TYPE "28") is also used to provide additional information regarding the TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA).  Subtype=2 is used specifically to provide the encoding of this information as specified in Figure 2-15.  
The content of the fields of the 1090ES TCAS RA Message conform to the corresponding bits of transponder Register 3016
, and are specified in ICAO Annex 10, Vol IV, Â§4.3.8.4.2.2.1.

a. The transmission of the Aircraft Status Message with Subtype=2 **shall** begin within 
0.5 seconds after the transponder notification of the initiation of a TCAS Resolution Advisory.   
 
b. The transmission of the Aircraft Status Message with Subtype=2 **shall** be terminated 
24 Â±1 seconds after the Resolution Advisory Termination (RAT) flag transitions from ZERO (0) to ONE (1).   
 
c. Aircraft Status Messages with Subtype=2 **shall** have priority over Aircraft Status 
Messages with Subtype=1, and over all other Event-Driven Messages.   
 

## 2.2.3.2.7.9 Reserved Type Code "30" Ads-B Messages

ADS-B Messages with TYPE Code=30 are Reserved for future expansion. 
Note: The first version of these MOPS (RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102) specified 
TYPE "30" for use in support of Operational Coordination Messages.  The Operational Coordination Messages are no longer required and future editions of these MOPS may specify a different use for TYPE "30" Messages.   
 

## 2.2.3.3 Ads-B Message Transmission Rates 2.2.3.3.1 Transmission Rates For Transponder - Based Transmitters 2.2.3.3.1.1 Transmission Rates Compliant With Rtca Do-181E (Eurocae Ed-73E)

ADS-B transmitters based on Mode S transponders **shall** comply with the Message Transmit Rates specified in RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E), for each class of transponder defined in the latest version of FAA TSO C112 (ETSO 2C112).   

Note: The requirements of RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E) are consistent with 
the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, fourth edition, July 2007, 
Â§3.1.2.8.6.4.   
 

## 2.2.3.3.1.2 Transmission Rates Not Specified In Rtca Do-181E (Eurocae Ed-73E)

When the transmission rate of a particular message type is not specified in RTCA DO- 181E (EUROCAE ED-73E), then the Mode S Transponder-Based ADS-B transmitters shall deliver those messages at the rates specified in the following subparagraphs for Stand Alone Transmitters.  If there is conflict between the requirements of RTCA DO- 181E (EUROCAE ED-73E) and this document, then the requirements of RTCA DO-
181E (EUROCAE ED-73E) **shall** be adhered to.  
Note: The possible transmission time epochs should not be correlated with UTC to preclude inadvertent synchronization of transmissions from different aircraft. 

Table 2-79 summarizes the broadcast rates of the 1090ES ADS-B Messages specified in these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A).

## Notes: 1. Transmitters Are Limited To No More Than 2 Event Driven Messages Per Second.  Therefore, The Average Of 2 Airborne Position, 2 Airborne Velocity, 0.2 Identification, And 2 Periodic Status And Event Driven Messages Per Second, Averaged Over Any 60 Second Interval, Yields The Required 6.2 Messages Per Second.

2. Not all aircraft broadcast the Target State and Status Message (see Table 2-3). 
 

## 2.2.3.3.1.3 Maximum Transmission Rates For Transponder - Based Transmitters

The maximum ADS-B Message transmission rate shall not exceed 6.2 transmitted messages per second averaged over any 60 second interval, distributed as required by RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.23.1.3 (ED-73E, Â§3.28.3).     
Note: Transponders are limited to no more than 2 Event Driven messages per second. 

Therefore, the average of 2 Airborne Position, 2 Airborne Velocity, 0.2 Identification, and 2 Periodic Status and Event Driven messages per second, averaged over any 60 second interval, yields the required 6.2 messages per second.   

## 2.2.3.3.1.4 Ads-B Periodic Status And Event-Driven Message Broadcast Rates

ADS-B Operational Status Messages and Target State and Status Messages are Periodic Status Messages that are broadcast in the same manner as the Airborne Position, Surface Position, Airborne Velocity and Aircraft Identification Messages.  Event-Driven Messages are broadcast at the rates specified under the provisions of the Event-Driven Protocol (see Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.6.1 and Â§A.1.6.4).   

Note:  The Event-Driven Protocol limits event-driven message transmissions to 2 per 
second in any second.  In previous versions of these MOPS, Periodic Status Messages were included under the event-driven protocol.  In these MOPS, the 
analysis contained in Appendix R verifies that the combination of Periodic Status Messages and Event-Driven Messages does not exceed 2 messages per second 
averaged over 60 seconds.   

## 2.2.3.3.1.4.1 Ads-B Target State And Status Message Broadcast Rates

a. The Target State and Status (Subtype=1) Message(s) (TYPE=29, Â§2.2.3.2.7.1) **shall** 
be initiated only when the aircraft is airborne and when target state information is available and valid as a minimum.   
Note: Target state information includes both Selected Altitude and Selected Heading data.  Because only one of these may actually be available in any given installation, then in order to initiate broadcast of the Target State and Status (Subtype=1) Message, either the Selected Altitude or the Selected Heading data must be available and valid as a minimum.  Future versions of these MOPS may include the Barometric Pressure Setting (BPS) as a required parameter in order to initiate the Target State and Status Message.   

b. The Target State and Status Message with a Subtype value of ONE (1) **shall**, for the 
nominal case, be broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 1.2 to 1.3 seconds relative to the previous Target State and Status for as long as data is available to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph "a." above.   
c. The broadcast rates for Target State and Status Messages with a Subtype subfield 
value of other than ONE (1) are not defined by this version of these MOPS.  

## Notes:

1. Future versions of these MOPS may require unique broadcast update intervals 
for each Target State and Status Message Subtype (i.e., unique for each value of 
the Subtype subfield). 
2. Future versions of these MOPS may require that the broadcast rate for Target 
State and Status Messages be temporarily increased (e.g., for 24 seconds) following any change in target state or system status information. 

## 2.2.3.3.1.4.2 Ads-B Aircraft Operational Status Message Broadcast Rates

The rate at which the ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31 and Subtype=0/1, Â§2.2.3.2.7.2) are broadcast is given for various conditions in the following paragraphs:   

a. Airborne Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, Subtype=0) **shall** be

If there has been a change in the TCAS RA Active, NAC
P, SIL or NICSUPP
 
information provided in the Airborne Aircraft Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, Subtype=0), and Target State and Status Messages are being broadcast, then the Airborne Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, Subtype=0) **shall** be broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 2.4 to 2.6 seconds relative to the previous Airborne Aircraft Operational Status Message for as long as data is available to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph "a." above. 

(3). 
Change in TCAS RA Active/NAC
 Data with No Target State 
P/SIL/NICSUPP
and Status: 
If there has been a change in the TCAS RA Active, NAC
P, SIL or NICSUPP 
information provided in the Airborne Aircraft Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, Subtype=0), and Target State and Status Messages are NOT being broadcast, then the Airborne Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, Subtype=0) **shall** be broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds relative to the previous Airborne Aircraft Operational Status Message for a period of 24 Â±1 seconds.   

b. Surface Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, Subtype=1) **shall** be 
broadcast  at the rates given in the following subparagraphs when aircraft operational 
status information is valid and when in the ON-Ground state (i.e., when surface message formats are being broadcast);   
(1). Aircraft/Vehicle Not Moving: 
If the aircraft/vehicle is on-ground and NOT moving, then Surface Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, Subtype=1) **shall** be broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds relative to the previous Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message for as long as data is available to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph "b." above. 

/NAC/SIL Data: 
(2).

If the Aircraft/Vehicle IS Moving and there has been no change in the NIC
SUPP
, NAC, or SIL data provided in the Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, Subtype=1), then the messages shall be broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 2.4 to 2.6 seconds relative to the previous Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message for as long as data is available to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph "b." above. 

(3). Aircraft/Vehicle Is Moving With Change in NIC

SUPP
, NAC, or SIL data provided in the Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message 
(TYPE=31, Subtype=1), then the messages **shall** be broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds relative to the previous Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message for a period of 24 Â±1 seconds. 

## 2.2.3.3.1.4.3 "Extended Squitter Aircraft Status" Ads-B Event-Driven Message Broadcast Rates 2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1 "Emergency/Priority Status Message" Broadcast Rates

The "Emergency/Priority Status Message" (TYPE=28, Subtype=1), (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.8) 
shall be broadcast using the EventâDriven protocol.  The rate of transmission varies depending on other conditions.  If the transmission of the Mode A Code is disabled, the transmission of the "Emergency/Priority Status Message" occurs only when an emergency condition is active.  When the transmission of the Mode A Code is enabled, the transmission rate of the "Emergency/Priority Status Message" depends on whether the Mode A Code is changed, or if an emergency condition is active.   
When the Mode A Code is set to "1000," the 1090ES Transmitting Subsystem **shall** 
disable the transmission of the Mode A Code and broadcast the "Emergency/Priority Message" in accordance with Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1.1 only when an emergency is declared. Otherwise, the Mode A Code transmission is enabled and the broadcast rates of Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1.2 apply.   

Note: The use of Mode A Code "1000" for this purpose is in accordance with the ICAO 
Doc 9871 provision to disable the transmission of the Mode A Code on 1090ES. This will occur at such time that the ATC systems no longer depend on the Mode A Code to identify aircraft.   

## 2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1.1 "Emergency/Priority Status Message" Broadcast Rates When Transmission Of Mode A Code Is Disabled

When the Mode A Code transmission is disabled as per Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1, the following transmit rates apply: 

a. The "Emergency/Priority Status Message" (TYPE=28, Subtype=1) **shall** be 
broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds relative to the previous "Emergency/Priority Status" for the duration of 
the emergency condition which is established by any value other than ZERO in the 
"Emergency/Priority Status" subfield in accordance with (Â§2.2.3.2.7.8.1.1).   
Note: Emergency conditions resulting from the Mode A Code being set to 7500, 
7600 or 7700 are covered by the requirements in Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1.2.   

b. In the case where there is no emergency condition established by a ZERO value in 
the "Emergency/Priority Status" subfield, then the "Emergency/Priority Status 
Message" shall not be broadcast.   

## 2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1.2 "Emergency/Priority Status Message" Broadcast Rates When Transmission Of Mode A Code Is Enabled

When the Mode A Code transmission is enabled as per Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1, the following transmit rates apply: 

a. The "Emergency/Priority Status" (TYPE=28, Subtype=1) **shall** be broadcast at 
random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds 
relative to the previous "Emergency / Priority Status" under the following conditions: (1). For a duration of 24 Â±1 seconds following a Mode A Code change by the pilot 
except if the Mode A Code is changed to 7500, 7600 or 7700.   

Note: The case where the Mode A Code is set to 7500, 7600 or 7700, the 
       transmission of the emergency condition is covered by (2). below.  
       Setting the Mode A Code to 7500, 7600 or 7700 is indicated by a 
       Permanent Alert in the "Surveillance Status" field (value of 1) (see 
       Â§2.2.3.2.3.2).  A change in the Mode A Code, except to 7500, 7600 or 
       7700, is indicated by a Temporary Alert in the "Surveillance Status" 
       subfield (value of 2) (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.2).   

(2). For the duration of an emergency condition by any non-ZERO value in the 
"Emergency/Priority Status" subfield in accordance with (Â§2.2.3.2.7.8.1.1), if the emergency code is cleared by the pilot changing the Mode A Code to other than 7500, 7600 or 7700, the broadcast of the "Emergency/Priority Status" 
Message **shall** be continued for 24 Â±1 seconds as in (1) above. 
b. In the absence of conditions specified in "a" above, the "Emergency/Priority Status" 
Message **shall** be broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over 
the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds relative to the previous "Emergency / Priority Status" Message.    

## 2.2.3.3.1.4.3.2 "Tcas Ra Broadcast Message" Broadcast Rate

A TCAS RA Broadcast (TYPE=28, Subtype=2), **shall** be broadcast using the Event-
Driven Protocol at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds relative to the previous "TCAS RA Broadcast Message" for the duration of the TCAS RA in accordance with Â§2.2.3.2.7.8.2. 

 

## 2.2.3.3.1.4.4 "Type Code=23 (Test)" Ads-B Event-Driven Message Broadcast Rate

The following broadcast rate requirements **shall** apply only under the condition that 
"TEST" Messages of the Subtype indicated are authorized to be transmitted.   
The "TEST" ADS-B Event-Driven Messages with Subtype=0 **shall** be broadcast NOT 
MORE THAN ONCE each time the Event-Driven Test Information is updated to the transponder.   

 

## 2.2.3.3.1.4.5 "Type Codes 24 - 27" And "Type Code=30" Ads-B Event-Driven Message Broadcast Rate

In general, TYPE Codes 24 - 27 ADS-B Event-Driven Messages **shall** be broadcast ONCE each time the Event-Driven TYPE Code 24 - 27 information is updated to the transponder. 

## 2.2.3.3.1.4.6 Ads-B Message Transmission Scheduling

An ADS-B Message scheduling function **shall** be used to determine the sequence of ADS-B Messages to be broadcast and to control the overall transmission rate of Event-
Driven messages.   

## 2.2.3.3.1.4.6.1 Event-Driven Message Scheduling Function

Note: This version of these MOPS does not define the message format for the broadcast of Trajectory Change information (Â§2.2.3.2.7.7).  However it is anticipated that future versions of these MOPS will require the broadcast of Trajectory Change information for all Class A2 and Class A3 airborne systems and will be optional for Class A1S and A1 airborne systems.  The following requirements for the Event-Driven Message Scheduling Function include provisions to accommodate the future addition of messages conveying Trajectory Change information (i.e., message TYPE=27). 

The Event-Driven Message Scheduling Function **shall** ensure that the total Event-Driven message rate does not exceed 2 transmitted messages per second.  This is consistent with the required overall maximum allowed transmission rate specified in Â§2.2.3.3.1.3.  
The Event-Driven Message Scheduling Function **shall** apply the following rules as a means of prioritizing the Event-Driven Message transmissions and limiting the transmission rates: 

a.  The Event-Driven Message scheduling function **shall** reorder, as necessary, pending 
Event-Driven Messages according to the following message priorities, listed below (and in Table 2-156) in descending order from highest to lowest priority: (1). The 
broadcast 
of 
the 
Extended 
Squitter 
Aircraft 
Status 
Message 
(Â§2.2.3.2.7.8.1) TCAS RA Broadcast (TYPE=28, Subtype=2).   
(2). The 
broadcast 
of 
the 
Extended 
Squitter 
Aircraft 
Status 
Message 
(Â§2.2.3.2.7.8.2) Emergency/Priority Condition (TYPE=28, Subtype=1).   
(3). This priority level applies as a default to any Event-Driven Message TYPE and 
Subtype combination not specifically identified at a higher priority level above.  
Event-Driven Messages of this default priority level **shall** be delivered to the 
transponder on a first-in-first-out basis at equal priority.   
b. The Event-Driven Message scheduling function **shall** limit the number of Event-
Driven Messages provided to the transponder to two (2) messages per second.   
Note: It is possible that future versions of these MOPS, requiring a complementary 
change to the Mode S transponder MOPS, will allow for Event-Driven Messages to be transmitted at a rate of greater than the current limit of two (2) messages per second.  Therefore, a means should be provided to allow for a future adjustment to the value used for the message rate limit in the Event-Driven Message scheduling function. 
c. If (b) results in a queue of messages awaiting delivery to the transponder, the higher 
priority pending messages, according to (a) above **shall** be delivered to the 
transponder for transmission before lower priority messages. 
d. If (b) results in a queue of messages awaiting delivery to the transponder, new Event-
Driven messages **shall** directly replace older messages of the same exact TYPE and 
Subtype (where a Subtype is defined) that are already in the pending message queue.  
The updated message **shall** maintain the same position in the message queue as the 
pending message that is being replaced. 
e. If (b) above results in a queue of messages awaiting delivery to the transponder, then 
pending message(s), **shall** be deleted from the message transmission queue if not 
delivered to the transponder for transmission, or not replaced with a newer message of the same message TYPE and Subtype, within the Message Lifetime value 
specified in the Table 2-80 below: 

| Message                 | Message                 | Message Lifetime    |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|

Note: A default message lifetime of 20 seconds will be used for queue management unless otherwise specified. 

## 2.2.3.3.2 Transmission Rates For Stand Alone Transmitters

a. Stand Alone Transmitters for Class A0 and Class B0 equipment are those 
implemented independent of a Mode S transponder.  Such transmitters **shall** meet the 
transmission rate requirements of Â§2.2.3.3.1.3 and the message update rate 
requirements specified in the following subparagraphs. 
b. Extended Squitter messages **shall** be transmitted at random intervals that are 
uniformly distributed over the specified time interval using a time quantization no greater than 15 milliseconds.  
Note: The possible transmission time epochs should not be correlated with UTC to preclude inadvertent synchronization of transmissions from different aircraft. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.1 Power-On Initialization And Start Up 2.2.3.3.2.1.1 Power-On Initialization

a. At power-up initialization, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** start operations 
in a mode in which it transmits NO messages. 
b. Given that appropriate message data is provided to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem, the transmission device **shall** be capable of transmitting ADS-B 
Messages no later than 2.0 seconds after Power-On. 
c. After a power-up initialization exceeding the momentary power interruption 
capability of the equipment, the total set of BITE tests that check all necessary 
functions of the ADS-B device **shall** be completed within 20 seconds.  As a 
minimum, the BITE tests **shall** include RAM, ROM, I/O, Timing, CPU instruction 
integrity, and any associated RF hardware tests necessary to ensure proper functioning of the ADS-B device. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.1.2 Start Up

a. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** initiate broadcast transmissions of the 
Airborne Position, Surface Position, Aircraft Identification and Category, Velocity, Target State and Status, and/or Aircraft Operational Status Messages only when it has 
received appropriate data to structure at least one variable data field of the respective 
message.  As such, each message **shall** be initiated individually and independently of 
the other messages.   
The single exception is presented by Altitude data in the Airborne Position Message which **shall** be processed as follows: The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem shall not initiate broadcast of the Airborne Position Message until horizontal position data has been received.  That is, that altitude data alone shall not be sufficient to initiate broadcast of the Airborne Position Message. 

b. Once ADS-B Message transmission has been initiated the transmission rate of each 
type of ADS-B Message **shall** be as provided in the following paragraphs. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.2 Ads-B Airborne Position Message Broadcast Rate

Once started, ADS-B Airborne Position Messages **shall** be broadcast by the transmission device when in the Airborne state at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.4 to 0.6 seconds relative to the previous Airborne Position Message, with the exceptions as specified in Â§2.2.3.3.2.9. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.3 Ads-B Surface Position Message Broadcast Rate

a. Once started, ADS-B Surface Position Messages **shall** be broadcast by the 
transmission device when in the On-Ground state using either the "High" or "Low" 
broadcast rate, which has been selected as follows:   
(1). Switching from "High" broadcast rate to "Low" broadcast rate: 
(a). 
The broadcast rate **shall** be changed from "High" to "Low" when the 
navigation source position data has not changed more than 10 meters in any 30 second interval.   
Note: It is acceptable to compute the 10 meter distance using either rectangular or polar coordinates.   

(b). Upon selecting the "Low" broadcast rate, the transmission device **shall** 
save the Position data at the time that the "Low" rate was selected.   
(2). Switching from "Low" rate to "High" Rate: 
The broadcast rate **shall** be changed from "Low" to "High" when the position of the transmission device has changed by 10 meters or more since the "Low" rate was selected. 

Note: It is acceptable to compute the 10 meter distance using either rectangular or polar coordinates. 

b. If the "High" broadcast rate is selected, then the Surface Position Message **shall** be 
transmitted at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.4 to 0.6 seconds relative to the previous Surface Position Message.    
Note: When the "High" broadcast rate is selected based on the criteria defined in 
Â§2.2.3.3.2.3.a.(2), then the Movement subfield is provided by the Ground Speed data input as per Â§2.2.5.1.9.a.   

c. If the "Low" broadcast rate is selected, then the Surface Position Messages **shall** be 
transmitted at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds relative to the previous Surface Position Message.   
Note: When the "Low" broadcast rate is selected based on the criteria defined in 
Â§2.2.3.3.2.3.a.(1), then the Movement subfield is encoded to decimal ONE (1) 
(Aircraft Stopped) as per Â§2.2.5.1.9.b.    

d. If the transmission device loses its navigation source, the "High" broadcast rate **shall** 
be used as the default transmission rate.   
e. Exceptions to these transmission rate requirements are specified in Â§2.2.3.3.2.9.   

## 2.2.3.3.2.4 Ads-B Aircraft Identification And Category Message Broadcast Rate

a. Once started, ADS-B Aircraft Identification and Category Messages **shall** be 
broadcast by the transmission device at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds relative to the previous Identification and Category Message, when the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is reporting the 
Airborne Position Message, or when reporting the Surface Position Message at the high rate. 
b. When the Surface Position Message is being reported at the low surface rate, then the 
Aircraft Identification and Category Message **shall** be broadcast at random intervals 
that are uniformly distributed over the range of 9.8 to 10.2 seconds relative to the previous Aircraft Identification and Category Message. 
c. When neither the Airborne Position Message nor the Surface Position Message is 
being transmitted, then the Aircraft Identification and Category Message **shall** be 
broadcast at the rate specified in subparagraph a. 
d. Exceptions to these transmission rate requirements are specified in Â§2.2.3.3.2.9. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.5 Ads-B Velocity Information Message Broadcast Rate

a. Once started, ADS-B Velocity Information Messages **shall** be broadcast by the 
transmission device at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.4 to 0.6 seconds relative to the previous Velocity Information Message. 
b. Exceptions to these transmission rate requirements are specified in Â§2.2.3.3.2.9. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.6 Ads-B Periodic Status Message Broadcast Rates

Operational Status Messages and Target State and Status Messages are Periodic Status Messages that are broadcast independently in the same manner as the Airborne Position, Surface Position, Airborne Velocity and Aircraft Identification Messages.   
Note: In previous versions of these MOPS, Operational Status and Target State and Status Messages were included under the event-driven protocol and subject to the Event-Driven Protocol limit of 2 transmissions per second in any second as per Â§2.2.3.3.2.9.2.  In these MOPS, the analysis contained in Appendix R verifies that the combination of Periodic Status Messages and Event-Driven Messages does not exceed 2 messages per second averaged over 60 seconds. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.6.1 Ads-B Target State And Status Message Broadcast Rates

a. The requirements of Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.1 are applicable. 
b. The Target State and Status Message (TYPE=29, Subtype=1, Â§2.2.3.2.7.1) **shall** be 
broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 1.2 to 1.3 seconds relative to the previous Target State and Status Message for as long as data is available to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph "a." above.   
c. Exceptions to these transmission rate requirements **shall** be as specified in 
Â§2.2.3.3.2.9. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.6.2 Ads-B Aircraft Operational Status Message Broadcast Rates

a. The Aircraft Operational Status Message (TYPE=31 and Subtype=0 and 1) 
(Â§2.2.3.2.7.2) **shall** be broadcast at the rates as specified in Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.2. 
b. Exceptions to these transmission rate requirements **shall** be as defined in Â§2.2.3.3.2.9. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.7 "Extended Squitter Aircraft Status" Ads-B Event-Driven Message Broadcast Rate

a. The rate at which the "Extended Squitter Aircraft Status" (TYPE=28), ADS-B Event-
Driven Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.8) **shall** be broadcast varies as defined in 
Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.   
b. The exceptional conditions specified in Â§2.2.3.3.2.9 **shall** be observed. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.8 Other Ads-B Event-Driven Message Broadcast Rates 2.2.3.3.2.8.1 "Type Code=23 (Test)" Ads-B Event-Driven Message Broadcast Rate

The "TEST" Message with Subtype=0 ADS-B Event-Driven Messages **shall** be broadcast *NOT MORE Than* ONCE each time the Event-Driven Test Information is updated to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  The delay conditions specified in 
Â§2.2.3.3.2.9 **shall** be observed. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.8.2 "Type Codes 24 - 27" Ads-B Event-Driven Message Broadcast Rate

In general, TYPE Code 24 - 27 ADS-B Event-Driven Messages **shall** be broadcast ONCE each time the Event-Driven TYPE Code 24 - 27 information is updated to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  The delay conditions specified in Â§2.2.3.3.2.9 **shall** be observed. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.9 Ads-B Message Transmission Scheduling

a. An ADS-B Message scheduling function **shall** be used to determine the sequence of 
ADS-B Messages to be broadcast and to control the overall transmission rate of Event-Driven messages. 
b. As an exception to the general requirement for the transmission of ADS-B Messages, 
the scheduled message transmission **shall** be delayed if a Mutual Suppression 
interface is active. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.9.1 Scheduling Of Non Event-Driven Messages

The priority for transmission (from highest to lowest) for the message types that are not event-driven **shall** be:   

a. Position Message (either Airborne Position Message, as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3, 
or Surface Position Message, as defined in Â§2.2.3.2.4) 
b. Airborne Velocity Message (Â§2.2.3.2.6) 
c. Aircraft Identification and Category Message (Â§2.2.3.2.5) 
d.  Target State and Status Message (Â§2.2.3.3.2.6.1) 
e.  Operational Status Message (Â§2.2.3.3.2.6.2) 

## 2.2.3.3.2.9.2 Event-Driven Message Scheduling

An Event-Driven Message Scheduling function **shall**: 

a. Ensure that the total Event-Driven Message rate does not exceed 2 transmitted 
messages per second.  This is consistent with the required overall maximum allowed transmission rate specified in Â§2.2.3.3.2.10.  
Note: It is possible that future versions of these MOPS may allow for Event-
Driven messages to be transmitted at a rate of greater than the current limit of two (2) messages per second.  Therefore a means should be provided to allow for a future adjustment to the value used for the message rate limit in the Event-Driven Message scheduling function. 

b. The Event-Driven Message scheduling requirements of Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.6.1 **shall** be 
used as the means of ensuring the Event-Driven message broadcast limit of 2 
messages per second is not exceeded. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.10 Maximum Ads-B Message Transmission Rates

The maximum ADS-B Message transmission rate of non-transponder ADS-B Transmitter implementations shall not exceed 6.2 transmitted messages per second, averaged over any 60 second interval. 

Note: It is possible that future versions of these MOPS may allow for ADS-B Messages 
to be transmitted at a rate of greater than the current limit of 6.2 messages per second.  Therefore a means should be provided to allow for a future adjustment to the value used for the message rate limit in the message scheduling function. 

## 2.2.3.3.2.11 Ads-B Data Subfield Timeout Notes:

1. These data subfields are cleared to prevent the reporting of outdated position and 
velocity information.   
2. During a register timeout event, the "ME" field of the ADS-B Broadcast Message 
may contain ALL ZEROs, except for those fields that may be updated due to the receipt of new data.   
3. All references in this subsection relate to the treatment of data subfields in specific 
ADS-B Messages after the data in that subfield has not been refreshed for some specified period of time, known as a "timeout."  The requirements for terminating the actual transmission of ADS-B Messages are specified separately in the subparagraphs of Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.   
a. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** clear all but the altitude and surveillance 
status subfields of the Airborne Position Message, if no new position data is received 
within two (2) seconds of the previous input data update.   
Note: During a timeout event the Format TYPE Code is set to ZERO (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.3.1.3.1).   

b. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** clear all 56-bits of the Surface Position 
Message if no new position data is received within two (2) seconds of the previous input data update.   

## Notes:

1. During a timeout event the Format TYPE Code is set to ZERO (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.3.1). 
2. When position is available, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem manages the 
movement and the ground track subfields such that the subfields and applicable status bits are set to ZERO (0) if no new data is received for the subfield within 
2.6 seconds of the last data update of the subfield.   
3. When position data is not received, all bits of the Surface Position Message are 
set to ZERO to avoid confusion with altitude data in the Airborne Position 
Message sent with TYPE Code ZERO (0).   
c. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** clear all 56-bits of the Airborne Velocity 
Message if no data is received within 2.6 seconds of the previous input data update.   
Note: The Intent Change information is not sufficient to consider that new data has been received (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.3).   

d. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem shall not clear the Aircraft Identification 
Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.5).   
Note: The Aircraft Identification Message, is not cleared since it contains data that rarely changes in flight and is not frequently updated.   

e. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** clear each of the Selected Altitude, 
Selected Heading, or Barometric Pressure Setting subfields of the Target State and Status Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.1) if no new data is received within 2.0 seconds of the 
previous input data update for the respective subfield.  Each of the subfields **shall** be 
cleared independently of the other subfields.  That is, each of the three specified 
subfields **shall** be processed mutually exclusively of the other two specified subfields.  The remaining subfields of the Target State and Status Message **shall not** 
be cleared, as they contain other integrity, mode, or status information.   
f. 
The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall not** clear the Operational Status Messages 
(see Â§2.2.3.2.7.2) since the subfields of the Message contain various integrity, mode, 
or status information.   
g. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem shall not clear the Event-Driven Messages (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.7.8).   
Note: The Event-Driven Messages do not need to be cleared since contents of such messages are only broadcast once each time that new data is received.   

## 2.2.3.3.2.12 Ads-B Message Termination

Note: The subsections below contain requirements for terminating transmission of ADS-B Messages.  These requirements are in response to data timeout conditions or in response to terminating transmission of other ADS-B Messages.  
Requirements in the subparagraphs of Â§2.2.3.3.2.11 relate to the treatment of data subfields in specific ADS-B Messages after the data in that subfield has not been refreshed for some specified period of time, known as a "timeout."   

a. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** terminate broadcast transmissions of the 
Airborne Position Message when position (latitude/longitude) and altitude data are 
not available for a period of 60 seconds.   
Note: For the Airborne Position Message, altitude data alone is sufficient to 
maintain broadcast of the Message once the Message has been initiated. When only altitude data is available, the Airborne Position Message 
continues to be transmitted even after 60 seconds.  However, if the altitude 
data is not available for 60 seconds, then the Airborne Position Message 
transmission is terminated and the conditions for start-up defined in 
Â§2.2.3.3.2.1.2 are necessary to resume the transmission of Airborne Position 
Message.   
b. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** terminate the transmission of Surface 
Position Messages if position data that is necessary to update the Message is not available for a period of 60 seconds.  Transmission termination of Surface Position Messages does not apply to Non-Transponder Devices on aircraft that are on the surface, or on surface vehicles.   
Note: For the Surface Position Message, the receipt of new Movement, or Heading/Ground Track data is not sufficient to maintain broadcast of the message once the message has been initiated.    

c. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall not** terminate broadcast transmissions of 
Aircraft Identification and Category Message even if input data necessary to update the Message is not available.   
d. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** terminate broadcast transmissions of the 
Airborne Velocity Message if input data necessary to update the subfields of the 
Airborne Velocity Message, other than the Intent Change Flag, is not available for a period of 2.6 seconds.   

## Notes:

1. The receipt of new data necessary to update any single subfield, other than the 
Intent Change Flag, is sufficient to maintain broadcast of the Airborne Velocity Message.   
2. Previous versions of these MOPS required the Airborne Velocity Message to be 
transmitted for an additional 60 seconds with ALL ZEROs including the TYPE Code field.  In the event of a loss of GPS data the Airborne Position Message would have barometric altitude in it, the Airborne Velocity Message would not. However, a receiver could not determine the difference between these cases, 
therefore the transmitted altitude was not usable.   
e. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** continue to broadcast the Target State and 
Status Message for as long as Airborne Position Messages are being broadcast.   

## Note: The Broadcast Of Target State And Status (Subtype=1) Messages May Be

terminated either: (1) as a result of the requirements of Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.1.b if the target state information is no longer available or valid, or (2) if the broadcast of the Airborne Position Message has been terminated (see Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.a), since the Target State and Status Messages contain various integrity, mode, or status information that is applicable to the Airborne Position Messages, data which becomes irrelevant if the broadcast of the Airborne Position Message has been terminated.    

f. 
The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** continue to broadcast the Operational 
Status Messages for as long as Airborne Position Messages or Surface Position Messages are being broadcast.    

## Note: The Broadcast Of The Aircraft Operational Status Messages (Either Subtype 0

or 1) may be terminated only after the termination of the respective Airborne (see Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.a) or Surface (see Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.b) Position Messages, since the Operational Status Messages contain various integrity, mode, version number, or status information that is applicable to the respective Position Messages, data which becomes irrelevant if the broadcast of that Position Message has been terminated.    

g. Class B2 Non-Transponder-Based Transmitting Subsystems on Ground Vehicles 
shall provide an interface capable of putting the unit into a standby condition in 
which the unit suspends all message transmissions.   

## Notes:

1. This interface is intended to be used by a mapping function that will 
automatically trigger the interface if the Transmitting Subsystem is outside a user adaptable two-dimensional geographic area. 
2. If required because of spectrum considerations, the two-dimensional geographic 
area will be defined as the movement area (i.e., runways and taxiways) plus a reasonable buffer area (i.e., 50 foot buffer).  Implementations of this feature should be designed such that a particular ground authority can specify a region that conserves spectrum without introducing risk of accidental termination within the movement area.  Consideration should be given to precision and accuracy of the geographic region definition. 
3. As a vendor option, this mapping function may be implemented integral to the 
Class B2 equipment.  In this case, the interface is internal to the unit. 

## 2.2.3.4 Ads-B Transmitted Message Error Protection

Error protection **shall** be provided by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem encoding all messages in accordance with the requirements provided in RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.18.2.1 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.22.2.1) and illustrated in Figure 2-11 of RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E, Figure 3-9). 

Note: The requirements of RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.18.2.1 and Figure 2-11 (EUROCAE 
ED-73E, Â§3.22.2.1 and Figure 3-9) are consistent with the requirements of ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, fourth edition, July 2007, Â§3.1.2.3.3.   

## 2.2.4 Ads-B Receiver Characteristics 2.2.4.1 Minimum Triggering Level (Mtl) Definition

a. The sensitivity of the ADS-B Receiver is sufficient to reliably detect and decode 
ADS-B Messages provided the received power is at or above a certain level.  The 
receiver sensitivity requirements are stated in terms of the Minimum Triggering Level (MTL) specified in the following paragraphs. 
b. Given a valid ADS-B Message signal that complies with the frequency, pulse spacing 
and pulse width requirements, and in the absence of interference or overloads, the 
MTL of an ADS-B receiver is defined as the received power level that results in a successful message reception ratio of 90%. 

## 2.2.4.2 Receivers Shared With A Tcas Unit

a. ADS-B Receiving Subsystems implemented as part of a TCAS unit **shall** comply 
with all receiver requirements specified in the TCAS MOPS, RTCA DO-185B, Â§2.2.4.4 (EUROCAE ED-143, Â§2.2.4.4). 
b. ADS-B Receiving Subsystems operating with TCAS units that are more sensitive 
than the MTL requirements specified in RTCA DO-185B (EUROCAE ED-143), 
shall implement the capabilities specified in Â§2.2.4.2.1 through Â§2.2.4.4. 
Note: The TCAS MOPS, RTCA DO-185B (EUROCAE ED-143), uses the term 
"Extended Squitter" to refer to messages having the same formats and transmission requirements as those messages referred to as ADS-B Messages in this document.  These terms should be accepted as being equivalent when referring to the TCAS system.   

## 2.2.4.2.1 Dual Minimum Triggering Levels

Note: A TCAS receiver that is also used as an ADS-B receiver will have a minimum 
triggering level (MTL) that is more sensitive than a standard TCAS receiver. Such a receiver must implement dual MTLs so that it is capable of setting an indication for each squitter reception as to whether the reply would have been detected by a TCAS operating with a standard MTL.  Squitter receptions received at the standard MTL will be passed to the TCAS surveillance function for further processing.  Squitter receptions that do not meet this condition will be not passed 
to the TCAS surveillance function. 

## 2.2.4.2.1.1 Tcas Compatibility

No more than 10% of all ADS-B Messages received at an input signal level of -78 dBm or less **shall** be delivered to the TCAS functions specified in RTCA DO-185B 
(EUROCAE ED-143). 

Note: Use of the standard TCAS MTL (-74 Â±2dB as specified in RTCA DO-185B 
Â§2.2.4.4.1.1.a (EUROCAE ED-143, Â§2.2.4.4.1.1.a)) for the TCAS surveillance functions preserves the current operation of TCAS surveillance when operating with a receiver with an improved MTL, such as those inferred in Â§2.2.4.3.1.   

## 2.2.4.2.1.2 Ads-B Compatibility

All ADS-B Messages **shall** be processed in accordance with Â§2.2.4.3.1.1. 

## 2.2.4.2.2 Re-Triggerable Reply Processor

The TCAS Mode S reply processing function **shall** use a Mode S reply processor that will re-trigger if it detects a Mode S preamble that is at least 3 dB stronger than the reply that is currently being processed if the signal level of the reply currently being processed is at or below -24 dBm in order to ensure that the stronger signal is processed.   

Note: Care must be taken to ensure that low-level squitters (i.e., those below the 
nominal TCAS MTL) do not interfere with the processing of acquisition squitters for TCAS.  This may happen if the low-level squitter is allowed to capture the 
reply processor.  This may be prevented by using a separate reply processor for each function, or by requiring the reply processor to be re-triggered by a higher level squitter message. 

## 2.2.4.3 Receivers Not Shared With Tcas 2.2.4.3.1 In-Band Acceptance And Re-Triggerable Capability 2.2.4.3.1.1 In-Band Acceptance

The requirements provided in the following subparagraphs are specified at the Antenna end of an Antenna to Receiver transmission line having loss equal to the maximum for which the receiving installation is designed. 

a. The MTL of an ADS-B receiver processing signals over the frequency range of 1089 
to 1091 MHz **shall** comply with the MTL limits provided in Table 2-81 for the 
applicable receiver Equipment Class. 

EQUIPMENT 
CLASS 
A0 
A1S/A1 
A2 
A3 
MTL  
-72 dBm  
-79 dBm 
-79 dBm 
-84 dBm 

Note: The MTL limits of Table 2-81 must be complied with over the entire environmental operating range specified by the manufacturer of the receiver 
(e.g., receiver performance variations over temperature and other conditions must be taken into account). 

b. In the absence of interference or overloads, each ADS-B receiver **shall** properly 
detect and decode at least 99% of all ADS-B Messages received at an input signal level between the levels of MTL  + 3 dB and 0 dBm.   
c. In the absence of interference or overloads, each ADS-B receiver of equipment Class 
A3 **shall** properly detect and decode at least 15% of all ADS-B Messages received at 
an input signal level of -87 dBm. 

## Notes:

1. This requirement need only be tested under ambient conditions. 2. The intent of this requirement is to emphasize the desirability of taking 
advantage of signals received below the required MTL. 

## 2.2.4.3.1.2 Re-Triggerable Capability

ADS-B receivers having Equipment Class A1S, A1, A2 or A3 capability **shall** re-trigger if such receivers detect an ADS-B Message having a preamble that is at least 3 dB stronger than that of the message that is currently being processed if the signal level of the message currently being processed is at or below -24 dBm.   
Note: This requirement is required in order to ensure that the ADS-B processor will properly detect and process the stronger signal. 

## 2.2.4.3.2 Out-Of-Band Rejection

For out-of-band signals the ADS-B Message signal level required to provide 90 percent ratio of decoded and accepted messages to the number of actual messages transmitted shall increase relative to the equipment MTL at 1090 MHz as provided in Table 2-82. 

| Message                  |
|--------------------------|
| Frequency Difference     |
| (MHz from 1090 MHz)      |
| Triggering Level         |
| (dB above MTL)           |
| + 5.5                    |
| Greater Than or Equal to |
| 3                        |
|                          |
| + 10                     |
| Greater Than or Equal to |
| 20                       |
|                          |
| + 15                     |
| Greater Than or Equal to |
| 40                       |
|                          |
| + 25                     |
| Greater Than or Equal to |
| 60                       |
|                          |

## 2.2.4.3.3 Dynamic Minimum Trigger Level (Dmtl)

ADS-B single receiver systems **shall** implement Dynamic Minimum Trigger Level 
(DMTL) control as a mean of rejecting low level multipath signals and interference. 

If the enhanced reception techniques (Â§2.2.4.4) are used, then the DMTL characteristics shall be compatible with the requirements in Â§2.2.4.4.  Otherwise, the DMTL characteristics shall be compatible with the requirements in Â§2.2.4.3.4.1 through Â§2.2.4.3.4.3. 

## 2.2.4.3.4 1090 Mhz Ads-B Message Reception Techniques 2.2.4.3.4.1 Ads-B Message Reception

a. When listening for ADS-B Messages and upon receipt of a single pulse of greater 
than 300 nanoseconds duration and having amplitude A, where A exceeds MTL +8 
dB, the receiver threshold **shall** increase to A -6 dB Â±1 dB for a period of not less 
than five microseconds following the leading edge of the first pulse and **shall** be 
recovered in not more than eight microseconds, unless a valid or qualifying preamble 
is received (Â§2.2.3.1.1), in which case the threshold **shall** be held at A -6 dB Â±1 dB 
for a period of not less than 115 microseconds and **shall** be recovered in not more 
than 120 microseconds.   
The receiver threshold **shall** at no time exceed A -5 dB except for possible overshoot during the first microsecond following the leading edge of the first pulse.   

b. If A is less than MTL +8 dB, there is no requirement to raise the threshold.   

## Notes:

1. The length of an ADS-B Message cannot be determined with certainty by the DMTL 
system.  Therefore, the ADS-B Message DMTL desensitizes for the duration of the 
ADS-B Message. 
2. These requirements are consistent with the requirements of RTCA DO-185, 
Â§2.2.2.3.2.  Note that there is no direct correlation to these requirements provided in RTCA DO-185A.  In fact, RTCA DO-185A has deleted the DMTL requirements 
previously provided and relied completely on Whisper Shout level control techniques 
to provide multipath rejection (see RTCA DO-185A Â§2.2.4.5.1).  Likewise, RTCA 
DO-185B is consistent with RTCA DO-185A in that it only provides the multipath 
rejection requirements in Â§2.2.4.5.1.   

## 2.2.4.3.4.2 Narrow Pulse Discrimination

The DMTL control shall not be responsive to pulses that have a width of less than 0.3 
microseconds.   
Note: These requirements are consistent with the requirements of RTCA DO-185B, 
Â§2.2.4.5.1.2.1 (EUROCAE ED-143, Â§2.2.4.5.1.2.1).   

## 2.2.4.3.4.3 Tacan And Dme Discrimination

The DMTL control shall not be responsive to TACAN or DME pulses. 

Note: These requirements are consistent with the requirements of RTCA DO-185B, 
Â§2.2.4.5.1.2.2 (EUROCAE ED-143, Â§2.2.4.5.1.2.2).   

## 2.2.4.3.4.4 Pulse Characteristics Of Received Ads-B Messages

All pulse characteristics of the ADS-B Messages were previously specified in Â§2.2.2.2.1 
and Â§2.2.3.1 and associated subparagraphs of this document. 

## 2.2.4.3.4.5 Message Formats

The 1090 MHz receiver **shall** correctly decode all valid ADS-B Messages received in accordance with the requirements specified in Â§2.2.4.3.1.1 through Â§2.2.4.3.4.4.  A valid Extended Squitter message follows the format specified in RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E) with the "PI" field specified with "II"=0 and "SI"=0. General formats of the Extended Squitter (i.e., ADS-B) Messages was provided is 
Â§2.2.3.1 through Â§2.2.3.2.1.7 of this document.   

## 2.2.4.3.4.6 Description Of 1090 Mhz Ads-B Message Received Signals

Formats of ADS-B transmitted messages were previously specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3 through 
Â§2.2.3.2.7 of this document. 

## 2.2.4.3.4.7 Ads-B Signal Reception 2.2.4.3.4.7.1 Criteria For Ads-B Message Transmission Pulse Detection

a. ADS-B Message transmission pulse decoding **shall** be based on pulse leading edges. 
Note: The occurrence of a leading edge may be determined directly from a positive slope or inferred from pulse widths and trailing edge positions.  An actual leading edge is defined as an event for which:  the signal rises at a rate exceeding 48 dB per microsecond to a level above the receiver threshold AND 0.125 microseconds later the rate of rise is less than 48 dB per microsecond.  An inferred leading edge is defined as an event in which a leading edge is assumed to exist in order to account for a pulse whose width implies the existence of overlapping pulses. 

a. All performance requirements **shall** be met for pulses having the following 
characteristics: 
(1). 
Pulse Amplitude Variation: 
up to +2 dB, relative to the amplitude of the first preamble pulse 
(2). 
Pulse rise time: 
0.1 microsecond or less 
(3). 
Pulse decay time: 
0.2 microseconds or less 
 

## 2.2.4.3.4.7.2 Criteria For Preamble Acceptance

The first qualifying criterion for reception of an ADS-B 1090 MHz message signal **shall** be the reception of the Preamble (Â§2.2.3.1.1).  A preamble **shall** be accepted if each of the four pulse positions of the preamble waveform contains a pulse that is above the receiver threshold for at least 75 percent of its nominal duration, AND the last three pulses are within +0.125 microseconds of their nominal position relative to the first pulse, AND at least two of the four preamble pulses have actual leading edges (as specified in 
Â§2.2.4.3.4.7.1.a) that occur within +0.125 microseconds of their nominal edge positions.  
All inferred leading edges **shall** occur within +0.125 microseconds of the expected nominal position. 

Note: Appendix "I" provides description of an improved implementation. 

## 2.2.4.3.4.7.3 Criteria For Data Block Acceptance In Ads-B Message Signals

ADS-B Messages always contain 112 data bits.  Each bit of the 1090 MHz ADS-B 
Message Data Block **shall** be decoded by comparing the received signal with a 0.5 
microsecond delayed replica of itself to determine the difference between the signal amplitudes at the centers of the two possible pulse positions for that bit. 

The ADS-B transmission **shall** be accepted as a valid ADS-B Message if: 

a. The first five bits of the data block contain either the code 1 0001 or 1 0010 (i.e., 
either DF=17 or DF=18); 
b. AND no error is detected, OR error correction performed in accordance with 
Â§2.2.4.4.2.2.d and Appendix A, Section 3 of RTCA DO-185B (EUROCAE ED-143, 
Â§2.2.4.4.2.2.d) can be successfully applied, AND no more than seven consecutive 
data bits fail the following confidence test: 
Sample the received signal at least eight times during the one microsecond bit interval to determine if the amplitude of the received signal is above or below the dynamic minimum triggering level of the receiver.  The data bit **shall** be declared a high-confidence bit if, between the first and second of the two possible pulse positions for that bit, the difference in the number of samples for which the signal is above DMTL is at least three AND the sign of this difference agrees with the decoded value of the bit. 

## Notes:

1. Alternative equivalent methods are acceptable, provided that the manufacturer 
provides evidence that performance is not degraded. 
2. Acceptance of ADS-B transmissions with the first five bits identified as 
1 0011 (i.e., DF=19) is optional. 

## 2.2.4.3.5 Ads-B Receiver Duty Factor

Available ADS-B receiver duty factor (i.e., the percentage of time that the ADS-B 
Message Reception function is able to receive and process ADS-B Messages at the required ADS-B MTL), when the receiver is shared with another receiving function using the 960-1215 MHz band, is an important consideration in meeting the intended ranges of operation for ADS-B equipment.  The available ADS-B receiver duty factor **shall** be 90% 
or greater, averaged over a 10 second period.  As an exception, if the available ADS-B 
receiver duty factor is less than 90 percent, techniques for achieving equivalent performance may be proposed and substantiated by analysis.   

## 2.2.4.4 Enhanced Squitter Reception Techniques 2.2.4.4.1 Need For Enhanced Techniques

The 1090 MHz ADS-B Message Reception Techniques specified in Â§2.2.4.3.4 provide a high probability of correct reception when the desired squitter is overlapped with one ATCRBS interfering reply of equal or greater power.  In some high interference environments (e.g., Los Angeles or Frankfurt, Germany), there is a relatively high probability that the desired squitter signal will be overlapped with two or more ATCRBS replies.  In these environments, the air-to-air range may be reduced because of the effects of this interference. 

## 2.2.4.4.2 Enhanced Squitter Reception Technique Overview

Enhanced squitter reception techniques have been developed (see Appendix I) that provide the ability to receive squitters with multiple overlapping Mode A/C FRUIT.  
Such enhanced reception techniques are composed of the following elements: 

a. Improved preamble detection to reduce the probability of a false alarm caused by 
detection of an apparent Mode S preamble synthesized by overlapped Mode A/C FRUIT replies. 
b. Improved code and confidence bit declaration typically based on the use of amplitude 
to aid in the interpretation of the squitter data block. 
c. More capable error correction techniques that are optimized to the characteristics of 
the code and confidence process. 
Class A1S, A1, A2 and A3 equipment **shall** demonstrate compliance with test procedures specified in Â§2.4.4.4 and its subparagraphs. 

Note: The full set of enhanced techniques are applicable to Class A2 and A3 receiving 
equipment.  Class A1S and A1 receiving equipment requires only a subset of the enhanced reception capabilities, and this is reflected in the test procedures of 
Â§2.4.4.4 and its subparagraphs.   

## 2.2.4.4.3 Error Correction 2.2.4.4.3.1 Error Correction Requirements

The ADS-B Receiving Subsystem **shall** either 

a. use "conservative" and "brute force" error correction techniques as defined in Â§I.4.3, 
or 
b. use alternative error correction techniques that are demonstrated to provide no more 
than 1 x (10-6
) report error rate. 

## 2.2.4.4.3.2 Error Correction Restrictions

The enhanced reception techniques are intended to operate in very high Mode A/C FRUIT environments.  For this reason, the sliding window error correction technique shall not be used in conjunction with the enhanced techniques since it produces an unacceptably high undetected error rate in these high FRUIT environments. 

Note: See Appendix I, Â§I.3.3 and Â§I.4.3 for more details on error correcting techniques. 

## 2.2.4.5 Ads-B Received Message Error Protection

a. Error protection **shall** be provided by the ADS-B Receiving Subsystems decoding all 
messages that have been encoded in accordance with the requirements provided in 
RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.18.2.1.c and illustrated in Figure 2-11 of RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.22.2.1.c and Figure 3-10). 
b. Error correction techniques for equipment class A0 **shall** be applied by the ADS-B 
Receiving Subsystems in accordance with RTCA DO-185B, Appendix A, Â§A.3 (EUROCAE ED-143, Â§A.3).   
c. Error correction techniques for equipment Classes A1S, A1, A2 and A3 are specified 
in Â§2.2.4.4.2.

and Â§2.2.3.2.6.4) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.15 and Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.15, 
respectively, 
(4). The "Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.15) in 
the Airborne Velocity Subtype "1 & 2" (see Â§2.2.3.2.6.1 and Â§2.2.3.2.6.2) as 
specified in Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.15 and Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.15, respectively, and 
(5). The "Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.15) in 
the Airborne Velocity Subtype "3 & 4" (see Â§2.2.3.2.6.3 and Â§2.2.3.2.6.4) as 
specified in Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.15 and Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.15, respectively, 
If appropriate "GNSS Height Above the Ellipsoid (HAE)" data is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, then the device **shall** set all subfields identified above in subparagraphs (1). through (5). to ZERO. 

c. **GNSS Altitude (MSL)**

b.(1). through b.(5). to ZERO. 

## 2.2.5.1.6 Time Data And Time Mark Pulse

The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** accept GPS/GNSS Time Mark information as provided in the following subparagraphs.   

## 2.2.5.1.6.1 Case, Where Time ("T") = 0

a. If the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is not capable of setting the "TIME" ("T") 
subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.5) in the Airborne Position Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.3) or in the 
Surface Position Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.4), then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem 
shall set the "TIME" subfield to ZERO.   
b. Whenever the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is setting the "TIME" ("T") subfield 
to ZERO as provided in subparagraph "a," then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem 
shall not be required to accept and process GPS/GNSS Time Mark information.   

## 2.2.5.1.6.2 Case, Where Time ("T") = 1

a. Establishing the Time Mark Reference (TMR) 
The leading edge of the Time Mark indicates the beginning of the USER TIME EPOCH (Figure 8-3, ARINC-743A).  The UTC time indicates the UTC Time at the leading edge of the Time Mark and may or may not be at the beginning or end of an UTC EPOCH.   
The UTC of Time Mark **shall** be used to establish synchronization of the position data to the 200 millisecond UTC sub-epochs.  Refer to Appendix "S" which provides an acceptable method of establishing the required synchronization to the Time Mark Reference (TMR) based on UTC of Time Mark.   

## Notes:

1. When synchronization is required, in addition to accepting the Time Tag 
information, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem needs to accept appropriate 
UTC time information in order to establish the EVEN or ODD Epoch and the appropriate EVEN or ODD 0.2 second sub-epochs.   
Typically, this information can be determined from the ARINC-743A label "140" and "150" words. (See Â§2.2.5.1.53 and Â§2.2.5.1.54.    

2. If UTC Time indicates that the beginning of the EPOCH is within Â±5 
milliseconds of the leading edge of the Time Mark, then the GPS/GNSS Time Mark can be used to establish the Time Mark Reference (TMR) that represents 
the time of applicability as discussed in Â§2.2.5.1.6.2.b.   
b. The leading edge of the GPS/GNSS Time Mark pulse, or equivalent (e.g., TMR, see 
Â§2.2.5.1.6.2.a.(2)), indicates the exact moment (epoch of the UTC time scale) that 
represents the time of applicability of Position, Velocity, and Time (PVT) 
information that is received from the navigation source.  The ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem **shall** determine the leading edge to within Â±5 milliseconds.   
Note: A possible implementation of the GPS/GNSS Time Mark pulse is illustrated in Figure 2-16.  The PVT data is expected to be provided by the navigation data source no later than 200 milliseconds after the leading edge of the GPS/GNSS Time Mark pulse, or equivalent.   

c. When the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem sets the TIME ("T") subfield to ONE in 
the Airborne Position Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.3), then the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem **shall** use the GPS/GNSS Time Mark pulse or TMR (see 
Â§2.2.5.1.6.2.a.(2)) to accomplish the following: 
(1). Synchronize the loading of the Airborne Position Message such that the 
register is properly loaded 100 milliseconds Â±50 milliseconds prior to the time 
of applicability of the data being loaded into the register. 
(2). Establish the "Time" subfield in ADS-B Airborne Position Messages (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.3) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3.5.   
(3). Establish the "CPR Format" subfield in ADS-B Airborne Position Messages 
(see Â§2.2.3.2.3) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3.6.   
(4). Extrapolate Airborne Latitude Position in ADS-B Airborne Position Messages 
(see Â§2.2.3.2.3) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.2. 
(5). Extrapolate Airborne Longitude Position in ADS-B Airborne Position 
Messages (see Â§2.2.3.2.3) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.2.   
d. When the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem sets the TIME ("T") subfield to ONE in 
the Surface Position Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.4), then the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem **shall** use the GPS/GNSS Time Mark pulse or TMR (see 
Â§2.2.5.1.6.2.a.(2)) to accomplish the following: 
(1). Synchronize the loading of the Surface Position Message such that the register 
is properly loaded 100 milliseconds Â±50 milliseconds prior to the time of 
applicability of the data being loaded into the register.   
(2). Establish the "Time" subfield in ADS-B Surface Position Messages (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.4) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.5.   
(3). Establish the "CPR Format" subfield in ADS-B Surface Position Messages (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.4) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.6.   
(4). Extrapolate Surface Latitude Position in ADS-B Surface Position Messages 
(see Â§2.2.3.2.4) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.2.   
(5). Extrapolate Surface Longitude Position in ADS-B Surface Position Messages 
(see Â§2.2.3.2.4) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.2.    

## Position, Velocity, And Time (Pvt)

 
Note: Navigation and UTC time information should be available within 200 
milliseconds following the leading edge of the Time Mark at time t0.  The information is considered to be valid at time t0.  Specifically, the information is NOT projected to be valid at time t1
, which represents the beginning of the next GPS/GNSS Epoch. 

## 2.2.5.1.7 Own Position Latitude Data

The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** accept own position Latitude information via an appropriate variable data input interface and use such data to establish subfields in ADS-B transmitted messages as follows: 

a. The encoded Latitude subfield in the Airborne Position Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.3) as 
specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3.7 through Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.4, 
b. The encoded Latitude subfield in the Surface Position Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.4) as 
specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.7 through Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.4, 
Note: Encoded Latitude for the Airborne and the Surface Position Messages will normally not be the same.  However, the procedures used to obtain the Encoded Latitude for either case are essentially the same in the CPR algorithm. (See Appendix A). 

c. If Latitude data is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, then the 
device **shall** enter ALL ZEROs into the Encoded Latitude subfield of the Airborne 
Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.3) when airborne or into the Encoded Latitude subfield of 
the Surface Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.4) when on the surface.  
Note: Any airport surface application(s) that will use ADS-B surface position information will need to account for the potential navigation error associated with the reported position relative to the navigation center of the aircraft. 

## 2.2.5.1.8 Own Position Longitude Data

The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** accept own position Longitude information via an appropriate variable data input interface and use such data to establish subfields in ADS-B transmitted messages as follows:

specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3.8 through Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.4, 
b. The encoded Longitude subfield in the Surface Position Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.4) as 
specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.8 through Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.4, 
Note: Encoded Longitude for the Airborne and the Surface Position Messages will normally not be the same.  However, the procedures used to obtain the Encoded Longitude for either case are essentially the same in the CPR algorithm.  (See Appendix A). 

c. If Longitude data is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, then the 
device **shall** enter ALL ZEROs into the Encoded Longitude subfield of the Airborne 
Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.3) when airborne or into the Encoded Longitude subfield 
of the Surface Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.4) when on the surface.  
Note: Any airport surface application(s) that will use ADS-B surface position information will need to account for the potential navigation error associated with the reported position relative to the navigation center of the aircraft. 

 

## 2.2.5.1.9 Ground Speed Data

a. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** accept own vehicle Ground Speed 
information via an appropriate variable data input interface and use such data to establish the "Movement" subfield (see Â§2.2.3.2.4.2) in the Surface Position Message 
as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.2, except when the system has selected the "Low" broadcast 
rate as per Â§2.2.3.3.2.3.c.   
b. When the system has selected the low broadcast rate of Surface Position Message as 
per Â§2.2.3.3.2.3.c, then the device **shall** enter the encoding of decimal ONE (1) 
(Aircraft stopped) into the Movement subfield specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.2.   
c. A low broadcast rate forced by an external RCS command as described in RTCA 
DO-181E, Â§2.2.23.1.6 (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.28.6) **shall** have no impact on the 
encoding of values in the Movement subfield.   
d.  If Ground Speed data is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, then 
the device **shall** enter ALL ZEROs into the Movement subfield specified in 
Â§2.2.3.2.4.2.   
e. Ground Speed may be used in conjunction with Ground Track data to arithmetically 
establish East/West Velocity Data (see Â§2.2.5.1.2) and North/South Velocity Data 
(see Â§2.2.5.1.3) if East/West and/or North/South Velocity Data is not available. 
(1). When Ground Speed data is used as provided in subparagraph "c," the NACV
2.2.5.1.19
 
(see Â§
) data reported by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** be 
consistent with the accuracy, range, and resolution that can be obtained by using Ground Speed data as the input data to the arithmetic computations necessary.   
(2). When Ground Speed data is used as provided in subparagraph "c," but Ground 
Speed Data is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, then the 
device **shall** enter ALL ZEROs into all transmitted subfields that are computed 
based on Ground Speed data.   

## 2.2.5.1.10 Heading/Ground Track Data

The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** accept own vehicle Heading/Ground Track information via an appropriate variable data input interface and use such data to establish subfields in transmitted ADS-B Messages as follows: 

a. The "Status Bit for Heading/Ground Track" subfield in the Surface Position Message 
(See Â§2.2.3.2.4) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.3, 
b. The "Heading/Ground Track" subfield in the Surface Position Message (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.4.2) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.4, 
c. If Heading/Ground Track data is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem, then the device **shall** enter ALL ZEROs into the "Status Bit for 
Heading/Ground Track" and "Heading" subfields specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.3 and 
Â§2.2.3.2.4.4 respectively, 
d. Heading/Ground Track may be used in conjunction with Ground Speed data to 
arithmetically establish East/West Velocity Data (see Â§2.2.5.1.2) and North/South 
Velocity Data (see Â§2.2.5.1.3) if East/West and/or North/South Velocity Data is not 
available. 
(1). When Heading/Ground Track data is used, the NACV
2.2.5.1.19
 (see Â§
) data 
reported by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** be consistent with the 
accuracy, range, and resolution that can be obtained by using Heading data as the input data to the arithmetic computations necessary.   
(2). When Heading/Ground Track data is used, but Heading/Ground Track Data is 
not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, then the device **shall** 
enter ALL ZEROs into all transmitted subfields that are computed based on 
Heading/Ground Track data.   

## Notes:

1. Ground Track data may be unreliable at low ground speeds.  At very low ground 
speeds, the best estimate of an aircraft's or ground vehicle's ground track angle may be from a heading source rather than from the "track angle" output of a GNSS receiver. 
2. If a source of A/V Heading **is not** available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, 
but a source of Ground Track angle is available, then Ground Track angle may be 
used instead of Heading, provided that the "Status Bit for Heading/Ground Track" 
subfield is set to ZERO whenever the Ground Track angle is not a reliable indication of the A/V's heading.  (The Ground Track angle is not a reliable indication of the 
A/V's heading when the A/V's ground speed is close to ZERO.  Some regulators have already established such limits.  These limits may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.) 

## 2.2.5.1.11 Aircraft Identification (Or Registration) Data

a. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** accept own vehicle Aircraft Identification 
Data via an appropriate data input interface and use such data to establish the Aircraft Identification or Flight Number Data in Aircraft Identification and Category Messages (see Â§2.2.3.2.5) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.5.3. 
b. When Aircraft Identification or Flight Number data specified in subparagraph a is not 
available or is not valid, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** accept own 
vehicle Aircraft Registration Character Data (N250DL, etc.) via an appropriate data input interface and use such data to establish the Aircraft Identification or Flight Number Data in Aircraft Identification and Category Messages (see Â§2.2.3.2.5) as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.5.3. 
c. Only if Aircraft Identification or Flight Number Data, and Aircraft Registration Data 
is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, **shall** the device enter ALL 
ZEROs into the character fields specified in Â§2.2.3.2.5.3. 

## 2.2.5.1.12 East/West Velocity Data

The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** accept own vehicle East/West Velocity information via an appropriate variable data input interface and use such data to establish subfields in transmitted ADS-B Messages as follows:

Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.7 respectively. 
If East/West Velocity data is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, then the device **shall** enter ALL ZEROs in the E/W Direction Bit and E/W Velocity subfields specified in: 
(1). Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.6 and Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.7, and (2). Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.6 and Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.7, respectively.

## 2.2.5.3 Ads-B Transmission Device Source Selection

When more than one position source is provided to the ADS-B transmitter, the transmitter **shall** select a single source to provide position, horizontal velocity, and quality metrics.  Heading on the surface is an exception to this requirement.   When selecting among sources with equal Source Integrity Level (SIL) values, the source with the smallest Radius of Containment **shall** be selected. 

## Notes:

1. The source selection logic should be designed to prevent the selection from 
alternating between valid sources.  One acceptable way to ensure this is to allow the source selection to switch sources only after an alternate source has consistently exceeded the performance of the currently selected source for several seconds.   
2. Source selection logic may include criteria specific to the sources available on the 
aircraft.     

## 2.2.6 Ads-B Receiving Device Message Processor Characteristics

To provide maximum flexibility in user application implementation of ADS-B 
information, ADS-B Receiving Devices are categorized into two major functional types, which are illustrated in Figure 2-17 and specified in the following subparagraphs. 

Note: Figure 2-20 provides additional detail in regards to ADS-B Message and Report general data flow. 

a. The ADS-B Message processing function begins with the ADS-B Message Reception 
Function receiving the transmitted message and then performing the necessary processing to deliver "Message Data" to the Report Assembly Function. 
b. **TYPE 1** - TYPE 1 ADS-B Report Assembly subsystems are those that receive ADS-
B Messages and produce application-specific subsets of ADS-B reports.  As such, the 
Type 1 ADS-B Report Assembly subsystems may be customized to the particular applications using ADS-B reports.  In addition, Type 1 ADS-B Report Assembly 
subsystems may be controlled by an external entity to produce installation-defined subsets of the reports that those subsystems are capable of producing. 

c. **TYPE 2** - TYPE 2 ADS-B Report Assembly subsystems are those that receive ADS-
B Messages and are capable of producing complete ADS-B reports in accordance 
with the applicable ADS-B equipment class requirements.  Type 2 Report Assembly subsystems may be controlled by an external entity to produce installation-defined subsets of the reports that those subsystems are capable of producing. 

## 2.2.6.1 Ads-B Message Reception Function Requirements

a. The ADS-B Message Reception Function **shall** properly decode valid ADS-B 
transmitted messages while ignoring other similar Mode-S transmissions. 
b. The ADS-B Message Reception Function **shall** decode ADS-B transmitted messages 
in accordance with the requirements provided in Â§2.2.4.3.4.7 of these MOPS.   
c. The ADS-B Message Reception Function **shall** receive and decode ADS-B Messages 
that are transmitted in ADS-B Version Two (2), or higher, Message formats as 
defined by Â§2.2.3.2 and its subparagraphs.   
d. The ADS-B Message Reception Function **shall** also receive and decode ADS-B 
Airborne Position, Surface Position, Airborne Velocity, Aircraft Status, Aircraft 
Operational Status, and Identification and Category Messages that are transmitted in 
ADS-B Version Zero (0) Message formats as defined by Appendix N, Section Â§N.2, 
and its subparagraphs, and Figure N-1 through Figure N-7.   
e. The ADS-B Message Reception Function **shall** also receive and decode ADS-B 
Messages that are transmitted in ADS-B Version One (1) Message formats as defined 
by Appendix N, Section Â§N.3, and its subparagraphs, and Figure N-8 through Figure 
N-17.    
The version determined from the decoding of the ADS-B Version Number subfield of the Aircraft Operational Status Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.5) **shall** be retained and associated with the specific target.  This ADS-B Version Number **shall** then be used for determining the applicable message formats to be applied for the decoding of all subsequent 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages received from that target.   

## Notes:

1. A summary of the RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 compliant, ADS-B Version 
Zero (0) and RTCA DO-260A compliant ADS-B Version One (1) Message formats 
that must be received and processed by ADS-B Version Two (2) 1090 MHz ADS-B Receiving Subsystems is provided in Appendix N.   
2. The ADS-B Version Two (2) and Version One (1) Aircraft Operational Status 
Message format includes an explicit ADS-B Version Number subfield ("ME" bits 41 - 43).  For an ADS-B Version Zero (0) Aircraft Operational Status Message, these 
same bits were unassigned and were required to be set to a value of ZERO (binary 000).  Thus, a ADS-B Version Two (2) and Version One (1) Receiving Subsystem will 
decode "ME" bits 41 - 43 received from a 1090 MHz ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem compliant with RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 to indicate a ADS-B 
Version Number of Zero (0). 

## 2.2.6.1.1 Ads-B Message Reception Function Output Message Structure Requirements

All ADS-B Messages are received in the general format provided in Figure 2-2 and specified in Â§2.2.3.2.   
Each ADS-B Message received **shall** be structured into the baseline OUTPUT 
MESSAGE shown in Figure 2-18 for delivery to the user interface or the Report Assembly function:

Note: "[#]" Provided in the FIELD indicates the number of bits in the field. 

## 2.2.6.1.2 Ads-B And Tis-B Message Reception Function Output Message Delivery Requirements

Figure 2-19 illustrates the transmitted message receipt capabilities and the OUTPUT 
MESSAGE delivery requirements, which are specified in the following subparagraphs: 
The ADS-B and TIS-B Message Reception Function **shall** deliver All OUTPUT 
MESSAGES to the user interface or the Report Assembly function within 2.0 
milliseconds of the receipt of the last message bit of the transmitted message. 

## 2.2.7 Ads-B Message Processor Characteristics 2.2.7.1 Ads-B Receiving Device Message Reception

The ADS-B Receiver **shall** decode all valid ADS-B transmitted messages and structure the information from such messages into the appropriate ADS-B Reports identified in subsequent sections of this document.  The structured reports **shall** then be made available to the appropriate user application as needed.   
Future versions of these MOPS are expected to maintain backward compatibility with RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A.  Messages originating from 1090 MHz ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystems reporting a MOPS ADS-B Version Number value that is indicated in Table 2-68 as "Reserved" are to be considered valid.  However, all message types and all subfields within messages that are currently "Unassigned," or are indicated as being "Reserved" by these MOPS, **shall** be ignored and not used for ADS-B Report Generation.   

## 2.2.7.1.1 Receipt Of Type Code Equal To Zero

An ADS-B Message containing a TYPE Code of ZERO (binary 0 0000) can only be used to update the altitude data of an aircraft that is already being tracked by the entity receiving the altitude data in a TYPE ZERO ADS-B Message. If an ADS-B Message with TYPE Code equal to ZERO is received, it should be checked to see if altitude data is present and then process the altitude data as follows: 

a. If altitude data is not present, the message **shall** be discarded. 
b. If altitude data is present, it may be used to update altitude as needed. 
Note: For TCAS systems, this could be an aircraft that was being maintained via 
hybrid surveillance when the position data input failed.  In this case, altitude only could be used for a short period of time.  Interrogation would have to begin at the update rate for that track to ensure update of range and bearing information on the TCAS display. 

## 2.2.8 Ads-B Report Characteristics

The intent of the following subparagraphs is to provide an example coding of each type of ADS-B report.  Implementations may use alternative report structures and coding of the ADS-B reports.  However, the contents of each Report Type, as specified in Table 2-
84 **shall** include, as a minimum, the data parameters as specified in the following subparagaphs. 

Note:  This requirement describes the Report Type structure, not the contents of each report that can contain a subset of the complete allowed parameters. 

## 2.2.8.1 Ads-B State Vector Report Characteristics

Table 2-83 and the subsequent subparagraphs identify the data structure for all ADS-B 
State Vector Reports generated for each ADS-B vehicle being reported. 

The Report Assembly Function **shall** be compatible with the current and prior versions of the relevant 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages (e.g., Airborne Position, Surface Position, Airborne Velocity) that are used as the basis for generating State Vector Reports.  The relevant Version Two (2) messages are identified below and the relevant Version Zero (0) 
messages, conformant to RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102, including Change 1, and Version One (1) messages, conformant to DO-260A including Change 1 and Change 2, and their required use for ADS-B State Vector Report generation are defined in Appendix N, Sections N.2 and N.3.   
The intent of Table 2-83 is to illustrate the structure of all Items (i.e., parameters) 
required to be reported in an ADS-B State Vector Report.  The exact structure of the data indicated in columns 10 and 11 is provided as a guideline or one possible method of satisfying the report structure.  Implementers may choose to organize the data in another format; however, delivery to a user interface or application of all Items in Table 2-83 
shall be consistent with the range, resolution, and units indicated in column 7, 8 and 9 of Table 2-83 respectively.  If data is not available to support a field that is delivered to an application, then the data provided to the application **shall** be set to ALL ZEROs.  Those requirements in Â§2.2.8.1.1 to Â§2.2.8.1.22 below that relate to specific data structure details (byte numbers, and bit numbers within the bytes) **shall** only apply to equipment that uses the sample report data structure shown in columns 10-11 of Table 2-83. 

Note: Table 2-83 is structured such that column 1, 2, and 6 through 11, pertain to the State Vector Report elements and how such elements should be structured into the report.  Columns 3 through 5 provide information on where the appropriate data can be located in the ADS-B Messages for each of the Report elements.

## Notes:

1. 
In the "Data Structure" column (i.e., column 10), "S" indicates the "sign-bit," "M" indicates the Most Significant Bit of the data field, "d" indicates data bits in 
the field, "L" indicates the Least Significant Bit of the data field, "0" indicates the bit is to always be set to a value of zero (0) and "x" indicates "Don't Care" 
bits in the data field. 
2. 
The Report Type Identifier is used to identify the type of ADS-B Report being generated as specified in Â§2.2.8.1.1.1. 
3. 
The Time of Applicability is actually a grouping of 3 individual parameters as specified in Â§2.2.8.1.4. 
4. 
Parameters annotated with Note 4 are only present in the State Vector Report when the aircraft is airborne 
5. 
Parameters annotated with Note 5 are only present in the State Vector Report with the aircraft is on the airport surface 
6. 
Estimated values may be either an actual value from a received message, if available, or a calculated value such as produced by a surveillance tracker algorithm. For example it is possible for a surveillance tracker to produce an updated estimate of the target's horizontal position based on just the receipt of a new velocity 
message.

The Report Structure field is used to indicate the exact data parameters identified in Table 2-83 that are being provided in the State Vector report and is intended to provide a methodology for the report processor to structure shorter reports when data for some parameters or groups of related parameters are not available.  In order to provide the capability to provide shorter State Vector reports the following basic conventions **shall** 
be adhered to: 

a. Any given data parameter to be used in the report **shall** use the designated number of 
bytes and format as designated in Table 2-83. 
b. Whenever a data parameter identified in Table 2-83, or a required grouping of data 
parameters as identified in Table 2-85, is not provided in the report, then it is 
permissible to concatenate the next parameter to be included into the report immediately following the inclusion of the previous reported parameter.  This feature 
shall be used accommodate the reporting of the different sets of required parameters, 
such as for when the aircraft is in the airborne condition versus on the airport surface 
as indicated in Table 2-83. 
c. Each parameter of the State Vector report identified in Table 2-83 **shall** be properly 
declared in the Report Structure field as detailed in the following paragraphs and 
Table 2-85.   
Note: Implementation of the methodology just provided is realizable and controllable 
due to the fact that the exact length of each report parameter is specified in Table 
2-83 and the Report Structure field identifies exactly which parameters are 
included in the report.  Therefore, the report user can easily re-construct the length and general format of the report.   
The Report Structure is a 20-bit field and **shall** be provided in the least significant nibble 
(i.e., bits 3 - 0) of the first byte (i.e., byte "0") and continuing into bytes 1 and 2 of the Report.  The Report Structure format is specified in Table 2-85 where each bit is associated with a particular data parameter, or group of data parameters, of the State Vector Report.  If the bit is set to ONE (1), then the data parameter, or group of identified data parameters, is considered to be available and **shall** be transmitted in the report.  
Otherwise, the data parameter, or group of identified data parameters, is considered to not be available and shall not be transmitted in the report.  Note that Table 2-85 does not address the Report Type and Structure Identification parameter, the Validity Flags parameter, nor the Participant Address parameter and the Address Qualifier, since these four parameters shall be included in the State Vector Report.  Also, certain of the other State Vector data parameters are required to be reported, as specified in 
Â§2.2.9, even though bits have been allocated in the report structure field as shown in Table 2-85.

## 2.2.8.1.1.2 State Vector Report Validity Flags

Validity Flags for data provided in the State Vector Report **shall** be indicated in bytes #3 
and #4 of the State Vector Report as shown for item "0c" in Table 2-83.  The State Vector Report elements that require validity flags are identified in Table 2-86.  Table 2-
86 identifies the byte and bit that **shall** be used as a flag for each element that requires a validity flag.  Each validity flag bit **shall** be set to ONE (1) to indicate that the corresponding State Vector Report Element data is valid.  If such data is not valid, then the corresponding validity flag bit **shall** be set to ZERO (0).

## Notes For Table 2-87:

1. All transponder-based based 1090 MHz ADS-B systems are required to use an ICAO 
24-bit address.  Certain types of non-transponder-based 1090 MHz ADS-B systems may under certain conditions be permitted to broadcast an address other than an ICAO 24-bit address.  ADS-B Messages received from Non-Transponder Devices transmitting with DF=18 and CF=1 indicate that a non-ICAO Address is being used 
(see Figure 2-2). 
2. The Emitter Category associated with the Participant Address is to be obtained from 
the "ADS-B Emitter Category" subfield (Â§2.2.3.2.5.2) of the ADS-B Aircraft 
Identification and Category Message.   
3. An Address Qualifier Code of 000 or 001 is to be reported if the value from the 
"ADS-B Emitter Category" subfield indicates "No ADS-B Emitter Category 
Information," or if an ADS-B Aircraft Identification and Category Message has not 
been received.  
 

## 2.2.8.1.4 Report Time Of Applicability

Since separate messages are used for position and velocity, the Time of Applicability is reported individually for the position related report parameters and the velocity related report parameters.  Also the State Vector Report may include estimated position and/or velocity values (i.e., not based on the receipt of a message with updated position or velocity information).  In this latter case the State Vector report **shall** include a Time of Applicability for the estimated position/velocity parameters.  The six-byte Report Time of Applicability Parameter field, as specified in Table 2-83, is sub-divided into three subfields as shown in Table 2-88.  The coding of the subfields is specified in the following subparagraphs. 

| Subfield                      | Coding                              |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Mddddddd dddddddL             | Time of Applicability for Estimated |
| Position/Velocity             |                                     |
| Position Time of Applicablity | Mddddddd dddddddL                   |
| Velocity Time of Applicabilty | Mddddddd dddddddL                   |

Note: In the "Coding" column, "M" indicates the Most Significant Bit of the data field and "L" indicates the Least Significant Bit of the data field.   

## 2.2.8.1.4.1 Time Of Applicability For Estimated Position/Velocity

The Time of Applicability for the estimated position and velocity **shall** be generated under the conditions specified below: 

a. Each time that an individual State Vector Report is updated as specified in 
Â§2.2.8.1.17, Â§2.2.8.1.18, Â§2.2.8.1.19, OR Â§2.2.8.1.20, the Report Assembly Function 
shall update the Time of Applicability for the Estimate Position/Velocity data in the 
State Vector Report with either the GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time data (Â§2.2.8.5.1) 
or the Established Receiver Unit Time (Â§2.2.8.5.2), whichever is applicable to the Receiving device Report Assembly Function installation requirements.  
b. Time of Applicability data **shall** be provided in the State Vector report in binary 
format as specified in Table 2-88.   

## 2.2.8.1.4.2 Position Time Of Applicability

Processing of Position Time of Applicability depends on the UTC Time of Message Receipt of the Position Message and the value of the "TIME" (T) bit in the Position Message.   

## 2.2.8.1.4.2.1 Position Time Of Applicability When "Time" (T)=0

Each time that an Airborne or Surface Position Message is received with valid Latitude AND Longitude data and "TIME" (T)=0, the Report Assembly Function **shall** update the Position Time of Applicability data in the State Vector Report with the Time of Message Receipt of the Position Message expressed as either GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time data 
(see Â§2.2.8.5.1), or the Established Receiver Unit Time (see Â§2.2.8.5.2).  Time of Applicability shall be rounded to the nearest LSB of the Position Time of Applicability field.   

## 2.2.8.1.4.2.2 Position Time Of Applicability When "Time" (T)=1 And Utc Time Of Message Receipt Is Available

Each time that an Airborne or Surface Position Message is received with "TIME" 
(T)="1" and valid Latitude AND Longitude data, and when a valid UTC Time of Message Receipt is available per Â§2.2.8.5.1, the Report Assembly Function  **shall** update the Position Time of Applicability data in the State Vector Report with the appropriate 0.2 second UTC epoch.  The appropriate 0.2 second UTC epoch is determined as follows: 

- 
If "CPR Format" (F)=0, Position Time of Applicability **shall** be the nearest even 
0.2 second UTC epoch to the time that the Airborne Position Message is received, expressed as GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time data (see Â§2.2.8.5.1) and rounded to the nearest LSB of the Position Time of Applicability field. 
- 
If "CPR Format" (F)=1, Position Time of Applicability **shall** be the nearest odd 
0.2 second UTC epoch to the time that the Airborne Position Message is received, expressed as GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time data (see Â§2.2.8.5.1) and 
rounded to the nearest LSB of the Position Time of Applicability field. 
Note: An "even 0.2 second UTC epoch" is defined as that moment on the UTC time that occurs at an even number of 200-millisecond intervals after an exact evennumbered UTC second.  Likewise, an "odd 0.2 second UTC epoch" is defined as that moment on the UTC time scale that occurs at an odd number of 200 
millisecond intervals after an even numbered UTC second.  Examples of even 0.2 second epochs are 12.0 seconds, 12.4 seconds, 12.8 seconds, 13.2 seconds, 13.6 seconds, etc.  Examples of odd 0.2 second epochs are 12.2 seconds, 12.6 seconds, 13.0 seconds, 13.4 seconds, 13.8 seconds, etc. 

## 2.2.8.1.4.2.3 Position Time Of Applicability When "Time" (T)=1 And Utc Time Of Message Receipt Is Not Available

Each time that an Airborne or Surface Position Message is received with "TIME" (T)=1 
and valid Latitude AND Longitude data, and when no valid UTC Time of  Message Receipt per Â§2.2.8.5.1 is available, the Position Time of Applicability **shall** be processed as specified in Â§2.2.8.1.4.2.1.    

## 2.2.8.1.4.3 Velocity Time Of Applicability

Each time that an Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=1 or "2" is received with valid East/West AND North/South Velocity data, the Report Assembly Function **shall** update the Velocity Time of Applicability data in the State Vector Report with either the GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time data (see Â§2.2.8.5.1) or the Established Receiver Unit Time (see Â§2.2.8.5.2), whichever is applicable to the Receiving device Report Assembly Function installation requirements.  
Each time that a Surface Position Message is received with valid Movement AND 
Heading/Ground Track data, the Report Assembly Function **shall** update the Velocity Time of Applicability data in the State Vector Report with either the GPS/GNSS UTC 
Measure Time data (see Â§2.2.8.5.1) or the Established Receiver Unit Time (see 
Â§2.2.8.5.2), whichever is applicable to the Receiving device Report Assembly Function installation requirements.    

## 2.2.8.1.5 Latitude (Wgs-84)

The ADS-B Report Assembly Function **shall** decode the Encoded Latitude data 
(Â§2.2.3.2.3.7 and /or Â§2.2.3.2.4.7) provided in the ADS-B broadcast.  Decoding of the encoded latitude data **shall** be performed in accordance with Â§A.1.7.4 through Â§A.1.7.8.2

value for this field.) 

## 2.2.8.1.15 Barometric Altitude Rate

Rate" subfield (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.10, Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.10, Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.10 or Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.10) 
the ADS-B Report Assembly Function **shall** extract the "Sign Bit for Vertical Rate" 
subfield (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.11, Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.11, Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.11 or Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.11) and the "Vertical Rate" subfield (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.12, Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.12, Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.12 or

value for this field.) 

## 2.2.8.1.16 Navigation Integrity Category (Nic)

The ADS-B Report Assembly Function **shall** provide Navigation Integrity Category 
(NIC) information in the State Vector Report.  The NIC is derived from the "TYPE" 
Code data (Â§2.2.3.2.3.1) and the NIC Supplement-B value (Â§2.2.3.2.3.3) from the ADS-B 
Airborne Position Message, and the NIC Supplement-A value (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6) from the ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Message, OR the "TYPE" Code data (Â§2.2.3.2.4.1) from the ADS-B Surface Position Message, and the NIC Supplement-A value 
(Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6) and the NIC Supplement-C value (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.3.10) from the ADS-B 
Aircraft Operational Status Message.  The NIC values are encoded according to the NIC 
values given in Table 2-69, except for RC < 0.3 NM which is encoded in the State Vector Report with a value of 6 in bits 0 - 3 in byte 35, with bit 4 in byte 35 set to ONE (1) (i.e., xxx10110).  The NIC parameter is provided to the user application in the State Vector Report as specified in Table 2-83.     

## Notes:

1. For backward compatability, applications designed to interface to the State Vector 
 < 0.3 NM.   
Report structure of RTCA DO-260A will decode RC < 0.3 NM as NIC=6 with a NIC Supplement=0, and interpret it as RC < 0.5 NM.  Applications designed to comply 
with these MOPS will properly decode the NIC as RC
2. NIC is derived by the combination of Airborne or Surface Position Message Type 
Codes and NIC Supplement bits broadcast in Airborne Position Messages (NIC Supplement-B), and Operational Status Messages (NIC Supplement-A and C). Because of the different rates of broadcast between either Airborne or Surface Position Messages, and the Operational Status Messages, during a NIC change or airborne/surface format reporting transitions, the receipt of a new Type Code can no longer be associated with the NIC Supplement bits previously received and processed by the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem.  These transitions may yield an incorrect NIC value or a value not specified in 
Table 2-69 (also see Table 2-14).  In order to 
prevent improper reporting of NIC to ADS-B applications during these NIC transitions, the reporting of NIC needs to consider the following cases: a. For reporting of NIC during Type Code changes between position messages of 
the same format (either airborne-to-airborne or surface-to-surface), the largest 
RC for that Type Code (Type Code and NIC Supplement-B for Airborne Position 
Messages) should be reported in accordance with Table 2-69 (see also Table 2- 14), until a subsequent update of NIC Supplement bits occurs from receipt of an Operational Status Message.   
b. When aircraft transition from transmitting Airborne Position Messages to 
 for that received Surface Position Type Code until an Operational 
Surface Position Messages, a Surface Operational Status Message (Subtype=1) is required to be received to correctly determine NIC.  In this case, until the reception of a Surface Operational Status Message, the reported NIC should 
correspond to the RC of the last received airborne RC if the Type Code of the received Surface Position Message can represent this, or the next larger RC 
value defined for that Type Code.  Otherwise, report the NIC corresponding to 
the largest RC
Status Message is received.   
c. When aircraft transition from transmitting Surface Position Messages to 
Airborne Position Messages, an Airborne Operational Status Message (Subtype=0) is required to be received to correctly determine NIC if Type Code=13, and the NIC Supplement-B is equal to ONE (1) (in order to distinguish between R
C < 0.3 NM and RC < 0.6 NM).  In this case, until the reception of a 
new Airborne Operational Status Message, if the last reported surface RC was either RC < 0.3 NM or RC < 0.6 NM, then report the corresponding NIC value. Otherwise, report RC

## 2.2.8.2 Ads-B Mode Status Report Characteristics

Table 2-90 and the subsequent subparagraphs identify the data structure for all ADS-B 
Mode Status Reports. 

The Report Assembly Function **shall** be compatible with the current and prior versions of the relevant 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages (e.g., Operational Status, Airborne Position, Surface Position, Airborne Velocity, Aircraft Status and Aircraft Identification) that are used as the basis for generating Mode Status Reports.

messages are identified below and the relevant Version Zero (0) messages, conformant to RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102, including Change 1, and the relevant Version One 
(1) messages, conformant to RTCA DO-260A, including Change 1 and Change 2, and their required use for ADS-B Mode Status Report generation are defined in Appendix N, Section N.4.   
The intent of Table 2-90 is to illustrate the structure of all Items required to be reported in an ADS-B Mode Status Report.  The exact structure of the data indicated in columns 10 
and 11 is provided as a guideline or one possible method of satisfying the report structure.  Implementers may choose to organize the data in another format; however, delivery to a user interface or application of all Items in Table 2-90 **shall** be consistent with the range, resolution, and units indicated in column 7, 8 and 9 of Table 2-90 
respectively.  If data is not available to support a field that is delivered to an application, then the data provided to the application **shall** be set to ALL ZEROs.  Those requirements in Â§2.2.8.2.1 to Â§2.2.8.2.4 below that relate to specific data structure details 
(byte numbers, and bit numbers within the bytes) **shall** only apply to equipment that uses the sample data structure shown in columns 10-11 of Table 2-90. 

Note: Table 2-90 is structured such that column 1, 2, and 6 through 11, pertain to the Mode Status Report elements and how such elements should be structured into the report.  Columns 3 through 5 provide information on where the appropriate data can be located in the ADS-B Messages for each of the Report elements.

formats. 
4. The Operational Mode subfield includes the GPS Antenna Offset parameter in Mode Status Reports for aircraft or vehicles when reporting the  
surface formats. 

## 2.2.8.2.1 Mode Status Report Type And Structure Identification And Validity Flags 2.2.8.2.1.1 Mode Status Report Type And Structure Identification

The Report Type requirements were previously provided in Â§2.2.8.1.1. Report Type formats and the maximum number of bytes to be contained in each report are identified in Table 2-90. 

The Report Structure field is used to indicate the exact data parameters identified in Table 
2-90 that are being provided in the Mode Status report and is intended to provide a methodology for the Report Assembly Function to structure shorter reports when data for some parameters is not available.  In order to provide the capability to provide shorter Mode Status reports the following basic conventions **shall** be adhered to: 

a. Any given data parameter to be used in the report **shall** use the designated number of 
bytes and format as designated in Table 2-90. 
b. Parameters that are designated in Table 2-90 are restricted to byte boundaries. 
c. Whenever a data parameter identified in Table 2-90 is not provided in the report, then 
it is permissible to concatenate the next parameter to be included into the report immediately following the inclusion of the previous reported parameter. 
d. Each parameter of the Mode Status report identified in Table 2-90 must be properly 
declared in the Report Structure field as detailed in the following paragraphs and Table 2-91. 
Note: Implementation of the methodology just provided is realizable and controllable 
due to the fact that the exact length of each report parameter is specified in Table 
2-90 and the Report Structure field identifies exactly which parameters are 
included in the report.  Therefore, the report user can easily re-construct the length and general format of the report. 
The Report Structure is a 20-bit field and **shall** be provided in the least significant nibble 
(i.e., bits 3 - 0) of the first byte (i.e., byte "0") and continuing into bytes 1 and 2 of the Report.  The Report Structure format is specified in Table 2-91 where each bit is associated with a particular data parameter of the Mode Status Report.  If the bit is set to ONE (1), then the data parameter is considered to be available and **shall** be transmitted in the report.  Otherwise, the data parameter is considered to not be available and shall not be transmitted in the report.  Note that Table 2-91 does not address the Report Type and Structure Identification parameter, the Validity Flags parameter, nor the Participant Address parameter since these four parameters **shall** be included in the Mode Status Report.  Also, certain of the other Mode Status data parameters are required to be reported, as specified in Â§2.2.9, even though bits have been allocated in the report structure field as shown in Table 2-91.

This one-bit flag **shall** be set to ZERO (0) to indicate that the Vertical Rate field in the State Vector Report holds the rate of change of barometric pressure altitude.  Or, this one-bit flag **shall** 
be set to ONE (1) to indicate that the Vertical Rate field holds the rate of change of geometric altitude. 

## 2.2.8.2.19 (Reserved For) Flight Mode Specific Data

A 3-bit field in the Mode Status Report is reserved for future use as a "Flight Mode Specific Data" field.  In the current version of these MOPS, this field **shall** be set to ALL 
ZEROs. 

## 2.2.8.3 Ads-B On-Condition Report Characteristics

ADS-B On-Condition Reports include, but will not necessarily be limited to: 

a. The Target State Report 
b. The Air Referenced Velocity Report 
Note: It is anticipated that the Trajectory Change Reports will be specified by a future revision of these MOPS as an additional type of "On-Condition" Report. 

## 2.2.8.3.1 Ads-B Target State Report

Table 2-97 and the subsequent subparagraphs identify the data structure for all ADS-B 
Target State Reports. 

The Report Assembly Function **shall** be compatible with the current ADS-B Version Two (2) of the relevant 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages (e.g., Target State and Status, Subtype=1) that are used as the basis to generate Target State Reports.  The relevant Version Two (2) messages are identified below.   
 
Note: Version 0 messages cannot be used as the basis for Target State Reports, because there are no Version 0 messages that contain the necessary data elements. Version 1 message formats for the Target State and Status Message with Subtype=0 are defined in Appendix N, but are not used to generate the Version 2 Target State Report .   
The intent of Table 2-97 is to illustrate the structure of all Items that are required to be reported in an ADS-B Target State Report.  The exact structure of the data indicated in columns 10 and 11 is provided as a guideline or one possible method of satisfying the report structure.  Implementers may choose to organize the data in another format; 
however, delivery to a user interface or application of all Items in Table 2-97 **shall** be consistent with the range, resolution, and units indicated in column 7, 8 and 9 of Table 2-
97 respectively.  If data is not available to support a field that is delivered to an application, then the data provided to the application **shall** be set to ALL ZEROs.  Those requirements in the subparagraphs below that relate to specific data structure details (byte numbers, and bit numbers within the bytes) **shall** only apply to equipment that uses the sample data structure shown in columns 10 and 11 of Table 2-97. 

Note: Table 2-97 is structured such that column 1, 2, and 6 through 11, pertain to the Target State Report elements and how such elements should be structured into the report.  Columns 3 through 5 provide information on where the appropriate data can be located in the ADS-B Messages for each of the Report elements.

## Notes:

1. 
In the "Data Structure" column (i.e., column 10), "S" indicates the "Sign-Bit," "M" indicates the Most Significant Bit of the data field, "d" indicates data bits in the field, "L" indicates the Least Significant Bit of the data field, and "x" indicates "Don't Care" bits in the data field. 
2. 
The Report Type Identifier is used to identify the type of ADS-B Report being generated as specified in Â§2.2.8.1.1.1. 
 

## 2.2.8.3.1.1 Report Type And Structure Identification

The Report Type requirements were previously provided in Â§2.2.8.1.1.  Report Type formats and the maximum number of bytes to be contained in each report are identified in Table 2-97. 

The Report Structure field is used to indicate the exact data parameters identified in Table 2-97 that are being provided in the Target State Report and is intended to provide a methodology for the Report Assembly Function to structure shorter reports when data for some parameters is not available.  In order to provide the capability to provide shorter Target State Reports the following basic conventions **shall** be adhered to: 

a. Any given data parameter to be used in the report **shall** use the designated 
number of bytes and format as designated in Table 2-97. 
b. Parameters that are designated in Table 2-97 are restricted to byte 
boundaries. 
c. Whenever a data parameter identified in Table 2-97 is not provided in the 
report, then it is permissible to concatenate the next parameter to be included into the report immediately following the inclusion of the previous reported parameter. 
d. Each parameter of the Target State Report identified in Table 2-97 must be 
properly declared in the Report Structure field as detailed in the following 
paragraphs and Table 2-98. 
Note: Implementation of the methodology just provided is realizable and 
controllable due to the fact that the exact length of each report 
parameter is specified in Table 2-97 and the Report Structure field 
identifies exactly which parameters are included in the report. Therefore, the report user can easily re-construct the length and general format of the report. 
The Report Structure is a 12-bit field and **shall** be provided in the least significant nibble (i.e., bits 3 - 0) of the first byte (i.e., byte "0") and continuing into byte 1 of the Report.  The Report Structure format is specified in Table 2-98 
where each bit is associated with a particular data parameter of the Target State Report.  If the bit is set to ONE (1), then the data parameter is considered to be available and **shall** be transmitted in the report.  Otherwise, the data parameter is considered to not be available and shall not be transmitted in the report.  Note that Table 2-98 does not address the Report Type and Structure Identification parameter, the Participant Address parameter, the Address Qualifier parameter, nor the Report Time of Applicability parameter, since these four parameters **shall** 
be included in the Target State Report.  Also, certain of the other Target State data parameters are required to be reported, as specified in Â§2.2.9, even though bits have been allocated in the report structure field as shown in Table 2-98.

## 2.2.8.3.1.2 Target State And Status Validty Flags

Validity Flags for data provided in the Target State Report **shall** be indicated in bytes #3 and #4 of the Target State Report as shown for item "0c" in Table 2-99.  
The Target State Report elements that require Validity Flags are identified in Table 2-99.  Table 2-99 identifies the byte and bit that **shall** be used as a flag for each element that requires a validity flag.  Each Validity Flag bit **shall** be set to ONE (1) to indicate that the corresponding State Vector Report Element data is valid.  If such data is not valid, then the corresponding Validity Flag bit **shall** be set to ZERO (0).

## Notes:

1. 
In the "Data Structure" column (i.e., column 10), "S" indicates the "Sign-Bit," "M" indicates the Most Significant Bit of the data field, "d" indicates 
data bits in the field, "L" indicates the Least Significant Bit of the data field, "0" indicates the bit is to always be set to a value of ZERO (0), and "x" 
indicates "Don't Care" bits in the data field. 
2. 
The Report Type Identifier is used to identify the type of ADS-B Report being generated as specified in Â§2.2.8.1.1.1. 
3. 
Airspeed is coded with a fixed data structure using the 12 least significant bits of the 2-byte field.  For the case where the source message for the airreferenced velocity information is of the type Airborne Velocity - Subtype 3 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.3), a reported resolution of 1 knot is used for airspeed.  This 
generally applies for aircraft airspeeds of 0 to 1000 knots, although under certain conditions, as described in Â§2.2.3.2.6.3, an airspeed of up to 1022 
knots may be reported with 1 knot resolution.  For airspeeds greater than 1000 knots and where the source message for the air-referenced velocity 
information is of the type Airborne Velocity - Subtype 4 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.4), the two least significant bits are set to a value of ZERO (0) thus providing an actual reported resolution of 4 knots.  

## 2.2.8.3.2.1 Report Type And Structure Identification And Validity Flags 2.2.8.3.2.1.1 Report Type And Structure Identification

The Report Type requirements were previously provided in Â§2.2.8.1.1.1.  The Report Type is provided in the most significant nibble of the first byte of the report.  The Report Type format, coding and the maximum number of bytes (i.e., 13 bytes) to be contained in each Air Referenced Velocity Report are identified in Table 2-100. 

The Report Structure field is used to indicate the exact data parameters identified in Table 
2-100 that are being provided in the Air Referenced Velocity Report and is intended to provide a methodology for the Report Assembly Function to structure shorter reports when data for some parameters is not available.  In order to provide the capability to provide shorter Air Referenced Velocity Reports the following basic conventions **shall** be adhered to: 

a. Any given data parameter to be used in the report **shall** use the designated number of 
bytes and format as designated in Table 2-100. 
b. Parameters that are designated in Table 2-100 are restricted to byte boundaries. 
c. Whenever a data parameter identified in Table 2-100 is not provided in the report, 
then it is permissible to concatenate the next parameter to be included into the report immediately following the inclusion of the previous reported parameter. 
d. Each parameter of the Air Referenced Velocity Report identified in Table 2-100 must 
be properly declared in the Report Structure field as detailed in the following 
paragraphs and Table 2-101.   
Note: Implementation of the methodology just provided is realizable and controllable 
due to the fact that the exact length of each report parameter is specified in Table 
2-100 and the Report Structure field identifies exactly which parameters are 
included in the report.  Therefore, the report user can easily re-construct the length and general format of the report. 
The Report Structure Identification parameter is a 12-bit field and **shall** be encoded in the least significant nibble (i.e., bits 3 - 0) of the first byte (i.e., byte "0") and continuing into byte 1 of the Report.  The Report Structure Identification parameter format is specified in Table 2-98 where each bit is associated with a particular subsequent data parameter of the Air Referenced Velocity Report.  If the bit is set to ONE (1), then the data parameter is considered to be available and **shall** be transmitted in the report.  Otherwise, the data parameter is considered to not be unavailable and shall not be transmitted in the report.  
Note that Table 2-101 does not address the Report Type and Structure Identification parameter, the Participant Address parameter, the Address Qualifier parameter, and the Report Time of Applicability parameter since these four parameters shall be included in each Air Referenced Velocity Report.  Also certain of the other Air Referenced Velocity data parameters are required to be reported, as specified in Â§2.2.9.1, even though bits have been allocated in the report structure field as shown in Table 2-
101.

## 2.2.8.3.2.1.2 Arv Report Validity Flags

The only Validity Flag specified by these MOPS for the Air Referenced Velocity Report uses the two (2) least significant bits of the one-byte field as shown in Table 2-102. 

| Byte #    | Bit #         | Validity Flag Reported    |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 2 - 7     | Reserved      |                           |
| 2         | 1             | Airspeed Valid            |
| 0         | Heading Valid |                           |

 
The "Heading Valid" flag bit in the ARV report **shall** be set to ONE if the "Heading While Airborne" field contains valid heading information, or set to ZERO if that field is known to not contain valid heading information.  The reported heading **shall** be indicated as not valid if the received ADS-B Airborne Velocity Message (Â§2.2.3.2.6.3 or 
Â§2.2.3.2.6.4) includes a "Heading Status Bit" (Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.6) indicating that "Heading Data is NOT Available." 
" subfield that is invalid.     
The "Airspeed Valid" flag bit **shall** be set to ONE if the "Airspeed" field (Â§2.2.8.3.2.6) 
contains valid heading information, or ZERO if that field is known to not contain valid airspeed information.  The reported Airspeed **shall** be indicated as "Not Valid" if the received ADS-B Airborne Velocity Message (Â§2.2.3.2.6.3 or Â§2.2.3.2.6.4) includes either a value for the "Airspeed" subfield indicating "No Airspeed Information Available," or includes a value for the "NACV

## 2.2.8.3.2.2 Participant Address

The participant address **shall** be encoded as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.1.5. 

## 2.2.8.3.2.3 Address Qualifier

The Address Qualifier is used to indicate the type of Participant Address (Â§2.2.8.1.3) 
being reported.  The 3 least significant bits of the one-byte field are used to convey the Address Qualifier information.  The Address Qualifier subfield **shall** be coded as specified in Table 2-87. 

## 2.2.8.3.2.4 Report Time Of Applicability

Each time that an individual Air Referenced Velocity Report is updated, the Report Assembly Function **shall** update the Time of Applicability data in the Air Referenced Velocity Report with either the GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time data (see Â§2.2.8.5.1) or the Established Receiver Unit Time (see Â§2.2.8.5.2), whichever is applicable to the Receiving device Report Assembly Function installation requirements.  
Report Time of Applicability data **shall** be provided in the Air Referenced Velocity report in binary format as specified in Table 2-100. 

## 2.2.8.3.2.5 Airspeed

Airspeed **shall** be reported over the range of 0 to 4000 knots.  The Airspeed parameter is coded with a fixed data structure using the 4 least significant bits of the first byte and the 
8 bits of the second byte of the Airspeed field as identified in Table 2-100.  For the case where the source message for the Air-Referenced Velocity information is of the type Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=3 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.3), a reported resolution of 1 knot is used for Airspeed.  This generally applies for Aircraft Airspeeds of 0 to 1000 knots, although under certain conditions, as described in Â§2.2.3.2.6.3, an Airspeed of up to 1022 
knots may be reported with 1 knot resolution.  For Airspeeds greater than 1000 knots and where the source message for the Air-Referenced Velocity information is of the type Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=4 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.4), the two (2) least significant bits are set to a value of ZERO (0) thus providing an actual reported resolution of 4 knots. 

## 2.2.8.3.2.6 Airspeed Type

The Airspeed Type and Validity field in the Air Referenced Velocity Report is a 2-bit field that **shall** be encoded as specified in Table 2-103.  The type of Airspeed being reported **shall** be obtained from the "Airspeed Type" subfield of the ADS-B Airborne Velocity Message, Subtype=3 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.3) or Subtype=4 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.4).  The reported Airspeed **shall** be indicated as "Not Valid" if the received ADS-B Airborne Velocity Message (Â§2.2.3.2.6.3 or Â§2.2.3.2.6.4) includes either a value for the "Airspeed" subfield indicating "No Airspeed Information Available," or includes a value for the "NACV
2.2.8.3.2.1.2
" 
subfield that is invalid.  When set to indicate the "Airspeed Field is Not Valid," the corresponding Validity Flag parameter (Â§
) **shall** also be set to indicate that the reported Airspeed is not valid. 

|   Coding  | Meaning                  |
|-----------|--------------------------|
|       00  | Airspeed Field Not Valid |
|       01  | True Airspeed (TAS)      |
|       10  | Indicated Airspeed (IAS) |
|       11  | Reserved for Mach        |

## 2.2.8.3.2.7 Heading While Airborne

An Aircraft's Heading is reported as the angle measured clockwise from the reference direction (magnetic north) to the direction in which the Aircraft's nose is pointing.  The heading field in Air Reference Velocity Reports **shall** be encoded using the 2 least significant bits of the first byte and the 8 bits of the second byte of the "Heading While Airborne" field as specified in Table 2-100.  The encoding **shall** be the same as that used in the "Heading" subfield of the ADS-B Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=3 as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.7. 

## 2.2.8.4 Processing Of Reserved Message Type Codes

Receivers shall meet the requirements of Â§2.2.8.1 through Â§2.2.8.3 when receiving any valid combination of messages with "TYPE" Codes 0 through 31 including TYPE Codes 24, 25, 26, 27 and 30. 

Note: This requirement ensures that the receipt of ADS-B Messages with reserved 
"TYPE" Codes will not adversely affect the processing of other ADS-B Messages.   

## 2.2.8.5 Receiving Installation Time Processing 2.2.8.5.1 Precision Installations

Receiving devices intended to generate ADS-B reports based on Surface Position Messages received from TYPE 5 or 6 (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.1) equipment or Airborne Position Messages received from TYPE 9, 10, 20 or 21 (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.1) equipment **shall** accept GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time data via an appropriate interface.  Such data **shall** be used to establish Time of Applicability data required in Â§2.2.8.1.4, Â§2.2.8.1.17 through 
Â§2.2.8.1.20, Â§2.2.8.2.4, Â§2.2.8.3.1.5 and Â§2.2.8.3.2.4.   
UTC Measure Time data **shall** have a minimum range of 300 seconds and a resolution of 
0.0078125 (1/128) seconds. 

Note: Time of Applicability information is required in Item #'s 18 through 23, and 25 
of Table 2-83, Item #16 of Table 2-90, and Item #7 of Table 2-97.  Each of these table entries specify the data to be entered in 9 bits of whole number and 7 bits of fractional data.  Therefore, the full range can be up to 511.9921875 seconds having the required resolution of 0.0078125 seconds.   

## 2.2.8.5.2 Non-Precision Installations

Receiving devices that are not intended to generate ADS-B reports based on Surface Position Messages received from TYPE 5 or 6 (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.1) equipment or Airborne Position Messages received from TYPE 9, 10, 20 or 21 (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.1) equipment may choose not to use GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time data if there is no requirement to do so by the end user of the ADS-B reports.  In such cases, where there is no appropriate time reference, the Receiving device **shall** establish an appropriate internal clock or counter having a maximum clock cycle or count time of 20 milliseconds.  The established cycle or clock count **shall** have a range of 300 seconds and a resolution of 0.0078125 (1/128) 
seconds in order to maintain commonality with the requirements of Â§2.2.8.5.1. 

Note: Time of Applicability information is required in Item #'s 18 through 23, and 25 
of Table 2-83, Item #16 of Table 2-90, and Item #7 of Table 2-97.  Each of these table entries specify the data to be entered in 9 bits of whole number and 7 bits of fractional data.  Therefore, the full range can be up to 511.9921875 seconds having the required resolution of 0.0078125 seconds. 

## 2.2.9 Ads-B Report Type Requirements

Equipage classes are defined to accommodate tiered capabilities according to increasingly complex operational objectives while preserving basic inter-operability between classes of equipage.  Each equipage class is required to receive messages and process the recovered information into specific ADS-B reports according to the applicable capability.  The required ADS-B report capabilities for each class of equipage are specified in the following paragraphs. 

## 2.2.9.1 Ads-B Receiver Reporting Requirements For Class A Equipage

ADS-B Report Requirements for Class A Equipage are specified in Table 2-104.  For each required report type all data elements, as defined in Â§2.2.8.1 through Â§2.2.8.3 
(inclusive of subparagraphs), **shall** be included for which valid information is available 
(i.e., current information that has been received via one or multiple ADS-B Messages or is available from an onboard data source).  Although the Report Assembly Function is required to support all data elements specified for the report types applicable to that Equipage Class, as per Table 2-104, reports may be generated that convey only a subset of the report elements.  This is a consequence of certain data elements only being applicable while airborne and others that are only applicable while on the surface.  Also the ADS-B Messages may not have been received that included the information necessary to report a valid value for a given report data element.  For each of the four types of reports there is a set of required data elements that **shall** be included.  The required set of data elements is specified in Table 2-105 through Table 2-108 (inclusive) 
for the four report types.   
The Report Assembly Function **shall** maintain backward compatibility with prior versions of the relevant 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages (i.e., Airborne Position, Surface Position, Airborne Velocity, Aircraft Status, Aircraft Operational Status, and Aircraft Identification and Category) that are used as the basis for generating State Vector, Air Referenced Velocity and Mode Status Reports.  The relevant Version Zero (0) message formats, conformant to RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102A, including Change 1, and the relevant Version One (1) messages, conformant to RTCA DO-260A, including Change 1 and Change 2, and their required use for ADS-B report generation are defined in Appendix N.

## 2.2.9.1.1 Ads-B State Vector Reports For Class A Equipage

Equipage Class A0, A1S, A1, A2 and A3 equipment **shall** provide State Vector Reports as indicated in Â§2.2.9.1.  An example report format is shown in Table 2-83. 

## 2.2.9.1.2 Ads-B Mode Status Reports For Class A Equipage

Equipage Class A0, A1S, A1, A2 and A3 equipment **shall** provide Mode Status Reports as indicated in Â§2.2.9.1.  An example report format is shown in Table 2-90. 

## 2.2.9.1.3 Ads-B Target State Reports For Class A Equipage

a. Equipage Class A0, A1S and A1 equipment are not required to provide Target State 
Reports. 
b. Equipage Class A2 and A3 equipment **shall** provide Target State Reports as indicated 
in Â§2.2.9.1.  An example report format is shown in Table 2-97. 
c. Target State Reports for newly acquired target aircraft shall not be provided until or 
unless an Aircraft Operational Status Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2) has been received from 
the target aircraft indicating an ADS-B Version Number of other than Zero (0). 
Note: Version Zero (0) messages that convey trajectory intent information using 
message TYPE Code 29 (see Appendix N) are not to be used by 1090 MHz ADS- B receiving systems conformant to these MOPS for the purpose of report generation.  Therefore a positive determination that the applicable ADS-B 
Version Number is other than Zero (0) for a received message with a TYPE Code of 29 is necessary in order to avoid errors in the reporting of the aircraft target state. 

## 2.2.9.1.4 Ads-B Air Referenced Velocity Reports For Class A Equipage

a. Equipage Class A0 equipment is not required to provide Air Referenced Reports. 
b. Equipage Class A1S, A1, A2 and A3 equipment **shall** generate an Air Referenced 
Velocity Report as indicated in Â§2.2.9.1.  An example report format is shown in 
Table 2-100. 

## 2.2.9.2 Ads-B Receiver Report Content Requirements For Class B Equipage

There are no report requirements for Class B, i.e., Broadcast Only, Equipage. 

## 2.2.10 Ads-B Receiver Report Assembly And Delivery

Note: This paragraph and its subparagraphs describe report assembly and delivery only for ADS-B Receiving Subsystems.  See Â§2.2.17.4 and its subparagraphs for requirements on TIS-B report aseembly and delivery. 

## 2.2.10.1 Fundamental Principals Of Report Assembly And Delivery 2.2.10.1.1 General Data Flow

Figure 2-20 illustrates the general data flow of ADS-B Messages and Reports for the purposes of establishing the baseline requirements for Report Assembly and Delivery.

Specified by the
ADS-B / Application
Interface Specification

a. **Message Input Processing**  --  The Message Input Processing is performed by the 
ADS-B Message Reception Function previously depicted in Figure 2-17 and 
described in Â§2.2.6.1.  The primary function of the Message Input Processing function is to deliver all received ADS-B Messages to the Report Assembly Function. 
b. **Report Assembly Function**  --  The Report Assembly Function receives all ADS-B 
Messages from the Message Input Processing Function and structures ADS-B Reports for delivery to the Report Output Storage Buffer.  
It is important to note that the specification of requirements within this document is considered complete once the ADS-B Reports have been structured and delivered to the Report Output Storage Buffer.  Specifically, the specification of data delivery via the Application Interface is not addressed in this document.  Figure 2-20 illustrates the boundary of the ADS-B MOPS specification. 

c. **Report Output Storage Buffer**  --  The primary purpose of the Report Output 
Storage Buffer is to store and maintain all ADS-B reports such that the Reports are 
available for extraction by the Application Interface upon demand or as needed.  
d. **Application Report Control**  --  The Application Report Control depicted in Figure 
2-20 represents an *optional* function that may be implemented for the application to 
provide commands or control to the Report Assembly Function in order to control the size of various ADS-B reports and/or the conditions under which such reports are issued. 
e. **Application Interface**  --  The Application Interface is responsible for the extraction 
of ADS-B reports from the Report Output Storage Buffer via the Report to 
Application Interface.  Requirements for the Application Interface and Report to Application Interface are to be specified in various Application Interface specifications and therefore are not addressed in this document. 
Note: Figure 2-21, Figure 2-22 and Figure 2-23 are provided below as a guideline to assist in understanding the Report Assembly and Delivery Process.  As such, these figures should not be construed as presenting the actual requirements. Rather, the requirements for Report Assembly and Delivery are provided in the remaining subparagraphs of Â§2.2.10. 

  

NOTE:  This diagram does not itself contain requirements 
for the Report Assembly Function.  It is only a note 
guiding the reader to those requirements provided in the 
text of section 2.2.10.

.

 

## 2.2.10.1.2 Ads-B Report Organization

a. All ADS-B Message receptions and Reports **shall** be organized (i.e., indexed) in 
accordance with the Participant Address (see Â§2.2.3.2.1.1) and the Address Qualifier 
(see Â§2.2.8.1.3). 
Note: The Participant Address, report element 1 in all ADS-B report structures.  Is conveyed in the "AA" Address Field of all ADS-B transmitted messages.  The Address Qualifier, report element 2 in all the ADS-B report structures, denotes whether the address is a 24-bit ICAO aircraft address or some other kind of address, and is conveyed in the combination of DF fields and, if DF=18, in the CF field in ADS-B transmitted messages.   

b. For the purposes of correlating received ADS-B Messages to existing Reports, 
separate Reports **shall** be maintained for the same Participant Address (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.1.1) and Address Qualifier (see Â§2.2.8.1.3) if DF=17 ADS-B Messages are 
received 
from 
one 
aircraft/vehicle 
and 
DF=18 
Messages 
from 
another 
aircraft/vehicle.   
Note: Duplicate address processing as per Â§2.2.10.7 helps protect against not detecting an aircraft/vehicle that is transmitting with the same 24-bit address.  However, duplicate address processing is not required when addresses can be resolved when one aircraft/vehicle is from a Mode S transponder based transmitting system and the other is from a Nontransponder based transmitting system.   

c. The Participant Address and the Address Qualifier **shall** be required elements in all 
ADS-B Reports (see Table 2-83 Items 1 and 2, Table 2-90 Items 1 and 2, Table 2-97 
Items 1 and 2, and Table 2-100 Items 1 and 2).    

## 2.2.10.1.3 Ads-B Message Temporary Retention

a. Unless otherwise specified, all ADS-B Messages and decoded latitude and longitude 
values received for a given Participant **shall** be appropriately time tagged and 
temporarily stored for at least 200 seconds unless replaced by a received message of 
equivalent type from that Participant. 
Note: This requirement is intended to aid in the start-up of Report Assembly for a given Participant such that as much data as possible can be provided as soon as a Track is initialized on the given participant. 

b. If no new messages have been received from a given Participant for 250 seconds, 
then all records (including temporary storage) relevant to the Participant Address 
shall be deleted from temporary storage and from the Report Output Storage Buffer. 

## 2.2.10.1.4 Participant Ads-B Track Files

A Track File is defined as the accumulation of reports maintained on a given participant. In the ADS-B case, the Track File refers to the State Vector, Mode Status, Target State and Air Referenced Velocity Reports, which comprise a set of reports maintained on a given participant. 

The ADS-B Report Assembly function **shall** maintain one, and only one, Track File, i.e., set of reports on any given participant. 

## 2.2.10.2 Report Assembly Initialization State

The Initialization State is entered for any given Participant for which there is no information upon receipt of any of the following ADS-B Messages received from the given Participant:   

a. Airborne Position Message (i.e., a State Vector Position Message --- Airborne) (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.3)   
b. Surface Position Message (i.e., a State Vector Position Message --- Surface) (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.4)   
c. ADS-B Aircraft Identification and Category Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.5)   
d. ADS-B Airborne Velocity Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.6)   
e. Target State and Status Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.1)   
f. 
"Aircraft" Operational Status Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.2)   
Note: Upon the first receptions of airborne-format messages from a target that is 
already in the Track State as a Surface Participant, it is not necessary to enter the Initialization State or the Acquisition State.  The target remains in the Track State, now as an Airborne Participant.  Similarly, for the transition from 
airborne-format to surface-format messages, if the target is currently in the Track State, it remains in the Track State, now as a Surface Participant.   

## 2.2.10.3 Report Assembly Acquisition State 2.2.10.3.1 Report Assembly Acquisition State --- Airborne Participant

Upon receipt of an *"even"* and an *"odd"* encoded Airborne Position Message from a given Participant within a ten second period, the Report Assembly Function **shall**:   

a. Perform a successful Globally Unambiguous CPR decode of the Participant Position 
in accordance with Â§A.1.7.7 of Appendix A.  Perform a validation of the resulting position decode as follows:  Compute the distance between own receiver position, if known, and the Participant Position resulting from the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode.  The position validation is failed if the computed distance is greater than the maximum operating range of the receiver.  If position validation is not failed, then 
proceed with subparagraph "b" below.  Otherwise, discard the "*even*" and "odd" 
Position Messages used in the attempted Globally Unambiguous CPR decode.  The Report Mode for the given Airborne Participant remains in Initialization State.   
Note:  If the Airborne Participant has already been in the Track State as a Surface Participant, then it is not necessary to perform the Globally Unambiguous CPR Decode.   

b. Set the Report Mode to "Acquisition" for the given Airborne Participant in the State 
Vector Report (see Â§2.2.8.1) in accordance with Â§2.2.8.1.22,   
c. Structure all possible fields of the State Vector Report for the given Airborne 
Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.1 (all subsections inclusive),   
d. Deliver the first structured State Vector Report for the given Airborne Participant to 
the Report Output Storage Buffer for subsequent access by the Application Interface 
on demand,   
e. Continue to maintain the integrity of the State Vector Report for the given Airborne 
Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer for at least 200 seconds unless replaced by an updated State Vector Report or otherwise specified in the following 
sections, the conditions of the following subparagraphs **shall** apply:   
f. 
If a new Position Message is not received within a 120 second period, then the 
Globally Unambiguous CPR decode performed in step a. **shall** be considered to be 
invalid, and the Report Assembly Function **shall** return to the Initialization State.  (In 
order to proceed to the Track State for the airborne participant, the Globally 
Unambiguous CPR decode will need to be repeated.)   
Note: This action effectively represents a return to the Initialization State with the exception that the return is to step a. above, and the report is retained as per step e.  The purpose of this action is to minimize the need to perform the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode since it is not necessary when position messages have been received within the reasonable time limit of 120 
seconds.  This action is illustrated in Figure 2-22.   

g. If no new messages have been received from a given Airborne Participant for at least 
200 seconds, then all reports relevant to the Participant Address **shall** be deleted from 
the Report Output Storage Buffer.   

## 2.2.10.3.1.1 Latency, Report Assembly Acquisition State --- Airborne Participant

Step 2.2.10.3.1.d **shall** be completed within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the second Airborne Position Message of the "*even*" and "odd" pair.   

## 2.2.10.3.2 Report Assembly Acquisition State --- Surface Participant

Upon receipt of an *"even"* and an *"odd"* encoded Surface Position Message from a given Participant within a time period of interval "X" (where X=50 seconds, unless the Ground Speed in either Surface Position Message is greater than 25 knots, or is unknown, in which cases X=25 seconds), the Report Assembly Function **shall**:   

a. Perform a successful Globally Unambiguous CPR decode of the Participant Position 
in accordance with Â§A.1.7.8 of Appendix A.  Perform a validation of the resulting 
position decode as follows:  Compute the distance between own aircraft position, if known, and the Participant Position resulting from the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode.  The position validation is failed if the computed distance is greater than the maximum operating range of the receiver.  If position validation is not failed, then 
proceed with subparagraph "b" below.  Otherwise, discard the "*even*" and "odd" 
Position Messages used in the attempted Globally Unambiguous CPR decode.  The Report Mode for the given Surface Participant remains in Initialization State.   
Note: If the Surface Participant has already been in the Track State as an Airborne Participant, then it is not necessary to perform the Globally Unambiguous CPR Decode.   

b. Set the Report Mode to "Track" for the given Surface Participant in the State Vector 
Report (see Â§2.2.8.1) in accordance with Â§2.2.8.1.22,   
c. Structure all possible fields of the State Vector Report for the given Surface 
Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.1 (all subsections inclusive),   
d. Deliver the first structured State Vector Report for the given Surface Participant to 
the Report Output Storage Buffer for subsequent access by the Application Interface on demand,   
e. Continue to maintain the integrity of the State Vector Report for the given Surface 
Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer for at least 200 seconds unless 
replaced by an updated State Vector Report or otherwise specified in the following 
sections, and the conditions of the following subparagraphs **shall** apply:   
f. 
If a new Position Message is not received within a 120 second period, then the 
Globally Unambiguous CPR decode performed in Step "a" **shall** be considered to be 
invalid, and the Report Assembly Function **shall** return to the Initialization State.  In 
order to proceed from the Acquisition State to the Track State, the Globally 
Unambiguous CPR decode must be repeated.   
Note: This action effectively represents a return to the Initialization State with the exception that the return is to Step "a" above, and the report is retained as per Step "e."  The purpose of this action is to minimize the need to perform the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode since it is not necessary when position messages have been received within the reasonable time limit of 120 
seconds.  This action is illustrated in Figure 2-22. 

g. If no new messages have been received from a given Surface Participant for at least 
200 seconds, then all reports relevant to the Participant Address **shall** be deleted from 
the Report Output Storage Buffer. 

## 2.2.10.3.2.1 Latency, Report Assembly Acquisition State --- Surface Participant

Step 2.2.10.3.2.d **shall** be completed within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the second Surface Position Message of the "*even*" and "odd" pair. 

## 2.2.10.3.3 Acquisition State Data Retention

Upon receipt of any of the messages identified in Â§2.2.10.2 for any given participant, the received message **shall** either: 

a. Use the message as required in Â§2.2.10.3.1 for Airborne Participants or Â§2.2.10.3.2 
for Surface Participants, or 
b. Retain the message for future use as specified in Â§2.2.10.1.3. 

## 2.2.10.4 Report Assembly Track State 2.2.10.4.1 Report Assembly Track State  ---  Airborne Participant 2.2.10.4.1.1 Report Assembly Track State Initialization  ---  Airborne Participant

Initialization of the Track State for a given Airborne Participant assumes that the Acquisition State has been established for the given Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.10.3.1. Upon receipt of a valid Airborne Velocity Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.6) for a given Airborne Participant, the Report Assembly Function **shall**: 

a. Set the Report Mode to "Track" for the given Airborne Participant in the State Vector 
Report (see Â§2.2.8.1) in accordance with Â§2.2.8.1.22, 
b. Structure all possible fields of the State Vector Report for the given Airborne 
Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.1 (all subsections inclusive), 
c. Deliver the new State Vector Report for the given Airborne Participant to the Report 
Output Storage Buffer within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the Airborne Velocity Message, 
d. Maintain the integrity of the State Vector Report for the given Airborne Participant in 
the Report Output Storage Buffer for 100 Â±5 seconds unless replaced by an updated 
State Vector Report or otherwise specified in the following sections, 
e. Initiate Assembly of Mode Status Reports: 
(1). The Report Assembly Function **shall** review all messages received from the 
given Airborne Participant that may have been placed in temporary storage in accordance with Â§2.2.10.1.3. 
(2). Upon completion of the message review, the Report Assembly Function **shall** 
structure all possible fields of the Mode Status Report for the given Airborne Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.2 (all subsections inclusive). 
(3). The Report Assembly Function **shall** deliver the new Mode Status Report for 
the given Airborne Participant to the Report Output Storage Buffer within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the Airborne Velocity Message which initialized the Track State. 
(4). The Report Assembly Function **shall** maintain the integrity of the Mode Status 
Report for the given Airborne Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer 100 Â±5 seconds unless replaced by an updated Mode Status Report or 
otherwise specified in the following sections. 
f. 
Initiate Assembly of ADS-B Target State Reports: 
(1). The Report Assembly Function **shall** review all messages received from the 
given Airborne Participant that may have been placed in temporary storage in accordance with Â§2.2.10.1.3. 
(2). Upon completion of the message review, the Report Assembly Function **shall** 
structure all possible fields of the ADS-B Target State Report for the given Airborne Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.3 (all subsections inclusive). 
(3). The Report Assembly Function **shall** deliver the new ADS-B Target State 
Report for the given Airborne Participant to the Report Output Storage Buffer within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the Airborne Velocity Message which initialized the Track State. 
(4). The Report Assembly Function **shall** maintain the integrity of the ADS-B 
Target State Report for the given Airborne Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer for 100 Â±5 seconds unless replaced by an updated ADS-B 
Target State Report or otherwise specified in the following sections. 

## 2.2.10.4.1.2 Report Assembly Track State Maintenance --- Airborne Participant

The Track State **shall** be maintained for a given Airborne Participant for as long as Airborne Position Messages (see Â§2.2.3.2.3) and Airborne Velocity Messages (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.6) are being received from the Participant.   

a. Each time that a new Airborne Position Message is received from the given Airborne 
Participant, the Report Assembly Function **shall**:   
(1). Perform a Local CPR decode of the Airborne Participant Position in 
accordance with Â§A.1.7.4 and Â§A.1.7.5 of Appendix A.  Perform the 
reasonableness test identified in Â§2.2.10.6.3 to verify that the most recently received position does not represent an unreasonable offset from the previous aircraft position. A. If the difference between the TOMRs of the previously received Position 
Message and the most recently received Position Message is 30 seconds or less, and the position decodes resulting from the reasonableness test of Â§2.2.10.6.3 are less than or equal to 6 NM if the last Position Message 
received was an Airborne Position Message, or less than or equal to 2.5 
NM if the last Position Message received as a Surface Position Message, then the validation is successful and complete, and the position can be used to update the track.   
B. If the difference between the TOMRs of the previously received Position 
Message and the most recently received Position Message is 30 seconds or 
less, and the reported position in the most recently received Position Message differs from the previously reported position by more than 6 NM 
if the last Position Message received was an Airborne Position Message, or 
more than 2.5 NM if the last Position Message received as a Surface 
Position Message, then the most recently received position **shall not** be 
used to update the track.   
(2). Update all possible fields of the State Vector Report for the given Airborne 
Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.1 (all subsections inclusive),  
(3). Deliver the updated State Vector Report to the Report Output Storage Buffer 
within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the new Airborne Position Message, and   
(4). Maintain the integrity of the State Vector Report for the given Airborne 
Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer for 100 Â±5 seconds unless replaced by an updated State Vector Report or otherwise specified in the following sections.   
b. Each time that a new Airborne Velocity Message is received from the Airborne 
Participant that contains Ground Referenced Velocity information, the Report 
Assembly Function **shall**:   
(1). Update all possible fields of the State Vector Report for the given Airborne 
Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.1 (all subsections inclusive),   
(2). Deliver the updated State Vector Report to the Report Output Storage Buffer 
within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the new Airborne Position Message, and   
(3). Maintain the integrity of the State Vector Report for the given Airborne 
Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer for 100 Â±5 seconds unless 
replaced by an updated State Vector Report or otherwise specified in the following sections. 
c. Each time an ADS-B Airborne Velocity Message (Â§2.2.3.2.6) with Subtype="3" or 
"4" (i.e., providing Air Referenced Velocity information) is received from the ADS-
B Airborne Participant, then the Report Assembly Function **shall**: 
(1). Update all possible fields of the Air Referenced Velocity Report for the given 
ADS-B Airborne Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.3.2 (all subsections inclusive), 
(2). Deliver the updated ARV Report to the Report Output Storage Buffer within 
500 milliseconds of receipt of the new ADS-B Airborne Velocity Message, and 
(3). Maintain the integrity of the ARV Report for the given ADS-B Airborne 
Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer for 100 Â±5 seconds unless replaced by an updated ARV Report or otherwise specified in the following sections. 
d. Each time that a new Aircraft Identification and Category Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.5), 
Target State and Status Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.1) having system status information, 
Aircraft Operational Status Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.2), Airborne Velocity Message 
(Â§2.2.3.2.6), or Extended Squitter Aircraft Status Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.8) is 
received from the Airborne Participant, the Report Assembly Function **shall**: 
(1). Update all possible fields of the Mode Status Report for the given Airborne 
Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.2 (all subsections inclusive), 
(2). Deliver the updated Mode Status Report to the Report Output Storage Buffer 
within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the new Message, and 
(3). Maintain the integrity of the Mode Status Report for the given Airborne 
Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer for 100 Â±5 seconds unless replaced by an updated Mode Status Report or otherwise specified in the following sections. 
e. Each time that a new Target State and Status Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.1) having 
Target State information is received from the given Airborne Participant, the Report 
Assembly Function **shall**: 
(1). Update all possible fields of the ADS-B Target State Report for the given 
Airborne Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.3 (all subsections inclusive), 
(2). Deliver the updated ADS-B Target State Report to the Report Output Storage 
Buffer within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the new Message, and 
(3). Maintain the integrity of the ADS-B Target State Report for the given Airborne 
Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer for 100 Â±5 seconds unless replaced by an updated ADS-B Target State Report or otherwise specified in the following sections. 

## 2.2.10.4.1.3 Report Assembly Track State Termination --- Airborne Participant

a. The Track State **shall** be terminated for a given Airborne Participant if no Airborne 
Position (see Â§2.2.3.2.3) or Airborne Velocity Messages (see Â§2.2.3.2.6) have been 
received from the Participant in 25 Â±5 seconds. 
b. Upon termination of the Track State for a given Airborne Participant, the Report 
Assembly Function **shall** immediately delete all State Vector, Mode Status, ADS-B 
Target State, and Air Referenced Velocity Reports that were placed in the Report Output Storage Buffer for the given Participant. 
Note: The track state termination requires deletion of all reports structured for a given participant into the Report Output Storage Buffer.  Track state termination does not intend that temporary storage (see Â§2.2.10.1.3) 
established for the given Participant be deleted.  The temporary storage is only deleted if NO ADS-B Messages have been received from the given Participant for 225 Â±25 seconds. 

c. Upon completion of the preceding step b., the Report Assembly Function **shall** return 
to the Report Assembly Acquisition State for the given Airborne Participant as specified in Â§2.2.10.3.1. 

## 2.2.10.4.2 Report Assembly Track State --- Surface Participant 2.2.10.4.2.1 Report Assembly Track State Initialization  ---  Surface Participant

Initialization of the Track State for a given Surface Participant is established in accordance with Â§2.2.10.3.2. In addition to the requirements specified in Â§2.2.10.3.2, the Report Assembly Function shall initiate assembly of Mode Status Reports as follows: 

a. The Report Assembly Function **shall** review all messages received from the given 
Surface Participant that may have been placed in temporary storage in accordance with Â§2.2.10.1.3. 
b. Upon completion of the message review, the Report Assembly Function **shall** 
structure all possible fields of the Mode Status Report for the given Surface Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.2 (all subsections inclusive). 
c. The Report Assembly Function **shall** deliver the new Mode Status Report for the 
given Surface Participant to the Report Output Storage Buffer within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the last received Surface Position Message that initialized the Track State. 
d. The Report Assembly Function **shall** maintain the integrity of the Mode Status 
Report for the given Surface Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer 100 Â±5 
seconds unless replaced by an updated Mode Status Report or otherwise specified in the following sections. 

## 2.2.10.4.2.2 Report Assembly Track State Maintenance --- Surface Participant

The Track State **shall** be maintained for a given Surface Participant for as long as Surface Position Messages (see Â§2.2.3.2.4) are being received from the Surface Participant.   

a. Each time that a new Surface Position Message is received from the given Surface 
Participant, the Report Assembly Function **shall**:   
(1). Perform a Local CPR decode of the Surface Participant Position in accordance 
with Â§A.1.7.4 and Â§A.1.7.6 of Appendix A.  Perform the reasonableness test 
identified in Â§2.2.10.6.3 to verify that the most recently received position does 
not represent an unreasonable offset from the previous aircraft position. A. If the difference between the TOMRs of the previously received Position 
Message and the most recently received Position Message is 30 seconds or less, and the position decodes resulting from the reasonableness test of Â§2.2.10.6.3 are less than or equal to 0.75 NM if the last Position Message 
received was a Surface Position Message, or less than or equal to 2.5 NM if the last Position Message received was an Airborne Position Message, then the validation is successful and complete, and the position can be used to update the track.     
B. If the difference between the TOMRs of the previously received Position 
Message and the most recently received Position Message is 30 seconds or less, and the reported position in the most recently received Position 
Message differs from the previously reported position by more than 0.75 NM if the last Position Message received was a Surface Position Message, or more than 2.5 NM if the last Position Message received was an Airborne 
Position Message, then the most recently received position **shall not** be 
used to update the track.    
(2). Update all possible fields of the State Vector Report for the given Surface 
Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.1 (all subsections inclusive),   
(3). Deliver the updated State Vector Report to the Report Output Storage Buffer 
within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the new Surface Position Message, and   
(4). Maintain the integrity of the State Vector Report for the given Surface 
Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer for 200 Â±5 seconds unless 
replaced by an updated State Vector Report or otherwise specified in the following sections.   

b. Each time that a new Aircraft Identification and Category Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.5), 
Aircraft Operational Status Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.2), or Aircraft Status Message 
(see Â§2.2.3.2.7.8) is received from the Surface Participant, the Report Assembly 
Function **shall**:   
(1). Update all possible fields of the Mode Status Report for the given Surface 
Participant in accordance with Â§2.2.8.2 (all subsections inclusive),   
(2). Deliver the updated Mode Status Report to the Report Output Storage Buffer 
within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the new Message, and   
(3). Maintain the integrity of the Mode Status Report for the given Surface 
Participant in the Report Output Storage Buffer for 200 Â±5 seconds unless 
replaced by an updated Mode Status Report or otherwise specified in the following sections. 

## 2.2.10.4.2.3 Report Assembly Track State Termination  ---  Surface Participant

a. The Track State **shall** be terminated for a given Surface Participant if no Surface 
Position Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.4) has been received from the Participant in 200 Â±5 
seconds. 
b. Upon termination of the Track State for a given Surface Participant, the Report 
Assembly Function **shall** immediately delete all State Vector and Mode Status 
Reports that were placed in the Report Output Storage Buffer for the given Participant. 

## Notes:

1. The track state termination requires deletion of all reports structured into the 
Report Output Storage Buffer.  Track state termination does not intend that 
temporary storage (see Â§2.2.10.1.3) established for the given Participant be 
deleted.  The temporary storage is only deleted if NO ADS-B Messages have been 
received from the given Participant for 225 Â±25 seconds. 
2. ADS-B Surface Participants do not generate Trajectory Intent information; 
therefore, ADS-B Target State Report assembly is not required for Surface Participants. 
c. Upon completion of the preceding step b., the Report Assembly Function **shall** return 
to the Report Assembly Acquisition State for the given Surface Participant as specified in Â§2.2.10.3.2.   

## 2.2.10.5 Minimum Number Of Participant Track Files

In the absence of an applied interference environment and other interference, the ADS-B 
Report Assembly Function **shall** be capable of:   

a. Maintaining the minimum number of track files (see Â§2.2.10.1.4) of any mix of ADS-
B Participants and TIS-B targets as specified in Table 2-109 for a given equipage class, and   

| Equipage Class of ADS-B    | Minimum Number of       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Receiving Subsystem        | Participant Track Files |
| A0                         | 100                     |
| A1S/A1                     | 200                     |
| A2                         | 400                     |
| A3                         | 400                     |

b. If the track file capacity of the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem is being exceeded by the 
number of participants whose messages are being received by the subsystem, then the 
subsystem may choose to discard track files of those participants that are not of operational interest to the Receiving Subsystem (e.g., range and/or altitude filtering).   

## 2.2.10.6 Reasonableness Tests For Cpr Decoding Of Received Position Messages 2.2.10.6.1 Reasonableness Test Overview

Although receptions of Position Messages will normally lead to a successful target position determination, it is necessary to safeguard against Position Messages that would be used to initiate or update a track with an erroneous position.  A reasonableness test applied to the computed position resulting from receipt of a Position Message can be used to discard erroneous position updates.  Since an erroneous Globally Unambiguous CPR Decode could potentially exist for the life of a track, a reasonableness test and validation of the position protects against such occurrences.  Likewise, an erroneous Locally Unambiguous CPR Decode could result in an incorrect position that potentially remains incorrect for the life of the track.    

## 2.2.10.6.2 Reasonableness Test Applied To Positions Determined From Globally Unambiguous Cpr Decoding

A validation **shall** be performed to verify the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode established per Â§2.2.10.3.1, subparagraph "a" or Â§2.2.10.3.2, subparagraph "a," using the following steps:   

a. Compute a second Globally Unambiguous CPR decode based on reception of a new 
"odd" and an "*even*" Position Message as per Â§2.2.10.3.1, subparagraph "a" for an 
Airborne Participant, or per Â§2.2.10.3.2, subparagraph "a" for a Surface Participant, 
both received subsequent to the respective "odd" and "*even*" Position Message used 
in the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode under validation.   
b. Compare the position decode resulting from the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode 
as per subparagraph "a" above to the Locally Unambiguous CPR decode computed from the receipt of the current Position Message satisfying subparagraph "a" above, 
Note: The Locally Unambiguous CPR decode is based on the update of the position derived from the current Globally Unambiguous CPR decode established in 
Â§2.2.10.3.1, subparagraph "a," or Â§2.2.10.3.2, subparagraph "a." 

c. If the position decodes resulting from subparagraph "b" above are identical to within 
5 meters for an airborne decode and 1.25 meters for a surface decode, then the validation is complete.  Otherwise, the following subparagraph applies: 
d. No State Vector Report is generated from the receipt of the current Position Message.  
The Report Mode for the given Participant Report Mode is reset to the Initialization 
State.  All "*even*" and "odd" Position Messages received prior to the respective 
"*even*" or "odd" Position Message used in the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode in 
subparagraph "a" above are discarded.   
Note: Completion of validation requires reception of both an additional "even" 
and "odd" Position Message subsequent to the Position Messages used to satisfy the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode in Acquisition State.  In the case of Airborne Participants, since reception of an Airborne Velocity Message causes a transition from Acquisition State to Track State, as per 
Â§2.2.10.4.1.1, then validation may not be completed until the Airborne Participant is in the Track State.   

## 2.2.10.6.3 Reasonableness Test Applied To Positions Determined From Locally Unambiguous Cpr Decoding

A validation **shall** be performed to verify the Locally Unambiguous CPR decode established per Â§2.2.10.4.1.2, subparagraph "a.(1)" for Airborne Participants, or Â§2.2.10.4.2.2, subparagraph "a.(1)" for Surface Participants, using the following steps:   

a. Compare the Locally Unambiguous CPR decode computed from the reception of a 
new "odd" or "*even*" Position Message as per Â§2.2.10.4.1.2, subparagraph "a.(1)" for 
an Airborne Participant, or per Â§2.2.10.4.2.2, subparagraph "a.(1)" for a Surface 
Participant, to the current position that was computed from the previously received 
Position Message.   
b. If the difference between the TOMRs of the previously received Position Message 
and the most recently received Position Message is 30 seconds or less, and the difference in the position decodes resulting from subparagraph "a" above are greater 
than or equal to X NM  
where: 
X=6 for Airborne Participants receiving Airborne Position Messages, or X=2.5 for Airborne Participants that have received a Surface Position Message, or  
X=2.5 for Surface Participants that have received an Airborne Position Message, or X=0.75 for Surface Participants receiving Surface Position Messages,  
then the validation **shall** be considered failed, and: 

1) the most recently received position **shall not** be used to update the track, and 
2) the received position **shall** be used to initiate or update a candidate duplicate 
address track or update a duplicate address track in accordance with Â§2.2.10.7.   

## Notes:

1. If no duplicate address or candidate duplicate address Report exists for this 
ICAO 24-bit address, the position message is used to initiate a candidate duplicate address Report.  If a candidate duplicate address Report exists, the position message is used to update the candidate duplicate address Report.  
Otherwise, the position message is used to update the duplicate address Report unless the position message fails this validation test (see Â§2.2.10.7).   
2. The position threshold value is based on the assumption of a maximum aircraft 
velocity of V knots (where V=600 for Airborne and V=50 for Surface) over a 
maximum time period of 30 seconds.  This yields a maximum positional difference of approximately 5 NM for Airborne, and 0.5 NM for Surface.  An 
additional measure of 1 nautical mile for Airborne, and 0.25 for Surface are added to account for additional ADS-B positional measurement uncertainty.  The position threshold of 2.5 nautical miles between surface and airborne participants was derived from the assumption of 250 knots maximum speed for a target transitioning from the surface state to an airborne state over 30 seconds, yielding approximately 2 nautical miles, with an additional 0.5 NM being added to allow for positional errors.   

## 2.2.10.7 Duplicate Address Processing

The ICAO 24-bit address transmitted in each ADS-B Message and the derived Address Qualifier is used to identify and associate the messages for a particular aircraft/vehicle. Though each aircraft/vehicle should have a unique ICAO 24-bit address, there may be occasions on which more than one aircraft/vehicle is transmitting the same ICAO 24 bit address.  It is important for ADS-B applications that receive 1090ES ADS-B Reports to have knowledge of aircraft within receiving range.  The requirements in the following subparagraphs enable detection of a duplicate address aircraft/vehicle when horizontal position separation is outside of the local CPR reasonableness test criteria of Â§2.2.10.6.3.   

## Notes:

1. Without duplicate address detection, an aircraft/vehicle that enters the range of the 
receiver with the same ICAO 24-bit address as that of an existing ADS-B Report would go undetected and message data from the undetected aircraft/vehicle could be erroneously associated with the existing ADS-B Report. 
2. Duplicate Address processing is not required for TIS-B targets.  The assumption is 
that the ADS-B Ground Stations will protect against any Duplicate Address situation. 

## 2.2.10.7.1 Candidate Duplicate Address Report

A candidate duplicate address Report **shall** be initiated when a position message is received for an ICAO 24-bit address that fails the local CPR reasonableness test validation of Â§2.2.10.6.3.b and no candidate duplicate address Report or duplicate address Report is currently active for the received ICAO 24-bit address.  If initiated, the candidate duplicate address Report is set to Initialization State as per Â§2.2.10.2 and the position message is stored for this candidate duplicate address Report.  The ADS-B 
Report for which the position message did not pass the validation test of Â§2.2.10.6.3.b, the local CPR reasonableness test, is the primary ADS-B Report for this ICAO 24-bit address.  Once a candidate duplicate address Report is initiated, association of subsequent position messages with this ICAO 24-bit address **shall** be first attempted on the primary ADS-B Report for this ICAO 24-bit address.  If the position message does not pass the validation test of Â§2.2.10.6.3.b on the primary ADS-B Report, the position message **shall** 
be used to attempt Track Initialization on the candidate duplicate address Report as per Â§2.2.10.2.   

## Notes:

1. TIS-B Reports and ADS-R Reports are separate and distinct from ADS-B Reports as 
per Â§2.2.17 and Â§2.2.18 so there is no duplicate address issues between these Report 
types and ADS-B Reports.   
2. Inter-source correlation is addressed in RTCA DO-317.   

## 2.2.10.7.2 Duplicate Address Condition

A duplicate address condition **shall** be declared for an ICAO 24-bit address when a global CPR decode is completed by the receipt of both an even and odd position message within 10 seconds for the candidate duplicate address and passes the global CPR 
reasonableness test.  Once declared, a duplicate address condition **shall** result in the Duplicate Address Flag in the State Vector Report set to "ON" in the ADS-B Report upon output of either ADS-B Report in the duplicate address condition.  ADS-B Position Messages **shall** be associated with the ADS-B Report in the duplicate address condition that passes the local CPR reasonableness test in Â§2.2.10.6.3.b.  Each ADS-B Report in the duplicate address condition **shall** be updated upon receipt of other Extended Squitter Messages containing the duplicate ICAO 24-bit address since there is no means to associate these messages with the correct aircraft. ADS-B Position, Velocity, Aircraft Identification and Category and Emergency / Priority Status (Subtype=1) Messages from aircraft/vehicles with ICAO 24-bit addresses identified as Duplicate Addresses **shall** be processed as Version ZERO (0) format Messages.  Since Target State and Status Messages can be associated with the appropriate MOPS ADS-B Version Number based on the Subtype, and Operational Status Messages contain the MOPS ADS-B Version Number, these messages can be decoded directly.   

## Notes:

1. The Duplicate Address Flag is used to indicate to ADS-B applications that 
information associated with that address can not be correctly associated with either ADS-B Report in the duplicate address condition.  Additionally, the correct MOPS 
ADS-B Version Number for each of the aircraft/vehicles can not be readily 
determined so interpretation of message data defaults to Version ZERO (0).  
2. The update and output of both ADS-B Reports when Extended Squitter Messages are 
received with the duplicate ICAO 24-bit address results in additional overhead since output of both ADS-B Reports possibly occurs upon message reception.  However, this approach gives ADS-B applications the ability to associate information with the correct ADS-B Report if they choose to attempt to correlate using the additional 
provided information.   
The duplicate address condition **shall** be cleared after 60 seconds has elapsed with no Position Message update for a Participant with an ADS-B Report identified in the duplicate address condition.   The relevant ADS-B Report for the Participant **shall** be deleted from the Report Output Storage Buffer.  Output of the remaining ADS-B Report shall contain a State Vector Report with the Duplicate Address Flag set to "OFF".   

Note: After clearing the duplicate address condition, the ADS-B Report for the 
aircraft/vehicle that continues to receive Position Messages that pass the local CPR reasonableness test, as well as other 1090ES ADS-B Messages, is retained 
and updated as per Â§2.2.10.4.   

## 2.2.10.7.3 Duplicate Address Report Capacity

The ADS-B Receiving Subsystem **shall** be capable of maintaining and processing a minimum of three concurrent duplicate address Reports.    

Note: The required capacity includes duplicate address Reports from both ADS-B and 
ADS-R targets.  Since duplicate address situations are expected to be infrequent events, the ability to handle three duplicate address Reports is expected to be sufficient.   

## 2.2.11 Self Test And Monitors 2.2.11.1 Self Test

If a self-test feature or monitor is provided as part of the equipment: 

a. The device which radiates test ADS-B Messages or prevents messages from being 
broadcast during the test period **shall** be limited to no longer than that required to 
determine the status of the system.   
b. The self-test message signal level at the antenna end of the transmission line **shall** 
not exceed -40 dBm.   
c. If provision is made for automatic periodic self-test procedure, such self-testing **shall** 
not radiate ADS-B Messages at an average rate exceeding one broadcast every ten 
seconds.   

## 2.2.11.2 Broadcast Monitoring 2.2.11.2.1 Transponder-Based Equipment

If the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is implemented as part of a Mode S Transponder, then the squitter monitor required by RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.10.2 (EUROCAE ED-73E, 
Â§3.14.2) is sufficient to ensure proper operation of the transmit chain.  If the squitter monitor indicates a failure, the device failure indication **shall** be asserted.    

## 2.2.11.2.2 Non-Transponder-Based Equipment

If the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is a broadcast only device, then a monitor **shall** be provided to verify that DF=18 transmissions are generated at the applicable rates specified in Â§2.2.3.3 through Â§2.2.3.3.1.3.  Event-Driven Squitter rates are not required to be monitored to meet this requirement.  If the DF=18 transmissions cannot be transmitted properly, the device failure indication **shall** be asserted (see Â§2.2.11.5.1).   

## 2.2.11.3 Address Verification 2.2.11.3.1 Transponder-Based Equipment

Transponder implemented ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems **shall** declare a device failure in the event that it's own ICAO 24-bit Address (i.e., the Mode-S Address) is set to all 
"ZEROs" or all "ONEs." 

2.2.11.3.2 
Non-Transponder-Based Equipment 
Non-transponder implemented ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems **shall** declare a device failure in the event that it's own ICAO 24-bit Address is set to all "ZEROs" or all 
"ONEs." 

## 2.2.11.4 Receiver Self Test Capability

ADS-B Receiving Devices **shall** be designed to provide sufficient self-test capability to detect a loss of capability to receive ADS-B Messages, structure appropriate ADS-B 
reports, and make such reports available to the intended user interface.  Should the receiving device detect that these basic functions cannot be performed properly, the unit shall **declare a device failure**.  Loss of data on external interfaces should not cause the Receiver Device Failure to be asserted.   

## 2.2.11.5 Device Failure Annunciation 2.2.11.5.1 Ads-B Transmission Device Failure Annunciation

An output **shall** be provided to indicate the validity/non-validity of the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem hardware.  Failure to correctly transmit ADS-B Messages detected by self-test, or the broadcast monitoring function, or the address verification shall cause the output to assert the FAIL state.  Momentary power interrupts shall not cause the output to assert the FAIL state.  Loss of data on external interfaces should not cause the Transmit Device Failure to be asserted. The status of the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** be available for annunciation to the flight crew where applicable.  When the ADS-B Transmit Subsystem is integrated with a Mode S Transponder, the Transponder Fail signal may be used to indicate ADS-B Transmission Device Failure 
(refer to DO-181E Â§2.2.10.4, EURCAE ED-73E, Â§3.14.3).   

## 2.2.11.5.2 Ads-B Receiving Device Failure Annunciation

An output **shall** be provided to indicate the validity/non-validity of the ADS-B receiving device.  Failure to accept ADS-B Messages, structure appropriate ADS-B reports, make such reports available to the intended user interface, or failure detected by self-test or monitoring functions **shall** cause the output to assume the invalid state.  Loss of data on external interfaces should not cause the Receiver Device Failure to be asserted.  
Momentary power interrupts shall not cause the output to assume the invalid state.  The status of the ADS-B receiving device **shall** be available for annunciation to the flight crew where applicable.   

## 2.2.11.6 Ads-B Function Fail Annunciation

The ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving Subsystems depend on a position source to provide the data to populate the ADS-B Messages and Reports.  These sources or interconnects between them and the ADS-B device may fail and prevent the system from transmitting ADS-B Messages or Reports.  In this case, the ADS-B transmit/receive subsystem cannot function, but there is not a failure of the ADS-B device itself.  It is desirable to indicate that the ADS-B function is failed independently of the ADS-B 
Device Failure Annunciation.   
If the conditions of setting TYPE Code equal ZERO, as per Â§2.2.3.2.3.1.3.2 are met, then the ADS-B Function Fail Annunciation **shall** be asserted.  The status of the ADS-B 
Function **shall** be available for annunciation to the flight crew.   

Note: Although it is desirable to have an independent ADS-B Function Fail 
annunciation, some legacy airplanes may have to share the ADS-B Device Failure annunciation to also indicate when an ADS-B Function Fail has occurred.  In the case where the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is also 
integrated with a Mode S Transponder (Â§2.2.11.5.1), caution should be taken to 
ensure that the ADS-B Function Fail is not interpreted as a Mode S Transponder Device Failure that could generate a subsequent TCAS Fail annunciation.   

## 2.2.12 Response To Mutual Suppression Pulses

Mutual suppression systems may be needed if the aircraft has other pulse L-band (also known as D-band) equipment on board or if the ADS-B equipment is used in conjunction with certain Collision Avoidance System equipment. 

## 2.2.12.1 Ads-B Transmitting Subsystem Response To Mutual Suppression Pulses

If the ADS-B transmitting equipment is designed to accept and respond to mutual suppression pulses from other electronic equipment in the aircraft (to disable the equipment while the other equipment is transmitting), the equipment **shall** regain normal transmission capability not later than 15 microseconds after the end of the applied mutual suppression pulse. 

## 2.2.12.2 Ads-B Receiving Device Response To Mutual Suppression Pulses

If the ADS-B receiving equipment is designed to accept and respond to mutual suppression pulses from other electronic equipment in the aircraft (to disable the equipment while the other equipment is transmitting), the equipment **shall** regain normal sensitivity, within 3 dB, not later than 15 microseconds after the end of the applied mutual suppression pulse. 

Note: This document does not establish the design parameters of the mutual suppression system.  However, it is recommended that all sources of mutual suppression pulses be DC coupled while sinks are AC coupled.  This standardization will prevent source or sink failures from disabling all users of the mutual suppression pulses. 

## 2.2.13 Antenna System

ADS B systems require omni-directional antenna(s) for transmitting and receiving. Separate antenna for receiving and transmitting are not required. 

## 2.2.13.1 Transmit Pattern Gain

The gain of an omni-directional transmit antenna shall not be less than the gain of a matched quarter-wave stub minus 3 dB over 90 percent of a coverage volume from 0 to 
360 degrees in azimuth and from 5 to 30 degrees above the ground plane when installed at center of 1.2 meter (4 feet) diameter (or larger) flat circular ground plane. 

## 2.2.13.2 Receiver Pattern Gain

The gain of an omni-directional antenna should not be less than the gain of a matched quarter-wave stub minus one dB over 90% of a coverage volume from 0 to 360 degrees in azimuth and -15 to +20 degrees in elevation when installed at the center of a 1.2 m (4 ft.) diameter (or larger) circular ground plane that can be either flat or cylindrical. 

Note: These requirements are consistent with those provided in RTCA DO-185B, 
Â§2.2.4.7.2.1 (EUROCAE ED-143, Â§2.2.4.7.2.1). 

## 2.2.13.3 Frequency Requirements For Transmit And Receive Antenna(S)

Antenna **shall** be designed to transmit and receive signals at 1090 Â±1 MHz. 

## 2.2.13.4 Impedance And Vswr

The VSWR produced by each antenna when terminated in a 50 ohm transmission line shall not exceed 1.5:1 at 1090 MHz. 

## 2.2.13.5 Polarization

Antenna(s) **shall** be vertically polarized. 

## 2.2.13.6 Diversity Operation

Diversity transmission and/or reception is described in Â§3.3.1.  Such implementations shall employ two antennas, one mounted on the top and the other on the bottom of the aircraft.  Separate requirements apply to transmitting diversity and receiving diversity as provide in the following subsections. 

## 2.2.13.6.1 Transmitting Diversity

"Transmitting diversity" refers to the alternation between the top and bottom-mounted antennas for the transmission of ADS-B Messages.  If an ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem implements transmitting diversity, it **shall** transmit each required type of ADS-B 
Message alternately from the top and bottom antennas.   

## Notes:

1. For example, successive Airborne Position Messages would be transmitted on 
different antennas.  Again, successive messages loaded into a transponder's eventdriven register would be transmitted alternately from the top and bottom antennas.   
2. On systems implementing transmitting diversity, the use of the top antenna only is the 
default condition for broadcasting the surface type messages.  The selection of the antenna when transmitting surface type messages may be under the control of other systems (see RTCA DO-181E / EUROCAE ED-73E).   
The Single Antenna Flag (SAF) is set as described in Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.4.5. 

## 2.2.13.6.1.1 Transmitting Diversity Channel Isolation

The peak RF power transmitted from the selected antenna **shall** exceed the power transmitted from the non-selected antenna by at least 20 dB. 

## 2.2.13.6.2 Receiving Diversity

"Receiving diversity" refers to an ADS-B Receiving Subsystem's use of signals received from either the top antenna, or the bottom antenna, or both antennas. For the purpose of these requirements, several alternate ADS-B Receiving Subsystem architectures that employ receiving antenna "diversity" are illustrated in Figure 2â17. 

a. Full receiver and message processing function diversity:   
(see Figure 2-24, part b1.) 
There are two receiver input channels, each with its own receiver front end, preamble detection, bit demodulation, error detection, and error correction functions. Channel selection is based on declaration of a correct message by the parity error detection function.  In the event that both channels produce an identical correct message with no parity errors, the message from either channel can be selected as the received message, which is then delivered to the report assembly function. In the event each channel produces valid, but different messages, both **shall** be delivered to the report assembly function.  

b. Receiver Switching Front-end Diversity:   
(see Figure 2-24, part b2.) 
There are two receiver input channels, each with its own receiver front end and preamble detection; followed by single channel bit, demodulation, error detection, and error correction functions.  Channel selection is based on the detection of valid preamble pulse patterns and connection of the single string elements to the receiver input having the strongest preamble pulse pattern. In the event that the preamble pulse patterns for both channels are within 1 dB of each other, either receiver input may be selected. 

c. Receiving antenna switching:   
(see Figure 2-24, part b3.) 
A single receiver input channel, consisting of receiver RF front end, preamble detection, bit demodulation, and error detection and correction functions, is internally connected alternately and periodically to the top and bottom antennas.  If this method is implemented, switching **shall** cause the channel to dwell for 2.0 seconds on each antenna and continue an alternating transition every 2 Â±0.1 seconds.  The switching function **shall** result in loss of no more than 1 input message for each transition when the RF message signals are present at the required maximum incoming message rate of 8000 ADS-B Messages per second. 

## Notes:

1. The maximum rate is derived from Â§2.2.4.3.4.1.which infers that the receiver 
sensitivity threshold will be recovered in not more than 120 microseconds after the detection of the preamble.  Therefore, the minimum separation between the leading edge of the first preamble pulse of two successive ADS-B Messages is established at 125 microseconds, thereby establishing the maximum possible short term rate of 8000 ADS-B Messages per second. 
2. The maximum rate identified above is not typical of the future ADS-B 
environment and should not be applied to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem as a steady state rate.  This high rate should be applied to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem for short durations that are adequate to demonstrate compliance of the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem. 
ADS-B Receiving Subsystems which implement antenna switching to a single receiver as discussed in Â§"c," **shall** provide a method of delivering all ADS-B Messages to an appropriate output interface for the purpose of monitoring the message throughput capability of the Receiving Subsystem (see Figure 2-24, part a., "MOPS test point").  

d. Other switching diversity techniques.  Other diversity implementations may be used. 
Any implementation must meet the requirements of (a) or (b) above.

## 2.2.17 Traffic Information Services - Broadcast (Tis-B) 2.2.17.1 Introduction

This section defines the formats and coding for a Traffic Information Service Broadcast (TIS-B) based on the same 112-bit 1090 MHz signal transmission that is used for ADS-B 
on 1090 MHz. TIS-B complements the operation of ADS-B by providing ground-to-air broadcast of surveillance data on aircraft that are not equipped for 1090 MHz ADS-B.  The basis for this ground surveillance data may be an ATC Mode S radar, a surface or approach multilateration system or a multi-sensor data processing system.  The TIS-B ground-to-air transmissions use the same signal formats as 1090 MHz ADS-B and can therefore be accepted by a 1090 MHz ADS-B receiver. 

TIS-B data content on the 1090 MHz signal does not include all of the parameters, such as the System Design Assurance (SDA) and the SIL Supplement, which are normally associated with ADS-B transmissions from aircraft.  Those parameters that are not broadcast will need to be provided by the TIS-B Service Provider.   
TIS-B service is the means for providing a complete surveillance picture to 1090 MHz ADS-B users during a transition period.  After transition, it also provides a means to cope with a user that has lost its 1090 MHz ADS-B capability, as well as a means to provide ADS-B users with information from surface or approach multi-lateration systems.   

## 2.2.17.2 Tis-B Format Structure

TIS-B information is broadcast using the 112-bit Mode S DF=18 format as shown in Figure 2-25.

## 2.2.17.3.5.1 Relationship To Ads-B Format

The format of the TIS-B Coarse Position Message is not specifically related to any other ADS-B format.  The Surveillance Status and CPR Format (F) fields **shall** be decoded as specified for the ADS-B Airborne Position Message defined in Â§2.2.3.2.3.  The formats for the other elements of the TIS-B Coarse Position Message are specified in the following subparagraphs.   

## 2.2.17.3.5.2 Icao/Mode A Flag (Imf)

This one-bit ("ME" bit 1) field **shall** be set as specified in Â§2.2.17.3.1.2. 

## 2.2.17.3.5.3 Service Volume Id (Svid)

The 4-bit ("ME" bits 4 - 7) SVID field **shall** be decoded to identify the TIS-B site that delivered the surveillance data. 

Note: In the case where TIS-B Messages associated with a specific target are being received from more than one TIS-B ground station, the receiving application can use the SVID to select coarse messages from a single source.  This will prevent the receiving application's TIS-B track from wandering due to the different error biases associated with different sources. 

## 2.2.17.3.5.4 Pressure Altitude

This 12-bit ("ME" bits 8 - 19) field **shall** be decoded as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3.4.1. 

## 2.2.17.3.5.5 Ground Track Status

This one bit ("ME" bit 20) field **shall** define the validity of the Ground Track value.  
Coding for this field **shall** be as follows:  0=not valid and 1= valid. 

## 2.2.17.3.5.6 Ground Track Angle

This 5-bit ("ME" bits 21 - 25) field **shall** define the direction (in degrees clockwise from true north) of aircraft motion.  The Ground Track **shall** be encoded as an unsigned angular weighted binary numeral, with an MSB of 180 degrees and an LSB of 360/32 
degrees, with ZERO (0) indicating true north.  The data in the field **shall** be rounded to the nearest multiple of 360/32 degrees. 

## 2.2.17.3.5.7 Ground Speed

This 6-bit ("ME" bits 26 - 31) field **shall** define the aircraft speed over the ground.  
Coding of this field **shall** be as shown in Table 2-111.

## Notes:

1. The encoding shown in the table represents Positive Magnitude data only.   
2. Raw data used to establish the Ground Speed Subfield will normally have more 
resolution (i.e., more bits) than that required by the Ground Speed Subfield.  When 
converting such data to the Ground Speed Subfield, the accuracy of the data must be 
maintained such that it is not worse than Â±Â½ LSB where the LSB is that of the 
Ground Speed Subfield. 

## 2.2.17.3.5.8 Encoded Latitude And Longitude

The Encoded Latitude field **shall** be decoded consistent with the format specified in 
Â§2.2.3.2.3.7, except that the 12-bit CPR coding specified in Appendix A, Â§A.1.7 **shall** be used. 

The Encoded Longitude field **shall** be decoded consistent with the format specified in Â§2.2.3.2.3.8, except that the 12-bit CPR coding specified in Appendix A, Â§A.1.7 **shall** be used. 

 

## 2.2.17.4 Tis-B Message Processing And Report Generation

The information received in TIS-B Messages is reported directly to applications, with one exception.  The exception is latitude-longitude position information, which is CPR-
encoded when it is received, and must be decoded before reporting.  In order to accomplish CPR decoding, it is necessary to track received messages, so that even-format and odd-format messages can be combined to determine the latitude and longitude of the target. In the most common case, a particular target will result in TIS-B Message receptions or ADS-B Message receptions, but not both.  It is possible, however, for both types of messages to be received for a single target.  If this happens, the TIS-B information is processed and reported independently of the ADS-B receptions and reporting. 

## 2.2.17.4.1 Tis-B Message-To-Track Correlation

Tracking makes it possible to associate a received message with information previously received about that same target, in the presence of many other intervening messages about other targets.  Such associations are necessary for global decodes (Â§2.2.17.4.2), for estimating velocity when position was received (Â§2.2.17.4.6) and for estimating position when velocity was received (Â§2.2.17.4.6). 

## 2.2.17.4.1.1 Tis-B Messages Having A Icao 24-Bit Address

For a target that has a ICAO 24-bit Address, that address is used for correlating new receptions with information in the TIS-B track file.  Correlation is successful if the address matches exactly.  When a TIS-B Position Message having a ICAO 24-bit Address is received, and an existing TIS-B track has the same address, the message **shall** 
be correlated with the track.   

## 2.2.17.4.1.2 Tis-B Messages Having Mode A Code And Track Number

For a target not identified by a 24-bit ICAO Address, but instead having a Mode A Code and a TIS-B track number, then these are used to correlate with information in the track file.  Correlation is successful if the Mode A Code and the track number both match exactly.  When a TIS-B Message having a Mode A Code and TIS-B track number is received, and an existing TIS-B track has the same Mode A Code and ADS-B track number, the message **shall** be correlated with the track. 

## 2.2.17.4.2 Tis-B Position Message Decoding

When a received TIS-B Position Message correlates to an existing TIS-B track, the message and the track are used together to decode the latitude and longitude of the target. If the track is "Complete," meaning that a global decode has been accomplished, then the new latitude-longitude information **shall** be decoded using local decoding, as specified in 
Â§A.1.7.4 in Appendix A, taking the previous position of the target as the reference. If the TIS-B track is "Incomplete," meaning that a global decode has not yet been accomplished prior to this reception, then a global decode may be computed depending on the contents of the track.  If the information in the track together with the new position message consist of at least one even format message and at least one odd format message received within 10 seconds, then a global decode **shall** be computed as specified in 
Â§A.1.7.7 of Appendix A.  Otherwise the received encoded position, the even/odd format, and the time of applicability, **shall** be saved in the track file for later use. 

Note: When decoding positions, a reasonableness test may be applied. 

 

## 2.2.17.4.3 Tis-B Track Update

When a position message is correlated to a TIS-B track that is Complete, then a new position is computed as specified in Â§2.2.17.4.2 and the tracked position **shall** be updated with the new position and time of applicability.  The previous position and time need not be saved.  Figure 2-32 illustrates the transition from Incomplete track to Complete track and later track drop. When a position message is correlated with a TIS-B track that is Incomplete, the new information may make it possible for a global decode, as specified in Â§2.2.17.4.2.  If a global decode is accomplished, the track **shall** be promoted to Complete, and the latitude, longitude, and time of applicability **shall** be saved in the track.  The previous position and time information need not be saved.  If a global decode is not accomplished, the even and odd encoded positions **shall** be saved for future decodes.   
Note: It is not necessary to save any encoded positions longer than 10 seconds. 


## 2.2.17.4.4 Tis-B Track Initiation

A TIS-B track begins with the reception of one position message.  A new Incomplete track **shall** be created, and the encoded position, even/odd format bit, and time of applicability **shall** be saved. 

## 2.2.17.4.5 Tis-B Track Drop

A TIS-B track that is Complete shall not be dropped within 120 seconds after any TIS-B 
Position Message reception.  If 125 seconds elapses without any TIS-B Message reception, the track **shall** be dropped. 

Note: As specified in Â§2.2.17.4.3, for an Incomplete TIS-B track, it is not necessary to save any information more than 10 seconds after reception.  Therefore the track can be dropped after 10 seconds. 

## 2.2.17.4.6 Tis-B Report Generation

As TIS-B Messages are received, the information is reported to applications.  All received information elements, other than position, **shall** be reported directly, including all reserved fields for the TIS-B fine format messages (Â§2.2.17.3.1 to Â§2.2.17.3.4) and the entire message content (i.e., including the complete 88-bit content of the DF, CF, AA and "ME" fields of the Extended Squitter Message) of any received TIS-B Management Message (Table 2-110, for CF=4).  The reporting format is not specified in detail, except that the information content reported **shall** be the same as the information content received.  The report **shall** be issued within 0.5 seconds of the message reception. 

When a TIS-B Position Message is received, it is compared with tracks to determine whether it can be decoded into target position, as specified in Â§2.2.17.4.2.  If the message is decoded into target position, a report **shall** be generated, within 0.5 seconds of the message reception.  The report **shall** contain the received position information with its time of applicability, the most recently received velocity measurement with its time of applicability, estimated position and velocity, applicable to a common time of applicability, address, and all other information in the received message.  The estimated values **shall** be based on the received position information and the track history of this target. When a TIS-B Velocity Message is received, if it is correlated to a complete track, then a report **shall** be generated, within 0.5 seconds of the message reception.  The report **shall** 
contain the received velocity information with its time of applicability, the most recently received position measurement with its time of applicability, estimated position and velocity, applicable to a common time of applicability, address, and all other information in the received message.  The estimated values **shall** be based on the received ground referenced velocity information and the track history of this target. 

## Notes:

1. Whereas ADS-B reports are classified as to "State Vector Reports" and certain other 
defined types, TIS-B reports are not.  Instead, TIS-B reporting follows the general principle that all received information is reported directly upon reception. 
2. In the absence of TIS-B Message receptions, it is possible for reports to be generated, 
but this is not required.  Such additional reports might be useful as a means of counteracting possible flaws in an on-board data bus between ADS-B and an application. 
3. Track drop (Â§2.2.17.4.5) is the only TIS-B function for which time-out performance is 
required.  It is expected that TIS-B applications will take account of the times when 
information is reported and will apply the time-out functions that are appropriate for each application. 

## 2.2.18 Ads-B Rebroadcast Service - Formats And Coding 2.2.18.1 Introduction

The TIS-B MASPS, RTCA DO-286B defines, in addition to the "Fundamental TIS-B 
Service," an "ADS-B Rebroadcast Service" as an additional service that may be provided.  The Messages of the ADS-B Rebroadcast Service are not transmitted by aircraft, but by ADS-B ground stations.   

## Notes:

1. This section defines the formats and coding for an ADS-B Rebroadcast (ADS-R) 
Service (see the TIS-B MASPS, RTCA DO-286B, Â§1.4.1) based on the same 112-bit 
1090 MHz Extended Squitter signal transmission that is used for DF=17 ADS-B Messages on 1090 MHz.   
2. The ADS-B Rebroadcast Service complements the operation of ADS-B and the 
Fundamental TIS-B Service (see the TIS-B MASPS, RTCA DO-286B, Â§1.4.1) by providing ground-to-air rebroadcast of ADS-B data about aircraft that are not equipped for 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B, but are equipped with an alternate form of ADS-B (e.g., Universal Access Transceiver (UAT)).  The basis for the ADS-R transmission is the ADS-B Report received at the Ground Station using a receiver compatible with the alternate ADS-B data link.   
3. The ADS-R ground-to-air transmissions use the same signal formats as the DF=17 
1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B and can therefore be accepted by a 1090 MHz ADS-B Receiving Subsystem, with the exceptions identified in the following sections.   

## 2.2.18.2 Ads-B Rebroadcast Format Definition

ADS-B Rebroadcast information is transmitted using the 112-bit Mode S DF=18 format specified in Figure 2-2. 

 

## 2.2.18.3 Control Field Allocation

The content of the DF=18 transmission is defined by the value of the Control Field (CF).  
As specified in Table 2-9, ADS-B Rebroadcast (i.e., ADS-R) transmissions use CF=6, and ADS-R Management information transmissions (i.e., defining ADS-R Service Volume and service availability) use CF=4.  The ADS-B Receiving Subsystem **shall** 
accept and process ADS-R Messages, DF=18, with CF=4 and CF=6.   

 

## 2.2.18.4 Ads-R Message Processing

The Rebroadcast of ADS-B information on the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter data link is accomplished by utilizing the same ADS-B Message formats used by aircraft/vehicles with the exception of the need to transmit an indication to the 1090 MHz Receiving Subsystem as to the type of identity associated with the aircraft data being reported in the ADS-B Rebroadcast Message.  This identification is performed using the ICAO/Mode A Flag (IMF), which was previously discussed in Â§2.2.17.3.1.2 for the TIS-B transmissions. 

The insertion of this one bit into the ADS-B Messages identified in the subparagraphs below allows the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem to interpret the Address Field (AF) in the following manner:   

IMF = 0 
indicates that the ADS-B Rebroadcast data is identified by an ICAO 24-bit 
Address.   
IMF = 1 
indicates that the ADS-B Rebroadcast data is identified by an anonymous 24-
bit address or ground vehicle address or fixed obstruction address.   
The ADS-B Receiving Subystem outputs data to ADS-B applications for aircraft/vehicles received via ADS-R Messages similar to direct reception of ADS-B Messages from aircraft/vehicles.  ADS-R Messages may be received from a Ground Station transmitting ADS-B Version ONE (1) or Version TWO (2) Messages that have been received by the Ground Station from an aircraft or vehicle transmitting on an alternate ADS-B data link. Therefore, to correctly decode the data, knowledge of the MOPS ADS-B Version Number is required.  The ADS-B Receiving Subsystem **shall** decode all valid ADS-R 
transmitted messages and structure the information from such received messages into the appropriate ADS-B Reports as per Â§2.2.8 and designate them as ADS-R Reports. 

Note: ADS-B applications may need to distinguish ADS-B Reports generated from direct receipt and those received via ADS-R.   

## 2.2.18.4.1 Ads-R Airborne Position Messages

The ADS-B Receiving Subsystem **shall** decode and process the "ME" Field of the ADS-
R Airborne Position Messages, and update and maintain ADS-R Reports with the decoded data in accordance with Â§2.2.18.5.  The format is as specified in Figure 2-33.   

## Notes:

1. The format is identical to the Airborne Position Message depicted in Figure 2-3, 
except that "ME" bit 8 is redefined to be the ICAO/Mode A Flag (IMF).   
2. The format of ADS-B Version ONE ADS-R Airborne Position Messages is depicted in 
Figure N-8, which represents the ADS-B Airborne Position Message, except that 
"ME" bit 8 is redefined to be the ICAO/Mode A Flag (IMF).

R Aircraft Identification and Category Messages, and update and maintain ADS-R 
Reports with the decoded data in accordance with Â§2.2.18.5.  The format is as specified in Figure 2-6.   
Note: Any Rebroadcast ADS-B Aircraft Identification and Category Message does not contain the IMF bit since aircraft using an anonymous 24-bit address will not provide identity and category information.   

 

## 2.2.18.4.4 Ads-R Airborne Velocity Messages

The ADS-B Receiving Subsystem **shall** decode and process the "ME" Field of the ADS-
R Airborne Velocity Messages, and update and maintain ADS-R Reports with the decoded data in accordance with Â§2.2.18.5.  The format is as specified in Figure 2-35 for Subtype 1 & 2 Messages, and in Figure 2-36 for Subtype 3 & 4 Messages.   

## Notes:

1. The format of ADS-B Version ONE and ADS-B Version TWO ADS-R Airborne 
Velocity Messages is identical to the ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages depicted in 
Figure 2-7 for Subtype 1 & 2 Messages, and in Figure 2-8 for Subtype 3 & 4 
Messages, except that "ME" bit 9 is redefined to be the ICAO/Mode A Flag (IMF).   
2. "ME" Bit 10 in ADS-B Version ONE (1) ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages is the 
IFR Capability Flag, which is not conveyed in ADS-B Version TWO (2) ADS-B

## 2.2.18.5 Ads-R Report Processing

ADS-R Reports **shall** be maintained and output for DF=18, with CF=6 ADS-R Messages consistent with the ADS-B Report Characteristics requirements of Â§2.2.8 and the Report Assembly and Delivery requirements of Â§2.2.10.  ADS-R Reports **shall** be provided for both ADS-B Version ONE (1) and Version TWO (2) formatted ADS-R Messages in accordance with the message formats provided in Â§2.2.18.4. 

Note: ADS-R Reports are for Participants that do not have ADS-B Reports since they 
are ADS-B Messages transmitted by the Ground for aircraft/vehicles that 
transmit on a different ADS-B link (e.g., UAT).  ADS-R Messages are processed 
by the 1090ES ADS-B Receiving Subsystems in the same manner as ADS-B 
Messages received directly from aircraft/vehicle Participants.   

## 2.3 Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in this subsection provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under conditions representative of those that may be encountered in actual aeronautical operations. Some of the environmental tests contained in this subsection need not be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition.  These tests are identified by the phrase "When Required."  If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional environmental conditions, then these 
"when required" tests **shall** be performed. 

The test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in RTCA DO-160G (EUROCAE ED-14G), Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, December 2010. Some of the performance requirements in Subsections 2.1 and 2.2 are not tested by test procedures herein.  Moreover, not all tests are required to be done at each of the environmental conditions in RTCA DO-160G (EUROCAE ED-14G).  Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Subsections 2.1 and 2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these environmental conditions. 

The specified performance tests cover all classes of ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving Subsystems.  Only those tests that are applicable to the class of equipment being qualified need be performed.  Additional tests may have to be performed in order to determine performance of particular design requirements that are not specified in this document.  It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to determine appropriate tests for these functions. 

Specific ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving Subsystem performance tests have been included in this section for use in conjunction with the environmental procedures of RTCA DO-160G (EUROCAE ED-14G).  These tests have been chosen as a subset of the ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving Subsystem performance tests provided in subsection 
2.4.  Normally, a MOPS document does not provide specific equipment performance tests to be used in conjunction with the environmental procedures of RTCA DO-160G 
(EUROCAE ED-14G).  However, there is a sufficiently large number of ADS-B 
Transmitting and Receiving Subsystem performance tests in subsection 2.4 that it would be impractical to repeat all of those tests in conjunction with all of the appropriate environmental procedures. 

## 2.3.1 Environmental Test Conditions

Table 2-112 lists all of the environmental conditions and test procedures (hereafter referred to as environmental procedures) that are documented in RTCA DO-160G (EUROCAE ED-14G).  Table 2-113 lists the sets of ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving Subsystem performance tests that are specified in detail in this section and which are intended to be run subject to the various environmental procedures of RTCA DO-160G (EUROCAE ED-14G).  In order to simplify the process of relating the environmental procedures to the ADS-B equipment performance tests, Table 2-112 divides the environmental procedures into groups.  All of the procedures in a given group are carried out in conjunction with the same set of ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving Subsystem performance tests.  Using this approach, the environmental procedures fall into five groups.  The environmental procedures that apply to all of the sets of ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving Subsystem tests fall into group 1.  Group 2 procedures apply to 9 of the sets of ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving Subsystem performance tests. Group 3 procedures apply to 6 of the sets of ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving Subsystem performance tests. Group 4 procedures apply to one set of the performance tests.  Group 5, which applies to none of the ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving Subsystem performance tests, includes only environmental procedures that are intended to determine the effect of the ADS-B Transmitting and/or Receiving Subsystem on rack mounting hardware, compass needles, explosive gases, and other RF hardware. 

Table 2-113 indicates which of the groups of environmental procedures is related to each set of ADS-B Transmitting and/or Receiving Subsystem performance tests.  Each ADS-B 
Transmitting and/or Receiving Subsystem performance test **shall** be validated under all of the environmental procedures in the groups required for that test as indicated in Table 
2-113.

## 2.3.2 Detailed Environmental Test Procedures

The test procedures set forth below are considered satisfactory for use in determining equipment performance under environmental conditions.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred.  These alternative procedures may be used if the manufacturer can show that they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternative procedures.  The ADS-B 
Transmitting and Receiving Subsystem performance tests do not include specific pass/fail criteria.  It is intended that those criteria be obtained from the ADS-B Transmitting and Receiving performance requirements provided in subsection 2.2.

The following tests verify the performance of the equipment under test to detect Extended Squitters that are preceded by lower level Mode S FRUIT while being subjected to environmental conditions. 

## Equipment:

Refer to Â§2.4.4.4.2.1.2 for Mode S Fruit Signal Source test requirements. 

Refer to Â§2.4.4.4.2.1.3 for Extended Squitter Signal Source test requirements. 

## Measurement Procedure: Step 1:  Verification Of Operation Of Equipment Under Test

Connect the Extended Squitter signal source.  Set and verify that the power level at the receiver input is equal to the MTL limit required for the UUT equipment class plus 12 dB: 

 â67 dBm for A1S, A1 or A2 equipment class or, 
 â72 dBm for A3 equipment class. 
Note: The power levels given above are specified at the antenna connector and not at the receiver unit-under-test connector. 

Inject the signal 100 times and record the Extended Squitters that are declared to be output as error free.  Compare the decoded content of each Extended Squitter with the known content of the injected Extended Squitter.  Any differences that are detected are recorded as an undetected error and that squitter reception is deleted from the count of error free receptions. Calculate the measured probability of correct receptions and the number of undetected errors.  The test is passed if the probability of correct receptions is at least 95% and there is no more than one undetected error event. If this test is successful, proceed to Step 2.  Otherwise, the test setup and equipment under test should be checked and Step 1 is repeated. 

## Step 2:   Re-Triggering Test With Varying Position Mode S Fruit

Connect the Mode S Fruit signal source. Set and verify that the power level at the receiver input is equal to the MTL limit required for the UUT equipment class plus 12 dB:

Note: The power levels given above are specified at the antenna connector and not at the receiver unit-under-test connector. 

Set the Extended Squitter power to +4 dB relative to the Mode S FRUIT signal level.   
Activate the Mode S FRUIT source so that the 112-bit Mode S FRUIT signal is uniformly randomly distributed across the time interval beginning at â112 microseconds and ending at â6 microseconds relative to the signal.  The time indicated is the spacing between the P1 pulse of the signal and the P1 pulse of the FRUIT, where negative values indicate that the FRUIT is received earlier. 

Inject the Extended Squitter waveform T times and record the receptions that are declared to be error free.  Check for undetected errors and adjust as necessary the number of correctly received replies as specified in Step 1. Calculate the measured probability of correct reception and the number of undetected errors. Repeat the above step for relative powers of Signal to Interference (S/I) of +12 dB. Calculate the probability of correct reception and the number of undetected errors for each of the three power levels. Compare the results recorded above with the appropriate requirements in Table 2-130, Table 2-131 or Table 2-132.

## 2.4.3.2.1.1 Verification Of "Df" Downlink Format Field (Â§2.2.3.2.1.1)

Appropriate test procedures to verify the "DF" field (Â§2.2.3.2.1.1) are included in the verification of the "PI" field in Â§2.4.3.2.1.7. 

## 2.4.3.2.1.2 Verification Of "Ca" Capability Field (Used In Df=17) (Â§2.2.3.2.1.2, Â§2.2.5.1.3)

Purpose/Introduction: The "CA" field is a 3-bit field (baseline message bits 6 - 8) used to report the capability of an ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem that is based on a Mode S transponder.  The "CA" 
field is used to report the capability of the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem and is used in DF=11 and DF=17 transmissions.  DF=11 is transmitted in response to an ATCRBS/Mode-S All-Call, Mode-S Only All-Call, and transmitted as an Acquisition Squitter.  DF=17 is transmitted as an Extended Squitter.  The codes used in the "CA" 
field are specified in Table 2-8. 

The test procedure in Â§2.4.3.2.1.2.1 **shall** be conducted for all Transponder-Based ADS-
B transmitter systems.  The "CA" field is set according to the requirements in RTCA DO-
181E (EUROCAE ED-73E) and Â§2.2.3.2.1.2.  ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems **shall** 
determine the On-Ground/Airborne status as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.1.2 to report the "CA" 
field reported in transponder replies.   

## 2.4.3.2.1.2.1 Verification Of On The Ground Determination (Â§2.2.3.2.1.2, Â§2.2.5.1.2, Â§2.2.5.1.3) Purpose/Introduction:

This test verifies the correct encoding of the "CA" Capability field in ADS-B 
transmissions.  If an ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem supports both installations with and without automatic means of determining on the ground/airborne status, the following procedures will be conducted for both configurations. 

## Notes:

1. Various interface specifications require that Mode S transponder installations 
provide a means in which the transponder is rendered incapable of generating replies to ATCRBS, ATCRBS/Mode S All Call, and Mode S Only All Call interrogations, but continue to generate Mode S squitter transmissions and continue to reply to discretely addressed Mode S interrogations when the aircraft is on the ground.  If this condition is enabled automatically when the aircraft is on the ground, a flight crew switch is not necessary.  If performed manually, this condition will have no effect on the transmission of Extended Squitters or on the reporting of the "On-
Ground" status (RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.1.7.b.) (EUROCAE ED-73E, section 2.5).  
Manual determination of the "On-Ground" status may be achieved through a flight crew switch.  Automatic determination of the "On-Ground" status can be achieved 
through weight on wheels, strut switch, etc. 
2. Mode-S Transponders should also ensure that all previous TCS commands have been 
timed out or have been canceled prior to execution of the following procedures (refer 
to RTCA DO-181E, Â§2.2.18.2.6 for additional information).   

## Measurement Procedure: Step 1: "Ca" Field Verification - No Input Data

The following procedure will be utilized to verify that the "CA" field is properly transmitted in DF=17 messages.  For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems with automatic means of determining the On-Ground status, provide input external to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to indicate on the ground status. For Mode-S Transponder-Based transmitting systems, force the "DR" field equal to zero (0) indicating no downlink requests.  Setup the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem to broadcast Extended Squitters by providing data from the navigation source.  After the initiation of Extended Squitters, remove radio altitude, ground speed and airspeed. 

For ADS-B systems that have automatic means of determining the On-Ground status, verify that the "CA" Capability field contains a value of FOUR (binary 100) for each Extended Squitter type.   
For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems that do not have automatic means of determining the On-Ground status, verify that the "CA" field equals Six (binary 110) for each Extended Squitter type. 

## Step 2: "Ca" Field Verification - With Input Data

Repeat the above procedure for ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems that have automatic means of determining the On-Ground status.  Setup the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem as in step 1 except provide external input to set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Verify that the "CA" Capability field reports a value of FIVE (binary 101) for all Extended Squitter types. 

## Step 3: "Ca" Field Verification - Input Data Variation

For Transponder-Based ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems that have automatic detection of the On-the-Ground status and have ground speed, airspeed or radio altitude available, the following procedure applies.  For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems for installations without automatic means of determining the Onthe-Ground status, the following procedure will verify that the "CA" field remains set to 6 throughout the procedure.   
Set up the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as in Step 1 with the On-the-Ground status externally provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem and additionally provide radio altitude input.  Use a value greater than 50 feet. Vary the "Emitter Category" data input through the range of Emitter Category Sets that the system is capable of supporting.  Verify that the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem correctly broadcasts each Extended Squitter message type with the "CA" field equal to 5 for all Emitter Category Set "A" codes 2 
through 6 as specified in Table 2-19.   
Repeat the procedure given in the previous paragraph, except change the radio altitude data to a value less than 50 feet.  Verify for each Extended Squitter type that the reported "CA" field equals 4.   
Maintain the radio altitude data at a value less than 50 feet and if the system is capable of accepting ground speed data input, provide ground speed data greater than 100 knots to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Verify for each Extended Squitter type that the reported "CA" field equals 5 for Emitter Category Set "A," codes 2 through 6. Maintain the radio altitude data at a value less than 50 feet and set the ground speed to a value less than, or equal to 100 knots.  Verify for each Extended Squitter type that the reported "CA" field equals 4.   
Maintain the radio altitude data at a value less than 50 feet and the ground speed at 100 knots or less.  If the system is capable of accepting airspeed data input, provide airspeed data greater than 100 knots to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Verify for each Extended Squitter type that the reported "CA" field equals 5 for Emitter category Set "A," codes 2 through 6. Maintain the radio altitude data at a value less than 50 feet and the ground speed at a value less than or equal to 100 knots.  Set the airspeed to a value less than or equal to 100 knots.  Verify for each Extended Squitter type that the reported "CA" field equals 4.   

## Step 4: "Ca" Field Verification - Input Data Variation

The following procedure verifies that ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems without automatic detection of "On-The-Ground" status and capable of inputting radio altitude, ground speed, or airspeed, correctly reports "CA" Field equal to SIX (6), even when Surface Position Message broadcast is determined according to the requirements of Â§2.2.3.2.1.2(c).  Set up the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as in Step 1 above.  For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems with automatic means of determining "On-The-Ground" status, and capable of inputting radio altitude, ground speed or airspeed, provide external input to set the system to "Airborne" status and verify that the "CA" Field remains equal to FIVE (5) throughout this procedure.   
For ADS-B Transmitting Systems capable of accepting radio altitude input, ground speed or airspeed, provide radio altitude data, ground speed and airspeed data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem according to the values defined in Table 2-134 or in the case of no data, stop providing the data as indicated.  Verify that the system broadcasts Extended Squitters with the "CA" 
Field equal to SIX (6) for each test condition in Table 2-134.   

## 2.4.3.2.1.2.2 Verification Of Air/Ground Format Selection (Â§2.2.3.2.1.2, Â§2.2.5.1.3) Purpose/Introduction:

The following test will verify that the ADS-B Transmission Device properly selects the Airborne or Surface Message formats for broadcast.  The determination is based upon the Air/Ground Status data input for aircraft with automatic means of determining the On-
Ground status.  Otherwise, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem broadcasts Airborne Messages unless the requirements of Â§2.2.3.2.1.2.c are met to emit Surface Position Messages.  

## Measurement Procedure: Step 1: Ground Status Verification - No Input Data

For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems with automatic means of determining the On-Ground status, provide input external to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to indicate the On-Ground status.  Setup the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to broadcast Extended Squitters by providing data from the navigation source.  Provide no radio altitude data, ground speed or airspeed data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  For ADS-B systems that have automatic means of determining the On-Ground status, verify that the Surface Position Message is broadcast at the proper rate for each Extended Squitter type.  For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems that do not have automatic means of determining the On-Ground status, verify that the system broadcasts Airborne Position and Velocity Messages at the proper rate. 

## Step 2: Airborne Status Verification - No Input Data

For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems with automatic means of determining the On-Ground status, provide input external to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to indicate airborne status.  Setup the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to broadcast Extended Squitters by providing data from the navigation source.  Provide no radio altitude, ground speed or airspeed data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Verify that Airborne Position and Velocity Messages are broadcast at the proper rate.  

## Step 3: Air/Ground Status Determination - Input Data Variation

For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems with automatic means of determining the On-Ground status, provide input external to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to indicate airborne status.  Setup the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to broadcast Extended Squitters by providing data from the navigation source.  Provide Radio Altitude data, ground speed and airspeed data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem according to the values specified in Table 2-134 or in the case of no data, stop providing the data as indicated.  For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems with automatic means of determining the On-
Ground status, verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem broadcasts Airborne Position and Velocity Messages for each run.  For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems without automatic means of determining the On- Ground status, verify that Airborne Position and Velocity Messages or Surface Position Messages as indicated in Table 2-134 are broadcast at the proper rate for each run.

## 2.4.3.2.1.3 Verification Of The "Cf" Field (Used In Df=18) (Â§2.2.3.2.1.3)

Appropriate test procedures to verify the "CF" field, used in Messages with DF=18, (Â§2.2.3.2.1.3) are included in the verification of the "PI" field in Â§2.4.3.2.1.7.   

## 2.4.3.2.1.4 Verification Of The "Af" Field (Used In Df=19) (Â§2.2.3.2.1.4)

Appropriate test procedures to verify the "AF" field (Â§2.2.3.2.1.4) are included in the verification of the "PI" field in Â§2.4.3.2.1.7. 

## 2.4.3.2.1.5 Verification Of "Aa" Address Field, Announced (Â§2.2.3.2.1.1, Â§2.2.5.1.1) Purpose/Introduction:

The following test will be performed for Non-Transponder-Based Subsystems.  The Address Field verification of Transponder-Based Implementations is included in the verification of the "PI" field in Â§2.4.3.2.1.7.  ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems for aircraft installations that are Non-Transponder-Based Implementations output the ICAO 24-Bit Address or the Anonymous Address as determined by the Address Qualifier input. 

The procedure requires configuring the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to generate ADS-B Messages to enable capture and bit decoding of the ADS-B Message.  The Address Qualifier, ICAO 24-Bit Address, and the Anonymous Address inputs will be controlled as required by the following steps. 

Step 1: 
Valid Message Contents When Selecting ICAO 24-Bit Address Verification 
Input AAAAAA {HEX} for the ICAO 24-Bit Address.  Select "ICAO 24-Bit Address" at the Address Qualifier input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  
Verify the following message content upon decode of the transmitted data: DF field (Message Bits 1 thru 5) equals 18. CF field (Message Bits 6 thru 8) equals ZERO. AA field (Message Bits 9 thru 32) equals AAAAAA {HEX}. 

Step 2: 
Valid Message Contents When Selecting Anonymous Address Verification 
Input 555555 {HEX} for the Anonymous Address.  Select "Anonymous Address" at the Address Qualifier input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. Verify the following message content upon decode of the transmitted data: DF field (Message Bits 1 thru 5) equals 18. CF field (Message Bits 6 thru 8) equals 1. 

AA field (Message Bits 9 thru 32) equals 555555 {HEX}. 

 

## 2.4.3.2.1.6 Verification Of "Me" Message, Extended Squitter (Â§2.2.3.2.1.6) No Specific Test Procedure Is Required To Validate Â§2.2.3.2.1.6.

2.4.3.2.1.7 
Verification of "PI" Parity / Identity (Â§2.2.3.2.1.7, Â§2.2.5.1.1) 
Purpose/Introduction: 
The following test will verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly outputs the Address (AA) field of ADS-B Messages, calculates the proper parity of ADS-B 
Messages and correctly outputs the PI field in the transmitted ADS-B Messages. 

Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to emit ADS-B Messages having TYPE 
Code equal to ZERO (0) and no Altitude data.  Effectively, establish the messages with the "ME" field set to ALL ZEROs as indicated in Table 2-136.  Refer to Table 2-136 and select the appropriate Set of stimulus to run for the type of equipment being tested as follows:   

a. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 17 and "CA" = 0, use Set 1. b. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 17 and "CA" = 4, use Set 2. c. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 17 and "CA" = 5, use Set 3. 
d. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 17 and "CA" = 6, use Set 4. 
e. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 17 and "CA" = 7, use Set 5. 
f. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 18 with "CF" = 0, use Set 6.  Note that this is 
the case where the equipment is non-Transponder device. 
g. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 19 with "AF" = 0, use Set 7.  Note that this 
case is where the equipment is for Military Applications. 
h. Where an equipment is capable of transmitting several of the cases described in 
paragraphs "b." through "f." above, it should suffice that the equipment be testing to 
only one of the cases since the parity encoding should work the same for all. 
For the Set of stimulus given in Table 2-136 that is selected for the equipment under test, establish each of the eight cases by establishing the message having "DF," "CA" or "CF," 
"AA," and "ME" fields as indicated in Table 2-136. 

Note: Since the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem may not accept changes in the ICAO 
24-Bit "AA" field after initial power on, it may be necessary to re-cycle power to the unit under test each time that the ICAO 24-Bit "AA" field is changed in this procedure. 
For each case of stimulus provided, verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem properly generates the associated "PI" code as given in column 6 of Table 2-136. 

For Transponder-Based Systems, verify that the "AA" field (i.e., the ICAO 24-Bit Address) cannot be changed once the unit under test has been powered to the operational state. For Non-Transponder-Based Systems, where a means to change the ICAO 24-bit Address is provided and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authority, verify that the "AA" field (i.e., the ICAO 24-Bit Address) cannot be changed once the unit under test has been powered to the operational state unless the system is in Standby mode as per Â§4.4.6.

## 2.4.3.2.3 Verification Of Ads-B Airborne Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.3)

No specific test procedure is required to validate Â§2.2.3.2.3. 

## 2.4.3.2.3.1 Verification Of "Type" Subfield In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.3.1) Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure verifies that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly outputs Airborne Position Messages with the correct TYPE subfield data content in Message bits 
33 - 37 in DF=17 Messages for Transponder-Based Systems and DF=18 Messages for Non-Transponder-Based Systems.  The "ME" field of the ADS-B Airborne Position Message contains the TYPE Code subfield in bits 1 - 5, which along with the Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) Supplement-A and NIC Supplement-B, indicates the navigational integrity of the position information.  The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem determines and outputs the TYPE Code subfield based upon the input it receives from the possible Navigational sources that may interface to the system.  The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem may receive the TYPE Code subfield directly through an external interface instead of dynamically determining the TYPE Code subfield.  Whatever the implementation, the test cases must exercise all of the resulting TYPE Code possibilities.  
If an ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem can only generate a subset of the possible ADS-B 
Airborne Position Message TYPE Codes, then only those test cases required to produce the possible TYPE Codes will be tested.  The test configuration is based on the type(s) of Navigational System(s) that may interface to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem and the data it provides.   

Step 1: 
Verification of TYPE Codes 9 through 18, and 20 through 22 with GNSS/Baro 
Altitude 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Position Messages by providing position information at the nominal update rate. Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set the ADS-
B Transmitting Subsystem to "Airborne" status.  Provide valid non-zero barometric pressure altitude data to the ADS-B System.  For each Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) supported, verify that the TYPE Code subfield in the ADS-B Airborne Position Message correctly matches the TYPE Code subfield value from the Radius of Containment (RC) depicted in Table 2-14.  
Additionally, verify that the NIC Supplement-B contained in the Airborne Position Message reflects the proper NIC value contained in Table 2-14 (see 
Â§2.4.3.2.7.2.6).  The NIC may be derived by the Horizontal Radius of Containment depicted in Table 2-14, or the Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL), or another means which establishes an appropriate Radius of Containment.  To test all of the possible resulting TYPE Codes that could be produced from the Navigational source, degradation of the position data from the Navigation source may require an alarm or alert condition that must be sensed by the ADS-
B Transmitting Subsystem.  The TYPE Code subfield will contain values in the range from 9 through 18.  In the cases where RC meets the criteria for NIC 
values of 0 through 11, verify that the proper TYPE Code, NIC Supplement-A 
and NIC Supplement-B values are assigned according to the criteria for each of these NIC values.   
Verify that TYPE codes 9 and 10 cannot be set if the unit under test is not provided with either a GNSS Time Mark (see Â§2.2.5.1.6) or UTC data unless the Non-Coupled Case of position estimation (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.3 for Latitude, and Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.3 for Longitude) is implemented. 

Note: UTC data is not acceptable to be used in place of GNSS Time Mark 
       (see Â§2.2.5.1.6) because of the fact that UTC data may not be available 
       for any possible time up to 200 milliseconds after the leading edge of 
       the GNSS Time Mark.  Therefore, UTC data may not be used to 
       establish TYPE Codes 9 and 10. 

Stop providing input of barometric altitude to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem and continue providing GNSS Altitude data.  If the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem supports broadcasting TYPE Codes 20 and 21, then 
verify that the TYPE Code subfield in the ADS-B Airborne Position Message 
correctly matches the TYPE Code subfield value from the Radius of 
Containment values depicted in Table 2-14 for TYPE codes 20 and 21.  If 
GNSS Altitude data is provided, but it is not possible to determine the RC

                                                                                   , then 
verify that the TYPE Code subfield is set to 22.   

Verify that TYPE Codes 20 and 21 cannot be set if the unit under test is not 
provided with either a GNSS Time Mark (see Â§

                                                2.2.5.1.6) or UTC data, unless 
the Non-Coupled Case of position estimation (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.3 for Latitude, 
and Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.3 for Longitude) is implemented.   

Note: UTC data is not acceptable to be used in place of GNSS Time Mark 
       (see Â§2.2.5.1.6) because of the fact that UTC data may not be available 
       for any possible time up to 200 milliseconds after the leading edge of 
       the GNSS Time Mark.  Therefore, UTC data may not be used to 
       establish TYPE Codes 20 and 21.   

Stop providing inputs of barometric altitude and GNSS altitude to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem, and provide position data for each of the RC values 
that correspond to the horizontal containment limits for NIC values 0 to 11 
(TYPE Codes 9 through 18).  Verify that the TYPE Code and the NIC 
Supplement-A and NIC Supplement-B subfields contain values that correspond 
to the RC value depicted in Table 2-14, with the Altitude Subfield set to ALL 
ZEROs.   

## Step 2: Verification Of Type Codes 20 Through 22 With Gnss Altitude

This step will be performed for all ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems capable of broadcasting GNSS Altitude data.  Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Position Messages.  Provide both barometric altitude and GNSS altitude data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. Disconnect the barometric altitude source to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem so that only GNSS altitude data is available.  For each NIC value supported, verify that the TYPE Code subfield in the ADS-B Airborne Position Message correctly matches the TYPE Code subfield value from the RC range of values depicted in Table 2-14 for TYPE codes 20 through 22.  The TYPE Code may be derived by the RC depicted in Table 2-14, or the HIL, or another means which establishes an appropriate integrity containment.  To test all of the possible resulting TYPE Codes that could be produced from the Navigational source, degradation of the position data from the Navigation source may require an alarm or alert condition that must be sensed by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Verify that the least capable RC
 value of each test case is used to determine the TYPE Code. 

Step 3: 
Verification of TYPE Code if the Radius of Containment is Unavailable 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to "Airborne" status as in Step 1, and provide navigation data from a source that normally provides a valid Raduis of Containment from HPL, HIL, or HPL that can be derived from a RAIM protection threshold.  Configure the navigation source such that valid RC 
data is no longer being provided.  Input both valid barometric altitude and GNSS altitude data.  Verify that in the absence of a valid RC
 value, the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem transmits ADS-B Airborne Position Messages with a TYPE Code subfield set to 18.   
Stop providing input of valid barometric altitude data to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem and continue to provide GNSS altitude data.  Verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem transmits ADS-B Airborne Position Messages with the TYPE Code subfield set to 22.   
Stop providing input of valid GNSS altitude data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem transmits ADS-B 
Airborne Position Messages with the TYPE Code subfield set to ZERO.

Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid altitude code data and a permanent alert (emergency condition) to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Connect the GNSS data input and verify that Airborne Position, Velocity and Aircraft Identification Messages are transmitted at the proper rate.   
Stop update of the Navigational source of Airborne Latitude and Longitude position information.  If the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is capable of receiving airborne position data from more than one Navigation source, verify the following by disconnecting each Navigation source separately.  Verify that after 2 seconds, the TYPE code of ZERO is transmitted twice per second.  Verify that the remaining "ME" Bits of the message are ZERO, except for the Altitude subfield, and the Surveillance Status subfield.  After 60 seconds, verify that the Airborne Position Message continues to be transmitted. Stop providing valid altitude.  After 60 seconds, verify that the Airborne Position Message is no longer transmitted. Connect the GNSS data input and verify that Airborne Position Messages are broadcast at a nominal rate of 2 per second.   
Repeat above if the Latitude and Longitude sources can be received separately.  Stop update of Latitude data while maintaining update of Longitude data and verify that TYPE code of ZERO is transmitted twice per second after 2 seconds from data input disconnection. Repeat above except stop update of Longitude data while maintaining update of Latitude data and verify that TYPE code of ZERO is transmitted twice per second after 2 seconds from data input disconnection.

## 2.4.3.2.3.2 Verification Of "Surveillance Status" Subfield In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.3.2, Â§2.2.5.1.4) Purpose/Introduction:

The "Surveillance Status" Subfield (SSS) is contained in ADS-B Airborne Position Messages TYPE Codes 0, 9 through 18, and 20 through 22.  The subfield is a 2-bit subfield used to indicate Alert Conditions and SPI Condition utilized in ATCRBS for ATC operations.  The alert conditions, as defined, are generated external to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem.  When an alert condition is generated and appears at the input to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, the SSS will indicate the proper code in the Airborne Position Message, using "ME" bits 6 and 7.  SSS will be verified for all possible Airborne Position Messages.  If the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is a Stand Alone Transmitter, and does not have the ability to set SSS, simply verify that SSS is ZERO in all generated Airborne Position Messages. 

Step 1: 
Verification of "SSS" = "0" 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Position Messages.  Disconnect the source for Permanent Alert Condition, Temporary Alert Condition and SPI Condition to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. Verify that SSS is ZERO in Airborne Position Messages. 

Step 2: 
Verification of "SSS" = Non "0" 
Connect the source(s) for Permanent Alert Condition, Temporary Alert Condition and SPI Condition to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Input the following conditions: 

a. Set the Permanent Alert Condition and verify that "SSS" equals ONE (1) in 
Airborne Position Messages. 
b. Set the Temporary Alert Condition and verify that "SSS" equals TWO (2) 
in Airborne Position Messages. 
c. Ensure Temporary Alert Condition is cleared.  Set the SPI Condition and 
verify that "SSS" equals THREE (3) in Airborne Position Messages. 
d. Set the Permanent Alert Condition and the SPI Condition and verify that 
"SSS" equals ONE (1) in Airborne Position Messages. 
e. Set the Temporary Alert Condition and the SPI Condition and verify that 
"SSS" equals "2" in Airborne Position Messages. 

## 2.4.3.2.3.3 Verification Of "Nic Supplement-B" Subfield In Ads-B Airborne Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.3.3)

Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
Verification of NIC Supplement-B Transmission 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Position Messages by providing valid trajectory information at the nominal update rate. Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.   
Verify that for each input NIC parameter that is specified by the RC value in Table 2-69, that the system generates ADS-B Airborne Position Messages with the NIC Supplement-B subfield ("ME" bit 8) set equal to the corresponding binary coding value shown in Table 2-69.  Do this for all TYPE Codes in Table 
2-69 for Airborne Position Messages. 

Step 2: 
Verification of NIC Supplement-B â Data Lifetime 
Rerun the Test Procedure in Step 1.  Remove the data source input for NIC Supplement-B for a period of at least 2 seconds.  Verify that "ME" bit 8 in the Airborne Position Message is set to a value of ZERO (0).

(Â§2.2.3.2.3.4.1, Â§2.2.5.1.5) 
Purpose/Introduction: This test procedure verifies that the Barometric Altitude is reported correctly in ADS-B 
Messages and that the altitude field reported matches the altitude data at the input interface to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  The Barometric Altitude is reported in the "Altitude" subfield of ADS-B Message TYPE Code 0 and Airborne Position TYPE 
Codes 9 through 18.  

Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Position Messages. If the ADS-B transmitter is based on a Mode S transponder, set the ATS input to the transponder to ZERO.    

## Step 1: No Barometric Altitude Data

Disconnect the altitude source from the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  
Verify that all altitude bits (Message bits 41 - 52, and "ME" bits 9 - 20) in Airborne Position Messages are set to ZERO.   

Step 2: 
Barometric Altitude Data Available 
Connect the Barometric Altitude source to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  
Provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with the Barometric Altitude Input_A values provided for each case in Table 2-137.  Verify that in each case, the "Q" bit ("ME" bit 16) is set to ZERO (0). 

For each case, verify that the altitude code is properly encoded into the Airborne Position Message Altitude Subfield. Provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with the Barometric Altitude Input_B values provided for each case in Table 2-137.  Verify that in each case, the "Q" bit ("ME" bit 16) is set to ONE (1).

2.4.3.2.3.4.2 
Verification of "GNSS Height Above the Ellipsoid (HAE)" in ADS-B Airborne Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.3.4.2) 

## Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure verifies that GNSS Height (HAE) is reported correctly in ADS-B 
Messages and that the altitude field reported is consistent with the GNSS Height (HAE) data at the input interface to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  The GNSS Height (HAE) is reported in the "Altitude" subfield of Airborne Position Messages having TYPE Codes 20 through 22. 

Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Position Messages having any TYPE Code between 20 and 22.  If the ADS-B transmitter is based on a Mode S transponder, set the ATS input to ONE (1). 

Step 1: 
No GNSS Height (HAE) Data 
Disconnect the GNSS Height (HAE) source from the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Verify that all altitude bits (Message bits 41 - 52, and "ME" bits 9 - 20) in Airborne Position Messages are set to ZERO. 

Step 2: 
GNSS Height (HAE) Data Available 
Connect the GNSS Height (HAE) source to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with the GNSS 
Height (HAE) input values provided for each case in Table 2-138.  For each case, verify that the altitude code is properly encoded into the Airborne Position Message Altitude Subfield.

Appropriate test procedures to verify Â§2.2.3.2.3.4.3 were previously provided in Â§2.4.3.2.3.4.1 and Â§2.2.3.2.3.4.2.   

2.4.3.2.3.5 
Verification of "TIME" (T) Subfield in ADS-B Airborne Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.3.5, Â§2.2.5.1.6, Â§2.2.5.1.6.1, Â§2.2.5.1.6.2) 
Measurement Procedure: 
If the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is capable of synchronizing to a 0.2 second UTC epoch, configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Position Messages by providing position information at the nominal rate.  Ensure that the time of applicability of the position data is synchronized to an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch. Verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem accepts a GNSS TIME MARK, or equivalent input from the navigation data source, which is required in order to be able to update the position data from the navigation data source to an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch.  Verify that the "TIME" (T) subfield is set to ONE (1). If the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is not capable of receiving a GNSS Time Mark, or if the input is not available, verify that the "TIME" (T) subfield is set to ZERO (0). 

Note: The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem must be capable of monitoring the GNSS 
Time Mark unless the non-coupled case (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.3 and Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.3) is implemented. 

2.4.3.2.3.6

Â§2.2.5.1.8, 
Â§2.2.5.1.12, Â§2.2.5.1.13, Appendix A.1.7) 

## Purpose/Introduction:

The "Encoded Latitude" subfield is a 17-bit field ("ME" bits 23 - 39, Message bits 55 - 
71) containing the encoded latitude of the airborne position.  The "Encoded Longitude" subfield is a 17-bit field ("ME" bits 40 - 56, Message bits 72 - 88) containing the encoded longitude of the airborne position.  The following test procedure verifies that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly receives Latitude and Longitude position data from the Navigation source and outputs encoded Latitude and Longitude data in the Airborne Position Message.  The Latitude and Longitude data is encoded according to the Compact Position Reporting (CPR) Format described in Appendix A.  The Latitude and Longitude data is dependent upon the positional accuracy supported by the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem. 

The following procedure verifies the *static* Latitude and Longitude encoding where the velocity input is 0.0 knots and is intended to verify the actual CPR Latitude and Longitude encoding precision. 

Note: The following procedures are specifically intended to indicate any gross errors in implementation of the CPR encoding algorithm provided in Appendix A. 

Step 1: 
Establish Initial Conditions 
a. Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to create an Airborne 
Position Message, i.e., TYPE Codes 9 through 18, or 20 through 22. 
b. Ensure that the Velocity input provided to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem is set to **ZERO**. 
Step 2: 
Verify Encoded Latitude Data 
a. Via the appropriate Navigation Data Source interface, provide the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem with the exact latitude and longitude data pair provided in the Angular Weighted Binary Values Latitude and Longitude 
Columns for each line item given in Table 2-139. 
Provide the latitude and longitude data via the interface at the nominal rate of the navigation data source.   
Allow the system to stabilize for at least 2 seconds after the data change prior to continuing with the following steps.

ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem: 
(1). Verify that the "CPR Format" (F) subfield is set to ZERO (0), and 
(2). Verify that the Encoded Even Interval Latitude subfield is encoded 
exactly as shown in the Even Airborne Encoding Latitude column of 
Table 2-139.   
If the encoding is not exact, verify that the encoding does not differ from the table value by more than "1" Least Significant Bit (LSB). If the encoded value differs from the table value by more than "1" LSB, then the test will be considered to have Failed.  Otherwise, the test will be considered to have passed. 

(3). Verify that the Encoded Even Interval Longitude subfield is encoded 
exactly as shown in the Even Airborne Encoding Longitude column 
of Table 2-139. 
If the encoding is not exact, verify that the encoding does not differ from the table value by more than "1" Least Significant Bit (LSB). 

If the encoded value differs from the table value by more than "1" LSB, then the test will be considered to have Failed.  Otherwise, the test will be considered to have passed.

## 2.4.3.2.3.7.2 Verification Of Gps/Gnss Time Mark Coupled Case ("Time" (T)="1") (Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.2, Â§2.2.5.1.6.2, Â§2.2.5.1.53, Â§2.2.5.1.54) Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure will be used to verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly extrapolates and encodes Airborne Position data when working with GNSS synchronized time.   

## Equipment Required:

Equipment capable of performing the following: 

a. Load all valid data required for the ADS-B Airborne Position Message into the ADS-
B Transmitting Subsystem via the operational interfaces. 
 
The equipment should be capable of updating Latitude position and North/South Velocity given time, initial Latitude position, initial North/South Velocity, and North/South acceleration.  The Latitude Position provided to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem will be referred to as the Computed Latitude.  Likewise, the 
North/South Velocity provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will be 
referred to as the Computed N/S Velocity. 
 
The equipment should be capable of updating Longitude position and East/West Velocity given time, initial Longitude position, initial East/West Velocity, and East/West acceleration.  The Longitude Position provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will be referred to as the Computed Longitude.  Likewise, the East/West 
Velocity provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will be referred to as the Computed E/W Velocity. 

b. Provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with an appropriate GNSS Time Mark 
and UTC Time information as described in Â§2.2.5.1.6 in order to establish the Time 
Mark Reference (TMR) as described in Â§2.2.5.1.6.2.  When providing UTC Time 
information (see Â§2.2.5.1.6.2.a, Note 1), the UTC Time provided should be offset 
approximately 0.2 seconds before the end of the UTC Epoch or 0.2 seconds after the beginning of the UTC Epoch.  (See Appendix S for rationale.)    
 
The equipment **shall** also be capable of time-tagging the Time Mark Reference 
(TMR) or GNSS Time Mark leading edge event to a minimum accuracy of 1.0 millisecond.   
c. When providing the GNSS Time Mark described in subparagraph "b," above, the 
equipment **shall** have re-computed position and velocity information required by 
subparagraph "a," above, available at one second intervals that are synchronized with the leading edge of the GNSS Time Mark, or Time Mark Reference as per Â§2.2.5.1.6.2.  Initial delivery of the all new computed position and velocity data to 
the ADS-B Transmission system **shall** be completed no later than 200 milliseconds 
after the leading edge of the GNSS Time Mark.   
d. The monitoring of position and velocity information at any given 0.2 s UTC epoch, 
with respect to the GNSS Time Mark or Time Mark Reference (TMR) described in 
subparagraph b, above.  The equipment **shall** be capable of updating the Calculated 
Longitude to a 0.2s UTC epoch with a minimum accuracy of 1.0 millisecond.  
Likewise, the equipment **shall** be capable of updating the Calculated Latitude to a 
0.2s UTC epoch with an minimum accuracy of 1.0 millisecond.   
e. The monitoring of transmitted ADS-B Airborne Position Messages and the Airborne 
Velocity Messages and the extraction of all subfields as may be required.  The 
equipment **shall** also be capable of time-tagging the receipt of any ADS-B Broadcast 
message, with respect to the GNSS Time Mark or Time Mark Reference (TMR) described in subparagraph b above, to a minimum accuracy of 1.0 milliseconds.   
f. 
Performing local unambiguous CPR decoding of the encoded latitude and longitude subfields in accordance with Appendix A, Â§A.1.7.4, Â§A.1.7.5 and Â§A.1.7.9.   
g. Determining the appropriate 0.2s UTC epoch as being the time of applicability of the 
Decoded Latitude Position based on the time of reception and the setting of the F-bit 
in accordance with Â§2.2.3.2.3.6.  This 0.2s UTC epoch **shall** be referred to as the

Measurement Procedure: 

## Step 1: Equipment Initialization (North-South)

Initialize the equipment to provide the following to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. 

## Do Not Start Delivery Of The Data At This Time

a. 
Initialize Time Reference at: 
t
 
0 
 

|       | Set initial Computed Longitude to:    |   45.0  | degrees    |
|-------|---------------------------------------|---------|------------|
| WEST  |                                       |         |            |
|       |                                       |         |            |
|       | Set initial Computed Latitude to:     |  0.0625 | degrees    |
| NORTH |                                       |         |            |
|       |                                       |         |            |

 
Set initial Computed N/S Velocity to: 
1020 
knots 
SOUTH 
Note:  The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of North/South velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the North/South Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

b. GNSS Time Mark as described above under Equipment subparagraphs b 
and c. 
c. All other data required to generate the Airborne Position Message and the 
Airborne Velocity Message. 

## Step 2: Equipment Data Delivery Start Up

Allow the equipment to start delivery of the data specified in Step 1 and designate this time as t0
.  Continue to let the equipment provide the data for at least 35 seconds. 

## Step 3: Latitude Position Performance Notes:

1. Since there has been no position or velocity data provided to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem up to this time (at least for the purposes of this test procedure), a minimal amount of time will need to be allowed for the 
transmitted message data to stabilize.  This fact has been factored in to the following required response criteria. 
2. Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the Equator 
at 1020 knots from North to South. 
a. At 4.0 Â±0.005 seconds after executing Step 2 where data has started being 
provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem under test: 
Verify that the Decoded Latitude Position differs from the Computed Latitude Position by no more than **22.1** meters (i.e., approximately 0.0002 
degrees of Latitude). 

b. At all successive points during the time of test that occur at least 6 seconds 
after the execution of Step 2: 
 
Verify that the Decoded Latitude Position differs from the Computed Latitude Position at the Transmitted Time of Applicability by no more than 
6.375 meters (i.e., approximately  0.000058 degrees of Latitude).   
c. Verify that the received message was encoded in the proper format, i.e., 
odd or even encoding, by correlating the received message to the stimulus 
data provided by the test equipment.   

Note: This test is intended to demonstrate that the UUT is encoding data 
       correctly in regards to the 0.2 UTC Epochs and in regards to the 
       alternating odd and even encodings.  Since the test set knows what 
       the data is at given 1.0 second intervals, and it also time tags the 
       received data, it is reasonable to expect that this capacity is 
       adequate to establish the proper 0.2 UTC Epochs and the 
       appropriate format encoding.   

## Step 4: Equipment Re-Initialization (South-North)

Note 1: 
Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the 
Equator at 1020 knots from South to North. 
Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings: 

Initialize Time Reference at: 
t
 
0 
 
Set initial Computed Longitude to: 
45.0 
degrees 
EAST 
Set initial Computed Latitude to: 
0.0625 
degrees 
SOUTH 
Set initial Computed N/S Velocity to: 
1020 
knots 
NORTH 

Note 2: 
The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of North/South velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the North/South Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

## Step 5: Performance Check (South-North)

Repeat Steps 2 through 3. 

## Step 6: Equipment Re-Initialization (North Pole)

Note 1: 
         Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the 
         North Pole at 1020 knots from South to North.  It is up to the 
         equipment designers to insure that equipment under test and the test 
         equipment properly move across the pole by moving up to 90.0 
         degrees North and then down from the pole for the duration of the 
         test. 

Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings: 

Initialize Time Reference at: 
t
 
0 
 
Set initial Computed Longitude to:  
45.0 
degrees 
EAST 
Set initial Computed Latitude to: 
89.9375 
degrees 
NORTH 
Set initial Computed N/S Velocity to: 
1020 
knots 
NORTH 

Note 2: 
         The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of 
         North/South velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction 
         sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is 
         up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly 
         resolved into the North/South Velocity required in the 
         transmitted messages. 

## Step 7: Performance Check (North Pole)

Repeat Steps 2 through 3. 

## Step 8: Equipment Re-Initialization (South Pole)

Note 1: 
Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the 
South Pole at 1020 knots from North to South.  It is up to the equipment designers to insure that equipment under test and the test 
equipment properly move across the pole by moving up to 90.0 
degrees South and then down from the pole for the duration of the test. 
Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings: 

Initialize Time Reference at: 
t
 
0 
 
Set initial Computed Longitude to:  
45.0 
degrees 
WEST 
Set initial Computed Latitude to: 
89.9375 
degrees 
SOUTH 
Set initial Computed N/S Velocity to: 
1020 
knots 
SOUTH 

Note 2: 
The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of North/South velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the North/South Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 
Step 9: 
Performance Check (South Pole) 
Repeat Steps 2 through 3. 

Step 10: Maximum Velocity Performance Checks 

Note: This procedure step must be performed only for those ADS-B 
      Transmitting Subsystems that are expected to be installed in vehicles 
      capable of attaining North/South or East/West velocities in excess of 
      1022 knots. 

Repeat Steps 1 through 9 with the exception that for each case where the 
velocity magnitude is specified, set the magnitude to 4084 knots and the time of 
test duration should be retained at 35 seconds. 

Step 11: Repeat for additional Navigation Data Sources 
Repeat Steps 1 through 10 for each Navigation Data Source input interface that the equipment is designed to accommodate.

Step 2: 
Termination of Latitude Data Input - Part 2 
Return to providing normal Airborne Position data at the nominal rate.  Next, filter the data so that the device does not receive any latitude data.  After 1 second, stop providing data.  Verify that after 1 second more, the latitude registers are set to ALL ZEROs.

         are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the 
         implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved 
         into the East/West Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

Step 9: 
Performance Check (IDL-W-E) 
Repeat Steps 2 through 3. 

Step 10: Maximum Velocity Performance Checks 

Note: This procedure step must be performed only for those ADS-B 
       Transmitting Subsystems that are expected to be installed in vehicles 
       capable of attaining North/South or East/West velocities in excess of 
       1022 knots. 

Repeat Steps 1 through 9 with the exception that for each case where the 
velocity magnitude is specified, set the magnitude to 4084 knots and the time of 
test duration should be retained at 35 seconds.

## 2.4.3.2.3.8.3 Verification Of Non-Gps/Gnss Time Mark Coupled Case ("Time" (T)="0") (Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.3)

Purpose/Introduction: This test procedure will be used to verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly extrapolates and encodes Airborne Position data when NOT working with GNSS synchronized time. Equipment Required: Equipment requirements remain the same as provided in Â§2.4.3.2.3.7.3.   
Measurement Procedure: 

## Step 1: Equipment Initialization (Gm-E-W)

Initialize the equipment to provide the following to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.   

## Do Not Start Delivery Of The Data At This Time

a. 
Initialize Time Reference at: 
t
 
0 
 
 
Set initial Computed Longitude to: 
0.0625 
degrees **EAST** 
 
Set initial Computed Latitude to: 
45.0 
degrees **NORTH** 
 
Set initial Computed E/W Velocity to: 
1020 
knots 
WEST 
Note: The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of East/West velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the East/West Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

b. Common time reference as described above under Equipment subparagraph 
"b."   
c. All other data required to generate the Airborne Position Message and the 
Airborne Velocity Message.   

## Step 2: Equipment Data Delivery Start Up

Allow the equipment to start delivery of the data specified in Step 1 and designate this time as t0
.  Continue to let the equipment provide the data for at least 35 seconds. 

## Step 3: Longitude Position Performance Notes:

1. Since there has been no position or velocity data provided to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem up to this time (at least for the purposes of this test procedure), a minimal amount of time will need to be allowed for the transmitted message data to stabilize.  This fact has been factored in to the following required response criteria. 
2. Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the 
Greenwich Meridian at 1020 knots from East to West. It is up to the equipment designers to insure that equipment under test and the test equipment properly move across the Greenwich Meridian by moving across 0 degrees.. 
a. At 4.0 Â±0.005 seconds after executing Step 2 where data has started being 
provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem under test: Verify that the Decoded Longitude Position differs from the Computed 
Longitude Position at the time of transmission by no more than **74.5** meters 
(i.e., approximately 0.00067 degrees of Longitude). 
b. At all successive points during the time of test that occur at least 6 seconds 
after the execution of Step 2: 
 
Verify that the Decoded Longitude Position differs from the Computed 
Longitude Position at the time of transmission by no more than **58.775** 
meters (i.e., approximately 0.00052 degrees of Longitude). 
c. Verify that the received message was encoded in the proper format, i.e., 
odd or even encoding, by correlating the received message to the stimulus 
data provided by the test equipment. 

## Step 4: Equipment Re-Initialization (Gm-W-E)

Note 1: 
Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the Greenwich Meridian at 1020 knots from West to East. 

Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings: 

Initialize Time Reference at: 
t
 
0 
 
Set initial Computed Longitude to: 
0.0625 
degrees 
WEST 
Set initial Computed Latitude to: 
45.0 
degrees 
SOUTH 
Set initial Computed E/W Velocity to: 
1020 
knots 
EAST 

Note 2: The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of East/West velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the East/West Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

## Step 5: Performance Check (West - East)

Repeat Steps 2 through 3. 

## Step 6: Equipment Re-Initialization (Idl-E-W)

Note 1: Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the International Dateline at 1020 knots from East to West. 

Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings: 

Initialize Time Reference at: 
t
 
0 
 
Set initial Computed Longitude to: 
179.9375 
degrees 
WEST 
Set initial Computed Latitude to: 
45.0 
degrees 
NORTH 
Set initial Computed E/W Velocity to: 
1020 
knots 
WEST 

Note 2: The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of East/West velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the East/West Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

## Step 7: Performance Check (Idl-E-W)

Repeat Steps 2 through 3. 

## Step 8: Equipment Re-Initialization (Idl-E-W)

Note 1: 
Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the International Dateline at 1020 knots from East to West.  It is up to the equipment designers to insure that equipment under test and the test equipment properly move across the International Dateline by moving up to 180 degrees and then down for the duration of the test. 
Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings: 

Initialize Time Reference at: 
t
 
0 
 
Set initial Computed Longitude to: 
179.9375 
degrees **EAST** 
Set initial Computed Latitude to: 
45.0 
degrees **SOUTH** 
Set initial Computed E/W Velocity to: 
1020 
knots 
EAST 

Note 2: The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of East/West velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the East/West Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

## Step 9: Performance Check (Idl-E-W)

Repeat Steps 2 through 3. 

## Step 10: Maximum Velocity Performance Checks

Note: 
This procedure step must be performed only for those ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystems that are expected to be installed in vehicles capable of attaining North/South or East/West velocities in excess of 1022 knots. 
Repeat Steps 1 through 9 with the exception that for each case where the velocity magnitude is specified, set the magnitude to 4084 knots and the time of test duration should be retained at 35 seconds.  
Step 11: Repeat for additional Navigation Data Sources Repeat Steps 1 through 10 for each Navigation Data Source input interface that the equipment is designed to accommodate. 

## 2.4.3.2.3.8.4 Verification Of Airborne Longitude Position Data Retention (Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.4)

Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
Longitude Data Termination - Part 1 
Provide normal Airborne Position data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem at the nominal rate.  First, filter the data so that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem does not receive any longitude data for at least 2 seconds. After 2 seconds, verify that the longitude data registers are set to ALL ZEROs.   
Note: In order to terminate longitude data, it may also be necessary to terminate latitude information since a position fix normally includes both latitude and longitude.   

Step 2: 
Longitude Data Termination - Part 2 
Return to providing normal Airborne Position data at the nominal rate.  Next, filter the data so that the device does not receive any longitude data.  After 1 second, stop providing data.  Verify that after 1 second more, the longitude registers are set to ALL ZEROs. 

## 2.4.3.2.4 Verification Of Ads-B Surface Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.4)

No specific test procedure is required to validate Â§2.2.3.2.4. 

## 2.4.3.2.4.1 Verification Of "Type" Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.4.1) Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure verifies that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly outputs ADS-B Surface Position Messages with the correct TYPE Code subfield data content in Message bits 33 - 37 in DF=17 Messages for Transponder-Based Systems and DF=18 
Messages for Non-Transponder-Based Systems.  The "ME" field of the ADS-B Surface Position Message contains the TYPE Code subfield in bits 1 - 5, which, along with the Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) Supplement-A (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6) and NIC Supplement-C (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.3.10) in the ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Message, indicates the navigational integrity of the position information.  The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem determines and outputs the TYPE Code subfield based upon the input it receives from the possible Navigational sources that may interface to the system.  The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem may receive the TYPE Code subfield directly through an external interface instead of dynamically determining the TYPE Code subfield.  
Whatever the implementation, the test cases must exercise all of the resulting TYPE Code possibilities.  If an ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem can only generate a subset of the possible ADS-B Surface Position Message TYPE Codes, then only those test cases required to produce the possible TYPE Codes will be tested.  The test configuration is based on the type(s) of Navigational System(s) that may interface to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem and the data it provides.   

Step 1: 
Verification of TYPE Codes 5 through 8 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit ADS-B Surface Position Messages by providing position information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to "On-Ground" status.  Provide appropriate position data to the ADS-B system in order to establish the high rate of transmission for the ADS-B Surface Position Messages.  For each Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) supported, verify that the TYPE Code subfield in the ADS-B Surface Position Message correctly matches the TYPE Code subfield value from the Radius of Containment (RC) depicted in Table 2-14.  
Additionally, verify that the NIC Supplement-A (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6) and NIC 
Supplement-C (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.3.10), both contained in the ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Message, along with the TYPE Code, reflects the proper NIC value contained in Table 2-14.  The TYPE Code may be derived by the Horizontal Radius of Containment depicted in Table 2-14, or the Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL), or another means which establishes an appropriate Radius of Containment.  To test all of the possible resulting TYPE Codes that could be produced from the Navigational source, degradation of the position data from the Navigation source may require an alarm or alert condition that must be sensed by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  The TYPE Code subfield will contain appropriate values in the range from 5 through 8.   
Verify that TYPE Codes 5 and 6 cannot be set if the unit under test is not provided with either a GNSS Time Mark (see Â§2.2.5.1.6) or UTC data unless the Non-Coupled Case of position estimation (see Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.3 for Latitude, and Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.3 for Longitude) is implemented.    

Note: UTC data is not acceptable to be used in place of GNSS Time Mark 
       (see Â§2.2.5.1.6) because of the fact that UTC data may not be available 
       for any possible time up to 200 milliseconds after the leading edge of 
       the GNSS Time Mark.  Therefore, UTC data may not be used to 
       establish TYPE Codes 5 and 6.   

Step 2: 
Verification of TYPE Codes if the Radius of Containment is Unavailable 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to the "On-Ground" status as in Step 1, and provide navigation data from a source that does not provide a valid RC value.  Horizontal Containment Radius is valid from a navigation source that provides HPL, HIL, or HPL that can be derived from a RAIM protection threshold.  Verify that in the absence of a valid RC
 value, the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem transmits ADS-B Surface Position Messages with a TYPE Code subfield set to 8, and a NIC Supplement-A set to ZERO (0), and a NIC Supplement-C set to ZERO (0).   

 
2.4.3.2.4.1.1 
Verification of Surface Position Message TYPE Code if Containment Radius is Available (Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.1) 
Appropriate test procedures are provided in Â§2.4.3.2.4.1.   

 
2.4.3.2.4.1.2 
Verification of Surface Position Message TYPE Code if Containment Radius is Not Available (Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.2) 
Appropriate test procedures are provided in Â§2.4.3.2.4.1.

Verification of Special Processing for TYPE Code ZERO (Â§2.2.3.2.3.1.3, 
Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.3) 
No specific test procedure is required to validate Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.3.  

 

## 2.4.3.2.4.1.3.1 Verification Of Significance Of Type Code Equal To Zero (Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.3.1)

Purpose/Introduction: TYPE Code equal to ZERO is broadcast as a result of loss of ADS-B data updates.  The following test verifies that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly outputs TYPE 
Code equal to ZERO for each ADS-B Position Message type and correctly terminates the transmission when required.   
Measurement Procedure: Setup the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to the On-Ground status.  Connect the GNSS data input, provide valid non-zero "Movement" and "Heading/Ground Track" data to the ADS-B System.  If the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is capable of receiving 
"Movement" and "Heading/Ground Track" data from a source other than GNSS, then provide such data from the  other source.  Verify that Surface Position and Aircraft Identification Messages are transmitted at the proper rate. Stop update of the Navigational source of Latitude and Longitude position information. If the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is capable of receiving position data from more than one Navigation source, verify the following by disconnecting each Navigation source separately.  Verify that after 2 seconds, the TYPE code is ZERO and the remaining "ME" Bits are ZERO.  For Mode S Transponder-Based systems, verify that the Surface Position Message is no longer transmitted after 60 seconds.  For Non-Mode S Transponder-Based systems, monitor for 120 seconds and verify that TYPE Code of ZERO is output at the high transmission rate.   

## 2.4.3.2.4.1.3.2 Verification Of Broadcast Of Type Code Equal To Zero (Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.3.2)

Appropriate test procedures are provided in Â§2.4.3.2.4.1.3.1. 

## 2.4.3.2.4.1.4 Verification Of Type Code Based On Horizontal Protection Level (Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.4)

Purpose/Introduction: This test procedure verifies that if valid horizontal position information is available, then the TYPE Code in the Surface Position Message is set in the range from "5" to "8."  If the Horizontal Radius of Containment (RC) information is available from the navigation data source, the TYPE Code is selected according to the RC value, in accordance with Table 2-14.  If RC
 is not available from the navigation data source, then the TYPE Code will be set to 8, and NIC Supplement-A and NIC Supplement-C set to ZERO (0).   
Measurement Procedure: 
 from the Navigational Data Source 

Step 1: 
Verification of TYPE Code Based on RC
Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to the "On-Ground" status and enable transmission of Surface Position Messages.  Provide valid horizontal position information with an R
C value less than 7.5 m.  Verify that the TYPE Code 
("ME" bits 1 - 5) in the next transmitted Surface Position Message is set to FIVE (binary 0 0101).  Repeat this step with RC 
values of less than 75m, less than 0.1 NM (182.5m) and greater than or equal to 0.1 NM (182.5m) and verify that TYPE Codes of 6, 7 and 8 respectively are reflected in each of the respectively next transmitted Surface Position Messages. 

Step 2: 
Verification of TYPE Code 8 if R
 Data is Not Available 
C
Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to the "On-Ground" status and enable transmission of Surface Position Messages.  Provide valid horizontal position information without an R
C
 value.  Verify that the TYPE Code ("ME" bits 1 - 5) 
in the next transmitted Surface Position Message is set to 8 (binary 0 1000) and that the NIC Supplement-A and NIC Supplement-C are set to ZERO (0). 

 

## 2.4.3.2.4.1.5 Verification Of Type Code During Fde Conditions While On The Surface (Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.5)

Purpose/Introduction: These test procedures verify that an "FDE Fault" annunciated by the GPS/GNSS receiver is properly detected by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem and results in: 

a. The "TYPE" Code in Surface Position Messages being set to indicate that the RC
 is 
UNKNOWN, 
b. The NIC Supplement-A and NIC Supplement-C subfields in the Surface Aircraft 
Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, Subtype=1) being set to indicate that the R

## Step 2: Set An "Fde Fault"

Via the appropriate interface, provide appropriate indication to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem that an "FDE Fault" has been set. 

## Step 3: Verification Of "Fde Fault" Response

(0), and 
f. 
Surface Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, Subtype=1) 
having NAC
V
 ("ME" bits 17 - 19, Message bits 49 - 51) set to ALL 
ZERO (0). 
Step 4: 
Clear the "FDE Fault" 
Via the appropriate interface, remove the indication to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem that an "FDE Fault" has been set. 

Step 5:

## 2.4.3.2.4.2 Verification Of "Movement" Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.4.2)

Purpose/Introduction: 
This test procedure will verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly outputs Surface Position Messages with the correct "Movement" subfield data encoded, in accordance with the encoding provided in Table 2-16, in DF=17 Messages for Transponder-Based Systems, and DF=18 Messages for Non-Transponder-Based Systems. 

Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
"Movement" Verification - Part 1 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Surface Position Messages by providing position information at the nominal update rate.  
Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Surface Position Messages at the nominal rate. Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to "On Ground" status.  Provide valid, non-zero "Movement" data to the ADS-B System.  Discontinue the 
"Movement" data and verify that when "Movement" data is not provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, the "Movement" subfield is set to ZERO 
(binary 000 0000).  

Step 2: 
"Movement" Verification - Part 2 
Set up the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as above and set the "Movement" input to represent a "Movement" of greater than Zero knots, but less than or equal to 0.125 knots.  Verify that the "Movement" subfield is set to TWO 
(binary 000 0010).  Increase the "Movement" input to a value greater than 
0.125 knots and less than 0.270 knots, and verify that the "Movement" subfield is set to THREE (binary 000 0011).    

Step 3: 
"Movement" Verification - Part 3 
Continue to increase the "Movement" input in increments equal to those identified in Table 2-16 for values greater than ONE knot and less than 175 
knots.  Verify that for each such increment, the encoding of the "Movement" 
subfield is equal to that specified in Table 2-16.  Increase the Ground Speed input data to exactly 175 knots and verify that the "Movement" subfield is set to 123.  Continue increasing the Ground Speed data input for values greater than 175 knots and verify that the "Movement" subfield continues to be set at 124.    
Note: The last three encodings (125, 126, 127) of the "Movement" subfield in Table 2-16 are reserved to indicate high levels of ground speed change, etc.  The precedence of the codes is not defined yet, as inputs that would be required are not currently available.   

Step 4: 
Setting "Aircraft Stopped" when "Low" broadcast rate is selected as specified 
in Â§2.2.5.1.9.b.   
Ensure that the equipment is set to the "On the Ground" condition and that the appropriate valid ADS-B Surface Position data is provided such that the position is changing at a rate of 10.1 meters in any 30 second interval.  Provide valid, non-zero "Movement" data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. Verify that the "Movement" subfield is set to a value greater than or equal to decimal TWO (2).   
Input new ADS-B Surface Position data with the position data changing at a rate of 9.9 meters in any 30 second interval.  At least 36 seconds after the input of the new data, verify that the "Movement" subfield is set to decimal ONE (1) "Aircraft Stopped."   
Note: 
The 36 seconds is derived from the initial 30 second interval plus the 5 
second broadcast rate, plus one second.   
Input new ADS-B Surface Position data such that the position is 10.1 meters away from the previous position.  One (1) second after inputting the new data, verify that the ADS-B Surface Position Messages "Movement" subfield is set to a value greater than or equal to decimal TWO (2). For a Transponder-Based system, send an external RCS command to switch to low broadcast rate and verify that Surface Position Messages "Movement" subfield continues to be transmitted with an encoded value greater than or equal to decimal TWO (2).   

## 2.4.3.2.4.3 Verification Of "Status Bit For Heading/Ground Track" Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.4.3, Â§2.2.5.1.10) Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure will verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly outputs Surface Position Messages with the correct "Status Bit for Heading/Ground Track" 
subfield data encoded as specified in Table 2-17 in DF=17 Messages for Transponder-
Based Systems and DF=18 Messages for Non-Transponder-Based Systems. 

Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Surface Position Messages by providing position information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Surface Position Messages at the nominal rate.  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to "On Ground" status.  Provide valid, non-zero "Heading/Ground Track" data to the ADS-B 
System.  Verify that the "Status Bit for Heading/Ground Track" is set to ONE (1). Discontinue the valid "Heading" data and verify that when non-valid "Heading/Ground Track" data is provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, that the "Status Bit for Heading/Ground Track" subfield is set to ZERO (0).  

## 2.4.3.2.4.4 Verification Of "Heading/Ground Track" Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.4.4, Â§2.2.5.1.10) Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure will verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly outputs Surface Position Messages with the correct "Heading/Ground Track" subfield data encoded as specified in Table 2-18, in DF=17 Messages for Transponder-Based Systems and DF=18 Messages for Non-Transponder-Based Systems. 

Step 1: 
Heading Verification - Part 1 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Surface Position Messages by providing position information at the nominal update rate.  
Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Surface Position Messages at the nominal rate. Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to "On Ground" status.  Provide valid, non-zero "Heading" data to the ADS-B System.  Verify that the "Heading" 
subfield is NOT set to ZERO (0).  Set the "Heading" input to exactly ZERO degrees and verify that the encoding of the "Heading" subfield is set to ZERO (binary 000 0000). 

Step 2: 
Heading Verification - Part 2 
Raw data used to establish the "Heading" subfield will normally have more resolution (i.e., more bits) than that required by the "Heading" subfield.  When converting such data to the "Heading" subfield, the accuracy of the data will be maintained such that it is not worse than Â±Â½ LSB where the LSB is that of the 
"Heading" subfield. 

Set up the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as above and set the Heading data input to 2.8125 degrees.  Verify that the "Heading" subfield is set to ONE (binary 000 0001).  Continue increasing the Heading data input in increments of 2.8125 degrees and verify that for each such increment, the encoding of the 
"Heading" subfield is set to the corresponding binary code shown in Table 2-
18. 

2.4.3.2.4.5 
Verification of "TIME" (T) Subfield in ADS-B Surface Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.4.5, Â§2.2.5.1.6) 
Measurement Procedure: 
If the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is capable of synchronizing to a 0.2 second UTC epoch, configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Surface Position Messages by providing position information at the nominal rate.  Ensure that the time of applicability of the position data is synchronized to an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch. Verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem accepts a GNSS TIME MARK, or equivalent, input from the navigation data source, which is required in order to be able to update the position data from the navigation data source to an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch.  Verify that the "TIME" (T) subfield is set to ONE (1). If the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is not capable of synchronizing to a 0.2 second UTC epoch, or if the input is not available, verify that the "TIME" (T) subfield is set to ZERO (0). 

Note: The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem must be capable of monitoring the GNSS 
Time Mark unless the non-coupled case (see Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.3 and Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.3) is implemented.

Purpose/Introduction: This test procedure verifies that the latitude transition points used in CPR encoding are properly computed or established to satisfy the equations provided in Appendix A, Â§A.1.7.2.d. 

## Measurement Procedure: Step 1: Encode Lower Values

a.  Set the input longitude value to 45.00 degrees East and keep it at that value 
for the duration of this test procedure. 
b.  For each line item in Table 2-140, set the input latitude value to the value 
provided in the latlow column provided in Table 2-140. 
c.  Verify that the Even Surface Position latitude encoding agrees with the 
value provided in the "lower latitude" column of Table 2-140. 
  If the latitude encoding does not agree with the Table 2-140 value, then 
proceed to subparagraph "d."    
  Otherwise, verify that the Even Surface Position longitude encoding agrees 
with the value provided in the "lower longitude" column of Table 2-140. 
  If the Even Surface Position latitude and longitude encoding values agree 
with the values provided in the "lower latitude" and "lower longitude" 
columns of Table 2-140, then this portion of the test will be considered as 
PASSED, latlow-actual
 will be set to the input latitude used for this Step for 
use in Step 2, and testing will proceed with Step 2 below. 
d.  Increase or decrease, as appropriate, the input latitude value until the 
Surface Position latitude encoding agrees with the value provided in the "lower latitude" column of 
Table 2-140. 
 * 10 degrees. 
  Verify that the difference between the input latitude value and the latlow 
value provided in Table 2-140 does not exceed 2-19
  Verify that the Even Surface Position longitude encoding agrees with the 
value provided in the "lower longitude" column of 
Table 2-140. 
  If the Even Surface Position latitude and longitude encoding values agree 
with the values provided in the "lower latitude" and "lower longitude" 
columns of Table 2-140, then this portion of the test will be considered as 
PASSED, latlow-actual
 will be set to the input latitude used in this Step for use 
in Step 3, and testing will proceed with Step 2 below. 

## Step 2: Encode Upper Values

a.  Set the input longitude value to 45.00 degrees East and keep it at that value 
for the duration of this test procedure. 
b.  For each line item in Table 2-140, set the input latitude value to the value 
provided in the latup column provided in Table 2-140. 
c.  Verify that the Even Surface Position latitude encoding agrees with the 
value provided in the "upper latitude" column of Table 2-140. 
  If the latitude encoding does not agree with the Table 2-140 value, then 
proceed to subparagraph "d."   
  Otherwise, verify that the Even Surface Position longitude encoding agrees 
with the value provided in the "upper longitude" column of Table 2-140. 
  If the Even Surface Position latitude and longitude encoding values agree 
with the values provided in the "upper latitude" and "upper longitude" 
columns of Table 2-140, then this portion of the test will be considered as 
PASSED and latupper-actual
 will be set to the input latitude used for this Step 
for use in Step 3, and testing will proceed with Step 3 below.   
d.  Increase or decrease, as appropriate, the input latitude value until the 
Surface Position latitude encoding agrees with the value provided in the "upper latitude" column of 
Table 2-140. 
 * 10 degrees. 
  Verify that the difference between the input latitude value and the latup 
value provided in Table 2-140 does not exceed 2-19
  Verify that the Even Surface Position longitude encoding agrees with the 
value provided in the "upper longitude" column of 
Table 2-140. 
  If the Even Surface Position latitude and longitude encoding values agree 
with the values provided in the "upper latitude" and "upper longitude" 
columns of Table 2-140, then this portion of the test will be considered as 
PASSED, latupper-actual
 will be set to the input latitude used for this Step for 
use in Step 3, and testing will proceed with Step 3 below.   

## Step 3: Cross Transition Latitude

Note: The transition latitude test table (Table 2-140) is presented in millionths of a degree and AWB format.  Since other implementations with other resolutions are possible and allowed by this standard, the following test allows the input co-ordinates to be adjusted to correspond to the co-ordinate system used in the implementation under test.  The system position resolution is the minimum change in position based on GPS input position resolution, internal representation of the position and floating point math resolution.  This must be calculated for the implementation under test.   

a. Set the input longitude value to 45.00 degrees East and keep it at that value 
for the duration of this test.    
b. For each latlow in Table 2-140, perform the action in (c) below.   
c. Starting at latlow-actual, increase the latitude in increments of the GPS input 
position resolution until latupper-actual
 is reached.  The test will be considered 
PASSED if the encoded latitude and longitude pair change from the lower values to the upper values only once and the latitude and longitude values change at the same change of GPS input position.

Note to Table 2-140: 
An entry from Table 2-140 consists of a pair of latitudes, which, in the process of encoding with maximum precision, will produce values that straddle the transition latitudes as closely as possible.  In addition, each entry contains 2 pairs of even surface encodings for the positions at each latitude in the entry and 45 degrees longitude.  Both the latitudes and the encodings are distinguished by "upper" and "lower" where the upper position is the one closer to the North Pole. 

## 2.4.3.2.4.7.1.2 Verification Of Surface Latitude And Longitude Data Encoding (Â§2.2.3.2.4.6, Â§2.2.3.2.4.7, Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.1, Â§2.2.3.2.4.8, Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.1, Â§2.2.5.1.7, Â§2.2.5.1.8, Â§2.2.5.1.12, Â§2.2.5.1.13, Appendix Â§A.1.7) Purpose/Introduction:

The "Encoded Latitude" subfield is a 17-bit field ("ME" bits 23 - 39, Message bits 55 - 
71) containing the encoded latitude of the surface position.  The following test procedure verifies that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly receives Latitude position data from the Navigation source and outputs encoded Latitude data in the Surface Position Message.  The Latitude data is encoded according to the Compact Position Reporting (CPR) Format described in Appendix A.  The Latitude data is dependent upon the positional accuracy supported by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. 

The following procedure verifies the *static* latitude encoding where the velocity input is 
0.0 knots and is intended to verify the actual CPR Latitude encoding precision. 

Step 1: 
Establish Initial Conditions 
a. Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to create a Surface Position 
Message, i.e., TYPE Codes 5 through 8. 
b. Ensure that the Velocity input provided to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem is set to **ZERO**. 
Step 2: 
Verify Encoded Latitude Data 
a. Via the appropriate Navigation Data Source interface, provide the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem with the exact latitude and longitude data pair provided in the Angular Weighted Binary Values Latitude and Longitude 
Columns for each line item given in Table 2-141.   
Provide the latitude and longitude data via the interface at the nominal rate of the navigation data source. 

Allow the system to stabilize for at least 2 seconds after the data change prior to continuing with the following steps.

## 2.4.3.2.4.7.2 Verification Of Gps/Gnss Time Mark Coupled Case ("Time" (T)="1") (Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.2, Â§2.2.5.1.6.2, Â§2.2.5.1.53, Â§2.2.5.1.54) Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure will be used to verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly extrapolates and encodes Surface Position data when working with GNSS synchronized time.   

## Equipment Required:

Provide equipment capable of performing the following: 

a. Load all valid data required for the ADS-B Surface Position Message into the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem via the operational interfaces. 
 
The equipment should be capable of updating Latitude position and North/South Velocity given time, initial Latitude position, and North/South Velocity.  The Latitude 
Position provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will be referred to as the Computed Latitude.  Likewise, the North/South Velocity provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will be referred to as the Computed N/S Velocity. 
 
The equipment should be capable of updating Longitude position and East/West Velocity given time, initial Longitude position, and East/West Velocity.  The Longitude 
Position provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will be referred to as the Computed Longitude.  Likewise, the East/West Velocity provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will be referred to as the Computed E/W Velocity.   

b. Provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with an appropriate GNSS Time Mark and 
UTC Time information as described in Â§2.2.5.1.6 in order to establish the Time Mark 
Reference (TMR) as described in Â§2.2.5.1.6.2.  When providing UTC Time information 
(see Â§2.2.5.1.6.2.a, Note 1), the UTC time provided should be offset approximately 0.2 
seconds before the end of the UTC Epoch or 0.2 seconds after the beginning of the UTC Epoch.  (See Appendix S for rationale.)   
 
The equipment **shall** also be capable of time-tagging the Time Mark Reference (TMR) 
or GNSS Time Mark leading edge event to a minimum accuracy of 1.0 millisecond.   
c. When providing the GNSS Time Mark described in subparagraph "b," above, the 
equipment **shall** have re-computed position and velocity information required by 
subparagraph "a," above, available at one second intervals that are synchronized with 
the leading edge of the GNSS Time Mark, or Time Mark Reference (TMR) as per Â§2.2.5.1.6.2.  Initial delivery of the all new computed position and velocity data to the 
ADS-B Transmission system **shall**  be completed no later than 200 milliseconds after 
the leading edge of the GNSS Time Mark.   
d. The monitoring of position and velocity information at any given 0.2 s UTC epoch, with 
respect to the GNSS Time Mark, or Time Mark Reference (TMR) described in 
subparagraph "b," above.  The equipment **shall** be capable of updating the Calculated 
Longitude to a 0.2s UTC epoch with a minimum accuracy of 1.0 millisecond.  Likewise, 
the equipment **shall** be capable of updating the Calculated Latitude to a 0.2s UTC epoch 
with a minimum accuracy of 1.0 millisecond.   
e. The monitoring of transmitted ADS-B Surface Position Messages and the extraction of 
all subfields as may be required.  The equipment **shall** also be capable of time-tagging 
the receipt of any ADS-B Broadcast message, with respect to the GNSS Time Mark, or 
Time Mark Reference (TMR) described in subparagraph "b" above, to a minimum accuracy of 1.0 millisecond.   
f. 
Performing local unambiguous CPR decoding of the encoded latitude and longitude subfields in accordance with Appendix A, Â§A.1.7.4, Â§A.1.7.6 and Â§A.1.7.9.   
g. Determining the appropriate 0.2s UTC epoch as being the time of applicability of the 
Decoded Latitude Position based on the time of reception and the setting of the F-bit in 
accordance with Â§2.2.3.2.3.6.  This 0.2s UTC epoch **shall** be referred to as the 
Transmitted Time of Applicability.   
h. After performing the encoded latitude and longitude local unambiguous CPR decoding, 
the equipment **shall** be capable of computing the difference between the Decoded 
Latitude Position and the Computed Latitude at the Transmitted Time of Applicability.  
Likewise, the equipment **shall** be capable of computing the difference between the 
Decoded Longitude Position and the Computed Longitude at the Transmitted Time of 
Applicability.   
Measurement Procedure: 

## Step 1: Equipment Initialization (North-South)

Initialize the equipment to provide the following to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. 

## Do Not Start Delivery Of The Data At This Time

a. 
Initialize Time Reference at: 
 
t
 
0 
 
 
Set initial Computed Longitude to:  
45.0 
degrees 
WEST 
 
Set initial Computed Latitude to: 
0.0625 
degrees 
NORTH 
 
Set initial Computed N/S Velocity to: 
1020 
knots 
SOUTH 
Note: The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of North/South velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the North/South Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

b. GNSS Time Mark as described above under Equipment subparagraphs b and 
c. 
c. All other data required to generate the Surface Position Message.    

## Step 2: Equipment Data Delivery Start Up

Allow the equipment to start delivery of the data specified in Step 1 and designate this time as t0
.  Continue to let the equipment provide the data for at least 35 
seconds.   

## Step 3: Latitude Position Performance Notes:

1. Since there has been no position or velocity data provided to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem up to this time (at least for the purposes of this test procedure), a minimal amount of time will need to be allowed for the transmitted message data to stabilize.  This fact has been factored in to the following required response criteria. 
2. Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the Equator at 
1020 knots from North to South. 
a. At 4.0 Â±0.005 seconds after executing Step 2 where data has started being 
provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem under test: 
Verify that the Decoded Latitude Position differs from the Computed Latitude Position by no more than **22.1** meters (i.e., approximately 0.0002 degrees Latitude). 

b. At all successive points during the time of test that occur at least 6 seconds 
after the execution of Step 2: 
 
Verify that the Decoded Latitude Position differs from the Computed Latitude 
Position by no more than 3.0 meters (i.e., approximately 0.000027 degrees 
Latitude). 
c. Verify that the received message was encoded in the proper format, i.e., odd 
or even encoding, by correlating the received message to the stimulus data provided by the test equipment. 

Note: This test is intended to demonstrate that the UUT is encoding data 
       correctly in regards to the 0.2 UTC Epochs and in regards to the 
       alternating odd and even encodings.  Since the test set knows what 
       the data is at given 1.0 second intervals, and it also time tags the 
       received data, it is reasonable to expect that this capacity is adequate 
       to establish the proper 0.2 UTC Epochs and the appropriate format 
       encoding 

## Step 4: Equipment Re-Initialization (South-North)

Note 1: 
Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the Equator at 1020 knots from South to North. 

Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings: 

| Initialize Time Reference at:         |           |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| t                                     |           |
|                                       |           |
| 0                                     |           |
|                                       |           |
|                                       |           |
| Set initial Computed Longitude to:    |   45      |
| EAST                                  |           |
|                                       |           |
| Set initial Computed Latitude to:     |    0.0625 |
| SOUTH                                 |           |
|                                       |           |
| Set initial Computed N/S Velocity to: | 1020      |
| NORTH                                 |           |
|                                       |           |

Note 2: 
         The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of 
         North/South velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources 
         are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the 
         implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved 
         into the North/South Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

## Step 5: Performance Check (South-North)

Repeat Steps 2 through 3. 

## Step 6: Equipment Re-Initialization (North Pole)

Note 1: 
Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the North Pole at 1020 knots from South to North.  It is up to the equipment designers to insure that equipment under test and the test equipment 
properly move across the pole by moving up to 90.0 degrees North and then down from the pole for the duration of the test. 
Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings:

The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of North/South velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the North/South Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

## Step 7: Performance Check (North Pole)

Repeat Steps 2 through 3. 

## Step 8: Equipment Re-Initialization (South Pole)

Note 1: 
Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the South Pole at 1020 knots from North to South.  It is up to the equipment 
designers to insure that equipment under test and the test equipment 
properly move across the pole by moving up to 90.0 degrees South and then down from the pole for the duration of the test.

Purpose/Introduction: 
This test procedure will be used to verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly extrapolates and encodes Surface Position data when NOT working with GNSS synchronized time.   
Equipment Required: Provide equipment capable of performing the following: 

a. Load all valid data required for the ADS-B Surface Position Message into the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem via the operational interfaces. 
 
The equipment should be capable of updating Latitude position and North/South Velocity given time, initial Latitude position, and North/South Velocity.  The Latitude 
Position provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will be referred to as the Computed Latitude.  Likewise, the North/South Velocity provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will be referred to as the Computed N/S Velocity. 
 
The equipment should be capable of updating Longitude position and East/West Velocity given time, initial Longitude position, and East/West Velocity.  The Longitude 
Position provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will be referred to as the Computed Longitude.  Likewise, the East/West Velocity provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will be referred to as the Computed E/W Velocity. 
b. Maintain a common reference time for the purposes of test validation, with a minimum 
accuracy of 1.0 millisecond.   
c. Referenced to the GNSS Time Mark described in subparagraph "b," above, the 
equipment **shall** have re-computed position and velocity information required by 
subparagraph "a," above, available at one second intervals that are synchronized with 
the time of delivery of the position and velocity information to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem. 
d. Monitoring the transmitted ADS-B Surface Position Messages and the Airborne 
Velocity Messages and extracting all subfields as may be required.  The equipment 
shall also be capable of time-tagging the receipt of any ADS-B Broadcast Message, 
with respect to the time reference described in subparagraph "b" above, to a minimum 
accuracy of 1.0 millisecond.   
e. Performing local unambiguous CPR decoding of the encoded latitude and longitude 
subfields in accordance with Appendix A, Â§A.1.7.4, Â§A.1.7.5 and Â§A.1.7.9.   
f. 
After performing the encoded latitude and longitude local unambiguous CPR decoding, 
the equipment **shall** be capable of computing the difference between the Decoded 
Latitude Position and the Computed Latitude at the time of reception.  Likewise, the 
equipment **shall** be capable of computing the difference between the Decoded 
Longitude Position and the Computed Longitude at the time of reception. 

## Measurement Procedure: Step 1: Equipment Initialization (North-South)

Initialize the equipment to provide the following to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. 

## Do Not Start Delivery Of The Data At This Time

a. 
Initialize Time Reference at: 
 
t
 
0 
 

|       | Set initial Computed Longitude to:     |     45.0  | degrees    |
|-------|----------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
| WEST  |                                        |           |            |
|       |                                        |           |            |
|       | Set initial Computed Latitude to:      |    0.0625 | degrees    |
| NORTH |                                        |           |            |
|       |                                        |           |            |
|       | Set initial Computed N/S Velocity to:  | 1020      | knots      |
| SOUTH |                                        |           |            |
|       |                                        |           |            |

Note: The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of North/South velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the North/South Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

b. Common time reference as described above under Equipment subparagraphs 
"b" and "c." 
c. All other data required to generate the Surface Position Message. 

## Step 2: Equipment Data Delivery Start Up

Allow the equipment to start delivery of the data specified in Step 1 and designate this time as t0.  Continue to let the equipment provide the data for at least 35 
seconds. 

## Step 3: Latitude Position Performance Notes:

1. Since there has been no position or velocity data provided to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem up to this time (at least for the purposes of this test procedure), a minimal amount of time will need to be allowed for the transmitted message data to stabilize.  This fact has been factored in to the following required response criteria. 
2. Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the Equator at 
1020 knots from North to South. 
a. At 4.0 Â±0.005 seconds after executing Step 2 where data has started being 
provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem under test: 
Verify that the Decoded Latitude Position differs from the Computed Latitude Position by no more than **74.5** meters (i.e., approximately 0.00067 degrees Latitude). 

b. At all successive points during the time of test that occur at least 6 seconds 
after the execution of Step 2: 
 
Verify that the Decoded Latitude Position differs from the Computed Latitude 
Position by no more than **55.4** meters (i.e., approximately 0.00049 degrees 
Latitude). 
c. Verify that the received message was encoded in the proper format, i.e., odd 
or even encoding, by correlating the received message to the stimulus data provided by the test equipment. 

## Step 4: Equipment Re-Initialization (South-North)

Note 1: 
Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the Equator at 1020 knots from South to North. 
Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings: 

| Initialize Time Reference at:         |           |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| t                                     |           |
|                                       |           |
| 0                                     |           |
|                                       |           |
|                                       |           |

| SOUTH                                 |           |
|                                       |           |
| Set initial Computed N/S Velocity to: | 1020      |
| NORTH                                 |           |
|                                       |           |

Note 2: 
The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of North/South velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the North/South Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

## Step 5: Performance Check (South-North)

Repeat Steps 2 through 3. 

## Step 6: Equipment Re-Initialization (North Pole)

Note 1: 
         Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the North 
         Pole at 1020 knots from South to North.  It is up to the equipment 
         designers to insure that equipment under test and the test equipment 
         properly move across the pole by moving up to 90.0 degrees North and 
         then down from the pole for the duration of the test. 

Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings: 

| Initialize Time Reference at:         |           |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| t                                     |           |

| 0                                     |           |
|                                       |           |
|                                       |           |

| Set initial Computed Latitude to:     |   89.9375 |
| NORTH                                 |           |

|                                       |           |

Note 2: 
The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of North/South velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the North/South Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

## Step 7: Performance Check (North Pole)

Repeat Steps 2 through 3. 

## Step 8: Equipment Re-Initialization (South Pole)

Note 1: 
         Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the South 
         Pole at 1020 knots from North to South.  It is up to the equipment 
         designers to insure that equipment under test and the test equipment 
         properly move across the pole by moving up to 90.0 degrees South and 
         then down from the pole for the duration of the test. 

Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings:

|                                       |           |

Note 2: 
         The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of 
         North/South velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources

         implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved 
         into the North/South Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

Step 9: 
Performance Check (South Pole) 
Repeat Steps 2 through 3.

Repeat Steps 1 through 9 for each Navigation Data Source input interface that the equipment is designed to accommodate. 

 

## 2.4.3.2.4.7.4 Verification Of Surface Latitude Position Data Retention (Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.4, Â§2.2.5.1.7) Purpose/Introduction:

The extrapolation or estimation, and update of latitude data and fields specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.1 through Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.3 is limited to no more than two seconds, in the event that the latitude position data is no longer available.  At the end of two seconds, the latitude data registers and the encoded latitude field will be set to ALL ZEROs.   
Measurement Procedures: 

Step 1: 
Termination of Latitude Data Input - Part 1 
Provide normal Surface Position data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem at the nominal rate.  First, filter the data so that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem does not receive any latitude data for at least 2 seconds.  After 2 seconds, verify that the latitude data registers are set to ALL ZEROs.   
Note: In order to terminate latitude data, it may also be necessary to terminate longitude information since a position fix normally includes both latitude and longitude.   

Step 2: 
Termination of Latitude Data Input - Part 2 
For equipment that can independently filter latitude and longitude, return to providing normal Surface Position data at the nominal rate.  Next, filter the data so that the device does not receive any latitude data.  After 1 second, stop providing data.  Verify that after 1 second more, the latitude registers are set to ALL ZEROs.   

 

## 2.4.3.2.4.8 Verification Of "Cpr Encoded Longitude" Subfield In Ads-B Surface Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.4.6, Â§2.2.3.2.4.8, Â§2.2.5.1.6, Â§2.2.5.1.8, Â§2.2.5.1.13)

Appropriate test procedures are provided in Â§2.4.3.2.4.8 through Â§2.4.3.2.4.8.4. 

 

## 2.4.3.2.4.8.1 Verification Of Surface Longitude Data Encoding (Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.1, Â§2.2.5.1.8, Â§2.2.5.1.13)

Appropriate test procedures to verify the surface longitude data encoding were previously provided in Â§2.4.3.2.4.7.1.2. 

## 2.4.3.2.4.8.2 Verification Of Gps/Gnss Time Mark Coupled Case ("Time" (T)="1") (Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.2)

Purpose/Introduction: This test procedure will be used to verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly extrapolates and encodes Surface Position data when working with GNSS synchronized time.   
Equipment Required: Equipment requirements remain the same as provided in Â§2.4.3.2.4.7.2. Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
Equipment Initialization (GM-E-W) 
Initialize the equipment to provide the following to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. 

## Do Not Start Delivery Of The Data At This Time

a. 
Initialize Time Reference at: 
 
t
 
0 
 

|       | Set initial Computed Longitude to:     |   0.0625  | degrees    |
|-------|----------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
| EAST  |                                        |           |            |
|       |                                        |           |            |
|       | Set initial Computed Latitude to:      |        45 | degrees    |
| NORTH |                                        |           |            |
|       |                                        |           |            |
|       | Set initial Computed E/W Velocity to:  |      1020 | knots      |
| WEST  |                                        |           |            |
|       |                                        |           |            |

Note: The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of East/West velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the East/West Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

b. GNSS Time Mark as described above under Equipment subparagraphs "b" 
and "c." 
c. All other data required to generate the Surface Position Message.    

## Step 2: Equipment Data Delivery Start Up

Allow the equipment to start delivery of the data specified in Step 1 and designate this time as t0
.  Continue to let the equipment provide the data for at least 35 
seconds.   

## Step 3: Longitude Position Performance Notes:

1. Since there has been no position or velocity data provided to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem up to this time (at least for the purposes of this test procedure), a minimal amount of time will need to be allowed for the transmitted message data to stabilize.  This fact has been factored in to the following required response criteria. 
2. Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the Greenwich 
Meridian at 1020 knots from East to West. It is up to the equipment designers 
to insure that equipment under test and the test equipment properly move across the International Dateline by moving up to 180 degrees and then down for the duration of the test. 
a. At 4.0 Â±0.005 seconds after executing Step 2 where data has started being 
provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem under test: 
Verify that the Decoded Longitude Position differs from the Computed Longitude Position at the Transmitted Time of Applicability by no more than 
22.1 meters (i.e., approximately 0.0002 degrees Longitude). 

b. At all successive points during the time of test that occur at least 6 seconds 
after the execution of Step 2: 
 
Verify that the Decoded Longitude Position differs from the Computed Longitude Position at the Transmitted Time of Applicability by no more than 
3.0 meters (i.e., approximately 0.000027 degree Longitude).   
c. Verify that the received message was encoded in the proper format, i.e., odd 
or even encoding, by correlating the received message to the stimulus data provided by the test equipment.   

Note: This test is intended to demonstrate that the UUT is encoding data 
       correctly in regards to the 0.2 UTC Epochs and in regards to the 
       alternating odd and even encodings.  Since the test set knows what 
       the data is at given 1.0 second intervals, and it also time tags the 
       received data, it is reasonable to expect that this capacity is adequate 
       to establish the proper 0.2 UTC Epochs and the appropriate format 
       encoding. 

## Step 4: Equipment Re-Initialization (Gm-W-E)

Note 1: 
Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the Greenwich Meridian at 1020 knots from West to East. 

Repeat Step 1 with the following equipment settings:

         The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of East/West 
         velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., 
         ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to 
         verify that such information is properly resolved into the East/West 
         Velocity required in the transmitted messages.

## 2.4.3.2.4.8.3 Verification Of Non-Gps/Gnss Time Mark Coupled Case (Estimation, "Time" (T) = "0") (Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.3, Â§2.2.5.1.8, Â§2.2.5.1.13)

Purpose/Introduction: This test procedure will be used to verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly extrapolates and encodes Surface Position data when NOT working with GNSS synchronized time.   
Equipment Required: Equipment requirements remain the same as provided in Â§2.4.3.2.3.7.3.   
Measurement Procedure: 

## Step 1: Equipment Initialization (Gm-E-W)

Initialize the equipment to provide the following to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. 

## Do Not Start Delivery Of The Data At This Time

a. 
Initialize Time Reference at: 
 
t
 
0 
 

|       | Set initial Computed Longitude to:     |   0.0625  | degrees    |
|-------|----------------------------------------|-----------|------------|

|       |                                        |           |            |
|       | Set initial Computed Latitude to:      |        45 | degrees    |
| NORTH |                                        |           |            |
|       |                                        |           |            |
|       | Set initial Computed E/W Velocity to:  |      1020 | knots      |
| WEST  |                                        |           |            |
|       |                                        |           |            |

Note: The velocity requirements above are specified in terms of East/West velocities.  If alternate velocity and direction sources are used, i.e., ground speed and ground track, then it is up to the implementer to verify that such information is properly resolved into the East/West Velocity required in the transmitted messages. 

b. Common time reference as described above under Equipment subparagraphs 
"b." 
c. All other data required to generate the Surface Position Message.   

## Step 2: Equipment Data Delivery Start Up

Allow the equipment to start delivery of the data specified in Step 1 and designate this time as t0
.  Continue to let the equipment provide the data for at least 35 
seconds. 

## Step 3: Longitude Position Performance Notes:

1. Since there has been no position or velocity data provided to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem up to this time (at least for the purposes of this test procedure), a minimal amount of time will need to be allowed for the transmitted message data to stabilize.  This fact has been factored in to the 
following required response criteria. 
2. Be advised that this test scenario is forcing movement across the Greenwich 
Meridian at 1020 knots from East to West.  It is up to the equipment designers 
to insure that equipment under test and the test equipment properly move across the International Dateline by moving up to 180 degrees and then down for the duration of the test. 
a. At 4.0 Â±0.005 seconds after executing Step 2 where data has started being 
provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem under test: 
Verify that the Decoded Longitude Position differs from the Computed Longitude Position at the time of transmission by no more than **74.5** meters 
(i.e., approximately 0.00067 degrees Longitude). 

b. At all successive points during the time of test that occur at least 6 seconds 
after the execution of Step 2: 
 
Verify that the Decoded Longitude Position differs from the Computed 
Longitude Position at the time of transmission by no more than **55.4** meters 
(i.e., approximately 0.00049 degrees Longitude). 
c. Verify that the received message was encoded in the proper format, i.e., odd 
or even encoding, by correlating the received message to the stimulus data provided by the test equipment.   

## Step 4: Equipment Re-Initialization (Gm-W-E)

## Step 9: Performance Check (Idl-E-W)

## Step 10: Repeat For Additional Navigation Data Sources

Repeat Steps 1 through 9 for each Navigation Data Source input interface that the equipment is designed to accommodate. 

## 2.4.3.2.4.8.4 Verification Of Surface Longitude Position Data Retention (Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.4, Â§2.2.5.1.8) Purpose/Introduction:

The extrapolation or estimation, and update of longitude data and fields specified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.1 through Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.3 is limited to no more than two seconds, in the event that the longitude position data is no longer available.  At the end of two seconds, the longitude data registers and the encoded longitude field will be set to ALL ZEROs.   

Step 1: 
Longitude Data Termination - Part 1 
Provide normal Surface Position data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem at the nominal rate.  First, filter the data so that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem does not receive any longitude data for at least 2 seconds. After 2 seconds, verify that the longitude data registers are set to ALL ZEROs.   

Note: 
        In order to terminate longitude data, it may also be necessary to 
        terminate latitude information since a position fix normally includes 
        both latitude and longitude.   

Step 2: 
Longitude Data Termination - Part 2 
For equipment that can independently filter latitude and longitude, return to providing normal Surface Position data at the nominal rate.  Next, filter the data so that the device does not receive any longitude data.  After 1 second, stop providing data.  Verify that after 1 second more, the longitude registers are set to ALL ZEROs.  Verify that after 1 second more, the longitude registers are set to ALL ZEROs. 

## 2.4.3.2.5 Verification Of Ads-B Aircraft Identification And Category Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.5)

The format for the Aircraft Identification and Category Message "ME" field contents is specified in Figure 2-6.  Testing requirements for each of the subfields is specified in the following subparagraphs.   

2.4.3.2.5.1 
Verification of "TYPE" Subfield in ADS-B Aircraft Identification and Category

## 2.4.3.2.5.2 Verification Of "Ads-B Emitter Category" Subfield In Ads-B Aircraft Identification And Category Message (Â§2.2.3.2.5.2, Â§2.2.5.1.2)

Purpose/Introduction: 
Each of the ADS-B Emitter Category Sets specified in Table 2-19 are used to identify particular aircraft or vehicle types within the ADS-B Emitter Category Sets A, B, C, or D 
identified by Message Format TYPE codes 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.   
Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
Emitter Category Data Input 
Provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with appropriate ADS-B Emitter Category data via the appropriate interface.  Vary the "Emitter Category" data input through the range of codes, for appropriate values between 0 through 7 for Emitter Category Sets "A," "B," "C" and "D," for all Emitter Categories and codes that the system supports. For each ADS-B Emitter Category data input selected, verify that the Format TYPE Code is properly transmitted in the ADS-B Aircraft Identification and Category Message. For each ADS-B Emitter Category data input selected, verify that the ADS-B 
Emitter Category subfield is properly transmitted in the ADS-B Aircraft Identification and Category Message in accordance with the encodings provided in Table 2-19. 

Step 2: 
Emitter Category Data Not Available 
Set up the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as in Step 1 above.  Discontinue the input of valid ADS-B Emitter Category data and verify that the ADS-B Emitter Category Subfield is set to ALL ZEROs (binary 000) in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message. 

## 2.4.3.2.5.3 Verification Of "Character" Subfield In Ads-B Aircraft Identification And Category Message (Â§2.2.3.2.5.3, Â§2.2.5.1.11)

Purpose/Introduction: Each of the 8 "Character" subfields is a 6-bit field as shown in Figure 2-6. Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
Aircraft Identification Data Input - Part 1 
Provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with appropriate ADS-B Emitter Category data via the appropriate interface.  Set the input data for each of the eight characters to the character "5." 
Verify that each of the characters in the ADS-B Aircraft Identification and Category Message is transmitted properly in accordance with the encoding provided in Â§A.1.4.4.1 of Appendix A.  For an input character of "5," the encoding for each character should be 110101 Binary. 

Step 2: 
Aircraft Identification Data Input - Part 2 
Provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with appropriate ADS-B Emitter Category data via the appropriate interface.  Set the input data for each of the eight characters to the character "J." Verify that each of the characters in the ADS-B Aircraft Identification and Category Message is transmitted properly in accordance with the encoding provided in Â§A.1.4.4.1 of Appendix A.  For an input character of "J," the encoding for each character should be 001010 Binary. 

Step 3: 
Aircraft Registration Marking Data Input 
Repeat Step 1 and 2 while providing the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with Aircraft Registration Marking data instead of Aircraft Identification via the appropriate interface. 

Step 4: 
No Aircraft Identification or Aircraft Registration Data 
Reinitialize the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem and ensure that Aircraft Identification or Flight Number Data, and Aircraft Registration Data is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Verify that each of the characters in the ADS-B Aircraft Identification and Category Message is transmitted properly with all bits of each character set to a binary ZERO (0).  The encoding for each character should be ALL ZEROs (binary 000000). 

## 2.4.3.2.6 Verification Of Ads-B Airborne Velocity Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.6)

Formats for the various Airborne Velocity Messages are further classified by Subtype as identified in Figure 2-7 and Figure 2-8.  Test procedures to verify the various fields within the Airborne Velocity Message are described in the following paragraphs. 

## 2.4.3.2.6.1 Verification Of Ads-B Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=1 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1)

Appropriate test procedures required to validate the correct transmission of the parameters of the ADS-B Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=1 are provided in Â§2.4.3.2.6.1.1 
through Â§2.4.3.2.6.1.15.  
Purpose/Introduction: 
Additionally, the requirement of Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.c states that: "this message shall not be broadcast if the only valid data is the Intent Change Flag."   
Measurement Procedure: Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages.  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne Status.  Provide valid input data and verify that Airborne Velocity Messages â Subtype=1 are being broadcast.  
Discontinue all of the input data to the data fields except for the Intent Change Flag data. Wait 2.6 seconds and verify that the Airborne Velocity Message â Subtype=1 is no longer being broadcast. Repeat this procedure for Airborne Velocity Messages of Subtypes "2," "3" and "4."

(Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.1) 
Appropriate test procedures are provided in Â§2.4.3.2.6.1.2. 

 
2.4.3.2.6.1.2 
Verification of "Subtype" Subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 
(Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.1, Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.2, Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.1, Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.2, Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.1, Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.2, 
Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.1, Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.2, Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.1, Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.2, Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.1, Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.2) 
Purpose/Introduction: The "Subtype" subfield is contained in Message bits 38 - 40 ("ME" bits 6 - 8), and is encoded according to Figure 2-7.  This test procedure is intended to verify that the appropriate Subtype subfield is used in all Airborne Velocity Messages. 

Step 1: 
TYPE and Subtype Verification - Part 1 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status. Provide velocity information in the form of Velocity Over Ground (i.e., Ground Speed) with a valid value that is greater than zero but non-supersonic (i.e., both North/South AND East/West Velocity inputs are less than 1000 knots). Verify that ADS-B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain Subtype value "1." Raise the East/West Velocity input to a value of 1021 knots, and verify that ADS- B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain Subtype value "1."  Lower the East/West Velocity input to a value below 1000 knots, and raise the North/South Velocity input to a value of 1021 knots.  
Verify that ADS-B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain Subtype value "1." Lower the North/South Velocity input to a value below 1000 knots, then raise both the East/West and North/South Velocity inputs to values of 1021 knots. Verify that ADS-B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain Subtype value "1." 

Note:  
During the execution of the previous step, care must be taken to ensure that neither the East/West nor the North/South Velocity inputs are raised to a value greater than 1021 knots. 

## Step 2: Type And Subtype Verification - Part 2

This step verifies that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly transitions between Subtype equal "1" and Subtype equal "2" in Airborne Velocity Messages. Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages as indicated in Step 1.  Provide velocity information in the form of Velocity Over Ground (i.e., Ground Speed).  Initially, both the East/West Velocity input and the North/South Velocity input will be greater than 0 knots but less than 1000 knots, as in Step 1.  
Raise the East/West Velocity to a value of 1023 knots. Verify that ADS-B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain Subtype value "2." Decrease the East/West Velocity input to a value of 999 knots.  Verify that ADS- B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages revert to Subtype value "1."  Raise the North/South Velocity to a value of 1023 knots.   
Verify that ADS-B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain Subtype value "2." Decrease the North/South Velocity input to a value of 999 knots. Verify that ADS-B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages revert to Subtype value "1." 
Raise both North/South and East/West input values to 1023 knots, and verify that ADS-B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain Subtype value "2."   
Decrease both North/South and East/West input values to 999 knots, and verify that ADS-B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain Subtype value "1." 

Step 3: 
TYPE and Subtype Verification - Part 3 
Provide velocity information in the form of Airspeed and Heading Information with a valid value that is greater than zero but non-supersonic (i.e., the Airspeed input is less than 1000 knots). Verify that ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain Subtype value "3." 
Raise the Airspeed input to 1021 knots, without exceeding the value of 1022 knots in the process. Verify that ADS-B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain Subtype value "3." 

Step 4: 
TYPE and Subtype Verification - Part 4 
This step verifies that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly transitions between Subtype equal "3" and Subtype equal "4" in Airborne Velocity Messages containing Airspeed and Heading Information. 

Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages as indicated in Step 1 but with velocity information provided in the form of Airspeed and Heading Information rather than Velocity Over Ground.  Initially, the Airspeed input will be greater than 0 knots but less than 1000 knots, as in Step 1.  Raise the input Airspeed to a value of 1023 knots. Verify that ADS-B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain Subtype value "4." Decrease the Airspeed input to a value of 999 knots. Verify that ADS-B Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages revert to Subtype value "3." 

## 2.4.3.2.6.1.3 Verification Of "Intent Change Flag" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.3, Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.3, Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.3, Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.3, Â§2.2.5.1.18) Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure verifies that the "Intent Change Flag" subfield is used to indicate a change in intent as specified in Table 2-21, and transmitted in the Airborne Velocity Message Message. 

Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
"Intent Change Flag" Subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages (All Subtypes), 
Mode-S Transponder Implementations - Setup (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.3.a) 
For Mode-S Transponder Implementations only, configure the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system, via GICB Registers 4016 to 4216
2.2.3.2.6
, appropriate to each of the four Airborne Velocity Message Subtypes (see Â§
), and enable broadcasting of the Airborne Velocity Messages (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status, and provide valid non-zero velocity data to the ADS-B Transmitting System. 

Step 2: 
"Intent Change Flag" Subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages (All Subtypes), 
Mode-S Transponder Implementations (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.3.a) 
Change the data input to GICB Registers 4016 to 4216
, and verify that after 4 
seconds, and for each of the four Airborne Velocity Message Subtypes, that the ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19," and with Message Bit 41, "ME" Bit 9 ("Intent Change Flag" subfield) set to ONE (1). 

With no further change at the data input to GICB Registers 40
16 to 4216
, verify that after 18 Â±1 seconds following the last intent change, the Message Bit 41, "ME" Bit 9 ("Intent Change Flag" subfield) is reset to ZERO (0). 

Step 3: 
"Intent Change Flag" Subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages (All Subtypes), 
Non-Transponder Implementations - Setup (Â§
2.2.3.2.6.1.3.b) 
For Non-Transponder Implementations only, repeat Steps 1 and 2. 

Verify that for each of the four Airborne Velocity Message Subtypes, that the ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19," and with Message Bit 41, "ME" Bit 9 ("Intent Change Flag" subfield) always set to ZERO (0). 

## 2.4.3.2.6.1.4 Verification Of "Reserved Bit-A" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.4) Purpose/Introduction:

The "Reserved Bits-A" subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 10, Message bit 42) field that will be set to ZERO (0) in all ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems that comply with these MOPS. 

Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to broadcast Airborne Velocity Messages - 
Subtype=1 at the nominal rate.  Verify that the "Reserved Bits-A" subfield is set to ZERO (0) in all transmitted messages.   

## 2.4.3.2.6.1.5 Verification Of "Nacv " Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 (Â§ , Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.5, Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.5, Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.5, Â§2.2.5.1.19) 2.2.3.2.6.1.5

Purpose/Introduction: 
The "NACV" subfield is used to indicate the Navigation Accuracy Category for Velocity as specified in Table 2-22.  These test procedures are intended for use for Airborne Velocity Messages of all Subtypes.  The type and values of the input Velocity data should be set so as to generate Airborne Velocity Messages for all appropriate Subtype fields.   
Note: Subsequent to Revision A of the 1090 MHz ADS-B MOPS, the Federal Aviation Administration requested RTCA SC-159 to develop test procedures for a velocity accuracy test to characterize the 95% horizontal and 95% vertical velocity accuracies during normal maneuvers of GNSS equipment, as specified in RTCA/DO-229D, RTCA/DO-316, and RTCA/DO-253C receiver MOPS, which do not provide a specific velocity accuracy output.  These tests can be used to substantiate Global Positioning System (GPS), GPS/Space-Based Augmentation System (SBAS), or GPS/Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) equipment to support an ADS-B NACV =1 requirement of horizontal velocity error less than 10 
meters/second (95th percentile with HDOP of 1.5 or less) and vertical velocity error less than 50 feet/second (95th percentile, with VDOP of 3.0 or less). Additional test procedures were developed to substantiate equipment that supports a NACV =2 requirement of horizontal velocity error less than 3 meters/second and vertical velocity error less than 15 feet/second.  However, these tests are not adequate for demonstrating more stringent ADS-B NACV levels (i.e., NACV =3, or greater), but are expected to be developed as more demanding ADS-B applications mature.  The results of these tests can be used to substantiate the setting of a NACV

                                                                                                                                        
value to be used when ADS-B position and velocity are provided by the GPS 
equipment, presuming that that equipment does not have a specific velocity 
accuracy output.   

Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages.  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid nonzero velocity data to the ADS-B System.   
From an external source, input 95% accuracy figures of merit for horizontal velocity, and verify that for each horizontal velocity error value in Table 2-22 that the system generates Airborne Velocity Messages with the NACV subfield set equal to the corresponding binary coding value shown for the NACV subfield in Table 2-22.   

## 2.4.3.2.6.1.6 Verification Of "East/West Direction Bit" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.6, Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.6, Â§2.2.5.1.12) Purpose/Introduction:

The "East/West Direction Bit" subfield is contained in Message Bit 46 ("ME" Bit 14) of Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtypes "1" and "2."  This test procedure verifies that the "East/West Direction Bit" subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages is correctly set to ZERO 
(0) for inputs indicating travel in an eastward direction, and ONE (1) for travel in a westward direction. These test procedures are intended for use for Airborne Velocity Messages of Subtypes "1" and "2."  The values of the input Velocity data should be set so as to generate Airborne Velocity Messages for each Subtype value. 

Step 1: 
East/West Direction Bit Verification when Velocity is Not Available 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages with Subtype=1 by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid non-zero velocity data to the ADS-B System. Verify that when East/West Velocity Data is not provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, the "East/West Direction Bit" subfield is set to ZERO (0). 

Step 2: 
East/West Direction Bit Verification - Directional Components 
The method for testing this field depends largely upon the nature of the input for East/West Velocity Data.  

## Case 1:

If the directional component of the input is a single bit or a "flag" type (i.e., a single discrete value is used to represent "EAST," and another discrete value is used to represent "WEST"), then the procedure for this step will be as follows. 

Set the input to the value that indicates travel in an eastward direction, and check that ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19," and that all such messages contain an "East/West Direction Bit" subfield with a value of ZERO (0). 

Next, set the input to the value that indicates travel in a westward direction. Verify that ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19," and that all such messages contain an "East/West Direction Bit" subfield with a value of ONE (1). 

CASE 2: If the directional component of the input is variable (e.g., a heading expressed in degrees or other similar manner so that the input value must be evaluated by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem in order to determine the proper value for the "East/West Direction Bit"), then the test procedure will be as follows.  In this case, the input variable must be made to assume values corresponding to movement in an eastward direction. It must be verified for each such input value that Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain an "East/West Direction Bit" subfield with a value of ZERO (0). The input must then be varied to assume values corresponding to movement in a westward direction.  It must be verified for each such value that the system generates Airborne Velocity Messages with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain an "East/West Direction Bit" subfield with a value of ONE (1). 

## 2.4.3.2.6.1.7 Verification Of "East/West Velocity" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.7, Â§2.2.5.1.12) Purpose/Introduction:

The "East/West Velocity" subfield is contained in Message bits 47 - 56 ("ME" bits 15 - 24) 
of Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtypes "1" and "2."  The following test procedures verify that the "East/West Velocity" subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages is correctly set according to the coding specified. 

Step 1: 
East/West Velocity Verification - Velocity Data Not Available 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages with Subtype=1 (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid non-zero velocity data to the ADS-B System.  Discontinue East/West Velocity data. 

Verify that when East/West Velocity Data is not provided to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem, the "East/West Velocity" subfield is set to ZERO (binary 00 0000 0000). 

Step 2: 
East/West Velocity Verification - Velocity Equal ZERO 
Setup the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as in Step 1 and set the East/West Velocity input to represent a velocity of ZERO knots. Verify that the East/West Velocity subfield is set to ONE (1) (binary 00 0000 0001). 

## Step 3: East/West Velocity Verification -  Discrete Values

Verify that for each integer East/West Velocity input value in knots in Table 2- 142, that the system generates Airborne Velocity Messages with the TYPE 
Subfield equal to "19" and that the "East/West Velocity" subfield in each such message is set equal to the corresponding binary coding value in Table 2-142.

E/W Velocity = 937 knots 
11 1111 1110 
1022 
E/W Velocity = 1021 knots 

## Step 4: East/West Velocity Verification - Maximum Values

If the resolution of the input value is the same as the resolution of the "East/West Velocity" subfield in the output message (i.e., 1 knot), verify that for an input corresponding to an eastward velocity of 1022 (in knots), Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE "19" and all such messages contain an "East/West Velocity" subfield with a value of 1023 (binary 11 1111 1111).  
If the resolution of the input value is greater than the resolution of the "East/West Velocity" subfield, verify that for the input value corresponding to the largest possible eastward velocity that is less than 1021.5 knots, Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 are generated and all such messages contain an "East/West Velocity" subfield with a value of 1022 (binary 11 1111 1110). If the resolution of the input data makes it possible to enter an input value that corresponds to exactly 1021.5 knots, then this value will be input and it will be verified that the resultant "East/West Velocity" subfield output field is equal to either 1022 (binary 11 1111 1110, represents 1021 knots) or 1023 (binary 11 1111 1111, represents > 1021.5 knots). 

## Step 5: East/West Velocity Verification - Part 5

If the input data used to establish the "East/West Velocity" subfield has more resolution than that required by the "East/West Velocity" subfield (i.e., more than 
10 bits), then this step will be used to ensure that the accuracy of the data is maintained such that it is not worse than Â±Â½ LSB, where the LSB is the least significant bit of the "East/West Velocity" subfield. 

If the input data field that is used to determine the output value of the "East/West Velocity" subfield consists of 10 bits or less, proceed to Step 6. Enter an input value corresponding to an eastward velocity of 1.5 knots. Verify that the value of the "East/West Velocity" subfield in the output message is either "2" (binary 00 0000 0010, represents 1 knot) or "3" (binary 00 0000 0011, represents 2 knots). 

If the input field used to establish the "East/West Velocity" subfield has exactly 
11 bits, skip to step 6.  Otherwise (indicating that more than 11 bits are used to establish "East/West Velocity" subfield), let Z be equal to the smallest possible fraction that can be represented by the number of bits in the input field (i.e., Z is the value of the least significant bit of the input field). Set the value of the input field to correspond to an eastward velocity of (1.5 - Z).   
Verify that the value of the "East/West Velocity" subfield in the output Airborne Velocity Message is "2" (binary 00 0000 0010, represents 1 knot). Set the value of the input field to correspond to an eastward velocity of (1.5 + Z). 

Verify that the value of the "East/West Velocity" subfield in the output Airborne Velocity Message is "3" (binary 00 0000 0011, represents 2 knots). 

Note: 
If the resolution of the East/West Velocity input is such that an eastward velocity of 1.5 knots cannot be represented  (but is still greater than 1 knot, e.g., a resolution of 0.2 knot increments), then values corresponding to eastward velocity must be tested, and the output examined for each value to confirm that the output is within Â±0.5 
knots (inclusive) of the input value. 

## Step 6: East/West Velocity Verification - Part 6

Note: 
If the nature of the inputs is such that a separate bit or "flag" type field is input to the transmitter to indicate "East" or "West," the following step is not necessary.  However, if the transmitter must perform some interpretation of its inputs in order to determine the correct output value of the "East/West Direction Bit," the following step must be performed. 
Repeat Steps 3, 4 and 5 so that each step is performed with East/West Velocity input data indicating travel in both EAST and WEST directions, i.e., replace the word "eastward" with "westward" in steps 3, 4 and 5. 

## 2.4.3.2.6.1.8 Verification Of "North/South Direction Bit" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.8, Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.8, Â§2.2.5.1.13) Purpose/Introduction:

The "North/South Direction Bit" subfield is contained in Message Bit 57 ("ME" Bit 25) of Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtypes "1" and "2."  This test procedure verifies that the "North/South Direction Bit" subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages is correctly set to ZERO (0) for travel in a northward direction, and ONE (1) for travel in a southward direction. These test procedures are intended for use for Airborne Velocity Messages of Subtypes "1" and "2."  The values of the input Velocity data should be set so as to generate Airborne Velocity Messages for all appropriate Subtype fields. 

Step 1: 
North/South Direction Bit Verification - Velocity Data Not Available 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity data at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid non-zero barometric pressure altitude data and valid non-zero velocity data to the ADS-B System. 

Verify that when North/South Velocity Data is not provided to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem, the "North/South Direction Bit" subfield is set to ZERO 
(0), as specified in Â§2.2.5.1.13, item (e). 

Step 2: 
North/South Direction Bit Verification - Directional Components 
The method for testing this field depends largely upon the nature of the input for North/South Velocity Data.   

## Case 1:

If the directional component of the input is a single bit or a "flag" type (i.e., a single discrete value is used to represent "NORTH," and another discrete value is used to represent "SOUTH"), then the procedure for this step will be as follows: Set this input to the value that indicates travel in a northward direction, and check that ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19," and that all such messages contain a "North/South Direction Bit" subfield with a value of ZERO (0). Next, set the input to the value that indicates travel in a southward direction, and verify that ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19," and that all such messages contain a "North/South Direction Bit" subfield with a value of ONE (1).   
CASE 2: If the directional component of the input is variable (e.g., a heading expressed in degrees or other similar manner, so that the input value must be evaluated by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem in order to determine the proper value for the 
"North/South Direction Bit" subfield), then the test procedure will be as follows. 

In this case, the input variable must be made to assume values corresponding to movement in a northward direction, and it must be verified, for each such value, that Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain a "North/South Direction Bit" subfield with a value of ZERO (0). The input must then be made to assume values corresponding to movement in a southward direction, and it must be verified, for each such value, that the transmitter generates Airborne Velocity Messages with TYPE value "19," and that all such messages contain a "North/South Direction Bit" subfield with a value of ONE (1). 

## 2.4.3.2.6.1.9 Verification Of "North/South Velocity" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.9, Â§2.2.5.1.13) Purpose/Introduction:

The "North/South Velocity" subfield is contained in Message bits 58 - 67 ("ME" bits 26 - 35) of Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtypes "1" and "2."  This test procedure verifies that the "North/South Velocity" subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages is correctly set.  

Step 1: 
North/South Velocity Verification - Velocity Data Not Available 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system. 

Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages with Subtype=1 (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status. Provide valid non-zero velocity data to the ADS-B System. Discontinue North/South Velocity data and verify that when North/South Velocity Data is not provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, the "North/South Velocity" subfield is set to ZERO (binary 00 0000 0000). 

Step 2: 
North/South Velocity Verification - Velocity Equal ZERO 
Set up the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as above and set the North/South Velocity input to represent a velocity of ZERO knots.  Verify that the North/South Velocity subfield is set to ONE (1). 

## Step 3: North/South Velocity Verification - Discrete Values

Verify that for each integer North/South Velocity input value in knots in Table 2-
143 that the system generates Airborne Velocity Messages with the TYPE 
Subfield equal to "19" and that the "North/South Velocity" subfield in each such message is set equal to the corresponding binary coding value in Table 2-143.

938 
N/S Velocity = 937 knots 
11 1111 1110 
1022 
N/S Velocity = 1021 knots 

## Step 4: North/South Velocity Verification - Maximum Values

If the resolution of the input value is the same as the output resolution (i.e., 1 knot), verify that for an input corresponding to a northward velocity of 1022 (in knots), Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE "19" and all such messages contain a "North/South Velocity" subfield with a value of 1023 (binary 11 1111 1111). If the resolution of the input value is greater than the output resolution, verify that for input value corresponding to the largest possible northward velocity that is less than 1021.5 knots, Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 are generated and all such messages contain a "North/South Velocity" subfield with a value of 1022 
(binary 11 1111 1110). 

If the resolution of the input data makes it possible to enter an input value that corresponds to exactly 1021.5 knots, then this value will be input and it will be verified that the resultant "North/South Velocity" output field is equal to either 1022 (binary 11 1111 1110, representing 1021 knots) or 1023 (binary 11 1111 1111, representing > 1021.5 knots). 

## Step 5: North/South Velocity Verification - Part 5

If the input data used to establish the "North/South Velocity" subfield has more resolution than that required by the "North/South Velocity" subfield (i.e., more than 10 bits), then this step will be used to ensure that the accuracy of the data is maintained such that it is not worse than Â±Â½ LSB, where the LSB is the least significant bit of the "North/South Velocity" subfield.  If the input data field that is used to determine the output value of the "North/South Velocity" subfield consists of 10 bits or less, proceed to Step 6. 

Enter an input value corresponding to a northward velocity of 1.5 knots. Verify that the value of the "North/South Velocity" subfield in the output message is either "2" (binary 00 0000 0010, representing 1 knot) or "3" (binary 00 0000 0011, representing 2 knots). 

If the input field used to establish the "North/South Velocity" subfield has exactly 11 bits, skip to step 6.  Otherwise (indicating that more than 11 bits are used to establish "North/South Velocity" subfield), let Z be equal to the smallest possible fraction that can be represented by the number of bits in the input field (i.e., Z is the value of the least significant bit of the input field).  Set the value of the input field to correspond to a northward velocity of (1.5 - Z). Verify that the value of the "North/South Velocity" subfield in the output Airborne Velocity Message is "2" (binary 00 0000 0010, representing 1 knot). Set the value of the input field to correspond to a northward velocity of (1.5 + Z). Verify that the value of the "North/South Velocity" subfield in the output Airborne Velocity Message is "3" (binary 00 0000 0011, representing 2 knots). 

Note: 
If the resolution of the North/South Velocity input is such that a northward velocity of 1.5 knots cannot be represented  (but is still greater than 1 knot, e.g., a resolution of 0.2 knot increments), then values corresponding to northward velocity must be tested, and the output examined for each value to confirm that the output is within Â±0.5 
knots (inclusive) of the input value. 

## Step 6: North/South Velocity Verification - Part 6

Note: 
If the nature of the inputs is such that a separate bit or "flag" type field is input to the transmitter to indicate "North" or "South," the following step is not necessary.  However, if the transmitter must 
perform some interpretation of its inputs in order to determine the correct output value of the "North/South Direction Bit," the following step must be performed. 
Repeat Steps 3, 4 and 5 so that each step is performed with North/South Velocity input data indicating travel in both NORTH and SOUTH directions, i.e., replace the word "northward" with "southward" in steps 3, 4 and 5.

The following test verifies that this bit is correctly set according to the table contained in the above referenced section. These test procedures are intended for use for Airborne Velocity Messages of all subtypes. The type and values of the input Velocity data should be set so as to generate Airborne Velocity Messages for all appropriate Subtype fields. 

Step 1: 
Vertical Rate Source Bit Verification - Part 1 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.

Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid non-zero barometric pressure altitude data and valid non-zero velocity data to the ADS-B 
System. Verify that if the input Vertical Rate data is from Geometric Source (GNSS or INS), then the "Source Bit for Vertical Rate" subfield is set to ZERO (0). 

Step 2: 
Vertical Rate Source Bit Verification - Part 2 
Change the Vertical Rate input data so that it indicates to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem that it is from Barometric Source. 

Verify that the "Source Bit for Vertical Rate" subfield in subsequent output messages is set to ONE (1). 

## 2.4.3.2.6.1.11 Verification Of "Sign Bit For Vertical Rate" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.11, Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.11, Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.11, Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.11, Â§2.2.5.1.14) Purpose/Introduction:

The "Sign Bit for Vertical Rate" subfield is contained in Message Bit 69 ("ME" Bit 37) of Airborne Velocity Messages.  The following test verifies that this bit is correctly set to ZERO (0) to indicate an upward vertical rate vector (climb), and ONE (1) to indicate a downward vertical rate vector (descent). These test procedures are intended for use for Airborne Velocity Messages of all Subtypes. The type and values of the input Velocity data should be set so as to generate Airborne Velocity Messages for all appropriate Subtype fields. 

Step 1: 
"Sign Bit for Vertical Rate" Verification - Data Not Available 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid non-zero barometric pressure altitude data and valid non-zero velocity data to the ADS-B System. 

Verify that when Vertical Rate Data is not provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, the "Sign Bit for Vertical Rate" subfield is set to ZERO (0), as specified in Â§2.2.5.1.14, item (d).  

Step 2: 
"Sign Bit for Vertical Rate" Directional Component Verification 
The method for testing this field depends largely upon the nature of the input for "Vertical Rate" subfield Data.   

## Case 1:

If the directional component of the input is a single bit or a "flag" type (i.e., a single discrete value is used to represent "UP," and another discrete value is used to represent "DOWN"), then the procedure for this step will be as follows: Set this input to the value that indicates an upward direction, and verify that ADS- B Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19," and that all such messages contain a "Sign Bit for Vertical Rate" subfield with a value of ZERO (0). Next, set the input to the value that indicates a downward direction, and verify that ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19," and that all such messages contain a "Sign Bit for Vertical Rate" subfield with a value of ONE (1). 

## Case 2:

If the directional component of the input is variable (e.g., a heading expressed in degrees or other similar manner, so that the input value must be evaluated by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem in order to determine the proper value for the 
"Sign Bit for Vertical Rate" subfield), then the test procedure will be as follows. 

In this case, the input variable must be made to assume values corresponding to an upward climb, and it must be verified, for each such value, that Airborne Velocity Messages are generated with TYPE value "19" and that all such messages contain a "Sign Bit for Vertical Rate" subfield with a value of ZERO (0). 

The input must then be made to assume values corresponding to a descent, and it must be verified, for each such value, that the transmitter generates Airborne Velocity Messages with TYPE value "19," and that all such messages contain a "Sign Bit for Vertical Rate" subfield with a value of ONE (1).

Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid non-zero barometric pressure altitude data and valid non-zero velocity data to the ADS-B System. 

Verify that when Vertical Rate Data is not provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, the "Vertical Rate" subfield in Airborne Velocity output messages is set to ZERO (0) (binary 0 0000 0000). 

Step 2: 
"Vertical Rate" Equal To ZERO Verification

feet per minute. Verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem generates Airborne Velocity Messages with TYPE "19" and that the "Vertical Rate" subfield in each such message contains the value ONE (1) (binary 0 0000 0001). 

Step 3: 
"Vertical Rate" Verification - Discrete Values 
Increase the value of the "Vertical Rate" Data input so that it assumes each discrete decimal coding value from Table 2-144.  Verify that for each discrete decimal coding input value, the "Vertical Rate" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages of TYPE "19" matches identically the corresponding Binary Coding value from Table 2-144.

These test procedures are intended for use for Airborne Velocity Messages of all Subtypes.  The type and values of the input Velocity data should be set so as to generate Airborne Velocity Messages for all appropriate Subtype fields.   
Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
Difference from Baro Altitude Sign Bit Verification - Part 1 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Information Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid non-zero barometric pressure altitude data, valid non-zero Geometric Source data and valid non-zero velocity data to the ADS-B System.  Set the inputs so that the input Geometric Altitude Source data is greater than (above) the input Barometric Altitude. Verify that the "Difference From Barometric Altitude Sign Bit" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity output messages is set to ZERO (0).

Difference from Baro Altitude Sign Bit Verification - Part 2 
Lower the input Geometric Altitude Source data. 

Verify that as long as the input Geometric Altitude Source data is greater than the input Barometric Altitude (in feet), all transmitted Airborne Velocity Messages continue to contain a ZERO (0) in the SIGN BIT subfield. 

Verify that as soon as the input Geometric Altitude Source data becomes lower than the input Barometric Altitude, the SIGN BIT subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages is changed to a ONE (1). 

## 2.4.3.2.6.1.15 Verification Of "Difference From Barometric Altitude" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.15, Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.15, Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.15, Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.15) Purpose/Introduction:

The "Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield is used to report the difference between Geometric (GNSS or INS) Altitude Source data and Barometric Altitude when both types of Altitude Data are available and valid, and is encoded as shown in Table 2-31.  
These test procedures are intended for use for Airborne Velocity Messages of all Subtypes. The type and values of the input Velocity data should be set so as to generate Airborne Velocity Messages for all appropriate Subtype fields.   

Step 1: 
Difference from Barometric Altitude Verification - Not Available 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Information Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid non-zero barometric pressure altitude data, valid non-zero Geometric Altitude Source data and valid non-zero velocity data to the ADS-B System. Discontinue the input of Geometric Altitude Source data and verify that subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages contain a "Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield with a value of ZERO (0) (binary 000 0000).  Stop the input of Barometric Altitude data and verify that the value of this field remains ZERO (0) in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages. Begin the input of only Geometric Altitude Source data and verify that the value of this field remains ZERO (0) in subsequent messages of this type. 

## Step 2: Difference From Barometric Altitude Verification - No Differences

Re-start the input of Barometric Altitude data, and set the inputs so that the Geometric Altitude Source data input and the Barometric Altitude input both represent the exact same altitude (in feet); i.e., the difference between the two altitude values is ZERO. 

Verify that the "Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages is set to ONE (1) (binary 000 0001, representing a Difference of ZERO). 

## Step 3: Difference From Barometric Altitude Verification - Discrete Values

Adjust the value of the Barometric Altitude input data so that the set of possible inputs includes a value that represents an altitude at least 3140 feet above the chosen value and a value that represents an altitude at least 3140 feet below the chosen value.  Adjust the Geometric Altitude Source data input to represent the same altitude as that chosen for the Barometric Altitude input. Increase the value of the Geometric Altitude Source data input while keeping the Barometric Altitude constant so that the Geometric Altitude Source data difference input assumes each value from Table 2-145.  Verify that for each Altitude Source Data Difference in Table 2-145 that the system generates Airborne Velocity Messages with the "Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield in each message set equal to the corresponding binary coding value from Table 2-145.

90 
GNSS Altitude Source data Difference = 2225 feet 
111 1110 
126 
GNSS Altitude Source data Difference = 3125 feet 

Additionally verify that for every 25 feet increase in the difference between the two, the "Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages of TYPE "19" is incremented by one from the previous value (i.e., that the value of the "Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield corresponds to the decimal coding values given in Table 2-145).   
Verify that the "Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield in the output message is not incremented until the difference in the input values reaches a number corresponding to an integer multiple of 25 feet with an accuracy of Â±12.5 
feet. 

## Step 4: Difference From Barometric Altitude Verification - Part 4

Continue to increase the value of the Geometric Altitude Source Data input. Verify that, for values that are greater than 3125 feet above the Barometric Altitude, but less than or equal to 3137.5 feet above the Barometric Altitude, the 
"Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield continues to be set to "126" (binary 111 1110). Continue to increase the value of the Geometric Altitude Source data input.  
Verify, for values representing an altitude greater than 3137.5 feet above the barometric altitude, up to the maximum possible input value, that the transmitter continues to generate Airborne Velocity Messages and that the "Difference From Barometric Altitude" subfield for all such messages is set to "127" (binary 111 
1111). 

## Step 5: Difference From Barometric Altitude Verification - Part 5

Note: 
If the nature of the inputs is such that a separate bit or "flag" type field is input to the transmitter to indicate "Up" or "Down," the following step is not necessary.  However, if the transmitter must perform some interpretation of its inputs in order to determine the correct output value of the "Difference From Barometric Altitude Sign Bit," the following step must be performed. 
Repeat steps 3 through 5, but this time decreasing the value of the Geometric Altitude Source data input, rather than increasing it.

Verification of "East/West Velocity" Subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=2 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.7, Â§2.2.5.1.12) 
Purpose/Introduction: The following test procedures verify that the "East/West Velocity" subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages is correctly set according to the coding specified. Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
East/West Velocity Verification - Data Not Available 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages with Subtype="2" (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate") by providing East/West Velocity input data with a value greater than 1022 knots.  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status. Discontinue East/West Velocity data and verify that when East/West Velocity Data is not provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, the "East/West Velocity" Subfield in output Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=2 is set to ZERO (binary 00 0000 0000). 

Step 2: 
East/West Velocity Verification - Velocity Equal ZERO 
Set up the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as above and set the East/West Velocity input to represent a velocity of ZERO knots.  Verify that the "East/West Velocity" Subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=2 is set to ONE (1) (binary 00 0000 0001). 

Step 3: 
East/West Velocity Verification - Discrete Values 
Verify that for each integer East/West Velocity input value in knots identified in Table 2-146 that the system generates Airborne Velocity Messages with the 
"East/West Velocity" Subfield set equal to the corresponding binary coding value in Table 2-146.

938 
E/W Velocity = 3748 knots 
11 1111 1110 
1022 
E/W Velocity = 4084 knots 

Verify that for 4 knot increases in the input value, the "East/West Velocity" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages of TYPE "19" is incremented by one from the previous value (i.e., that the value of the "East/West Velocity" 
subfield binary values corresponds to the values given in Table 2-146). 

Verify that the "East/West Velocity" subfield in the output message is not incremented to the next higher integer value until the input velocity value reaches a number corresponding to an even multiple of 4 knots. 

## Step 4: East/West Velocity Verification - Maximum Velocity

Continue to increase the value of the East/West Velocity Data input.  Verify that, for values greater than or equal to 4084 knots but less than or equal to 4086 knots, the output "East/West Velocity" subfield continues to be set to "1022" (binary 11 1111 1110). Continue to increase the value of the East/West Velocity input.  Verify, for every input value representing an East/West Velocity greater than 4086 knots, up to the maximum possible input value, that the transmitter continues to generate Airborne Velocity Messages with a TYPE subfield equal to "19," a Subtype subfield equal to "2," and that the "East/West Velocity" subfield for all such messages is set to "1023" (binary 11 1111 1111). 

## Step 5: East/West Velocity Verification - Input Resolution

If the input data used to establish the "East/West Velocity" subfield has more resolution than that required by the "East/West Velocity" subfield, then this step will be used to ensure that the accuracy of the data is maintained such that it is not worse than Â±Â½ LSB, where the LSB is the least significant bit of the "East/West Velocity" subfield.  If the input data field that is used to determine the output value of the "East/West Velocity" subfield does not have finer resolution than that required by the "East/West Velocity" subfield, proceed to Step 6. Enter an input value corresponding to an eastward velocity of 6 knots.  Verify that the value of the "East/West Velocity" subfield in the output message is either "2" (binary 00 0000 0010, representing 4 knots) or "3" (binary 00 0000 0011, representing 8 knots).   
If the input field used to establish the "East/West Velocity" subfield does not have resolution finer than 2 knots, skip to step 6.  Otherwise (indicating that East/West Velocity input resolution is finer than 2 knots), let Z be equal to the smallest possible value that can be represented by the number of bits in the input field (i.e., Z is the value of the least significant bit of the input field). Set the value of the input field to correspond to an eastward velocity of (6 - Z).  
Verify that the value of the "East/West Velocity" subfield in the output Airborne Velocity Message is "2" (binary 00 0000 0010, representing 4 knots).   
Set the value of the input field to correspond to an eastward velocity of (6 + Z).  
Verify that the value of the "East/West Velocity" subfield in the output Airborne Velocity Message is "3" (binary 00 0000 0011, representing 8 knots).   

Note: 
If the resolution of the East/West Velocity input is such that an eastward velocity of 6 knots cannot be represented  (but is still finer than 4 knots, e.g., a resolution of 1.75 knot increments), then values corresponding to eastward velocity must be tested, and the output 
examined for each value to confirm that the output is within Â±2 knots 
(inclusive) of the input value. 

## Step 6: East/West Velocity Verification - Part 6

Note: 
If the nature of the inputs is such that a separate bit or "flag" type field is input to the transmitter to indicate "East" or "West," the following step is not necessary.  However, if the transmitter must perform some interpretation of its inputs in order to determine the correct output value of the "East/West Direction Bit," the following step must be 
performed. 
Repeat Steps 3, 4 and 5 so that each step is performed with East/West Velocity input data indicating travel in both EAST and WEST directions, i.e., replace the word "eastward" with "westward" in Steps 3, 4 and 5.

Appropriate test procedures are provided in Â§2.4.3.2.6.1.8. 

## 2.4.3.2.6.2.9 Verification Of "North/South Velocity" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=2 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.2.9, Â§2.2.5.1.13) Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure verifies that the "North/South Velocity" subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages is correctly set.  

Step 1: 
North/South Velocity Verification - Data Not Available 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing velocity information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages with Subtype=2 (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate") by providing North/South Velocity input data with a value greater than 1022 knots. 

Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status. Discontinue North/South Velocity data and verify that when North/South Velocity Data is not provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, the "North/South Velocity" 
subfield in output Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=2 is set to ZERO 
(binary 00 0000 0000). 

Step 2: 
North/South Velocity Verification - Velocity Equal ZERO 
Setup the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as above and set the North/South Velocity input to represent a velocity of ZERO knots.  Verify that the 
"North/South Velocity" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages - 
Subtype=2 is set to ONE (1) (binary 00 0000 0001). 

Step 3: 
North/South Velocity Verification - Discrete Values 
Verify that for each integer North/South Velocity input value in knots identified in Table 2-147 that the system generates Airborne Velocity Messages with the 
"North/South Velocity" subfield set equal to the corresponding binary coding value in the table.

## 

Verify that for 4 knot increases in the input value, the "North/South Velocity" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages of TYPE "19" is incremented by one from the previous value (i.e., that the value of the "North/South Velocity" 
subfield corresponds to the values given in Table 2-147). 

Verify that the "North/South Velocity" subfield in the output message is not incremented until the input value reaches a number corresponding to an even multiple of 4 knots. 

## Step 4: North/South Velocity Verification - Maximum Velocity

Continue to increase the value of the North/South Velocity Data input. 

Verify that, for discrete values greater than or equal to 4084 knots but less than or equal to 4086 knots, the "North/South Velocity" subfield continues to be set to "1022" (binary 11 1111 1110). 

Continue to increase the value of the North/South Velocity input. 

Verify that for discrete input values representing a North/South Velocity greater than 4086 knots, up to the maximum possible input value, that the transmitter continues to generate Airborne Velocity Messages with a TYPE subfield equal to "19," a Subtype subfield equal to "2," and that the "North/South Velocity" 
subfield for all such messages is set to "1023" (binary 11 1111 1111). 

## Step 5: North/South Velocity Verification - Input Resolution

If the input data used to establish the "North/South Velocity" subfield has finer resolution than that required by the "North/South Velocity" subfield, then this step will be used to ensure that the accuracy of the data is maintained such that it is not worse than Â±Â½ LSB, where the LSB is the least significant bit of the "North/South Velocity" subfield.  If the input data field that is used to determine the output value of the "North/South Velocity" subfield does not have finer resolution than that required by the "North/South Velocity" subfield, proceed to Step 6. 

Enter an input value corresponding to a northward velocity of 6 knots.  Verify that the value of the "North/South Velocity" subfield in the output message is either "2" (binary 00 0000 0010, representing 4 knots) or "3" (binary 00 0000 0011, representing 8 knots). 

If the input field used to establish the "North/South Velocity" subfield does not have resolution finer than 2 knots, skip to step 6.  Otherwise (North/South Velocity input resolution is finer than 2 knots), let Z be equal to the smallest possible value that can be represented by the number of bits in the input field (i.e., Z is the value of the least significant bit of the input field).   
Set the value of the input field to correspond to a northward velocity of (6 - Z).  
Verify that the value of the "North/South Velocity" subfield in the output Airborne Velocity Message is "2" (binary 00 0000 0010, representing 4 knots). 

Set the value of the input field to correspond to a northward velocity of (6 + Z).  
Verify that the value of the "North/South Velocity" subfield in the output Airborne Velocity Message is "3" (binary 00 0000 0011, representing 8 knots).   

Note: If the resolution of the North/South Velocity input is such that a 
northward velocity of 6 knots cannot be represented  (but is still finer than 4 knots, e.g., a resolution of 1.75 knot increments), then values corresponding to northward velocity must be tested, and the output examined for each value to confirm that the output is within Â±2 knots (inclusive) of the input value.   

## Step 6: North/South Velocity Verification - Part 6

Note: If the nature of the inputs is such that a separate bit or "flag" type field is 
input to the transmitter to indicate "North" or "South," the following step is not necessary.  However, if the transmitter must perform some interpretation of its inputs in order to determine the correct output value 
of the "North/South Direction Bit," the following step must be performed. 
Repeat Steps 3, 4 and 5 so that each step is performed with North/South Velocity input data indicating travel in both NORTH and SOUTH directions, i.e., replace the word "northward" with "southward" in Steps 3, 4 and 5.

Purpose/Introduction: This test procedure verifies that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly outputs Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtypes "3" and "4," with the "Heading Status Bit" correctly set to ONE (1) if Heading information is available, and ZERO (0) if it is not. These test procedures are intended for use for Airborne Velocity Messages of Subtypes "3" and "4."  The values of the input Velocity data should be set so as to generate Airborne Velocity Messages for all appropriate Subtype fields. 

Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
Heading Status Bit Verification - Data Available 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtypes "3" and "4" by providing airspeed and heading information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS- B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide nonzero airspeed data to the ADS-B System.  This data should indicate nonsupersonic velocity (less than 1000 knots) for testing Subtype=3 messages, and supersonic (greater than 1022 knots) for testing Subtype=4 messages.  Provide heading input data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, and verify that output Airborne Velocity Messages have Message Bit 46 ("ME" Bit 14) correctly set to ONE (1). 

Step 2: 
Heading Status Bit Verification - Data Not Available 
Discontinue the input of heading information to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Verify that subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages have Message Bit 46 ("ME" Bit 14) correctly set to ZERO (0). 

## 2.4.3.2.6.3.7 Verification Of "Heading" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=3 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.7, Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.7, Â§2.2.5.1.15)

Purpose/Introduction: This test will verify that the "Heading" subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtypes 
"3" and "4" is correctly set according to the encoding in Table 2-35.  These test procedures are intended for use for Airborne Velocity Messages of Subtypes "3" and "4."  The values of the input Velocity data should be set so as to generate Airborne Velocity Messages for all appropriate Subtype fields.   
Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
Heading Verification - Data Equal ZERO 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=3 and "4" by providing airspeed information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid, non-zero airspeed data to the ADS-B System.  This data should indicate non-supersonic airspeed (less than 1022 knots) for testing Subtype=3 messages, and supersonic airspeed (greater than 1022 knots) for testing Subtype=4 messages. Provide heading input data with a value of ZERO to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, and verify that the output "Heading" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages is set to ZERO (binary 00 0000 0000).  Also verify that the 
"Heading Status Bit" is set to ONE.  

## Step 2: Heading Verification - Discrete Values

This test will verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem properly encodes the Heading data for positive direction values. Begin increasing the input Heading data so that it assumes all values identified in Table 2-148.  Verify that the value transmitted in the "Heading" subfield of the ADS-B Airborne Velocity Messages corresponds to the binary coding of the input Heading in Table 2-148.

Note: The resolution of the raw data used as input to establish the Heading subfield may not be capable of setting values to exact multiples of 0.3515625 degrees.  Where this is the case, the input should be set to values as close to the required values as possible. 

## Step 3: Heading Verification - Incremental Checks

Note: If the resolution of the Heading input to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem is exactly equal to 0.3515625 degrees, then this step will not 
apply.  If the resolution of the Heading input to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem is greater than 0.3515625 degrees, then the Â½ LSB rule given 
in Note 2 of Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.7 will apply, and this step will be used to ensure 
that the accuracy of the data is maintained such that it is not worse than Â±Â½ LSB, where the LSB is the least significant bit of the "Heading" output subfield.  In this case, this means that the output data must be accurate to within 1/2 of 0.3515625 degrees, i.e., within 0.17578125 degrees. 
Set up the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as in Step 1.  Set the input heading to 
0.3515625 degrees, and verify that the output "Heading" subfield is set to ONE (00 0000 0001).  Increase the input value by the smallest increment possible, so that it assumes values greater than 0.3515625 degrees but less than 0.52734375 degrees. 

Verify that for any value less than 0.52734375 degrees, the output of the "Heading" subfield does not change. Increase the input value to the smallest possible value that is greater than 
0.52734375 degrees. Verify that the output "Heading" subfield in subsequent output messages is set to TWO (00 0000 0010). Decrease the input so that it is set to the largest possible value that is less than 0.52734375 degrees. Verify that the "Heading" subfield reverts to ONE (00 0000 0001). 

 

## 2.4.3.2.6.3.8 Verification Of "Airspeed Type" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=3 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.8, Â§2.2.3.2.6.4.8, Â§2.2.5.1.16, Â§2.2.5.1.17) Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure will verify that the "Airspeed Type" subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages, Subtypes "3" and "4" is correctly set to ZERO (0) to if the airspeed type is Indicated Airspeed (IAS), and to ONE (1) if the Airspeed Type is True Airspeed (TAS).  
These test procedures are intended for use for Airborne Velocity Messages of Subtypes "3" and "4."  The values of the input Velocity data should be set so as to generate Airborne Velocity Messages with the appropriate Subtype field.   

## Measurement Procedure: Step 1: Airspeed Type Verification - Indicated Airspeed

Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtypes "3" and "4" by providing airspeed and heading information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-
B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages 
(see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide nonzero airspeed and heading data to the ADS-B System.  This data should indicate non-supersonic velocity (less than 1022 knots) for testing Subtype=3 messages, and supersonic (greater than 1022 knots) for testing Subtype=4 messages. 

Provide input airspeed data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem in the form of  
"Indicated Airspeed" (IAS) data.  Verify that the output Airborne Velocity Messages have an "Airspeed Type" subfield with a value of ZERO (0). 

Step 2: 
Airspeed Type Verification - True Airspeed 
Discontinue the input of IAS data to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem and instead provide input airspeed data in the form of "True Airspeed" (TAS) data. 

Verify that subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages have an "Airspeed Type" subfield with a value of ONE (1). 

## 2.4.3.2.6.3.9 Verification Of "Airspeed" Subfield In Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=3 (Â§2.2.3.2.6.3.9, Â§2.2.5.1.16, Â§2.2.5.1.17) Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure will verify that the "Airspeed" subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtypes "3" and "4" is correctly encoded by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.   

Step 1: 
Airspeed Verification - Data Not Available 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing airspeed and heading information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=3 (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid non-zero, non-supersonic airspeed and heading data to the ADS-B System. 

Discontinue Airspeed data and verify that when Airspeed data is not provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, the "Airspeed" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=3 is set to ZERO (binary 00 0000 0000). 

Step 2: 
Airspeed Verification - Data Equal to ZERO 
Setup the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as above and set the Airspeed input to represent a velocity of ZERO knots.  Verify that the "Airspeed" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=3 is set to ONE (1) (binary 00 0000 0001). 

Step 3: 
Airspeed Verification - Discrete Values 
Verify for each integer Airspeed (expressed in knots) in Table 2-149, that the system generates Airborne Velocity Messages with TYPE "19" and subtype "3" and that the "Airspeed" subfield coding in each such message is set equal to the corresponding binary coding value in Table 2-149.

## Step 4: Airspeed Verification - Part 4

Note: If the nature of the inputs is such that a separate bit or "flag" type field is 
input to the transmitter to indicate "Indicated Airspeed" or "True Airspeed," the following step is not necessary.  However, if the transmitter must perform some interpretation of its inputs in order to 
determine the correct output value of the "Airspeed Type," the following step must be performed. 
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 so that each step is performed with Airspeed Type input data indicating both Indicated Airspeed (IAS) and True Airspeed (TAS).

Purpose/Introduction: This test will verify that the "Airspeed" subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtypes 
"3" and "4" is correctly encoded by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.   
Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
"Airspeed" Verification - Data Not Available 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Airborne Velocity Messages by providing airspeed and heading information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set up the system to enable broadcast of Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=4 (see additional information in Â§2.2.3.3.2.5, "ADS-B Velocity Message Broadcast Rate").  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status.  Provide valid non-zero airspeed and heading data to the ADS-B System. Discontinue the input of Airspeed data and verify that when Airspeed data is not provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, the "Airspeed" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=4 is set to ZERO (binary 00 
0000 0000). 

Step 2: 
"Airspeed" Verification - Data Equal to ZERO 
Setup the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as above and set the Airspeed input to represent a velocity of ZERO knots.  Verify that the "Airspeed" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=4 is set to 1. 

Step 3: 
"Airspeed" Verification - Discrete Values 
Verify for each integer "Airspeed" (expressed in knots) in Table 2-150, that the system generates Airborne Velocity Messages with TYPE "19" and subtype "4" and that the "Airspeed" subfield coding in each such message is set equal to the corresponding binary coding value in Table 2-150.

Airspeed = 4084 knots 

Verify that for 4 knot increases in the input value, that the "Airspeed" subfield in subsequent Airborne Velocity Messages of TYPE "19" is incremented by one from the previous value (i.e., that the value of the "Airspeed" subfield corresponds to the values given in Table 2-150).    
Verify that the "Airspeed" subfield in the output message is not incremented until the input value reaches a number corresponding to an even multiple of 4 knots. 

## Step 4: "Airspeed" Verification - Part 4

Continue to increase the value of the "Airspeed" Data input.  Verify that for discrete values above or equal to 4084 knots but below or equal to 4086 knots, the "Airspeed" subfield continues to be set to "1022" (binary 11 1111 1110). Continue to increase the value of the "Airspeed" input.  Verify that for discrete input values representing an "Airspeed" greater than 4086 knots, up to the maximum possible input value, that the transmitter continues to generate Airborne Velocity Messages with a TYPE subfield equal to "19" and that the "Airspeed" subfield for all such messages is set to "1023" (binary 11 1111 1111). 

Step 5: 
Airspeed Verification - Part 5 
Note: If the nature of the inputs is such that a separate bit or "flag" type field is input to the transmitter to indicate "Indicated Airspeed" or "True Airspeed," the following step is not necessary.  However, if the transmitter must perform some interpretation of its inputs in order to determine the correct output value of the "Airspeed Type", the following step must be performed. 

Repeat Steps 2, 3 and 4 so that each step is performed with Airspeed Type input data indicating both Indicated Airspeed (IAS) and True Airspeed (TAS).

## 2.4.3.2.7.1.1 Verification Of "Type" Subfield In Target State And Status Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.1) Purpose/Introduction:

These test procedures verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly outputs Target State and Status Messages with the correct TYPE subfield data content in Message bits 33 - 37 in DF=17 Messages for Transponder-Based Systems and DF=18 Messages for Non-Transponder-Based Systems.  The TYPE subfield for the Target State and Status Messages should contain the value "29." The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem determines and outputs the "TYPE" subfield based upon the input it receives from the type of Navigational System source that may interface to the system.  The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem may receive the "TYPE" subfield directly through an external interface instead of dynamically determining the "TYPE" subfield. 

Measurement Procedure: 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Target State and Status Messages by providing valid trajectory information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status. Verify that the "TYPE" subfield in the ADS-B Message correctly matches the "TYPE" 
subfield value of 29 (binary 11101).  See Table 2-14. 

## 2.4.3.2.7.1.2 Verification Of The "Subtype" Subfield In Target State And Status Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.2)

Purpose/Introduction: 
The "Subtype" subfield in the Target State and Status Message is encoded in accordance with Table 2-40.   
Measurement Procedure: Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Target State and Status Messages by providing valid trajectory information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Airborne status. 

Verify that the "TYPE" subfield in the ADS-B Message is set to a value of 29 (binary 
11101) and that the "Subtype" subfield is set to a value of ONE (binary 01). 

## 2.4.3.2.7.1.3 Verification Of The Target State And Status (Subtype=1) Format (Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.3)

Appropriate test procedures required to validate the requirements of Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.3 are included in Â§2.4.3.2.7.1.3.1 through Â§2.4.3.2.7.1.3.12.   

## 2.4.3.2.7.1.3.1 Verification Of The "Sil Supplement" Subfield In Target State And Status Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.3.1, Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.14, Â§2.2.5.1.41)

Purpose/Introduction: The "SIL Supplement" (Source Integrity Level Supplement) subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 8, Message bit 40) field that defines whether the reported SIL probability is based on a "per hour" probability or a "per sample" probability as defined in Table 2-41.  The purpose of the following test procedure is to verify that the "SIL Supplement" subfield is being set appropriately.   
Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
Target State and Status Message Initialization  
Via the appropriate interface, provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with valid Mode Control Panel Selected Altitude data in order to initialize transmission of Target State and Status Messages.   

Step 2: 
Verification of SIL Supplement for "Per Hour" Probability 
Via the appropriate data input interface, provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with valid data indicating that the integrity of the geometric position source is being established on a "Per Hour" basis.   
Note: If an actual interface is not used to provide "SIL Supplement" 
information, then ensure that a GNSS position source is being used to provide geometric positon data for the purpose of establishing position in the Airborne and Surface Position messages.  (See Â§2.2.5.1.41).   
Verify that the "SIL Supplement" subfield ("ME" bit 8, Message bit 40) in the Target State and Status Messages is set to "ZERO" (0).   

## Step 3: Verification Of Sil Supplement For "Per Sample" Probability

Via the appropriate data input interface, provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with valid data indicating that the integrity of the geometric position source is being established on a "Per Sample" basis.   
Note: If an actual interface is not used to provide "SIL Supplement" 
information, then ensure that a Non-GNSS position source is being used to provide geometric positon data for the purpose of establishing position in the Airborne and Surface Position messages.  (See Â§2.2.5.1.41).   
Verify that the "SIL Supplement" subfield ("ME" bit 8, Message bit 40) in the Target State and Status Messages is set to "ONE" (1).

The requirements for the rules of prioritizing the Event-Driven Message transmissions and limiting the transmission rates are specified in Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.6.1.  Broadcast rates for 1090 
MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B Messages are summarized in Table 2-79.   

The Measurement Procedures include the broadcast of the baseline Airborne Position, Airborne Velocity and Aircraft ID & Category Messages at their specified nominal rates 
(i.e, at combined nominal rate of 4.2 messages per second).  The Measurement Procedure would then define a specific timed sequence of 'events' that would result in the generation of a specific sequence of ADS-B Event-Driven Messages that is known to exceed the nominal broadcast limit of 2 messages per second that is allocated for Event-Driven Messages.  The intent of this procedure is to cause the development of a queue of pending ADS-B Event-Driven Messages.  In order to "load up" the Event-Driven Message queue it is suggested to use the Event-Driven Messages specified in Table 2-156.

It is necessary to inject data that would result in the Event-Driven Messages identified in Table 2-156 being generated under the following test scenario.  The test procedures consist of the following steps performed as a continuous sequence of events.  Commencing with Step 2 below, it is expected that a pending ADS-B Message queue will develop that must be managed by the ADS-B Message Scheduling Function.   

## 

Step 1:  Place the ADS-B system in a test mode in which Test Messages (i.e., TYPE=23, 
Subtype=0) are generated at a nominal rate of 2 per second. 
Verify:  

a) Test Messages (TYPE=23, Subtype=0) are broadcast (see Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.4) at a 
nominal rate of 2 per second over a 30 second test period. 
b) A nominal total broadcast rate of â¤6.2 messages per second over the 30 second 
test period as in Step 1.a above.   
 
Step 2: 
With the ADS-B still in a test mode, as defined in Step 1 in which Test Messages 
are being generated, inject Extended Squitter Status Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.8.2) 
TCAS RA Broadcast (TYPE=28, Subtype=2) data and refresh at least once per 0.5 
second with no change in data contents of the broadcast message.   

## Verify:

a) Extended Squitter Aircraft Status (Â§2.2.3.2.7.8.2) TCAS RA Broadcast

b) Test Messages (TYPE=23, Subtype=0) are broadcast (see Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.4) at a 
nominal intervals of 1.25 seconds over the same 60 second test period.    
c) A nominal total broadcast rate of 
â¤6.2 messages per second over the 60 second 
test period.    
 
Step 3: 
With the ADS-B still in a test mode, as defined in Step 2 in which Test Messages and TCAS RA Broadcast Messages are being generated, inject Extended Squitter Aircraft Status Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.8.1.1) Emergency/Priority Condition 
(TYPE=28, Subtype=1) data and refresh at least once per 0.5 seconds WITH changes in the Mode A (4096) Code data.   
Verify:  

a) Extended Squitter Aircraft Status (Â§2.2.3.2.7.8.1.1) Emergency/Priority 
Condition (TYPE=28, Subtype=1) Messages are broadcast at nominal intervals 
of 0.8 seconds (see Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1.1) over a 60 second test period.   
b) Extended Squitter Aircraft Status (Â§2.2.3.2.7.8.2) TCAS RA Broadcast 
(TYPE=28, Subtype=2) Messages are broadcast at nominal intervals of 0.8 seconds (see Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.2) over a 60 second test period.   
c) Test Messages (TYPE=23, Subtype=0) are broadcast (see Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.4) at a 
nominal intervals of 1.25 seconds over the same 60 second test period.   
d) A nominal total broadcast rate of 
â¤6.2 messages per second over the 60 second 
test period.

Stand Alone Transmitters for Class A0 and Class B0 equipment are those implemented independent of a Mode S transponder.  Such transmitters must meet the transmission rate requirements of Â§2.2.3.3.1.3 and the message update rate requirements specified in 
Â§2.2.3.3.2 and its subparagraphs.  Extended Squitter messages must be transmitted at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the specified time interval using a time quantization no greater than 15 milliseconds.

Transmitting Subsystem for a period of not less than 10 minutes. 

Note: At a maximum rate of 6.2 ADS-B Broadcast messages per second, the recording period of 10 minutes should provide approximately 3720 messages.  That is, approximately 1200 Airborne Position, 1200 Airborne Velocity, 480 Target State and Status, 240 Operational Status, 120 Aircraft Identification and Category Messages, and up to 480 other On-
Condition Messages.  This should provide a representative sample size to support the subsequent statistical evaluations.

Interval Quantization Checks 
For each of the ADS-B Airborne Position, Aircraft Identification and Category, Airborne Velocity, Target State and Status, and Operational Status Message types transmitted, verify that the messages were distributed with the jitter spacing being 15 milliseconds or less between messages of equivalent type. 

Step 5: 
Surface Condition checks (High Rate) 
Repeat Steps 1 - 4 using only ADS-B Surface Position and Aircraft Identification and Category Messages using the high transmission rate (see Â§2.2.3.3.2.3 and 
Â§2.2.3.3.2.4) for each message type.

## 2.4.3.3.2.7 Verification Of "Extended Squitter Aircraft Status" Ads-B Event-Driven Message Broadcast Rate (Â§2.2.3.3.2.7)

Purpose/Introduction: The rate at which the "Extended Squitter Aircraft Status" (TYPE=28) ADS-B Event-Driven Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.8), is being broadcast varies as defined in Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.  
Exceptions to these transmission rate requirements are specified in Â§2.2.3.3.2.9.  Broadcast rates for 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B Messages are summarized in Table 2-79.   
Equipment Required: Provide a method of loading valid data for ADS-B broadcast messages into the ADS-B 
equipment under test.  Provide a method of detecting the RF pulses of the ADS-B Broadcast Message for display on an oscilloscope. 

Step 1: 
Verification of "Emergency/Priority Status Message" Broadcast Rates 
Appropriate procedures for the verification of Emergency/Priority Status Message Broadcast Rates were previously provided for Transponder Based ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsytems in Â§2.4.3.3.1.4.3.1.  Those procedures should also be used for verification of Emergency/Priority Status Message Broadcast Rates for Non-Transponder Based ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems. 

Step 2: 
Verification of "Emergency/Priority Status Message" Broadcast Rates with 
Mutual Suppression (Â§2.2.3.3.2.9) 
Perform Â§2.4.3.3.1.4.3.1 Step 5 such that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is broadcasting Extender Squitter Aircraft Status Emergency/Priority Status Messages at intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds. If the Mutual Suppression Interface is provided, force the Mutual Suppression condition at a time, and for a duration, which insures that the next expected ADS-
B Extended Squitter Aircraft Status Message will be delayed, and verify that the ADS-B Extended Squitter Aircraft Status Emergency/Priority Status Message is delayed. Remove the Mutual Suppression condition, and verify that ADS-B Extended Squitter Aircraft Status Emergency/Priority Status Messages resume at a intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds. 

Step 3: 
Verification of "TCAS RA Broadcast Message" Broadcast Rates 
Appropriate procedures for the verification of TCAS RA Broadcast Message Broadcast Rates were previously provided for Transponder Based ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsytems in Â§2.4.3.2.7.8.2.  It is not expected that those procedures are applicable to Non-Transponder Based ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems since such subsystems are normally not coupled with TCAS.  However, if such an installation is implemented, then the procedures of Â§2.4.3.2.7.8.2 should also be used for verification of TCAS RA Broadcast Message Broadcast Rates for Non-
Transponder Based ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems. 

Step 4: 
Verification of "TCAS RA Broadcast Message" Broadcast Rates with Mutual 
Suppression (Â§2.2.3.3.2.9) 
It is not expected that Non-Transponder Based ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems will be transmitting TCAS RA Broadcast Messages since they are not coupled with TCAS.  However, if such an installation is implemented, then the procedure detailed in the following paragraphs should be used for verification of TCAS RA Broadcast Message Broadcast Rates for Non-Transponder Based ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystems. 

Perform Â§2.4.3.2.7.8.2 Step 1 such that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is broadcasting Extender Squitter Aircraft Status TCAS RA Broadcast Messages at intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds. 

If the Mutual Suppression Interface is provided, force the Mutual Suppression condition at a time, and for a duration, which insures that the next expected ADS- B Extended Squitter Aircraft Status TCAS RA Broadcast Message will be delayed, and verify that the ADS-B Extended Squitter Aircraft Status TCAS RA Broadcast Message is delayed. 

Remove the Mutual Suppression condition, and verify that ADS-B Extended Squitter Aircraft Status TCAS RA Broadcast Messages resume at a intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds.

MORE Than ONCE each time the Event-Driven Test Information is updated to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem.  The delay conditions specified in Â§2.2.3.3.2.9 are to be observed.   
Equipment Required: Provide a method of loading valid data for ADS-B broadcast messages into the ADS-B 
equipment under test.  Provide a method of detecting the RF pulses of the ADS-B Broadcast Message for display on an oscilloscope.

## 2.4.3.3.2.9 Verification Of Ads-B Message Transmission Scheduling (Â§2.2.3.3.2.9) Purpose/Introduction:

An ADS-B Message scheduling function is used to determine the sequence of ADS-B 
Messages to be broadcast and to control the overall transmission rate of Event-Driven messages.  As an exception to the general requirement for the transmission of ADS-B 
Messages, the scheduled message transmission is delayed if a Mutual Suppression interface is active.

equipment under test.  Provide a method of detecting the RF pulses of the ADS-B Broadcast Message for display on an oscilloscope.

If a Mutual Suppression Interface is provided, force a Mutual Suppression condition such that the next expected ADS-B Aircraft Status Message will be delayed, and verify that the delay occurs. Remove the Mutual Suppression condition, and verify that ADS-B Aircraft Status Messages resume at a spacing uniformly distributed over the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds.

The ADS-B receiver power levels specified in this procedure are relative to the loss at the RF message source end of the transmission line used to interface the RF message source to the UUT receiver input port.  For each ADS-B equipage class, the specified power level shall be adjusted to compensate for the maximum line loss for which the UUT receiver has been designed.  For example, if the line loss is 3 dB, then each of the RF message power levels specified in the test procedures **shall** be lowered by 3 dB. 

Step 1: 
Apply ADS-B Input Messages 
Apply **Input** at the receiver input port. 

Step 2: 
Establish UUT Receiver MTL 
Decrease the input power level and determine the minimum RF signal level required to produce 90 percent ADS-B Message reception rate by the UUT 
receiver. This value plus the loss line value represents the measured MTL of the UUT ADS-B receiver. 

Step 3: 
Verify UUT Receiver Dynamic Range 
Increase the input signal power level to MTL + 3 dB. Verify that the receiver properly detects and decodes at least 99% of all ADS-B 
Messages received. 

Increase the input signal power level in 10 dB steps up to a signal level of 0 dBm. 

At each step, verify that the receiver properly detects and decodes at least 99% of all ADS-B Messages received. 

Step 4: 
Verify Class A3 UUT Receiver Performance 
Decrease the input signal power level to â87 dBm.  Verify that the receiver properly detects and decodes at least 15% of all ADS-B Messages input. 

Step 5: 
Repeat on all Applicable Receiver Input Ports 
Repeat Steps 1 through 4 on all other applicable receiver RF input ports of the UUT.

## 2.4.4.3.4.7.1 Verification Of Criteria For Ads-B Message Transmission Pulse Detection (Â§2.2.4.3.4.7.1 And Â§2.2.4.3.4.7.2)

Purpose/Introduction: 
These test procedures verify that the ADS-B reply processor correctly detects the presence of a valid ADS-B preamble whose pulse characteristics are within the allowable limits and rejects preambles having pulse spacing and position characteristics that are outside the allowable limits.   
Note: This test procedure is only applicable to A0 equipment that does not use the enhanced reception techniques.  Equipage Classes A1S, A1, A2 and A3 are required to use enhanced reception techniques, so this test procedure does not apply to them.  
The enhanced preamble detection requirements for this equipment are tested in 
Â§2.4.4.4.2.2.

## 2.4.4.3.5 Verification Of Ads-B Receiver Duty Factor (Â§2.2.4.3.5) Purpose/Introduction:

Available ADS-B receiver duty factor (i.e., the percentage of time that the ADS-B Message Reception function is able to receive and process ADS-B Messages at the required ADS-B MTL), when the receiver is shared with another receiving function using the 960-1215 MHz band, is an important consideration in meeting the intended ranges of operation for ADS-B 
equipment.  The available ADS-B receiver duty factor must be 90 percent or greater, as specified in Â§2.2.4.3.5, averaged over a 10 second period.  As an exception, if the available ADS-B receiver duty factor is less than 90 percent, techniques for achieving equivalent performance may be proposed and substantiated by the following analysis procedure.   

## Analysis Procedure:

Note that due to the many types of configurations and techniques that may be implemented in the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem, verification of the Receiver Duty Factor is to be done by analysis.  As such, this procedure does not provide a direct test procedure. 

This analysis **shall** take into consideration all effects presented to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem for an interference environment equivalent to the LA2020 traffic scenario used in Appendix P. 

## Step 1: Identify Functions That Degrade Receiver Availability

 
The first step of the analysis is for the ADS-B Receiver manufacturer to specifically identify all functions that may preclude the use of the ADS-B 
Receiver to properly receive ADS-B Messages.  Examples of such functions are 
provided (but not limited to) as follows: a. Receiver Self-Test 
b. Antenna Self-Test 
c. Receiver being used for other than ADS-B Receiving Subsystems 
d. Antenna being used for other than ADS-B Receiving Subsystems 
e. Receiver being suppressed by other in-band systems, i.e., Mode-S 
Transponder, TCAS, DME, JTIDS, etc. 
f. Antenna operating in other than omni-directional mode. 
For each function that may preclude the use of the ADS-B Receiver to properly receive ADS-B Messages, the analysis **shall** establish the probability of the Receiver not being available to process ADS-B Messages. 

Step 2: 
Establish the Improvements Environment for the Analysis 
 
The Receiver manufacturer **shall** specifically identify all functions that may 
improve the capability of the ADS-B Receiver to receive ADS-B Messages at the 
MTL levels specified in Â§2.2.4.3.1.1, Table 2-81.  Examples of such functions are 
provided (but not limited to) as follows: a. Improved antenna gain b. Improved Receiver gain (i.e., lower MTL capability) 
c. Improved message or signal processing techniques 
d. Improved Error Correction techniques 
For each function that improves the capability of the ADS-B Receiver to receive ADS-B Messages, the analysis **shall** establish the message decode probability that improvement will realize in the effective Receiver availability at the MTL levels specified in Â§2.2.4.3.1.1, Table 2-81. 

Step 3: 
Establish the Equivalent Receiver Performance 
From the analysis performed in step 1 and 2 demonstrate that equivalent receiver performance is sufficient to meet the required equipage class range performance. Demonstrate that [Receiver Availability (step 1) plus (+) Reception Improvements (step 2)] is not less than 90% of the total time when averaged over a processing time of 10 seconds. 

## 2.4.4.4 Verification Of Enhanced Squitter Reception Techniques (Â§2.2.4.4)

No specific test procedures are required to validate Â§2.2.4.4. 

## 2.4.4.4.1 Verification Of The Need For Enhanced Squitter Reception Techniques (Â§2.2.4.4.1)

No specific test procedures are required to validate Â§2.2.4.4.1. 

## 2.4.4.4.2 Verification For The Enhanced Squitter Reception Technique Overview (Â§2.2.4.4.2) Purpose/Introduction:

Enhanced squitter reception techniques have been developed (see Appendix I) that provide the ability to receive squitters with multiple overlapping Mode A/C FRUIT.  Class A1S, A1, A2 and A3 equipment must demonstrate compliance with test procedures specified in 
Â§2.4.4.4.2.1 through Â§2.4.4.4.3.   
Note: The full set of enhanced techniques are applicable to Class A2 and A3 receiving 

## 2.4.4.4.2.1 Test Equipment Requirements

Note: This section defines the tests that are conducted to evaluate the performance of the 
improved preamble and enhanced squitter reception techniques of the equipment under test. 
The tests consist of injecting special waveforms to test the limits of preamble detection.  The tests then proceed to inject a known Mode S Extended Squitter waveform at a nominal power level with a defined FRUIT overlap scenario to test the reception of the Extended Squitter data block.  These tests are followed by a test scenario where Mode S FRUIT precedes a nominal Mode S Extended Squitter waveform to measure the re-triggering capability.  Finally, a test is conducted to verify that the sliding window error correction technique is not used. 

The success criteria for the tests require the monitoring of the Mode S Extended Squitter data content.  This data must be available for test monitoring.  Report level monitoring is not adequate. 

In the following tests, the parameter T defines the number of trials that are to be executed.  
Unless otherwise indicated, T equals 1000. 

## 2.4.4.4.2.1.1 Mode A/C Fruit Signal Source Requirements

Five RF sources **shall** be provided that are capable of generating Mode A/C 14-pulse replies.  Each FRUIT source **shall** be capable of the following: The waveform **shall** consist of framing pulses and an average of five data pulses.  The data content of the FRUIT reply **shall** be pseudo randomly varied each time a FRUIT reply is generated.  The data pulses **shall** be uniformly pseudo randomly distributed across the 12 
data bit positions (the X pulse position shall not be used). 

Each FRUIT source **shall** be able to generate Mode A/C replies at received power levels ranging from â80 to â58 dBm as required within plus or minus 1 dB. 

The FRUIT sources should be able to sustain a repetition rate of at least 100 replies per second. 

The signals for each of the FRUIT sources **shall** be non-coherent with any of the other FRUIT sources and the Extended Squitter signal source (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1.3). 

The leading edge of the P1 pulse of the Extended Squitter waveform **shall** be defined as t=0. The timing of the generation of the beginning of the F1 pulse of each FRUIT reply **shall** be controllable to be uniformly pseudo randomly distributed over the interval -20 to +100 microseconds (Combined Extended Squitter preamble and data block with Mode A/C FRUIT test). The pseudo random timing of the generation of FRUIT replies from each FRUIT source shall be independent of the timing of the other FRUIT sources. 

## 2.4.4.4.2.1.2 Mode S Fruit Signal Source Requirements

One RF source **shall** be provided that is capable of generating a Mode S 112-bit transmission as follows:  
The content of the 112-bit Mode S transmission **shall** consist of a valid DF code (16, 17, 18, 
20, 21, or 24), an 83-bit field that is set pseudo randomly for each transmission, and a 24-bit PI field appropriate for the content of this transmission. If an Extended Squitter message type is used (DF=17 or 18) the test equipment **shall** be capable of distinguishing the reception of the desired Extended Squitter from that of the Mode S FRUIT. 

The Mode S FRUIT source should be able to sustain a squitter rate of at least 100 squitters per second. 

The Mode S FRUIT source **shall** be capable of generating a signal power equal to 12 dB 
above the minimum MTL required for the equipment class being tested within plus or minus 1 dB with no more than 1 dB droop. 

The signal for the Mode S FRUIT source **shall** be non-coherent with the Extended Squitter signal source (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1.3). 

The leading edge of the P1 pulse of the Extended Squitter waveform **shall** be defined as t=0.  
The timing of the generation of the beginning of the P1 pulse of the Mode S FRUIT 
waveform **shall** be controllable to be uniformly pseudo randomly distributed over a defined interval or fixed as required by the test procedure.  The following define the timing of the Mode S FRUIT source relative to the Extended Squitter waveform: 
+8 to +90 microseconds (Data Block Tests with Mode S Fruit) -112 to â6 microseconds (Re-triggering Tests with Varying Position Mode S Fruit) -6 microseconds (Re-triggering Tests with Fixed Position Mode S Fruit) 

## 2.4.4.4.2.1.3 Extended Squitter Signal Source Requirements

One RF source **shall** be provided that is capable of generating a 112-bit Extended Squitter transmissions with no more than 1 dB droop as follows:  
The Extended Squitter power level **shall** be adjustable ranging from 0 dBm to â84 dBm within plus or minus 1 dB as required by the test procedures. The Extended Squitter signal source should be able to sustain a squitter rate of at least 100 squitters per second. 

Unless otherwise required, the contents of the Extended Squitter transmission **shall** consist of the five-bit DF field set to 17, an 83-bit field that is set pseudo randomly for each Extended Squitter transmission except for "ME" Field bits 1 to 5 (the Format TYPE Code) which may be set to a fixed value, and a 24-bit PI field appropriate for the content of this transmission. 

Note: The Four-Pulse Preamble Detection tests and the Preamble Validation Tests do not 
require pseudo-random message content, all other test procedures do. 
Provision **shall** be made to record the contents of each Extended Squitter transmission.    
Note: This information is required to check for undetected errors. 

The Extended Squitter signal source **shall** have the capability to selectively control the width and/or position of individual preamble pulses with at least 25 nanosecond resolution. 

The Extended Squitter signal source **shall** also provide the capability of individually omitting preamble pulses or any of the first 5 data pulses from the transmission. 

## 2.4.4.4.2.2 Four-Pulse Preamble Detection Tests Purpose/Introduction:

These tests verify that the ADS-B reply processor correctly detects the presence of a valid ADS-B preamble whose pulse characteristics are within the allowable limits and rejects preambles having pulse spacing and position characteristics that are outside the allowable limits.   

## Reference Input:

Provide a method of supplying the UUT with: 

Any Valid ADS-B Message having: 
"DF" 
= 
17 
"AA" 
= 
Any discrete address 
Message Rate 
= 
50 Hz 
Frequency 
= 
1090 MHz 
Power 
= 
-23 dBm (for the first preamble pulse level)

2. Input H sets up a preamble where only P2 and P3 provide actual leading edges within the allowable position 
limits, while P1 and P4 have pulse positions provided by the extended P1 and P3 pulses.  Pulse positions and leading edges are located at nominal positions.  This test input verifies that the UUT accepts a preamble with the minimum 2 actual leading edges using P2 and P3.  The test procedure requires that the UUT accepts this input at a rate of at least 90%. 
3. Input K sets up a preamble where only P1 and P2 have actual leading edges, while P3 and P4 will have pulse 
positions provided by the extended P2 pulse.  The P2 leading edge position is offset by -0.2 microseconds.  This test input step verifies that the UUT uses a maximum Â± 0.1 sample pulse leading edge position tolerance using P1 and P2.  This is a negative test procedure and requires that the UUT accepts this input at a rate of 10% or less. 
4. Input L sets up a preamble where only P1 and P2 have actual leading edges, while P3 and P4 will have pulse 
positions provided by the extended P2 pulse.  The P2 leading edge position is offset by +0.2 microseconds.

microseconds respectively.  This is a negative test procedure and requires that the UUT accepts this input at a

position is offset by -0.3 microseconds and width is offset by +0.3 microseconds. The P3 width is offset by +1.0 
microsecond to replace the missing P4 pulse.  This places the P1 and P4 actual leading edges out of detection range but provides pulse positions at nominal positions.  This focuses the actual leading edge detection on P2 and P3 whose leading edges are offset by +0.125 microseconds and -0.125 microseconds respectively.  This is a 
negative test procedure and requires that the UUT accepts this input at a rate of 10% or less. 
15. Input W verifies that the UUT requires all 4 preamble pulses to be present.  This test step will be repeated 3 times 
with each preamble pulse taking a turn as the missing pulse.  This is a negative test procedure and requires that the UUT accepts this input at a rate of 10% or less.   
The ADS-B receiver power levels specified in this procedure are relative to the loss at the RF message source end of the transmission line used to interface the RF message source to the UUT receiver input port.

## 2.4.4.4.2.3 Preamble Validation Tests Purpose/Introduction:

These tests verify that the ADS-B reply processor correctly validates the ADS-B preamble. It is verified that when energy with an amplitude within 6 dB of the preamble reference level is contained in at least one chip of the first five data bits, the preamble is accepted, and the preamble is rejected if one or more of the first five data bits has insufficient energy in either chip.   

## Reference Input:

Provide a method of supplying the UUT with: 

Any Valid ADS-B Message having: 
"DF" 
= 
17 (or 18 as indicated in the test procedures) 
"AA" 
= 
Any discrete address 
Message Rate 
= 
50 Hz 
Frequency 
= 
1090 MHz 
Power 
= 
-23 dBm 

 The transmitted power in the first six data bits is controlled in such a way that the amplitude of a data bit can be set independently of the others.   

The ADS-B receiver power levels specified in this procedure are relative to the loss at the RF message source end of the transmission line used to interface the RF message source to the UUT receiver input port.  For each ADS-B equipage class, the specified power level is adjusted to compensate for the maximum line loss for which the UUT receiver has been designed.  For example, if the line loss is 3 dB, then each of the RF message power levels specified in the test procedures is lowered by 3 dB. For this test to be valid the receiver must perform error correction. 

Step 1: 
Preamble Validation - Missing First Data Bit - Part 1 
Input the **Reference Input** DF=17 messages with the amplitude of the first data bit set to â30 dB into the receiver, and verify that less than 10 percent of the ADS-
B Messages are correctly decoded.

Repeat Step 3 with the signal power level at -65 dBm and the second bit at â72 
dBm. 

Step 5: 
Preamble Validation - Missing Third Data Bit - Part 1

Step 6:

dBm. 

Step 7:

â72 dBm. 

Step 9:

Step 10: Preamble Validation - Missing Fourth and Fifth Data Bit - Part 2

B Messages are correctly decoded.   

Step 12: Preamble Validation - Missing Sixth Data Bit - Part 2 
Repeat Step 11 with the signal power level at -65 dBm. 

## 2.4.4.4.2.4 Combined Preamble And Data Block Tests With Mode A/C Fruit Purpose/Introduction:

The following tests measure the performance of the equipment under test in decoding the Extended Squitter preamble and data block overlapped with Mode A/C FRUIT.  The test series begins with monitoring the reception performance in the absence of interference to establish that the equipment under test is operating correctly. Next, a series of tests are conducted with the number of Mode A/C FRUIT overlaps set to one to five respectively for A2 and A3 equipment class.  For A1S and A1 equipment class, the tests are limited to a maximum of three Mode A/C FRUIT overlaps.  For each test, the timing of the overlapping FRUIT is uniformly pseudo randomly distributed across the preamble and data block for seven different relative power levels.  The FRUIT power levels will be set according to the test step being conducted and will remain constant while each of the seven Extended Squitter power levels are tested.  T samples (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1) are taken at each power level.  Squitters that are declared to be correctly received (i.e., received without errors or successfully error corrected) are compared to the known content of the Extended Squitter transmission.  Any difference between the content of the decoded Extended Squitter and the known content of the injected squitter is recorded as an undetected error and that squitter reception is removed from the count of successfully received squitters. 

The observed probability of correct squitter reception for each relative power level is computed.  An average value of the performance across all power levels is computed and compared to the required performance to determine success or failure for the test. 

## Step 1:  Verification Of Operation Of Equipment Under Test

Connect the Extended Squitter signal source and set the power level at the receiver input equal to the MTL limit required for the UUT equipment class: 

 â79 dBm for A1S and A1 equipment class or, 
 â79 dBm for A2 equipment class or, â84 dBm for A3 equipment class. 
Note: The power levels given above are specified at the antenna connector and not at the receiver unit-under-test connector. 

Inject the Extended Squitter signal T times (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1) and record the Extended Squitters that are declared to be output as error free.  Compare the decoded content of each Extended Squitter with the known content of the injected Extended Squitter.  Any differences that are detected are recorded as an undetected error and that squitter reception is deleted from the count of error free receptions. Calculate the measured probability of correct receptions and the number of undetected errors.  The test is passed if the probability of correct receptions is at least 90% and there is no more than one undetected error event. 

If this test is successful, proceed to Step 2. Otherwise, the test setup and equipment under test should be checked and Step 1 is repeated. 

## Step 2: Test With One Mode A/C Fruit Overlap

Set the Extended Squitter signal source as specified in Step 1. Set the power level of one Mode A/C FRUIT source at the receiver input to the value corresponding to the UUT equipment class: 
 â67 dBm for A1S, A1 or A2 equipment class or,  
 â72 dBm for A3 equipment class. 

Note: The power levels given above are specified at the antenna connector and not at the receiver unit-under-test connector. 

Activate the Mode A/C FRUIT source so that the FRUIT is pseudo randomly distributed across the Extended Squitter preamble and data block as specified in Â§2.4.4.4.2.1.   
Inject the Extended Squitter waveform T times (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1) and record the receptions that are declared to be error free.  Check for undetected errors and adjust as necessary the number of correctly received replies as specified in Step 1. Calculate the measured probability of correct reception and the number of undetected errors. 

Repeat the above step six times while increasing the Extended Squitter power level by 4 dB with each iteration. Calculate the average probability of reception and the total number of undetected errors across the seven power levels.   

## Step 3: Test With Two Mode A/C Fruit Overlaps

Repeat Step 2 with two FRUIT overlaps set to the following power levels and record the results: 
â69 and â65 dBm for A1S, A1 or A2 equipment class or, 
â74 and â70 dBm for A3 equipment class. 

Note: The power levels given above are specified at the antenna connector and not at the receiver unit-under-test connector. 

Step 4: 
Test with Three Mode A/C Fruit Overlaps 
Repeat Step 2 with three FRUIT overlaps set to the following power levels and record the results:

## 2.4.4.4.2.5 Data Block Tests With Mode S Fruit Purpose/Introduction:

The following tests measure the performance of the equipment under test in decoding the Extended Squitter data content overlapped with Mode S FRUIT.  The test series begins with monitoring the reception performance in the absence of interference to establish that the equipment under test is operating correctly. Next, a test is conducted with a single Mode S FRUIT overlap. For this test, the timing of the overlapping FRUIT is uniformly pseudo randomly distributed across the data block for four different relative power levels.  T samples (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1) are taken at each power level.  
Squitters that are declared to be correctly received (i.e., received without errors or successfully error corrected) are compared to the known content of the Extended Squitter transmission.  Any difference between the content of the decoded Extended Squitter and the known content of the injected squitter is recorded as an undetected error and that squitter reception is removed from the count of successfully received squitters. Finally, the observed probability of correct squitter reception for each relative power level is computed.   

## Step 1:  Verification Of Operation Of Equipment Under Test

Connect the Extended Squitter signal source. Set and verify that the power level at the receiver input is equal to the MTL limit required for the UUT equipment class plus 12 dB: 
 â67 dBm for A1S, A1 or A2 equipment class or, 

 â72 dBm for A3 equipment class. 
Note: The power levels given above are specified at the antenna connector and not at the receiver unit-under-test connector. 

Inject the signal T times (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1) and record the Extended Squitters that are declared to be output as error free.  Compare the decoded content of each Extended Squitter with the known content of the injected Extended Squitter.  Any differences that are detected are recorded as an undetected error and that squitter reception is deleted from the count of error free receptions. Calculate the measured probability of correct receptions and the number of undetected errors.  The test is passed if the probability of correct receptions is at least 95% and there is no more than one undetected error event. If this test is successful, proceed to Step 2.  Otherwise, the test setup and equipment under test should be checked and Step 1 is repeated. 

## Step 2:   Test With One Mode S Fruit Overlap

Set the Extended Squitter signal source as specified in Step 1. Activate the Mode S FRUIT source so that the Mode S FRUIT is pseudo randomly distributed across the data Extended Squitter data block as specified in Â§2.4.4.4.2.1.2. Set the Extended Squitter power to 0 dB relative to the Mode S FRUIT signal level.   
Inject the Extended Squitter waveform T times (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1) and record the receptions that are declared to be error free.  Check for undetected errors and adjust as necessary the number of correctly received replies as specified in Step 1.  
Calculate the measured probability of correct reception and the number of undetected errors. Repeat the above step for relative powers of signal to interference (S/I) of +4, +8, and +12 dB. Calculate the probability of correct reception and the number of undetected errors for each of the four power levels.

## 2.4.4.4.2.6 Re-Triggering Performance Purpose/Introduction:

The following tests measure the capability of the equipment under test to detect Extended Squitters that are preceded by lower level Mode S FRUIT.  The test series begins with monitoring the reception performance in the absence of interference to establish that the equipment under test is operating correctly. Next, a test is conducted with a single Mode S FRUIT overlap with a varying position.  For this test, the timing of the overlapping FRUIT is uniformly pseudo randomly distributed across the time interval beginning at â112 microseconds and ending at â6 microseconds relative to the leading edge of the P1 preamble pulse of the Extended Squitter. Finally, a test is conducted with a single Mode S FRUIT overlap with a fixed position.  For this test, the timing of the overlapping FRUIT is fixed at â6 microseconds relative to the leading edge of the P1 preamble pulse of the Extended Squitter. 

The re-triggering performance tests are conducted at three different relative power levels.  T 
samples (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1) are taken at each power level.  Squitters that are declared to have been correctly received (i.e., received without errors or successfully error corrected) are compared to the known content of the Extended Squitter transmission.  Any difference between the content of the decoded Extended Squitter and the known content of the injected squitter is recorded as an undetected error and that squitter reception is removed from the count of successfully received squitters.  The observed probability of correct squitter reception for each relative power level is computed.   

## Step 1: Verification Of Operation Of Equipment Under Test

Connect the Extended Squitter signal source.  Set and verify that the power level at the receiver input is equal to the MTL limit required for the UUT equipment class plus 12 dB: 
 â67 dBm for A1S, A1 or A2 equipment class or, 
 â72 dBm for A3 equipment class. 

Note: The power levels given above are specified at the antenna connector and not at the receiver unit-under-test connector. 

Inject the signal T times (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1) and record the Extended Squitters that are declared to be output as error free.  Compare the decoded content of each Extended Squitter with the known content of the injected Extended Squitter.  Any differences that are detected are recorded as an undetected error and that squitter reception is deleted from the count of error free receptions. Calculate the measured probability of correct receptions and the number of undetected errors.  The test is passed if the probability of correct receptions is at least 95% and there is no more than one undetected error event. If this test is successful, proceed to Step 2.  Otherwise, the test setup and equipment under test should be checked and Step 1 is repeated. 

## Step 2: Re-Triggering Test With Varying Position Mode S Fruit

Connect the Mode S Fruit signal source. Set and verify that the power level at the receiver input is equal to the MTL limit required for the UUT equipment class plus 12 dB: 
 â67 dBm for A1S, A1 or A2 equipment class or, 
 â72 dBm for A3 equipment class. 

Note: The power levels given above are specified at the antenna connector and not at the receiver unit-under-test connector. 

Set the Extended Squitter power to +4 dB relative to the Mode S FRUIT signal level. Activate the Mode S FRUIT source so that the 112-bit Mode S FRUIT signal is uniformly randomly distributed across the time interval beginning at â112 
microseconds and ending at â6 microseconds relative to the signal.  The time indicated is the spacing between the P1 pulse of the signal and the P1 pulse of the FRUIT, where negative values indicate that the FRUIT is received earlier. 

Inject the Extended Squitter waveform T times (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1) and record the receptions that are declared to be error free.  Check for undetected errors and adjust as necessary the number of correctly received replies as specified in Step 1.  
Calculate the measured probability of correct reception and the number of undetected errors. Repeat the above step for relative powers of Signal to Interference (S/I) of +8, and 
+12 dB. Calculate the probability of correct reception and the number of undetected errors for each of the three power levels. Compare the results recorded above with the appropriate requirements in Table 2-
174, Table 2-175 or Table 2-176.

## Step 3:   Re-Triggering Test With Fixed Position Mode S Fruit

Connect the Mode S Fruit signal source.  Set and verify that the power level at the receiver input is equal to the MTL limit required for the UUT equipment class plus 12 dB: 

 â67 dBm for A1S, A1 or A2 equipment class or, 
 â72 dBm for A3 equipment class. 
Note: The power levels given above are specified at the antenna connector and not at the receiver unit-under-test connector. 

Set the Extended Squitter power to +4 dB relative to the Mode S FRUIT signal level. 

Activate the Mode S FRUIT source so that the 112-bit Mode S FRUIT signal has a fixed time 6 microseconds earlier than the signal.  The 6-microsecond time is the spacing between the P1 pulse of the Mode S FRUIT and the P1 pulse of the signal. 

Inject the Extended Squitter waveform T times (Â§2.4.4.4.2.1) and record the receptions that are declared to be error free.  Check for undetected errors and adjust as necessary the number of correctly received replies as specified in Step 1. Calculate the measured probability of correct reception and the number of undetected errors. Repeat the above step for relative powers of Signal to Interference (S/I) of +8, and +12 dB. Calculate the probability of correct reception and the number of undetected errors for each of the three power levels. Compare the results recorded above with the appropriate requirements in Table 2-

## 2.4.4.4.3 Verification Of Error Correction (Â§2.2.4.4.3) 2.4.4.4.3.1 Verification Of Error Correction Requirements (Â§2.2.4.4.3.1)

Purpose/Introduction: ADS-B Receiving Subsystems either:  

a. use "conservative" and "brute force" error correction techniques as defined in Â§I.4.3, or b. use alternative error correction techniques that are demonstrated to provide no more 
than 1 x (10-6
) report error rate. 
Measurement Procedures: 
An analysis of the hardware/software design may be performed showing that conservative and brute force error correction techniques have been used, or that the alternative techniques meet the required undetected report error rate. 

## 2.4.4.4.3.2 Verification Of Error Correction Restrictions (Â§2.2.4.4.3.2)

Purpose/Introduction: This test verifies that the sliding window error correction technique, which is used in TCAS, is not being used in the unit under test.  In lieu of this test procedure, an analysis of the hardware/software design may be performed showing that a sliding window error correction technique is not used. To carry out this test, it is necessary to introduce several low-confidence flags (see Figure 2- 42) for which the corresponding information bit is incorrect in some case and in other cases low-confidence flags for which the corresponding bit is correct.  Introducing such errors and flags may be done in different ways for different receiver designs.  Given that the implementation specifics for enhanced reception are not rigidly standardized (whereas the reception performance is standardized), the specific means for introducing the bit errors and flags is implementation dependent. 

## Figure 2-42: Bit Error And Low Confidence Flags Equipment Required:

Provide a method of supplying the unit under test with any valid ADS-B Message having: 

| "DF"         | =    | 17                   |
|--------------|------|----------------------|
| "AA"         | =    | Any discrete address |
| Message Rate | =    | 1 Hz                 |
| Frequency    | =    | 1090 MHz             |
| Power        | =    | -50 dBm              |

Also provide an interference generator that can generate multiple interference pulses, in order to introduce bit errors and low confidence flags. 

Step 1: 
Verification of Operation of Equipment Under Test 
Apply tha ADS-B Input Message without interference.  Verify that there is at least 99% correct reception. 

Step 2: 
Test with Low Confidence Flags 
Add interfering pulses in a way that introduces six (6) low-confidence flags within a 24-microsecond window and three (3) additional low-confidence flags away from the 24-microsecond window.  The 24-microsecond window begins with the first low-confidence flag.  For the six affected bits in 24-microseconds, one is to have a bit error, and the other five are to have correct bit declaration.  For the three bits away from the 24-microsecond window, all three are to have correct bit declaration.  Verify that the message is not accepted under this condition.

Verify that the system generates ADS-B Aircraft Status Messages with Subtype=2 with the appropriate subfields set equal to the corresponding binary coding values that are specified from the transponder according to ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, Â§4.3.8.4.2.2. Set the RA Termination flag in the transponder to ONE (1), and verify that the ADS-B System continues to transmit Aircraft Status Messages with Subtype=2 for not less than 10 seconds.  Verify that 10 seconds after the RA Termination flag transitions from ZERO (0) to ONE (1) that the ADS-B System terminates broadcast of the Aircraft Status Messages with Subtype "2." 

## 2.4.5.3 Verification Of Ads-B Transmission Device Source Selection (Â§2.2.5.3) Purpose/Introduction:

This test procedure verifies that the source selection logic chooses the best source based on the quality of the available integrity.  It also verifies that all horizontal position, velocity, and quality metrics are used from a single selected source.  Â§2.4.3.2.3.1 tests that all possible quality metrics can be encoded so that is not repeated here.  This procedure is written assuming that two position sources are available to the ADS-B transmitter.  If more than two sources are available in an installation, this test should be expanded to encompass the available sources.   

Step 1: 
Select Source with Smallest Radius of Containment, Airborne 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as Airborne.  Provide position information on Interface A with: Latitude=35.0 North, Longitude=90.0 West, N/S Velocity=100 Knots North, E/W Velocity=100 Knots East, Horizontal Accuracy=35 meters, Horizontal Integrity=80 meters, SIL=3. Provide position information on Interface B with: Latitude=23.0 South, Longitude=70.0 East, N/S Velocity=50 Knots South, E/W Velocity=50 Knots West, Horizontal Accuracy=20 meters, Horizontal Integrity=190 meters, SIL=3. Verify that the transmitted Airborne Position Message, Airborne Velocity Message, and Operational Status Message fields are populated with data from Interface A.  Specifically the decoded Latitude=35.0 North, the decoded Longitude=90.0 West, N/S Velocity=100 Knots North, E/W Velocity=100 Knots East, NACP
=8, Airborne Position Type Code=11, NIC Supplement-A=0, NIC 
Supplement-B = 0, and SIL=3.   

Step 2: 
Switch Sources when Integrity of the Alternate Source is Consistently Better, 
Airborne 
Change the Horizontal Integrity on Interface B to 60 meters.  Wait for the source selection logic to re-evaluate the selection criteria.   
Verify that the transmitted Airborne Position Message, Airborne Velocity Message, and Operational Status Message fields are populated with data from Interface B. Specifically the decoded Latitude=23.0 South, the decoded Longitude=70.0 East, N/S Velocity=50 Knots South, E/W Velocity=50 Knots West, NACP
=9, Airborne Position Type Code=11, NIC Supplement A=1, NIC 
Supplement-B = 1, and SIL=3.   

Step 3: 
Select Source with Smallest Radius of Containment, Surface 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsytem as On-Ground.  Provide position information as in Step 1.  If heading is available to the system, invalidate it so the system reverts to using Track Angle. Verify that the transmitted Surface Position Message and Operational Status Message fields are populated with data from Interface A.  Specifically, the decoded Latitude=35.0 North, the decoded Longitude=90.0 West, Ground Track=45 Degrees, NACP
=8, Surface Position Type Code=7, NIC Supplement-
A=0, NIC Supplement-C = 0, and SIL=3.   

Step 4: 
Switch Sources when Integrity of the Alternate Source is Consistently Better, 
Surface 
Change the Horizontal Integrity on Interface B to 60 meters.  Wait for the source selection logic to re-evaluate the selection criteria.   
Verify that the transmitted Surface Position Message and Operational Status Message fields are populated with data from Interface B.  Specifically the decoded Latitude=23.0 South, the decoded Longitude=70.0 East, Ground Track=225 
Degrees, NACP
 =9, Surface Position Type Code=7, NIC Supplement-A=1, NIC 
Supplement-C = 0, and SIL=3.

Verify that the ADS-B Receiver DOES NOT generate Output Messages for all of the downlink formats received with the exception of DF=17 and DF=18.   
 
Verify that the ADS-B Receiver delivers appropriate Output Messages to the user interface or to the Report Assembly function for each DF=17 and DF=18 message received and that the Output Message formats are consistent with the requirements of Â§2.2.6.1.1 (for ADS-B) and Â§2.2.17.2 (for TIS-B).  
Step 2: 
ADS-B and TIS-B Message Reception (Â§2.2.6.1, Â§2.2.6.1.1, Â§2.2.17.2)

## 2.4.7.1.1 Verification Of The Receipt Of Type Code Equal To Zero (Â§2.2.7.1.1) Purpose/Introduction:

An ADS-B Message containing TYPE Code ZERO can only be used to update the altitude data of an aircraft that is already being tracked by the entity receiving the altitude data in TYPE Code ZERO ADS-B Message. 

If an ADS-B Message with TYPE Code equal to ZERO is received, it should be checked to see if altitude data is present and then process the altitude data as follows: 

a. If altitude data is not present, the message is discarded. 
b. If altitude data is present, it may be used to update altitude as needed. 
Appropriate test procedures to validate the requirements of this section are provided in Â§2.4.10.4.1.3.

2.4.8.1.1 
Verification of the State Vector Report Type and Structure Identification and Validity Flags (Â§2.2.8.1.1) 
No specific test procedure is required to validate Â§2.2.8.1.1. 

 

## 2.4.8.1.1.1 Verification Of The State Vector Report Type And Structure Identification (Â§2.2.8.1.1.1) Purpose/Introduction:

The Report Type is used to identify the type of ADS-B Report being generated by the report generation function and being provided to the User Application.  The Report Type formats and maximum number of bytes to be contained in each report are identified in Table 2-84.  
The Report Structure field is used to indicate the exact data parameters identified in Table 2-
83 that are being provided in the State Vector Report and is intended to provide a methodology for the report processor to structure shorter reports when data for some parameters, or groups of parameters, are not available.  The basic conventions for providing shorter reports are provided in Â§2.2.8.1.1.1.   

For each case in Table 2-181 below, execute Step 1 followed by Step 2 with the input simulating ADS-B Messages conforming to RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102, as specified in Appendix N, and referenced as "Version Zero (0)" Messages.  Repeat each case with the input simulating ADS-B Messages conforming to RTCA DO-260A and referenced as "Version One (1)" Messages.  Repeat each case again with the input simulating ADS-B 
Messages conforming to these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A) and referenced as "Version Two (2)" Messages.  With Version Zero, Version One and Version Two Message receptions, only ADS-B Reports conformant to these MOPS should be generated with the ADS-B Version Number correctly reported for the individual Participant.   
Step 1: 
Verification of Report Structure Bit Function (Â§2.2.8.1.1.1.a-c) 
Generate a Test Message Type (column 1), which includes the encoded data representing any valid case of the corresponding Parameter Datum (column 2), command the ADS-B Receiver/Report Assembly to output State Vector Reports of Type 0001, and set to "ONE" the corresponding Structure Coding Bit (column 3). Verify that the Structure Coding Bit, and the Validity Flag Bit (if specified in column 4), for the corresponding Parameter Datum, are "ONEs." Verify that the Binary Decoded Parameter Datum appears in its proper position in the Report (column 5), and in the proper binary format as specified in Table 2-83 
(Â§2.2.8.1). 

Step 2: 
Verification of Report Structure Bit Function (Â§2.2.8.1.1.1.a-c) 
Repeat Step 1 while implementing the following changes: Set the Structure Coding Bit, and the Validity Flag, to "ZERO." 
Verify that the Structure Coding Bit, and the Validity Flag Bit, are both "ZEROs." 
Verify that the Binary Decoded Parameter Datum no longer appears in the Report.

Appropriate test procedures required to validate the requirements of Â§2.2.8.1.4 are included in the following subparagraphs. 

## 2.4.8.1.4.1 Verification Of The Time Of Applicability For Estimated Position/Velocity (Â§2.2.8.1.4.1) Purpose/Introduction:

The Time of Applicability for the estimated position and velocity is generated under the conditions specified in Â§2.2.8.1.4.1.   

Step 1: 
Verification of (TOA) for Estimated Position and Velocity Reporting â Position 
Updates 
Within a ten (10) second period, generate a series of **"even"** and **"odd"** Airborne Position Messages having a stable TYPE code which include encoded data ("ME" bits 23 - 39 for Latitude, and bits 40 - 56 for Longitude) for both valid Latitude and valid Longitude based on any convenient starting position and any valid velocity.  Verify that the Report Assembly Function outputs a State Vector Report with the Time of Applicability for Position and Velocity Subfields updated to reflect the data in the most recently received Airborne Position Message. Update the State Vector Report as specified in Â§2.2.8.1.17 and Â§2.2.8.1.18 and, in each case, verify that the Time of Applicability for Estimated Position and Velocity presence bit, bit 3 of byte 0 (Table 2-85), is set to ONE (1), that the Horizontal Position Validity Flag, bit 7 of byte 3 (Table 2-86), is set to ONE (1), that the Airborne Horizontal Velocity Validity Flag, bit 5 of byte 3, is set to ONE (1), and that the corresponding Estimated Time of Applicability for Position and Velocity Subfield reflects these updates in the next output State Vector Report. 

Repeat this step with the Time of Applicability for Estimated Position and Velocity presence bit, bit 3 of byte 0, set to ONE (1), the Horizontal Position Validity Flag, bit 7 of byte 3, set to ONE (1), and the Airborne Horizontal Velocity Validity Flag, bit 5 of byte 3, set to ZERO (0).

Verify that the Estimated Time of Applicability for Position and Velocity Subfield is set to ALL ZEROs in the next output State Vector Report. 

## Step 2: Verification Of (Toa) For Estimated Position And Velocity Reporting â Velocity Updates

Within a ten (10) second period, generate a series of **"even"** and **"odd"** Airborne Position Messages having a stable TYPE code which include encoded data ("ME" bits 23 - 39 for Latitude, and bits 40 - 56 for Longitude) for both valid Latitude and valid Longitude based on any convenient starting position and any valid velocity.  Verify that the Report Assembly Function outputs a State Vector Report with the Time of Applicability for Position and Velocity Subfields updated to reflect the data in the most recently received Airborne Position Message. Update the State Vector Report as specified in Â§2.2.8.1.19 and Â§2.2.8.1.20 and, in each case, verify that the Time of Applicability for Estimated Position and Velocity presence bit, bit 3 of byte 0, is set to One (1), that the Horizontal Position Validity Flag, bit 7 of byte 3, is set to One (1), that the Airborne Horizontal Velocity Validity Flag, bit 5 of byte 3, is set to ONE (1), and that the corresponding Estimated Time of Applicability for Position and Velocity Subfield reflects these updates in the next output State Vector Report. Repeat this step with the Time of Applicability for Estimated Position and Velocity presence bit, bit 3 of byte 0, set to ONE (1), the Horizontal Position Validity Flag, bit 7 of byte 3, set to ONE (1), and the Airborne Horizontal Velocity Validity Flag, bit 5 of byte 3, set to ZERO (0).  Verify that the Estimated Time of Applicability for Position and Velocity Subfield is set to ALL ZEROs in the next output State Vector Report. 

Repeat this step with the Time of Applicability for Estimated Position and Velocity presence bit, bit 3 of byte 0, set to ONE (1), the Horizontal Position Validity Flag, bit 7 of byte 3, set to ZERO (0), and the Airborne Horizontal Velocity Validity Flag, bit 5 of byte 3, set to ONE (1).  Verify that the Estimated Time of Applicability for Position and Velocity Subfield is set to ALL ZEROs in the next output State Vector Report. 

Step 3: 
Verification of (TOA) for Estimated Position (resulting from received Surface 
Position Messages) Reporting 
Within a ten (10) second period, generate a series of **"even"** and **"odd"** Surface Position Messages having a stable TYPE code which include encoded data ("ME" bits 23 - 39 for Latitude, and bits 40 - 56 for Longitude) for both valid Latitude and valid Longitude based on any convenient starting position, and which include encoded data ("ME" bits 6 - 12) for a Ground Speed (Movement) of 2 knots 
(forces "High" rate of two Surface Position Messages per second). Verify that the Report Assembly Function outputs a State Vector Report with the Report Mode set to TWO (binary xxxx 0010) within 500 milliseconds of receipt of the second Surface Position Message of the **"even"** and **"odd"** pair for the given Surface Participant. 

Update the State Vector Report as specified in Â§2.2.8.1.17, Â§2.2.8.1.18, 
Â§2.2.8.1.19 and Â§2.2.8.1.20 and, in each case, verify that the corresponding Position Time of Applicability bit (Report Byte #2, Bit 1), and the Latitude and Longitude Validity Flag (Report Byte #4, Bit 7), are both set to "ONE."

## 2.4.8.1.4.2 Verification Of The Position Time Of Applicability (Â§2.2.8.1.4.2)

Appropriate test procedures required to validate the requirements of Â§2.2.8.1.4.2 are included in the following subparagraphs.    

## 2.4.8.1.4.2.1 Verification Of Position Time Of Applicability When "Time" (T)=0 (Â§2.2.8.1.4.2.1) Purpose/Introduction:

These test procedures verify that each time an Airborne or Surface Position Message is received with valid Latitude *AND* Longitude data and "TIME" (T)=0, the Report Assembly Function updates the Position Time of Applicability data in the State Vector Report with the Time of Message Receipt of the position message expressed as either the GPS/GNSS UTC 
Measure Time data (see Â§2.2.8.5.1) or the Established Receiver Unit Time (see Â§2.2.8.5.2).  
Time of Applicability is rounded to the nearest LSB of the Position Time of Applicability field.   

## Equipment Required:

The unit under test must be capable of receiving messages and producing State Vector Reports.  A stimulus capable of forming and transmitting compliant 1090ES Messages at specific times and an apparatus for analyzing State Vector Report contents are required.   

Step 1: 
Position Time of Applicability for Airborne Position Messages When "TIME" 
(T)=0 
Generate a series of Airborne Position Messages per Table 2-182 which have a stable TYPE Code and include encoded data ("ME" bits 23 - 39 for Latitude, and bits 40 - 56 for Longitude) for both valid Latitude and valid Longitude based on any convenient starting position.  The latitude and longitude in each message **shall** 
be unique among the latitudes and longitudes used in the set of messages. Ensure that the unit under test does not have a track file for the target address used in the Airborne Position Messages.  Inject the Airborne Position Messages into the unit under test at the times shown in the "Receiver Input Time" column of Table 
2-182.  Verify that the difference in Position TOA between State Vector Reports matches the value in the "TOA Difference Between Reports" column of Table 2-
182 rounded to the nearest LSB.  Verify that the Latitude and Longitude in each State Vector Report matches the CPR Coordinate Latitude and Longitude of the CPR Coordinates used in each Airborne Position Message.   

Note: The CPR Coordinate Latitude is determined with the Locally 
       Unambiguous CPR Decoding procedure in Â§A.1.7.5 using the latitudes 
       and longitudes that were CPR encoded into the Airborne Position 
       Messages.

## Step 2: Position Time Of Applicability For Surface Position Messages When "Time" (T)=0

Repeat Step 1 using Surface Position Messages.  Verify that the difference in Position TOA between State Vector Reports matches the value in the "TOA 
Difference Between Reports" column of Table 2-182 rounded to the nearest LSB.  
Verify that the Latitude and Longitude in each State Vector Report matches the CPR Coordinate Latitude and Longitude of the CPR Coordinates used in each Surface Position Message.   

Note: The CPR Coordinate Latitude is determined with the Locally 
       Unambiguous CPR Decoding procedure in Â§A.1.7.6 using the latitudes 
       and longitudes that were CPR encoded into the Surface Position 
       Messages.    

## 2.4.8.1.4.2.2 Verification Of Position Time Of Applicability When "Time" (T)=1 And Utc Time Of Message Receipt Is Available (Â§2.2.8.1.4.2.2) Purpose/Introduction:

These test procedures verify that each time an Airborne or Surface Position Message is received with "TIME" (T)="1" and valid Latitude AND Longitude data, and when a valid UTC Time of Message Receipt is available per Â§2.2.8.5.1, the Report Assembly Function updates the Position Time of Applicability data in the State Vector Report with the appropriate 0.2 second UTC epoch.   

## Equipment Required:

The unit under test must be provided with a UTC time reference, and must be capable of receiving messages and producing State Vector Reports.  A stimulus capable of forming and transmitting compliant 1090ES Messages at specific UTC times and a UTC time reference for this stimulus are required.  An apparatus for capturing State Vector Reports and analyzing their contents is also required.   

Step 1: 
Position Time of Applicability for Airborne Position Messages When "TIME" 
(T)=1 and UTC Time of Message Receipt is Available 
Generate a series of Airborne Position Messages per Table 2-183 which have a stable TYPE Code and include encoded data ("ME" bits 23 - 39 for Latitude, and bits 40 - 56 for Longitude) for both valid Latitude and valid Longitude based on any convenient starting position.  The latitude and longitude in each message **shall** 
be unique among the latitudes and longitudes used in the set of messages. Ensure that the unit under test does not have a track file for the target address used in the Airborne Position Messages.  Inject the Airborne Position Messages into the unit under test at the times shown in the "Receiver Input Time" column of Table 
2-183.  Verify that the Position TOA in the State Vector Reports matches the value in the "Expected Position TOA" column of Table 2-183 rounded to the nearest LSB.  Verify that the Latitude and Longitude in each State Vector Report matches the CPR Coordinate Latitude and Longitude of the CPR Coordinates used in each Airborne Position Message.   

Note: The CPR Coordinate Latitude is determined with the Locally 
       Unambiguous CPR Decoding procedure in Â§A.1.7.5 using the latitudes

2.4.8.1.4.2.3 
Verification of Position Time of Applicability when "TIME" (T) = "1" and UTC Time of Message Receipt is NOT available (Â§2.2.8.1.4.2.3) 
The requirement in Â§2.2.8.1.4.2.3 is verified using the test procedure specified in 
Â§2.4.8.1.4.2.1.   

 
2.4.8.1.4.3 
Verification of the Velocity Time of Applicability (Â§2.2.8.1.4.3) 

## Purpose/Introduction:

These test procdures verify that each time an Airborne Velocity Message - Subtype=1 or 
"2" is received with valid East/West AND North/South Velocity data, the Report Assembly Function updates the Velocity Time of Applicability data in the State Vector Report with either the GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time data (see Â§2.2.8.5.1) or the Established Receiver Unit Time (see Â§2.2.8.5.2), whichever is applicable to the Receiving device Report Assembly Function installation requirements.   
These test procedures also verify that each time a Surface Position Message is received with valid Movement AND Heading/Ground Track data, the Report Assembly Function updates the Velocity Time of Applicability data in the State Vector Report with either the GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time data (see Â§2.2.8.5.1) or the Established Receiver Unit Time 
(see Â§2.2.8.5.2), whichever is applicable to the Receiving device Report Assembly Function installation requirements.  

Step 1: 
Velocity Time of Applicability Updating and Reporting (resulting from received 
Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtype=1) Reporting  
Repeat Step 1 of Â§2.2.8.1.4.2 and verify that the Report Assembly Function outputs a State Vector Report with the Report Mode set to ONE (binary xxxx 
0001).  Generate an Airborne Velocity Message (TYPE=19, Subtype=1), which includes encoded data ("ME" bits 14 - 24 for E/W Velocity, and "ME" bits 25 - 35 
for N/S Velocity) based on any convenient valid velocity.  Verify that the Report Assembly Function outputs a State Vector Report with the Report Mode set to TWO (binary xxxx 0010) within 500 milliseconds of the receipt of the Airborne Velocity Message. Verify that the corresponding Velocity Time of Applicability presence bit (Report Byte #2, Bit 0), and the N/S & E/W Velocity Validity Flag (Report Byte #4, Bit 5), are set to "ONEs."  Verify that the Velocity Time of Applicability presence bit, bit 1 of byte 2, is set to ONE (1). 

Verify that the reported Binary Decoded Velocity Time of Applicability datum 
(Report Bytes # 42 - 43) changes by less than 500 ms between reports.  Table 2-
184 below shows an example of a possible time progression from a series of reports. 

Repeat this step with the Velocity Time of Applicability presence bit, bit 1 of byte 2, set to ONE (1) and the N/S & E/W Validity Flag, bit 5 of byte 3, set to ZERO (0).  Verify that the Velocity Time of Applicability Subfield is set to ALL ZEROs in the next output State Vector Report.

Step 2: 
Velocity Time of Applicability Updating and Reporting (resulting from received 
Surface Position Messages) 
Repeat Step 2 of Â§2.2.8.1.4.2 and verify that the Report Assembly Function outputs a State Vector Report with the Report Mode set to TWO (binary xxxx 
0010).  Generate a series of "**even**" and "odd" Surface Position Messages having a stable TYPE code, which include encoded data ("ME" bits 6 - 12) for a Ground Speed (Movement) of 2 knots (forces "High" rate of two Surface Position Messages per second), which include a Heading/Ground Track Status ("ME" bit 
13) of "ONE," and which include encoded data ("ME" bits 14 - 20) for any convenient Heading/Ground Track. Verify that the corresponding Velocity Time of Applicability presence bit (Report Byte #2, Bit 0), Ground Speed validity flag (Report Byte #4, Bit 0), and Heading/Ground Track validity flag (Report Byte #5, Bit 7), are set to "ONEs." Verify that the Velocity Time of Applicability presence bit, bit 1 of byte 2, is set to ONE (1). Verify that the reported Binary Decoded Velocity Time of Applicability datum changes by less than 500 ms between reports.  Table 2-184 above shows an example of a possible time progression from a series of reports. Repeat this step with the Velocity Time of Applicability presence bit, bit 1 of byte 2, set to ONE (1) and the N/S & E/W Validity Flag, bit 5 of byte 3, set to ZERO (0).  Verify that the Velocity Time of Applicability Subfield is set to ALL ZEROs in the next output State Vector Report. 

## 2.4.8.1.5 Verification Of Latitude (Wgs-84) Reporting (Â§2.2.8.1.5) Purpose/Introduction:

These test procedures verify that the ADS-B Report Assembly Function decodes the Encoded Latitude data (Â§2.2.3.2.3.7 and/or Â§2.2.3.2.4.7) provided in the ADS-B broadcast.  
Decoding of the encoded latitude data is performed in accordance with Â§A.1.7.4 through 
Â§A.1.7.8.4 of Appendix A.  Latitude data is provided to the user application in the State Vector report in angular weighted binary format (M bit = 90 degrees, S bit = negative, or 
180 degrees) as specified in Table 2-83. 

When valid encoded latitude data is not available, the latitude data provided to the user application is set to ALL ZEROs, and the Horizontal Position Validity Flag bit, i.e., bit #7 (MSB) of byte #3 of the State Vector Report, is set to ZERO (0) to indicate that the reported Horizontal Position data is not valid.  Otherwise, the Horizontal Position Validity Flag bit, i.e., bit #7 (MSB) of byte #3 of the State Vector Report, is set to ONE (1), unless modified by other conditions.   

Step 1: 
Latitude (WGS-84) Decoding 
For each case in Table 2-186 below, generate valid Airborne Position Messages that include the encoded data ("ME" bits 23 - 39) for the Decimal Latitude value listed, and verify that the ADS-B Receiver/Report Assembly outputs State Vector Report of Type 0001. Verify that the corresponding Latitude presence bit (Report Byte #0, Bit 0), and the Horizontal Position Validity flag (Report Byte #3, Bit 7), are "ONEs." 
Verify that the reported Binary Decoded (WGS-84) Latitude datum match the corresponding value in Table 2-186.

Step 2: 
Vertical Rate Data Not Available (Â§2.2.8.1.15.b) 
Keep the Vertical Rate presence bit at "ONE," and set the Vertical Rate Validity Flag to "ZERO."  Verify that the reported Binary Decoded Vertical Rate datum is set to "ALL ZEROs." 

## 2.4.8.1.16 Verification Of The Navigation Integrity Code (Nic) (Â§2.2.8.1.16) Purpose/Introduction:

These test procedures verify that the ADS-B Report Assembly Function extracts "TYPE" 
Code data (Â§2.2.3.2.3.1) and the NIC Supplement-B value (Â§2.2.3.2.3.3) from the ADS-B Airborne Position Message, or the "TYPE" Code data (Â§2.2.3.2.4.1) from the ADS-B Surface Position Message, and the NIC Supplement-A (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6) and NIC Supplement-C (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.3.10) values from the ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Message, and provides Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) information to the user application in the State Vector Report as specified in Table 2-83.  Definition of the NIC 
coding is provided in Table 2-69. 

Step 1: 
Verification of (NIC) on Receipt of ADS-B Messages â Version Zero (0) 
Set up to simulate reception of Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages by inputting data directly to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem.  Table 2-200 shows how a Version One or above ADS-B Receiving Subsystem **shall** interpret the NUCP 
Codes that it receives from a Version Zero ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  
Using Table 2-200 input the TYPE Code values found in each row of the table and verify that the corresponding NIC value in that row is reflected in the next output State Vector Report.  Repeat this procedure for each row in the table.

Note: Table 2-200 specifies that Surface Position Messages with a TYPE Code of 8 should be interpreted by Version Two (i.e., RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A 
compliant) Receiving Subsystems as specifying that NIC, NACP and SIL should all be ZERO (0).  This is because the information in the message is insufficient to indicate the value of either the RC
 Integrity Containment Radius, or the HFOM 95% 
Horizontal Accuracy Bound.   
 

Step 2: 
Verification of (NIC) on Receipt of ADS-B Messages â Version One (1) 
Set up to simulate Version One (1) ADS-B Messages by inputting data directly to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem being sure to first input an Aircraft Operational Status Message indicating Version One.  Using Table N-11 input the TYPE Code and NIC Supplement-A values found in each row of the table and verify that the corresponding NIC value is reflected in the next output State Vector Report. Repeat this procedure for each row in Table N-11 for both Airborne and Surface Position Messages. 

Step 3: 
Verification of (NIC) on Receipt of ADS-B Messages ï­ Version Two (2) 
Set up to simulate Version Two (2) ADS-B Messages by inputting data directly to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem being sure to first input an Aircraft Operational Status Message indicating Version Two.  Using Table 2-69 input the TYPE Code and NIC Supplement-A, NIC Supplement-B and NIC Supplement-C values found in each row of the table and verify that the corresponding NIC value is reflected in the next output State Vector Report.  Repeat this procedure for each row in Table 
2-69 for both Airborne and Surface Position Messages. 

## 2.4.8.1.17 Verification Of Estimated Latitude (Wgs-84) Reporting (Â§2.2.8.1.17) Purpose/Introduction:

These test procedures verify the proper reporting of Estimated Latitude as specified in Â§2.2.8.1.17.   

Step 1: 
Estimated Latitude (WGS-84) Updating and Reporting (resulting from received 
Airborne or Surface Position Message) (Â§2.2.8.1.17.a(1)) 
For each case in Table 2-202, generate valid Airborne Position Messages, which include the encoded data ("ME" Bits 23 - 39) for the Decimal Latitude value listed, and verify that the ADS-B Receiver/Report Assembly outputs State Vector Reports of Type 0001. 

Verify that the corresponding Estimated Latitude presence bit (Report Byte #1, Bit 0), and the Estimated Latitude Validity Flag (Report Byte #4, Bit 7), are "ONEs." Verify that the reported Binary Decoded Estimated Latitude (WGS-84) (Report Bytes # 44 - 46) data, match the corresponding value in Table 2-202.

## 2.4.8.2.1.1 Verification Of Mode Status Report Type And Structure Identification (Â§2.2.8.2.1.1) Purpose/Introduction:

The Report Type requirements are provided in Â§2.2.8.1.1.

These test procedures verify the correct encoding of the Report Structure (Mode Status Report bits 5 - 24).   

## Equipment:

Provide a method of supplying the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem with valid ADS-B 
Messages. 

Step 1: 
Incapability of Concatenation: 
If the Report Assembly Function is implemented such that the Mode Status Report may be shortened when certain data is not available, skip to Step 2. 

If the Report Assembly Function is implemented such that the Mode Status Report is 36 bytes long regardless of data availability across fields, consecutively provide the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem with valid ADS-B Messages, varying message types appropriately to prompt output of Mode Status Reports.  Ensure that in each valid ADS-B Message provided to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem, that the 
"AA" field (Message bits 9 - 32) is set to hexadecimal A60DBE.  Verify that in every Mode Status Report provided to the application, bytes 4 through 6 are hexadecimal A60DBE.  Verify that the 24-bit Report Structure field is set to ALL ONEs in every Mode Status Report provided to the application.  Verify that the Mode Status Report is 36 bytes long.

This test procedure is to verify the Validity Flags for data provided in the Target State Report as indicated in bytes #3 and #4 of the Target State Report shown for item "0c" in Table 2-99. Measurement Procedures: 

Step 1: 
Initialization 
Provide valid Airborne Position and Velocity Messages to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem such that the ADS-B Report Assembly Function enters the Track State (see Â§2.2.10.4) and is outputting Target State Reports to the Report Buffer. 

Step 2:

## 2.4.8.3.1.5 Verification Of The Target State Report - Time Of Applicability (Â§2.2.8.3.1.5) Purpose/Introduction:

Each time that an Individual Target State Report is updated, the Report Assembly Function updates the Report Time of Applicability data in the Target State Report with either the GPS / GNSS UTC Measure Time data (see Â§2.2.8.5.1) or the Established Receiver Unit Time 
(see Â§2.2.8.5.2), whichever is applicable to the Receiving device Report Assembly Function installation requirements.   

## Equipment:

The test equipment for this procedure depends on whether the ADS-B receiver under test is meant for Precision Installations or Non-Precision Installations (see Â§2.2.8.5).  For Precision systems, the equipment will need to have the ability to provide GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time Data via the appropriate interface.  For Non-Precision systems, the equipment will include a clock that is appropriately synchronized with the internal clock of the ADS-B 
Receiving Subsystem.  In both cases, the equipment **shall** have the capability to mark the time when a Target State Report is provided to the output buffer. A method of providing valid ADS-B Messages that are used for constructing Target State Reports.  Also, provide a method of providing valid Position and Velocity Messages to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem. In all messages provided to the ADS-B receiver, regardless of type, the "AA" field (Message bits 9 - 32) will be set to the same discrete address.  The requirement that the "AA" fields be identical is to ensure that the outputted Target State Reports are related solely to this test procedure. 

Step 1: 
Initialization 
Provide valid ADS-B Position and Velocity Messages to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem such that the ADS-B Report Assembly Function enters the Track State (see Â§2.2.10.4) and is outputting Target State Reports to the Report Buffer. 

Step 2: 
Verification of Report Time of Applicability  
Provide any valid Target State and Status Message.  After one second, provide a valid ADS-B Velocity Message to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem such that the ADS-B Report Assembly Function is prompted to output a Target State Report to the Report Buffer. Mark the timeâvia GPS/GNSS UTC for Precision Installations, or the test clock for Non-Precision Installations.  Retrieve the resulting Target State Report from the Report Buffer.  Calculate the time represented in the "Report Time of Applicability" (Report bytes 16 through 17 in the full Target State Report) and verify that this time is within 5 ms of the previously marked time. Repeat the process continuously for at least 550 seconds. 

## 2.4.8.3.1.6 Verification Of Selected Altitude: Selected Altitude Type (Â§2.2.8.3.1.6) Purpose/Introduction:

Step 3: 
Verification of Selected Altitude: FMS 
Provide a valid Target State and Status Message to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem indicating the data source as FMS, i.e., "ME" bit 9 in the Target State and Status Message is set to ONE.  Verify that the corresponding Target State Report indicates an FMS source.

## 2.4.8.3.2.4 Verification Of The Report Time Of Applicability (Â§2.2.8.3.2.4) Purpose/Introduction:

Report Time of Applicability data is provided in the Air Referenced Velocity report in binary format as specified in Table 
2-100. 

## Equipment:

The test equipment for this procedure depends on whether the ADS-B receiver under test is meant for Precision Installations or Non-Precision Installations (see Â§2.2.8.5).  For Precision systems, the equipment will need to have the ability to provide GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time Data via the appropriate interface.  For Non-Precision systems, the equipment will include a clock that is appropriately synchronized with the internal clock of the ADS-B 
Receiving Subsystem.  In both cases, the equipment **shall** have the capability to mark the time when a Target State Report is provided to the output buffer. A method of providing valid ADS-B Messages that are used for constructing Target State Reports.  Also, provide a method of providing valid Position and Velocity Messages to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem. In all messages provided to the ADS-B receiver, regardless of type, the "AA" field (Message bits 9 - 32) will be set to the same discrete address.  The requirement that the "AA" fields be identical is to ensure that the outputted Target State Reports are related solely to this test procedure. 

Step 1: 
Initialization 
Provide valid ADS-B Position and Velocity Messages to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem such that the ADS-B Report Assembly Function enters the Track State (see Â§2.2.10.4) and is outputting ARV Reports to the Report Buffer. 

Step 2: 
Verification of Report Time of Applicability  
Provide any valid Target State and Status Message.  After one second, provide a valid ADS-B Velocity Message to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem such that the ADS-B Report Assembly Function is prompted to output an ARV Report to the Report Buffer. Mark the timeâvia GPS/GNSS UTC for Precision Installations, or the test clock for Non-Precision Installations.  Retrieve the resulting ARV Report from the Report Buffer.  Calculate the time represented in the "Report Time of Applicability" (Report bytes 7 and 8 in the full ARV Report) and verify that this time is within 5 ms of the previously marked time. 

Repeat the process continuously for at least 550 seconds.

If no new messages have been received from a given Participant for 250 seconds, then all records (including temporary storage) 
relevant to the Participant Address will be deleted from the Report Output Storage Buffer. 

Step 1: 
Airborne Mode - 25 Participants 
Set up an Airborne scenario and simulation for a minimum of 25 Participants at various altitudes, velocities, initial positions and general directions.   Design the simulation to include Participants that are traveling toward, away from, and crossing in the vicinity of, the ADS-B Receiving Device.  The simulation must include several random Participants that appear for a short period of time of not less than fifteen (15), and not greater than twenty five (25) seconds, with accompanying issue of "*even*" and "odd" encoded Airborne Position Messages, and then disappear from the simulation altogether.  These same Participants should be re-introduced to the simulation after an absence of at least 500 seconds.

Verify that each entry contains a time tag.  Verify that for those Participants that are continuing through out the simulation that updated information replaces old information upon the receipt of the new information.  Verify that for those Participants that were introduced for a short period of time between 15 and 25 
seconds that each track file for that Participant is retained for at least 250 seconds. Verify that if no new messages are received for a given Participant for a period of 250 seconds, that all data relevant to that Participant is deleted from the Report Output Storage Buffer.

Step 2: 
Surface Mode - 25 Participants 
Set up a Surface scenario and simulation for a minimum of 25 Participants at various ground speeds, initial positions and general direction of travel.   Design the simulation to include Participants that are traveling toward, away from, and crossing in the vicinity of, the ADS-B Receiving Device.  The simulation must include random Participants that appear for a short period of time of not less than fifteen (15), and not greater than twenty five (25) seconds, and then disappear from the simulation altogether.  This same Participant should be re-introduced to the simulation after an absence of at least 500 seconds. 

Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem simulation to transmit Version Zero (0), Version One (1) and Version Two (2) Surface Position Messages, Aircraft Identification and Category Messages, and Aircraft Operational Status Messages, at a rate ensuring maximum transmission rate for a period of at least twenty (20) minutes. Initiate the simulation and verify that all received data for a given individual Participant is being stored in temporary storage within a single track file.  Verify that each entry contains a time tag.  Verify that for those Participants that are continuing through out the simulation that updated information replaces old information upon the receipt of the new information.  Verify that for those Participants that were introduced for a short period of time between 15 and 25 seconds that each track file for that Participant is retained for at least 250 seconds. Verify that if no new messages are received for a given Participant for a period of 250 seconds, that all data relevant to that Participant is deleted from the Report Output Storage Buffer. 

Verify that when this same Participant is re-introduced to the simulation that the new set of data is stored in temporary storage and a new track file initiated with none of the data from the previous track.

Note: The "odd" and "**even**" encodings for test case 5 have been established by forcing the NL lookup to 52 for encoding as opposed to 53.  This will result in the Decoder Function selecting NL "odd" equal to NL "**even**" and will produce what appears to be a valid decode of the position.  However, the decoded position will not be consistent with the position indicated for test case 5 in Table 2-213.   

g. Using the Airborne scenario and simulation set up in Step 1 of Â§2.4.10.1.3 
above, verify that for each Participant for which an "*even*" and an "odd" pair

h. Add an Airborne Participant to the simulation whose decoded position is 
beyond the maximum operating range of the Own Ship position.  Verify that the Report Mode of the Airborne Participant is returned to the Initialization State and that no State Vector Report is output.  Verify that the remaining Airborne Participant tracks are not terminated because of the distance validation.  Discontinue Own Ship position data so it is not available, and verify that no tracks are discarded by the position validation.  Some of the simulation participants may be terminated due to lack of update.

b. no new messages have been received from a given Airborne Participant for a 
period of 100 Â±5 seconds, in which case, verify that all reports relevant to the 
Airborne Participant Address have been deleted from the Report Output Storage Buffer. 
Step 6:

Step 1: 
Airborne Target Setup 
Set up the Test Generator to input to the receiver an Airborne Participant encoded using the following Messages to demonstrate proper position validation processing: Test inputs:  
Pair 1: A Position Message set consisting of first an "*even*" and then an "odd" 
Position Message, both encoded with the same NL value that produces a Globally Unambiguous CPR decode within the maximum operating range of the receiver, and both input to the receiver within 10 seconds of each other. 

Pair 2: A Position Message set consisting of first an "*even*" and then an "odd" 
Position Message, both encoded with the same NL value but different than Pair 1 that produces a Globally Unambiguous CPR decode within the maximum operating range of the receiver, and both input to the receiver within 10 seconds of each other. 

Along with the Position Messages, configure the target to output Airborne Velocity, Aircraft ID and Type Messages and Aircraft Operational Status Messages beginning at the same time the input of the Position Messages in the steps below and at the proper Airborne transmit rate. 

Step 2: 
Verify Airborne Position Not Validated 
Input a Pair 1 and verify that a State Vector Report is generated by the receipt of the "odd" Position Message of Pair 1.  Input a Pair 2 and verify that no State Vector Report is output by the receipt of the "odd" Position Message or by the receipt of Airborne Velocity Messages after Pair 2.

Position Message.  Repeat input of Pair 1 and verify that each Position and Velocity Message received results in a State Vector Report with position consistent with the Globally Unambiguous CPR position of Pair 1. 

Step 4: 
Verify Airborne Position Validated - Case 2 
Input a Pair 1 and verify that a State Vector Report consistent with the Globally Unambiguous CPR position of Pair 1 is generated by the receipt of the "odd" 
Position Message of Pair 1.  Input a Pair 2 and verify that no State Vector Report is output by the receipt of the "odd" Position Message.  Repeat input of Pair 2 and verify that no State Vector Report is output by the receipt of the "even" Position Message and that a State Vector Report consistent with the Globally Unambiguous CPR position of Pair 2 is generated by the receipt of the "odd" 
Position Message.  Repeat input of Pair 2 and verify that each Position and Velocity Message received results in a State Vector Report with position consistent with the Globally Unambiguous CPR position of Pair 2.

Position Message, both encoded with the same NL value that produces a Globally Unambiguous CPR decode within the maximum operating range of the receiver, and both input to the receiver within 25 seconds of each other. 

Pair 2: A Position Message set consisting of first an "*even*" and then an "odd" 
Position Message, both encoded with the same NL value but different than Pair 1 that produces a Globally Unambiguous CPR decode within the maximum operating range of the receiver, and both input to the receiver within 25 seconds of each other. 

Along with the Position Messages, configure the target to output Aircraft ID and Type Messages and Aircraft Operational Status Messages beginning at the same time the input of the Position Messages in the steps below and at the proper Surface transmit rate. 

Step 6: 
Verify Surface Position Not Validated  
Input a Pair 1 and verify that a State Vector Report is generated by the receipt of the "odd" Position Message of Pair 1.  Input a Pair 2 and verify that no State Vector Report is output by the receipt of the "odd" Position Message. 

Step 7: 
Verify Surface Position Validated - Case 1 
Input a Pair 1 and verify that a State Vector Report consistent with the Globally Unambiguous CPR position of Pair 1 is generated by the receipt of the "odd" 
Position Message of Pair 1.  Input a Pair 2 and verify that no State Vector Report is output by the receipt of the "odd" Position Message.  Repeat input of Pair 1 and verify that no State Vector Report is output by the receipt of the "even" Position Message and that a State Vector Report consistent with the Globally Unambiguous CPR position of Pair 1 is generated by the receipt of the "odd" 
Position Message.  Repeat input of Pair 1 and verify that each Position Message received results in a State Vector Report with position consistent with the Globally Unambiguous CPR position of Pair 1. 

Step 8: 
Verify Surface Position Validated - Case 2

Position Message of Pair 1.  Input a Pair 2 and verify that no State Vector Report is output by the receipt of the "odd" Position Message.  Repeat input of Pair 2 and verify that no State Vector Report is output by the receipt of the "even" Position Message and that a State Vector Report consistent with the Globally Unambiguous CPR position of Pair 2 is generated by the receipt of the "odd" 
Position Message.  Repeat input of Pair 2 and verify that each Position Message received results in a State Vector Report with position consistent with the Globally Unambiguous CPR position of Pair 2.

Verify that the reception of either of these Position Messages **does not** produce updates to the established Participant Track nor the output of an ADS-B State Vector Report.  Verify that these position messages are used to initiate a candidate duplicate track in accordance with Â§2.2.10.7.   

 

## 2.4.10.7 Verification Of Duplicate Address Processing (Â§2.2.10.7)

No specific test procedure is required to validate Â§2.2.10.7.   

## 2.4.10.7.1 Verification Of Candidate Duplicate Address Reporting (Â§2.2.10.7.1) Purpose/Introduction:

A candidate duplicate address Report will be initiated when a position message is received for an ICAO 24-bit address that fails the local CPR reasonableness test validation of 
Â§2.2.10.6.3.b and no candidate duplicate address Report or duplicate address Report is currently active for the received ICAO 24-bit address.  If initiated, the candidate duplicate address Report is set to Initialization State as per Â§2.2.10.2 and the position message is stored for this candidate duplicate address Report.  The ADS-B Report for which the position message did not pass the validation test of Â§2.2.10.6.3.b, the local CPR reasonableness test, is the primary ADS-B Report for this ICAO 24-bit address.  Once a candidate duplicate address Report is initiated, association of subsequent position messages with this ICAO 24-bit address will be first attempted on the primary ADS-B Report for this ICAO 24-bit address.  If the position message does not pass the validation test of 
Â§2.2.10.6.3.b on the primary ADS-B Report, the position message will be used to attempt Track Initialization on the candidate duplicate address Report as per Â§2.2.10.2.   

Step 1: 
Initialization 
Set up the Test Generator to transmit an ADS-B Airborne Position Message with an "*even*" format containing the exact latitude and longitude data pair provided in the following table.  Within 10 seconds, input another ADS-B Airborne Position Message with "odd" format containing the exact latitude and longitude data pair provided in the following table.  Input a valid ADS-B Airborne Velocity Message.

| 0       | 38.99836   |
| 1       | 38.99836   |

 
Verify that a Global CPR Decode has occurred and that the output of the ADS-B 
State Vector Report matches the corresponding values in the above table. Input another ADS-B Airborne Position Message to the Receiving Subsystem with "*even*" format and data as provided in the following table.    

##

| 0       | 39.0000    |

 
Verify that the output of the ADS-B State Vector Report matches the corresponding values in the above table. 

Step 2: 
Verification of Candidate Duplicate Address Track Initiation  
Input another ADS-B Airborne Position Message pair within 30 seconds with 
"*even*" and "odd" formats containing the exact latitude and longitude data pair provided in the following table.

Verify that the reception of either of the Position Messages does not produce updates to the established Participant Track nor the output of an ADS-B State Vector Report.  Verify that, instead, these two position messages are used to initiate a candidate duplicate track. 

Step 3: 
Verification of Priority Association of Subsequent Address Receptions 
Input additional ADS-B position messages being sure to include messages that will pass the validation test of Â§2.2.10.6.3.b, and others that will fail.  Verify that those messages that passed the validation test of Â§2.2.10.6.3.b were used to update the Primary ADS-B Report and that those that failed were associated with the Candidate Duplicate Address Report.   

## 2.4.10.7.2 Verification Of Duplicate Address Conditions (Â§2.2.10.7.2) Purpose/Introduction:

A duplicate address condition is declared for an ICAO 24-bit address when a global CPR decode is completed by the receipt of both an even and odd position message within 10 seconds for the candidate duplicate address and passes the global CPR reasonableness test. Once declared, a duplicate address condition results in the Duplicate Address Flag in the State Vector Report set to "ON" in the ADS-B Report upon output of either ADS-B Report in the duplicate address condition.  ADS-B Position Messages are associated with the ADS-
B Report in the duplicate address condition that passes the local CPR reasonableness test in Â§2.2.10.6.3.b.  Each ADS-B Report in the duplicate address condition is updated upon receipt of other Extended Squitter Messages containing the duplicate ICAO 24-bit address since there is no means to associate these messages with the correct aircraft. ADS-B Position, Velocity, Aircraft Identification and Category and Emergency / Priority Status (Subtype=1) Messages from aircraft/vehicles with ICAO 24-bit addresses identified as Duplicate Addresses are processed as Version ZERO (0) format Messages.  Since Target State and Status Messages can be associated with the appropriate MOPS ADS-B Version Number based on the Subtype, and Operational Status Messages contain the MOPS ADS-B 
Version Number, these messages can be decoded directly.   

## Measurement Procedure: Step 1: Initialization

Set up the Test Generator to transmit an ADS-B Airborne Position Message with an "*even*" format containing the exact latitude and longitude data pair provided in the following table.  Within 10 seconds, input another ADS-B Airborne Position Message with "odd" format containing the exact latitude and longitude data pair provided in the following table.

Verify that the reception of either of the Position Messages does not produce updates to the established Participant Track nor the output of an ADS-B State Vector Report.  Verify that, instead, these two position messages are used to initiate a candidate duplicate track.  Verify that the Duplicate Address Flag in any subsequent State Vector Report is set to "ON." 

Step 3: 
Verification of Duplicate Address Association with Reports 
Input additional ADS-B position messages and verify that each additional  
message was associated with each report in the duplicate address condition and that each report in the duplicate address condition was updated upon reception of each Extended Squitter Message containing the duplicate 24-bit address. 

Step 4: 
Verification of Version ZERO (0) format Processing 
Input additional ADS-B Position, Velocity, Aircraft Identification and Category and Emergency / Priority Status (Subtype=1) Messages with the 24-bit addresses identifying them as duplicate addresses.  Verify that all such messages were processed as Version ZERO (0) format Messages. 

Step 5: 
Verification of Duplicate Adress Timeout 
Rerun the test procedure in Step 2 above using the same Latitude and Longitude values, allow 60 seconds to pass without a position message update.  Verify that the relevant ADS-B Report for the Participant was deleted from the output storage buffer.  Verify that Duplicate Address Flag in any subsequent State Vector Report is set to "OFF."   

## 2.4.10.7.3 Verification Of Duplicate Address Report Capacity (Â§2.2.10.7.3) Purpose/Introduction:

The ADS-B Receiving Subsystem is required to maintain and process a minimum of three concurrent duplicate address Reports.   

Step 1: 
Initialization 
Provide a Test Generator capable of transmitting Extended Squitter Messages to input to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem.  Set up the Test Generator to transmit an ADS-B Airborne Position Message with ICAO 24-bit address 0x555555 with an "*even*" format containing the exact latitude and longitude data pair provided in the following table.  Within 10 seconds, input another ADS-B Airborne Position Message with the same ICAO 24-bit address with "odd" format containing the exact latitude and longitude data pair provided in the following table.

Verify the ouput of each of the six ADS-B Reports for the three addresses and that the Duplicate Address Flag is set to "ON" in each State Vector Report. 

## 2.4.11 Verification Of Self Test And Monitors (Â§2.2.11)

No specific test procedure is required to validate Â§2.2.11. 

## 2.4.11.1 Verification Of Self Test (Â§2.2.11.1)

Purpose/Introduction: 
These test procedures verify that self test transmissions from ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem comply with the requirements of Â§2.2.11.1. Equipment Required: Provide a method of loading valid data for ADS-B broadcast messages into the ADS-B 
equipment under test.  Provide a Wide Band Dual Channel Oscilloscope (HP 1710, or equivalent).  Provide a method of detecting and monitoring ADS-B broadcast messages. 

Measurement Procedure: 
Load valid data into the ADS-B Airborne Position format and ensure that the expected ADS-B transmissions occur.  Monitor all ADS-B broadcast messages for the occurrence of a 
"TYPE" Code = "23." Measure the single pulse in the "TYPE" Code = "23" message that has the highest RF power and verify that the power does not exceed -40 dBm.  Verify that the average rate of the "TYPE" Code = "23" messages does not exceed one in a 10 second interval. 

## 2.4.11.2 Verification Of Broadcast Monitoring (Â§2.2.11.2)

No specific test procedure is required to validate Â§2.2.11.2. 

## 2.4.11.2.1 Verification Of Transponder-Based Equipment Broadcast Monitoring (Â§2.2.11.2.1) Purpose/Introduction:

These test procedures verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem properly enunciates the "Fail/Warn" state if DF=17 transmissions do not occur at the rates specified in Â§2.2.3.3 
through Â§2.2.3.3.2.10.   
In the squitter monitor it is necessary to implement appropriate "debounce" and recovery techniques, such as those provided for in Table 2-218 in order to not induce unnecessary intermittent Fail/Warn declarations.  In these regards, "debounce" refers to the number of successive maximum transmit intervals that a particular squitter message can be missed (e.g., not transmitted) plus an additional time of 100 milliseconds to process and activate the Fail/Warn mechanism.  Likewise, "recovery" refers to the number of successive maximum transmit intervals within which a particular squitter message must be transmitted plus 100 milliseconds to process and de-activate the Fail/Warn mechanism.

The "ENCODED LATITUDE" and the "ENCODED LONGITUDE" subfields are 12-bit fields, "ME" bits 33 - 44 and "ME" bits 45 - 56, in the TIS-B Coarse Position Message.  
The following test procedure verifies that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem correctly receives Latitude and Longitude position data from the incoming TIS-B Coarse Position Message and outputs decoded Latitude and Longitude data in the TIS-B Report. The following procedure verifies the static Latitude and Longitude decoding where the velocity input is 0.0 knots to verify the actual CPR Latitude and Longitude decoding precision. 

The "Encoded Latitude" and the "Encoded Longitude" subfields are 12-bit fields ("ME" bits 
33 - 44 and ME Bits 45 - 56) in the TIS-B Coarse Position Message.  The following test procedure verifies that the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem correctly receives Latitude and Longitude position data from the incoming TIS-B Coarse Position Message and outputs decoded Latitude and Longitude data in the TIS-B Report.  The Latitude and Longitude data are encoded according to the Compact Position Reporting (CPR) Format described in Appendix A.  The Latitude and Longitude data are dependent upon the positional accuracy supported by the TIS-B site. 

The following procedure verifies the static Latitude and Longitude encoding where the velocity input is 0.0 knots to verify the actual CPR Latitude and Longitude decoding precision. 

Step 1: 
Establish Initial Conditions 
Set up to simulate TIS-B Transmitted Messages by inputting TIS-B Message information directly to the Receiving Subsystem being sure to set the velocity input to ZERO (0). 

Step 2: 
Verify Encoded Latitude and Longitude Data 
1. Provide the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem with an "**even"** formatted 
TIS-B Coarse Airborne Position Message containing the exact latitude and longitude data pair provided in the first row of the Even Airborne 
Encoding Column in Table 2-220. 
2. Within ten seconds, provide the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem with an 
"odd" formatted TIS-B Coarse Airborne Position Message containing the 
exact latitude and longitude data pair provided in the first row of the Odd 
Airborne Encoding Column in Table 2-220. 
3. For each Even interval TIS-B Coarse Position Message that is simulated: 
Verify that the "CPR Format" (F) subfield is set to ZERO (0). 
For each Odd interval TIS-B Coarse Position Message that is simulated: 
Verify that the "CPR Format" (F) subfield is set to ONE (1). 

Verify that the Reported Binary decoded Latitude and Longitude datum, in the output TIS-B Report, match the corresponding values in the Angular Weighted Binary columns on the same row in Table 2-220. 

If the decoding is not exact, verify that the decoding does not differ from the table value by more than "1" Least Significant Bit (LSB). If the decoded value differs from the table value by more than "1" LSB, then the test is considered to have failed.  Other wise the test is passed. 

Repeat this procedure for each row in Table 2-220.

## 2.4.17.4.1 Verification Of Tis-B Message-To-Track Correlation (Â§2.2.17.4.1)

Appropriate tests for validating Â§2.2.17.4.1 are contained in Â§2.4.17.4.2, Â§2.4.17.4.3, 
Â§2.4.17.4.4, and Â§2.4.17.4.6. 

## 2.4.17.4.1.1 Verification Of Tis-B Messages Having A Icao 24-Bit Address (Â§2.2.17.4.1.1) Purpose/Introduction:

For a target that has a ICAO 24-bit address, that address is used for correlating new receptions with information in the track file.  Correlation is successful if the address matches exactly.  If the ICAO 24-bit address in a received message is either ALL ZEROs or ALL ONEs, it is considered to be illegal, and the message will be discarded.  Otherwise, when a TIS-B Position Message having a ICAO 24-bit address is received, and an existing TIS-B track has the same address, the message will be correlated with the track as specified in Â§2.2.17.4.1.1.   
Measurement Procedure: 

Step 1: 
Verification of the Correlation of a Received TIS-B with an Existing TIS-B Track 
Set up to simulate TIS-B Transmitted Messages by inputting TIS-B Message information directly to the Receiving Subsystem.  Input a simulated TIS-B position message containing an ICAO 24-bit address.  Within two minutes, input another different TIS-B message with the same ICAO 24-bit address as the previous message and verify that the position information in the second TIS-B position message is reflected in the output TIS-B Report. 

Step 2: 
Verification of the correlation of a Received TIS-B with an Existing ADS-B Track 
Set up to simulate ADS-B and TIS-B Transmitted Messages by inputting ADS-B 
and TIS-B Message information directly to the Receiving Subsystem.  Input a simulated ADS-B position message containing an ICAO 24-bit address.  Within two minutes, input a TIS-B message with a different position and the same ICAO 24-bit address as the ADS-B message and verify that the position information in the TIS-B position message is reflected in the output TIS-B Report. 

## 2.4.17.4.1.2 Verification Of Tis-B Messages Having Mode A Code And Track Number (Â§2.2.17.4.1.2) Purpose/Introduction:

For a target not identified by a ICAO 24-bit address, but instead having a Mode A code and a TIS-B track number, then these are used to correlate with information in the track file.  
Correlation is successful if the Mode A code and the track number both match exactly. When a TIS-B Message having a Mode A code and TIS-B track number is received, and an existing TIS-B track has the same Mode A code and ADS-B track number, the message will be correlated with the track as specified in Â§2.2.17.4.1.2. 

Set up to simulate TIS-B Transmitted Messages by inputting TIS-B Message information directly to the Receiving Subsystem.  Input a simulated TIS-B position message containing a 12-bit Mode A Code followed by a 12-bit track file number.  Within two minutes, input another different TIS-B position message with the same 12-bit Mode A Code followed by the same 12-bit track file number as the previous message and verify that the position information in the second TIS-B position message is reflected in the output TIS-B Report.

Within 10 Seconds 
Set up to simulate TIS-B Transmitted Messages by inputting TIS-B Message information directly to the Receiving Subsystem.  Input a simulated TIS-B position message with an "even" format.  Within ten seconds, input another TIS-B position message with an "odd" format.  Verify that a "Global" decode has occurred by ensuring that the input position information is reflected in the output TIS-B Report. 

Step 2:

Step 2: 
Verification of Incomplete to Complete Track Promotion and Data Storage 
Set up to simulate TIS-B Transmitted Messages by inputting TIS-B Message information directly to the Receiving Subsystem.  Input a simulated TIS-B position message with an "even" format.  This should create an Incomplete track. Within ten seconds, input another TIS-B position message with an "odd" format. This should trigger a global decode and Complete the track.  Verify that the track has been promoted to Complete and that the latter input position and TOA are saved in the track. 

Step 3:

## 2.4.18.4 Verification Of The Ads-B Rebroadcast Surveillance Message Definitions (Â§2.2.18.4) Purpose/Introduction:

The Rebroadcast of ADS-B information on the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter data link is accomplished by utilizing the same ADS-B Message formats defined in Figure A-1 through Figure A-10, with the exception of the need to transmit an indication to the 1090 MHz Receiving Subsystem as to the type of identity associated with the aircraft data being reported in the ADS-B Rebroadcast Message.  This identification is performed using the ICAO/Mode A Flag (IMF), which was previously discussed in Â§2.2.17.3.1.2 for the TIS-B 
transmissions. The insertion of this one bit into the 1090ES ADS-B Messages identified in the subparagraphs below allows the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem to interpret the Address Field 
(AF) in the following manner: 

IMF = 0 
indicates that the ADS-B Rebroadcast data is identified by an ICAO 24-bit 
Address. 
IMF = 1 
indicates that the ADS-B Rebroadcast data is identified by an anonymous 24-bit 
address or ground vehicle address or fixed obstruction address.

## 3.0 Installed Equipment Performance

This section states the minimum acceptable level of performance for the equipment when installed in the aircraft.  Installed performance requirements are the same as contained in section Â§2.2, which are verified through bench and environmental testing.  Some system attributes and performance aspects may be affected by the physical installation (e.g., antenna patterns can affect system transmit and receive performance).  System integrators might have several options when connecting to aircraft sensors or data sources.  Some sources might lack the necessary range, resolution or accuracy to support the desired applications.  This section identifies system attributes which installation techniques and choices might affect, beyond the equipment manufacturer's ability to compensate.    

Note: Installation of Non-Transponder-Based 1090 MHz ADS-B equipment in airplanes 
equipped with Mode-S transponders is prohibited.   The transmission of squitters in addition to TCAS interrogation responses contributes unnecessary RF energy to the spectral environment.  TCAS systems (in other airplanes) cannot take advantage of hybrid surveillance on the ADS-B data, since the non-transponder data cannot be validated by TCAS interrogation.  ADS-B data is not directly available to ground interrogators as when read from transponder registers. 

## 3.1 Installed Equipment Considerations

A complete ADS-B system consists of five (5) functional elements:  

1. Data sources for aircraft position, velocity, flight plan, status, etc. 2. ADS-B transmitter 
3. ADS-B receiver 
4. Report Generator 5. Applications 
Each of these elements must meet the minimum requirements for an application in order for operational approval to be granted for that application.  Table 3-1 is an example of a system that meets the minimum requirements for 3 generic applications.  Additional guidance for determining requirements is contained in following paragraphs.

Note: The type designation refers to the Receiver Report Generator type and is included here as an example of equipment labeling and is not to imply any specific interface is required.  The developer is free to choose any of the interface types so long as it is properly documented and meets the end-to-end system requirements.  

## 3.1.1 Data Sources

Data sources necessary to support an application **shall** meet the requirements of the operational environment (e.g., The source of ADS-B navigation data must be approved for IFR navigation if the ADS-B application is to be approved for IFR operations.), and **shall** 
meet the accuracy, range, and resolution requirements of the appropriate ADS-B equipage category.   

## 3.1.2 Ads-B Transmit Power

The Transmit Power requirement (i.e, Effective Radiated Power) is different for different classes of equipment because of differences in altitude capabilities and ranges of applications.  The classes are defined in Â§2.1.12 and the power level in each class is defined in Â§2.2.2. Different classes of equipment have different minimum message capability requirements.  
Transmitted message capability requirements for Class A and Class B transmitters are defined in Â§2.1.12.1.  Some applications may require support for specific On-Condition Messages. 

## 3.1.3 Ads-B Receiver

The receiver **shall** be capable of supporting the message types required by application. 

The receiver sensitivity limits the expected range of the installed system.  The sensitivity of the installed receiving equipment should be appropriate to the minimum range requirement for the ADS-B equipage class.  Receivers having a Minimum Trigger Level (MTL) of â74 
dBm are intended to support applications at ranges up to 20 nautical miles.  Receivers having a MTL of â79 dBm are intended to support applications at ranges up to 40 nautical miles.  Receivers having a MTL of â84 dBm are intended to support applications at ranges up to 90 nautical miles.   

## 3.1.4 Report Generator

The report generator function **shall** be capable of accepting all message types and generating all reports appropriate to the intended applications.  Special attention may be necessary for Type 1 interfaces to ensure that the equipment is properly matched to the application requirements. 

## 3.1.5 Applications

Applications comprise any use of ADS-B data.  Applications **shall** be developed in accordance with approved standards if standards exist.  If approved standards do not exist, the developer **shall** propose a standard early in the development process to support approval of the operational concept and identify operational limitations. 

First time operational approval for the use of installed ADS-B equipment in a given application will be accomplished via the Type Certificate (TC) or Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) approval process.  Subsequent installations may be approved via the TC, STC, or field approval process.  It is incumbent upon the developer to show that the system meets the requirements of the application.  Operating limits of the system **shall** be included in an approved aircraft/rotorcraft flight manual supplement (AFMS/RFMS). 

## 3.2 Equipment Installation 3.2.1 Aircraft Environment

Equipment **shall** be installed such that environmental conditions do not exceed the equipment manufacturer's specifications during normal operations.   

## 3.2.2 Aircraft Power Source

The supply voltage and allowable variation shall not exceed the equipment manufacturer's specifications during normal operations.  Equipment voltage and frequency tolerance characteristics **shall** be compatible with an aircraft power source of appropriate category as specified in RTCA DO-160G (EUROCAE, ED-14G).   

## 3.2.2.1 Power Fluctuation

The equipment **shall** retain memory of variable data through aircraft power transfer, which occurs during normal operation.  Typical power transfer involves switching from external power to internal power, either battery or APU generator, or to engine driven generator(s).  
The equipment shall not require re-initialization for power transfer (i.e., power loss) for a period up to 0.5 second maximum.  Power transfer shall not latch a failure indication.  
Momentary failure indications, during switching, are allowed. 

## 3.2.3 Accessibility

Controls, indicators, and displays provided for in-flight use **shall** be readily accessible and/or readable from the pilot's normal seated position.  If two pilots are required to operate the aircraft, the controls must be readily accessible from each pilot's seated position. Adequate protection must be provided to prevent inadvertent turnoff of the equipment. 

## 3.2.4 Display Visibility

If there is a control panel display, then appropriate flight crew member(s) must have an unobstructed view of displayed data when in the seated position.  The brightness of any display must be adjustable to levels suitable for data interpretation under all cockpit ambient lighting conditions ranging from total darkness to reflected sunlight. 

Note: Visors, glare shields or filters may be an acceptable means of obtaining daylight visibility. 

## 3.2.5 Indicators

If visual indicators are installed, they **shall** be visible and readable from the pilot's normal seated position.  If two pilots are required to operate the aircraft, indicators **shall** be visible from each pilot's seated position.  The brightness of any indicator must be adjustable to levels suitable under all cockpit ambient lighting conditions ranging from total darkness to reflected sunlight.  If an indication is distracting, a means to cancel it should be provided.  If the optional Extended Squitter Inhibit capability per Â§2.1.5.1 is provided, the indication when activated **shall** be annunciated to the pilot.   

## 3.2.6 Alerts

If appropriate to an application, a means to alert the crew is provided as per the requirements of an application MOPS.     

## 3.2.7 Failure Protection

Probable failures of the ADS-B equipment must not degrade the normal operation of equipment or systems connected to it.  The failure of connected equipment or systems must not degrade normal operation of the ADS-B equipment except for loss of functions that are directly dependent upon the failed equipment.  

## 3.2.8 Failure Indication 3.2.8.1 Ads-B Transmission Or Receiver Device Failure Annunciation

The ADS-B system operational status **shall** be available to the crew.  Failures of the ADS-B transmitter and receiver **shall** be annunciated to the crew.  Though acceptable, dedicated ADS-B transmit and receive failure indicators are not required.  Text messages, displayed to the crew until acknowledged, are acceptable.  Systems which combine transmit and receive functions in a common unit may use a single annunciation to indicate a failure.  Otherwise, transmitter and receiver failure warnings **shall** be independent (Â§2.2.11.5).  

## 3.2.8.2 Ads-B Function Fail Annunciation (Â§2.2.11.6) 3.2.8.2.1 Ads-B Transmit Function Fail Annunciation

Loss of capability to generate ADS-B Message Transmissions, including loss of ADS-B 
data input, **shall** result in the ADS-B Function Fail annunciation, which **shall** be indicated to the Flight Crew in accordance with Â§2.2.11.6.   

## 3.2.8.2.2 Ads-B Receive Function Fail Annunciation

Loss of capability to generate and deliver ADS-B Reports to the intended interface or application **shall** result in the ADS-B Function Fail annunciation, which **shall** be indicated to the Flight Crew in accordance with Â§2.2.11.6.   

## 3.2.9 Interference Effects

The equipment shall not be the source of objectionable conducted or radiated interference nor be adversely affected by conducted or radiated interference from other equipment or systems installed in the aircraft.  If these systems are installed, check for interference when operating on TACAN channels 60 to 72; DME channels 65 to 67 (1089 - 1091 MHz paired with VHF frequency 133.8 to 134.05) 
Note: Electromagnetic compatibility problems noted after installation of this equipment may result from such factors as the design characteristics of previously installed systems or equipment and the physical installation itself.  The installing facility is responsible for resolving incompatibilities between the ADS-B equipment and previously installed equipment in the aircraft. 

## 3.3 Antenna Installation 3.3.1 General Considerations

Antenna gain and pattern characteristics are major contributors to the system data link performance.  The location and number of antennas required for aircraft ADS-B systems is determined by the equipage class.  Class A1, A2, and A3 equipment require antenna diversity and **shall** have transmitting and receiving capability on both the top and bottom of the aircraft.  Class B1 equipment requires antenna diversity and **shall** have transmitting capability on both the top and bottom of the aircraft.  Diverse use of the installed antennas shall comply with the requirements of Â§2.2.13.6 and may be demonstrated by analysis.   
Class A0, A1S, B0 and B1S do not require antenna diversity; however, antenna gain pattern performance **shall** be shown at least equivalent to that of a quarter-wave resonant antenna mounted on the fuselage bottom surface.    
If the ADS-B transmitter function is hosted in a Mode-S transponder, the antenna installation **shall** comply with the requirements of RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E). If the ADS-B receiver function is hosted in a TCAS computer, the antenna installation **shall** 
comply with the requirements of RTCA DO-185B (EUROCAE ED-143).   

## 3.3.2 Transmission Lines

Transmission lines to the antennas **shall** have impedance, power handling, and loss characteristics in accordance with the equipment manufacturer's specifications.  The VSWR, as seen through the transmission lines to the antenna(s), **shall** be within the limits specified by the manufacturer. 

When a transmission line is included as a part of the installation, all minimum installed system performance requirements stated in section Â§2.2, must be met.  Test results provided by the equipment manufacturer may be accepted in lieu of tests performed by the equipment installer. 

## 3.3.3 Antenna Location

Antennas **shall** be mounted as near as practical to the center line of the fuselage.  Antennas shall be located to minimize obstruction to their fields in the horizontal plane. 

Note: Where possible, it is recommended that the antennas be mounted on the forward 
part of the fuselage, thereby minimizing blockage due to the vertical stabilizer and engine nacelles. 

## 3.3.3.1 Minimum Distance From Other Antennas

The spacing between any ADS-B antenna and any transponder (Mode-S or ATCRBS) 
antenna **shall** be sufficient to provide a minimum of 20 dB of isolation between the two antennas. 

Note: If both antennas are conventional omni-directional matched quarter-wave stubs, 20 
dB of isolation is obtained by providing a spacing of at least 51 cm (20 in.) between the centers of the two antennas.  If either antenna is other than a conventional stub, the minimum spacing must be determined by measurement, or shown by analysis.  

## 3.3.3.2 Mutual Suppression

If other equipment installed in the aircraft operates at or near 1090 MHz, such as DME, the need for mutual suppression **shall** be determined.  When mutual suppression is used, the requirements of Â§2.2.12 **shall** be met.  There **shall** be no more than one active 1090 MHz transmitter per aircraft at any time. 

## 3.3.4 Antenna Gain Performance

Gain performance of the ADS-B antenna(s) is tested to verify that the installed antenna gain is not degraded from Â§2.2.13 requirements, beyond an acceptable value. Transmit antenna(s) 
shall be located such that a receiving system reliably receives data from the transmitting aircraft at the minimum range appropriate to the equipage category, as stated in Table 3-2.  
Receive antenna(s) **shall** be located such that a receiving system reliably receives data from a transmitting aircraft at the minimum range appropriate to the equipage category, as stated in Table 3-2.  If a traffic display is installed, reliable data reception is indicated by traffic target acquisition range and smooth movement of traffic targets, without excessive "popup," "drop-out," or position "jumps." 
Note: Typical ADS-B antennas have areas of reduced gain, directly above or below the antenna, such that no signal can be received from transmitters in the "cone of silence" or "uncertainty cone."  Reliable data reception from these areas is not required.  Approval of operational applications should consider this limitation.

* For each equipage class, the value shown in Table 3-2 corresponds to forward directional coverage.  Port and starboard coverage may be one half of this value; aft may be one third of this value.  (Ref. RTCA DO-242A Table 3-2(a)) 

## 3.3.4.1 Gain Performance Verification

Gain performance can be verified using one or a combination of four distinct procedures: 

(a) full scale antenna range measurements, 
(b) scaled model measurements, (c) theoretical calculations, 
(d) distance-area calculations, to ensure that the location of the antenna on the aircraft does 
not unduly degrade its gain performance.  
This procedure(s) **shall** be performed on final installed equipment with all appropriate connections and antenna in order to demonstrate proper operation of the final installation.  

## 3.3.4.1.1 Success Criteria

At an elevation angle of zero degrees relative to the fuselage reference plane, the gain of the forward Â±45 degree azimuth sector of both the top and bottom antennas **shall** be no more than one dB below the gain of the antenna when installed on a standard ground plane as specified in Â§2.2.13.  The radiation pattern gain, at zero degrees elevation, **shall** be within 3 
dB of the gain of the ground-plane-installed antenna over 90% of the remainder of its azimuth coverage.  The verification procedures of Â§2.4.13.1 through Â§2.4.13.5 **shall** be performed on final installed equipment with all appropriate connections and antenna in order to demonstrate proper operation of the final installation. 

Note: Antenna system performance tests are specified to accommodate the most stringent envisioned applications.  Operational approval of proposed applications must consider installed antenna system performance.  Installations that do not fully comply with the above requirements may be approved for particular operations based on the safety implications of the application. 

## 3.3.4.2 Full Scale Anechoic Antenna Range Measurements Of Gain

The gain characteristics of the antenna as mounted on the actual airframe may be measured directly in a calibrated anechoic antenna test range using standard controlled procedures for such measurements.  Gain characteristics determined in this way require no further validation. 

Note: Anechoic range measurements are generally impractical for determining full antenna gain patterns for large aircraft.  However, such techniques may be practical for qualifying certain sub-regions of the coverage pattern or for validating model measurements or theoretical calculations. 

## 3.3.4.3 Scaled Model Measurements Of Gain

Aircraft models for antenna measurements are normally 1/10 to 1/40 scale.  Scale selection is dependent upon considerations such as availability of equipment, and antenna scaling, with larger models resulting in greater accuracy. 

Only the major structural features of the airframe need be constructed.  Details such as windows, doors, turbines, etc. are not required.  The outside skin should be of conductive material.  Typically, the fuselage and engine nacelles are modeled from metal tubing and/or shaped metal screening; wings and stabilizers can be modeled from flat metal plates. Movable control surfaces are not required unless they will have significant effects upon the antenna pattern. 

## Notes:

1.  
In general, obstructions that subtend angles at the antenna of less than a few degrees in elevation or azimuth need not be modeled.  However, smaller obstructions such as other antennas, that are located within a few wavelengths of the antenna under test, may have to be modeled because they can act as resonant scatterers and could have a significant effect on the radiation pattern. 
2.  
If the swept area of propeller blades exceeds the limits given in (1) above, the blades can be worst-case modeled by a flat metal disk of radius proportional to blade length.  If the radiation pattern using disks for propellers satisfies the success 
criteria, it can be assumed that the pattern modulation caused by the rotating blades will not significantly degrade the ADS-B system performance. 

## 3.3.4.4 Model Tests

Mount the scaled model antenna in the center of a ground plane whose radius is equal in wavelengths to the ground plane used for testing the full scale antenna. Using a calibrated anechoic antenna test range, confirm that the gain of the scaled antenna (including possible multiple radiating elements, splitting or combining networks, impedance, and mutual coupling effects) is within 2 dB of the full-scale antenna gain, for all azimuth and elevation angles for which the gain of the full-scale antenna is within 6 dB of the peak gain. Mount the scaled model antenna on the aircraft model at the intended installation location. 

Measure the antenna gain for all azimuth angles (for top and bottom antennas). Confirm that the scaled antenna meets the success criteria of Â§3.3.4.1.1 above. 

## 3.3.4.5 Theoretical Calculations Of Antenna Gain

The gain characteristics of the antenna as mounted on the actual airframe may be determined by a combination of radiation pattern calculations, and measurements designed to validate those calculations.  When using such techniques to determine the gain of a multielement antenna, it is necessary to show that the calculations include the inherent characteristics of the antenna elements and their drivers, splitters, or combining networks and any effects due to mutual coupling between those elements. 

## 3.3.4.5.1 Validation Of Theoretical Calculations

If radiation pattern calculations are used to prove the success criteria of Â§3.3.4.1.1 above, the manufacturer of the antenna must provide corroborating data demonstrating the success of the calculation technique in predicting the antenna gain on an airframe roughly similar in size and complexity to the airframe under qualification.  Such data must be obtained by comparison with selected gain measurements made 

(a) on a full-size airframe using a calibrated ramp test antenna range, or 
(b) on a scaled model airframe as indicated in 3.3.4.4. 

## 3.3.4.5.2 Distance Area Calculations

The extent to which the antenna installation minimizes obstructions in the horizontal plane and minimizes effects of reflecting objects, may be judged by the distance to such objects and their sizes.  If the distances and sizes satisfy the condition given here, then the antenna installation may be considered validated with regard to antenna gain.  The condition is: For target aircraft at zero degree elevation angle and at azimuth bearing between â90 degrees and +90 degrees, 

$$\frac{A_{1}^{2}}{\lambda^{2}D_{1}^{2}}+\sum\frac{A_{2}^{2}{G_{2}}^{i}}{\lambda^{2}D_{2}^{2}G_{2}}+\sum\frac{A_{3}{G_{3}}^{i}}{4\pi D_{3}^{2}G_{3}}<0.02$$

 ft. is the free space wavelength at 1090 MHz.  The first term is applicable only if there is a metallic obstruction between the target and the ADS-B antenna.  The distance in feet to the obstruction is denoted D1 and the area in ft2 of the obstruction projected in the direction of the ADS-B antenna is denoted A1.  The second term is a summation over flat metallic reflectors, if any, that are oriented so as to cause a specular reflection between the ADS-B antenna and the target.  The distance to the reflector, in feet, is denoted D2, the area, in square feet, of the reflector, projected in the direction of the ADS-B antenna is denoted A2, the antenna gain in the direction of the reflector is denoted G'2 and is dimensionless (i.e., gain in dB = 10 log G'2), and the antenna gain in the direction of the target is denoted G2 and is dimensionless.  The third term is a summation over all other metallic objects that may cause reflections between the ADS-B antenna and the target.  The parameters D3, A3, G'3, and G3 have the same meanings as in the second term.  In the case of other aircraft antennas in view of the ADS-B antenna, a minimum value for A = 0.22 square feet is to be used if the actual area of the antenna is less than 0.22 square feet. 

## 3.3.4.5.3 Dynamic Response

The antenna(s) **shall** be located such that operation of the equipment is not adversely affected by aircraft maneuvering or changes in attitude encountered in normal flight operations. 

Note: Class A0 and A1S installations are not required to install multiple (e.g., top fuselage and bottom fuselage) antennas. 

## 3.3.4.6 Installed Equipment Antenna System 3.3.4.6.1 Verification Of Transmit Pattern Gain (Â§2.2.13.1) Purpose/Introduction:

The purpose of this procedure is to verify that the gain of an omni-directional transmit antenna is not less than the gain of a matched quarter-wave stub minus 3 dB over 90 percent of a coverage volume from 0 to 360 degrees in azimuth and from 5 to 30 degrees above the ground plane when installed at center of 1.2 meter (4 feet) diameter (or larger) flat circular ground plane. This procedure should be performed in the laboratory environment to demonstrate that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem properly delivers RF ADS-B Messages to the free space medium via the expected installation connections and radiating antenna.   
This procedure **shall** be performed on final installed equipment with all appropriate connections and antenna in order to demonstrate proper operation of the final installation. Equipment Required: Provide a method of generating ADS-B Airborne Position Broadcast.  
Calibrated quarter-wave stub Sense Antenna of known gain. (See Figure 3-1) 
Appropriate Couplers and Connectors as required Coaxial Connection of known attenuation (shown in Figure 3-1 as Coax #2) Appropriate Attenuators as required HP 8753E Spectrum Analyzer (or equivalent capability) 

Step 1: 
Understand the Equation 

## Define:

P_out 
= 
Transmitted Power (**in watts**) Measured at the ADS-B Broadcast Message Generator output connector in watts 
Loss_TX 
= 
attenuation (**in dB**) provided by connection of the ADS-B Broadcast 
Message Generator to the Transmitting Antenna.  This includes the 
cable (i.e., Coax #1 in Figure 3-1) and connectors 
G_tx 
=

 ) - 20*log( R ) 
 
= 
20*log( 2.19020564 X 10-2
= 
- 33.1903022 - 20*log( R ) 
 
G_rx 
= 
gain (**in dB**) of the receiving or Calibrated Sense Antenna 
Loss_RX 
= 
attenuation (**in dB**) provided by connection of the Calibrated Sense 

Antenna to the Spectrum Analyzer.  This includes the cable (i.e., Coax #2 in Figure 3-1) and connectors and should be calibrated to 3 dB 

P_rx_dBw 
= 
Power (in dBw) received at the Spectrum Analyzer 
P_rx_dBm 
= 
P_rx_dBw + 30 = Power (in dBm) received at the Spectrum Analyzer 
Then the expected power of the 1090 MHz signal received at the Spectrum Analyzer is given by the following equation. 

## Equation 1:

P_rx_dBw 
= 
10*log(P_out) - Loss_TX + G_tx + Path_Loss + G_rx - Loss_RX 
 
= 
10*log(P_out) - Loss_TX + G_tx -33.1903022 -20*log( R) + G_rx - Loss_RX 
Specifying a Range of 3 meters (i.e., the distance between the antennas along the reference line shown in Figure 3-1) to be used as the Range in the following procedure provides the following Equation 2. 

P_rx_dBw 
= 
10*log(P_out) - Loss_TX + G_tx - 33.1903022 - 9.54242509 + G_rx - 
Loss_RX 

## Equation 2:

P_rx_dBw 
= 
10*log(P_out) - Loss_TX + G_tx - 42.73272729 + G_rx - Loss_RX 
Note: If the measurement distance, R, is different from 3 meters, then Equation 2 must be recomputed for the new R and the recomputation must be based on Equation 1. Equation 1 is based on the fact that there are 1852 meters in one nautical mile. Also, there are 6076.1 feet in one nautical mile.  Therefore, for the purpose of these computations, there are 3.280831533 feet per meter. 

The Effective Radiated Power (ERP) emitted from the Transmitting Antenna is then given by Equation 3 as follows: 

## Equation 3:

ERP_dBw 
= 
P_rx_dBw + 42.73272729 - G_rx + Loss_RX 
Note:  Whenever the need to measure radiated RF power is established, the question 
arises in regards to the permissible level of radiation that can be sustained by personnel making the measurements.  This document addresses such concerns in the following paragraph of this note. 

Assume that the maximum Effective Radiated Power from the Transponder or 
ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is 500 W (27 dBW) as specified in Â§2.2.2.1.2 of 
this document and Â§2.2.3.2.d of RTCA DO-181E.  Then, using portions of equation 2 or 3 from above, the radiated power at 3 meters is given as follows:   

P_3m_dBW 
= ERP - 42.73272729 
 
= 26.98970004 dBW -42.73272729 
P_3m_dBW 
= -15.74302725 dBW 


then the power at 3 meters in watts is as follows: 
$$\begin{array}{l c l}{{{\cal I}0^{*}l o g(P_{-}3m_{-}W)}}&{{=}}&{{\text{-}{\cal I}5.74302725}}\\ {{{\cal P}_{-}3m_{-}W}}&{{=}}&{{({\cal I}0^{\;\cdot{\cal I}.574302725}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{0.02665\;W}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{=}}&{{26.65\;m W}}\end{array}$$

This would appear to be a minimum amount of power:  however, it does not 
readily translate into Maximum Permissible Exposure **(MPE)** limits, which are 
typically used to determine hazard levels. 

Consulting FCC OET Bulletin 65, Edition 97-01, August, 1997, "Evaluating 
Compliance with FCC Guidelines for Human Exposure to Radio frequency 
Electromagnetic Fields," provides information as provided in the following paragraphs. 

Section 2, equation 3, page 19 of the bulletin provides the following equation for 
the prediction of RF fields: 
_where:_

$S$ _power density (in appropriate units, e.g., mW/cm${}^{2}$)_
) 

_EIRP = equivalent (or effective) isotropically radiated power_

_(inappropriate units, e.g. mW)_

_R = distance to the center of radiation of the antenna (appropriate units, e.g., cm)_

Applying this equation at 3 meters to the maximum radiated power (e.g., 500 W) 
allowed for transponders or ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems provides the 
following results: 
 

$$\begin{array}{r c l}{{S}}&{{=}}&{{\frac{(500\ W)(1000\ m W/W)}{4\pi(300\ c m)^{2}}}}\end{array}$$

 

$$\begin{array}{r l}{={}}&{{}0.44209706\;m W/c m^{2}}\end{array}$$
 

Appendix A, Table 1(A) of the bulletin then provides MPE limits for 
Occupational/Controlled Exposure as follows: Frequency Range (MHz) 
 
= 
300 - 1500 
Electric Field Strength (E) (V/m) 
= 
Not Applicable 
Magnetic Field Strength (H) (A/M)

Power Density (S) (mW/cm2
)  
= 
f/300 
Averaging Time, S **(minutes)**  
=

2 

 
Therefore, the MPE exposure for an average of 6 minutes at 1090 MHz is: 
 
S_MPE_1090 = 
                                    (1090)/300 
                                                              = 
                                                                            3.63333333... mW/cm

 

Note that this limit value is 8.2184 times greater than the power density at 3 
meters computed above as 0.44209706 mW/cm2. 

Next, the time of exposure must be considered.  Page 11 of the bulletin addresses this concern with the equation: 
avg 

Î£ Sexpt
       = 
  exp 
        Slimitt

where: 
              

) 

Sexp 
= 
power density of exposure (mW/cm2
S
) 
limit = 
appropriate power density MPE limit (mW/cm2
t exp 
= 
allowable time of exposure for S
exp t
 
= 
appropriate MPE averaging time avg
 

Taking into the consideration that the transponder or ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem will never exceed a transmitting duty cycle of 5%, the allowable time of 
exposure is computed from the above equation as follows: 
 

(0.44209706 _mW/cm${}^{2}$_)*X*(0.05) = (1090/300 _mw/cm${}^{2}$_)(6 minutes) X = (1090/300 _mw/cm${}^{2}$_)(6 minutes) (0.44209706 _mW/cm${}^{2}$_)(0.05) X = 986.209 minutes or X = 16.4368 hours

These calculations have demonstrated that the expected power density of the 
transponder or ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem at 3 meters is well within the allowable MPE.  The calculations also demonstrate that the time of 16.44 hours of exposure to present a possible hazard is considerably longer than any time necessary to perform the test procedures address in this subparagraph. 

## Step 2: Measure The Output Power Of The Ads-B Transmitting Subsystem Or Device

On the Aircraft (or other applicable installation), disconnect the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem to Antenna connection at the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem unit connector. 

Using appropriate attenuators, connectors, and coaxial cable of known attenuation of 3 dB and impedance of 50 ohms, connect the Spectrum Analyzer to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem. 

Note:  The use of attenuators is strongly recommended such that the RF receiver front end of the Spectrum Analyzer is not destroyed.  If such happens, it is probable that the individual performing the test will not be performing similar tests in the future. 

Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit ADS-B Surface Position Messages. Using the Spectrum Analyzer set at a center frequency of 1090 MHz, capture the strongest (i.e., highest RF power) pulse in an ADS-B Surface Position Message Pulse Train.  Then measure the frequency and pulse power. Verify that the frequency is at 1090 MHz Â±1.0 MHz. 

For Class A0 equipment, verify that the output power is at least 70 watts (i.e., 18.45 dBw, or 48.45 dBm).  Log the measurement as P_out. For Class A1S, A1, and A2 equipment, verify that the output power is at least 125 
watts (i.e., 20.97 dBw, or 50.97 dBm).  Log the measurement as P_out.  
For Class A3 equipment, verify that the output power is at least 200 watts (i.e., 23.0 dBw, or 53.0 dBm).  Log the measurement as P_out. 

## Step 3: Re-Connect Aircraft Installation

Disconnect the Spectrum Analyzer from the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. 

Restore the normal aircraft (or other) installation connection of the ADS-B 
transmitting antenna to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. 

## Step 4: Establish Measurement Reference #1

Refer to Figure 3-1. 

Using an appropriate strong nylon string or similar, secure the string to the Calibrated Sensing Antenna and to the Aircraft Antenna under test such that the two antenna are exactly 3 meters apart along the reference line shown in Figure 3-
1.  Make sure that the two antennas are at the same height from a relatively level surface.  Note this position of the Calibrated Sensing Antenna as the **baseline** 
position. Then, move the Calibrated Sensing Antenna to a point that is 5 degrees above the baseline position while maintaining the Calibrated Sensing Antenna perpendicular to the string with the string being tight but not stretched.  Note this position as the 
#1 Reference Position. 

Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit ADS-B Surface Position Messages. Using the Spectrum Analyzer set at a center frequency of 1090 MHz, capture the strongest (i.e., highest RF power) pulse in an ADS-B Surface Position Message Pulse Train.  Then measure and note the pulse power. For Class A0 equipment, verify that the ERP (see Equation 3) is at least 70 watts (i.e., 18.45 dBw, or 48.45 dBm).  Log the measurement as ERP_dBw. For Class A1S, A1, and A2 equipment, verify that the ERP (see Equation 3) is at least 125 watts (i.e., 20.97 dBw, or 50.97 dBm).  Log the measurement as ERP_dBw. For Class A3 equipment, verify that the ERP (see Equation 3) is at least 200 watts (i.e., 23.0 dBw, or 53.0 dBm).  Log the measurement as ERP_dBw. 

Step 5: 
Circular Measurements 
Keeping the Calibrated Sensing Antenna at 5 degrees above the baseline position as specified in Step 4, move the Calibrated Sensing Antenna in the horizontal plane in approximately 45 degree steps such that new positions are established at approximately 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees relative to #1 Reference Position. 

At each new position, repeat the power measurement taken in Step 4 and log the results in dBw. Verify that the maximum deviation between any two measurements taken in Step 
4 and this Step does not exceed 1 dBw. 

Step 6: 
Establish new reference #2 
Repeat Step 4 with the Calibrated Sensing Antenna moved to a position that is 15 
degrees above the **baseline** position.  Note this position as the **#2 Reference** 
Position. Repeat the power measurement made in Step 4. 

Verify that the maximum difference between the measurement and that taken in Step 4 does not exceed 1 dBw. 

Repeat Step 5 about the **#2 Reference** Position while maintaining the Calibrated Sensing Antenna at 15 degrees above the baseline position. Verify that the maximum deviation between any two measurements taken in this Step does not exceed 1 dBw. 

Step 7: 
Establish new reference #3 
Repeat Step 4 with the Calibrated Sensing Antenna moved to a position that is 30 
degrees above the baseline position.  Note this position as the **#3 Reference** 
Position. Repeat the power measurement made in Step 4. Verify that the maximum difference between the measurement and that taken in Step 4 does not exceed 1 dBw. 

Repeat Step 5 about the **#3 Reference Position** while maintaining the Calibrated Sensing Antenna at 30 degrees above the baseline position. Verify that the maximum deviation between any two measurements taken in this Step does not exceed 1 dBw. 

Step 8: 
Establish new reference #4 
Repeat Step 4 with the Calibrated Sensing Antenna moved to a position that is 5 
degrees below the baseline position.  Note this position as the **#4 Reference** 
Position. Repeat the power measurement made in Step 4. Verify that the maximum difference between the measurement and that taken in Step 4 does not exceed 1 dBw. Repeat Step 5 about the #4 Reference Position while maintaining the Calibrated Sensing Antenna at 5 degrees below the baseline position. 

Verify that the maximum deviation between any two measurements taken in this Step does not exceed 1 dBw. 

Step 9: 
Establish new reference #5 
Repeat Step 4 with the Calibrated Sensing Antenna moved to a position that is 15 
degrees below the baseline position.  Note this position as the **#5 Reference** 
Position. Repeat the power measurement made in Step 4. 

Verify that the maximum difference between the measurement and that taken in Step 4 does not exceed 1 dBw. 

Repeat Step 5 about the **#5 Reference** Position while maintaining the Calibrated Sensing Antenna at 15 degrees below the baseline position. Verify that the maximum deviation between any two measurements taken in this Step does not exceed 1 dBw. 

Step 10: Establish new reference #6 
Repeat Step 4 with the Calibrated Sensing Antenna moved to a position that is 30 
degrees below the baseline position.  Note this position as the **#6 Reference** 
Position. Repeat the power measurement made in Step 4. Verify that the maximum difference between the measurement and that taken in Step 4 does not exceed 1 dBw. 

Repeat Step 5 about the **#6 Reference** Position while maintaining the Calibrated Sensing Antenna at 30 degrees below the baseline position. Verify that the maximum deviation between any two measurements taken in this Step does not exceed 1 dBw. 

## 3.3.4.6.2 Verification Of Receiver Pattern Gain (Â§2.2.13.2) Purpose/Introduction:

The purpose of this procedure is to verify that the gain of an omni-directional antenna should not be less than the gain of a matched quarter-wave stub minus one dB over 90% of a coverage volume from 0 to 360 degrees in azimuth and -15 to +20 degrees in elevation when installed at the center of a 1.2 m (4 ft.) diameter (or larger) circular ground plane that can be either flat or cylindrical. 

This procedure **shall** be performed on final installed equipment with all appropriate connections and antenna in order to demonstrate proper operation of the final installation.  

## Equipment Required:

Provide the same equipment capability as that provided in Â§3.3.4.6.1. 

Note:  Figure 3-2, above, is exactly the same as Figure 3-1 provided in Â§3.3.4.6.1 with the exception that: 

a.  The ADS-B Transmitter in Figure 3-1 has been replaced with an ADS-B 
Receiver and an ADS-B Test Transmitter that is to be patched in for this test procedure. 
b.  The Transmitting Antenna under Test in Figure 3-1 has been replaced with a 
Receiving Antenna under Test. 
Step 1: 
Install ADS-B Transmission Capability 
On the Aircraft (or other applicable installation), disconnect the ADS-B Receiving Device to Antenna connection at the ADS-B Receiving device unit connector. 

For Class A0 Receiver installations, install an ADS-B Test Transmitting device having a minimum RF power of least 70 watts (i.e., 18.45 dBw, or 48.45 dBm) 
plus 3 dB.  If additional cabling or connectors are required to make the connection, then the added attenuation must be accounted for when applying the equations given in Â§3.3.4.6.1 in this procedure. 

For Class A1S, A1, A2, and A3 Receiver installations, install a ADS-B Test Transmitting device having a minimum RF power of least 125 watts (i.e., 
20.97dBw, or 50.97 dBm) *plus* 3 dB.  If additional cabling or connectors are required to make the connection, then the added attenuation must be accounted for when applying the equations given in Â§3.3.4.6.1 in this procedure. 

At this point, the ADS-B Receiving device of the ADS-B Receiving installation has been replaced with an appropriate RF source such that the radiated pattern of the receiving antenna installation can be verified.  The premise here is that if the radiated pattern is good, then so is the reception pattern. 

Step 2: 
Perform Radiated Pattern Tests 
Using the equations given in Â§3.3.4.6.1, with appropriate modifications if necessary, repeat steps 2 through 10 of Â§3.3.4.6.1. 

Step 3: 
Restore Original Installation 
Disconnect and remove the ADS-B Test Transmitter and restore the original installation of the ADS-B Receiving device. 

## 3.3.4.6.3 Verification Of Frequency Requirements For Transmit And Receive Antenna(S) (Â§2.2.13.3)

Procedures to properly verify the frequency of ADS-B Transmitting installations are provided in Â§3.3.4.6.1, step 2. 

Procedures to properly verify the frequency of ADS-B Receiving installations are provided in Â§3.3.4.6.2 by verification of the transmission frequency capability. 

## 3.3.4.6.4 Verification Of Impedance And Vswr (Â§2.2.13.4)

Purpose/Introduction: The purpose of this procedure is to verify that the VSWR produced by the antenna when terminated in a 50 ohm transmission line does not exceed 1.5:1 at 1090 MHz. 

Equipment Required: Appropriate Couplers and Connectors as required.  Coaxial Connection of known attenuation (shown in Figure 3-1 and Figure 3-2 as Coax #2).  Appropriate Attenuators as required.  HP 8562E Network Analyzer (or equivalent capability) 

## Measurement Procedure: Step 1: Install Network Analyzer

For ADS-B transmitting installations, disconnect the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Antenna connection at the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem unit connector. For ADS-B receiving installations, disconnect the ADS-B Receiving device to Antenna connection at the ADS-B Receiving device unit connector. 

Using appropriate attenuators, connectors, and coaxial cable of known attenuation and impedance, connect the Network Analyzer to the cable end of the Antenna connection (i.e., the connector just removed from the ADS-B Transmitting or Receiving device). 

Note:  The use of attenuators is strongly recommended such that the RF front end of the Network Analyzer is not destroyed.  If such happens, it is probable that the individual performing the test will not be performing similar tests in the future. 

Step 2: 
Perform Impedance and VSWR Measurements 
Using the Network Analyzer, measure the impedance of the antenna installation at a frequency of 1090 MHz. Verify that the impedance does not exceed 50 ohms. 

Using the Network Analyzer, measure the Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) of the antenna installation at a frequency of 1090 MHz. 

Verify that the VSWR does not exceed 1.5:1. 

## 3.3.4.6.5 Verification Of Polarization (Â§2.2.13.5)

Procedures to properly verify that the ADS-B Transmitting antenna is vertically polarized are provided in Â§3.3.4.6.1. 

Procedures to properly verify that the ADS-B Receiving antenna is vertically polarized are provided in Â§3.3.4.6.2. 

## 3.4 Flight Environment Data Sources

Aircraft systems and/or sensors, which supply flight environment data to the ADS-B 
system, **shall** be selected to meet the accuracy, range, and resolution requirements appropriate to the equipage category.  (Accuracy, range, and resolution may be shown to be adequate by analysis.) 

## ) 3.4.1 Navigation Accuracy Category (Nacp

The system **shall** report NAC
P
2.2.3.2.7.2.7
 (see Â§
) values appropriate to the navigation source (including its operational mode) that supplies data to the ADS-B system.  NACP 
value varies with navigation source selection and the selected sensor's current performance.  
If the aircraft has multiple navigation systems, NACP can vary with system selection and the mode of operation (e.g., Inertial Navigation with DME or GPS augmentation).  The reported NACP value (see Table 2-70) must vary to track navigation accuracy (NACP
) as it increases or decreases, corresponding to navigation system accuracy.   

## 3.4.2 Altitude

Barometric Pressure Altitude relative to a standard pressure of 1013.25 millibars (29.92 
in.Hg.) **shall** be supplied to the ADS-B system.  Altitude data, which is correctable for local barometric pressure, shall not be supplied to the ADS-B system.  The ADS-B system and the ATC transponder (if installed) **shall** derive Pressure Altitude from the same sensor (e.g., air data computer or encoding altimeter).    

## 3.4.3 Surface/ Air (Vertical) Status

Aircraft systems or sensors providing vertical status to the ADS-B system **shall** be implemented such that they provide a reliable indication that the aircraft is on the ground or airborne.  When considering likely failure modes, the system should fail to the "air" mode where possible (e.g., air/ground relay should relax to the "air" mode).   

## 3.5 Aircraft / Vehicle Data

ADS-B Messages contain information describing the aircraft or vehicle that is transmitting. It is a responsibility of the installer to insure that the vehicle information provided to the ADS-B system is correct.  

## 3.5.1 Fixed Data

Data that does not change during operation, is selected or loaded at installation (e.g., ADS-B 
Emitter Category, 24-bit ICAO address).  Fixed data **shall** accurately represent the individual airplane/vehicle characteristics or registration information.  If ADS-B and a Mode-S transponder are installed, both **shall** use the same 24-bit ICAO address (whenever both are operating). 

## 3.5.2 Variable Data

Controls used by the pilot/crew for data entry (e.g., flight number, call sign, emergency status) **shall** correctly perform their intended functions. 

Note: Where regulations permit variation of the 24 bit Mode-S and /or ADS-B address, ADS-B and a Mode-S transponder **shall** use the same ICAO address (whenever both are operating). 

## 3.5.3 On-Condition Sensors

Aircraft systems or sensors used to trigger on-condition messages **shall** be selected and implemented such that they provide a reliable indication of the specific condition(s) to be reported. 

## 3.5.4 Class Code (Basic)

 Class code information **shall** be set to accurately transmit the capability of the system as it is installed.  Class code can vary between aircraft depending upon installed options and equipment variations 

## 3.5.5 Capability Class Data

Capability class data include en route, terminal area, approach and landing, and surface operations capability information supplied by installed applications.  Capability class data (see Â§2.2.5.1.21 - Â§2.2.5.1.26) must respond to changes in the availability of operational mode data (see Â§2.2.5.1.28 - Â§2.2.5.1.31).    

## 3.6 Flight Test Procedures

This guidance material offers examples of flight test procedures for demonstration of performance of selected functions. 

Flight testing of installed systems may be desirable to confirm or supplement bench and ground tests of installed performance. Flight tests are not necessary to evaluate functions that encode, communicate, and decode messages, assemble reports, or generate displays, except for the radio frequency functions associated with transmission and reception of ADS-B Messages. 

## 3.6.1 Displayed Data Readability

Determine that normal conditions of flight do not significantly affect the readability of displayed data. 

## 3.6.2 Interference Effects

For those aircraft systems and equipment that can only be tested in flight, determine that no operationally significant conducted or radiated interference exists.  Evaluate all reasonable combinations of control settings and operational modes. 

Note: Electromagnetic interference flight tests are often conducted on all electronic systems in one test series, using procedures established by the aircraft manufacturer.  If such tests included the ADS-B equipment, no further tests are required. (e.g., ADS-B functionality added to an existing transponder and/or TCAS installation) 

## 3.6.3 Surveillance Testing

The surveillance flight test is designed to verify that the installed ADS-B system is capable of transmitting and/or receiving ADS-B squitter messages from other aircraft.   The following suggested procedures are typical flight test plans that could be followed in a region of low air traffic density: but any other test that supplies equivalent data would be acceptable. 

ADS-B system testing requires verification of transmission and reception of ADS-B 
Messages at the minimum range for the equipage class.  If testing an aircraft installation ("Subject") that broadcasts only, the receiving equipment ("Target") must provide a means to display message information, received from the Subject, to the operator. Shorter range (10 - 20 NM) operational requirements may be demonstrated using a ground based Target system.  Longer range operation might require an airborne Target system. Typically the airborne Target aircraft will fly a holding pattern at a designated fix and within 3000 feet of the Subject aircraft altitude. Fly the Subject aircraft straight and level at the minimum operational range and verify that data from the Subject are received reliably by the Target system.  If the Subject system has receive capability, verify that the Subject system reliably reports information about the Target. (e.g., displays Target at appropriate range and altitude with correct identification)   
Note: It is not intended that reception of individual squitter messages be verified.  
Fly the Subject aircraft in a figure 8 pattern, at the minimum operational range, at bank angles consistent with normal operations, at a constant altitude, and verify that transmitted data are received reliably by the Target system.  If the Subject system has receive capability, verify that the Subject system reliably reports information about the Target during maneuvering. (e.g., displays Target at appropriate range and altitude with correct identification)

## 4.0 Operational Characteristics And Functional Requirements

A description of 1090 MHz ADS-B System operation is followed by functional requirements for the System. 

## 4.1 System Operation

This subsection describes the operation of a generic/hypothetical ADS-B system during typical phases of flight operations.  The phases considered are: pre-flight, taxi out, take off/departure, en route, approach, landing/taxi, and shutdown.  A transport aircraft is assumed, possessing a full complement of sensors to allow reliable detection of various phases of flight.  Less complicated systems or aircraft might incorporate fewer modes of operation and variations on mode selection logic.   

## 4.1.1 General Operation: Transmitting Subsystem

The system has multiple operating modes to vary the amount and type of data transmitted as appropriate to the operating environment and to minimize traffic on the radio frequency data link(s).  Mode selection should be automated to the greatest practical degree to reduce crew work load and enhance system utility.  
Pre-flight:  Electrical power is applied to the airplane, thus powering the ADS-B system components.  The ADS-B function performs internal power up self tests, selects the transmitter to Standby mode, if available, and begins to collect data about own ship for transmission. Firm data such as tail number or 24-bit ICAO address is loaded or reloaded.  Flight number, if used, is set to all zeros as a result of the power having been removed for a time in excess of the transient switching interval protection.  The system, sensing that the aircraft is on the ground, attempts to acquire a new flight number (flight number sometimes will change whenever the aircraft is on the ground).  System power might not be interrupted.  Position 
(latitude/longitude/altitude) is acquired and State Vector messages are prepared and refreshed as required to maintain current information ready for transmission.  
Taxi Out:  When the crew selects "on" or the ADS-B function detects a taxi, or imminent operational condition (e.g., an engine oil pressure discrete + brake release + doors closed while on the ground) the Surface mode is selected and squitter transmission commences, transmitting State Vector and Partial Mode Status messages (flight identification). Squitters might be transmitted at a reduced rate while on the ground.  (General aviation airplanes might sense a GPS ground speed /position exceeding an accuracy threshold.)    
Note: Regulations might preclude automatic squitter commencement during taxi, limiting transmissions to the movement area.  Crew action may be required to begin squitter transmissions.  Transmitter power should not be reduced during surface operations, in order to maintain probability of reception in competition with proximate airborne transmitters.  
Take off / Departure:  When the ADS-B function detects a take off  (e.g., speed (IAS or Ground Speed) in excess of an appropriate minimum) the Air mode is selected.  Transmitted message type and squitter rate are adjusted as appropriate.  The on-ground status is broadcast until the ADS-B function detects an airborne condition (e.g., landing gear WOW/squat switch) or associated conditions are met to override a malfunctioning squat switch. 

En route:   Continue transmitting in Air mode. Approach: Continue transmitting in Air mode.  When the aircraft transitions to approach 
(e.g., flaps set appropriately for landing and speed reduced accordingly), the Air mode is continued and appropriate messages to support on-condition reports may be sent. 

Landing / Taxi in:  When the ADS-B function detects a landing configuration (e.g., gear down  (general aviation airplanes could use flap position only, or allow pilot selection), the Air mode is continued and appropriate messages to support on-condition reports may be sent.  Surface mode is not entered until the ADS-B function detects an on-ground condition 
(e.g., landing gear Weight On Wheels/squat switch).  (General aviation airplanes might use an appropriate IAS or Ground Speed, corresponding to minimum stall speed, dirty.)  Logic should be biased toward the air mode in case of a squat switch failure. 

Shutdown:  When the crew selects "Stand-by" squitter ceases. 

Note: Regulations might limit squitter during taxi, to the movement area.  Crew action may be required to inhibit transmission of squitters. 

## 4.1.2 General Operation:  Receiving Subsystem

The ADS-B system receive function performs two tasks.  A radio frequency receiver detects squitters from external sources and decodes messages.   A report generator collects and organizes the individual messages into reports and outputs the reports on a data bus(s) to user applications.  The most likely application is a cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI).  Other applications might include a conflict detector to inform the pilot if separation from other traffic is predicted to be less than desired.  A logical extension of the conflict detector is advisory information for maintaining the desired separation distance. 

This section describes the operation of a generic/hypothetical ADS-B system receiver. Unlike the ADS-B transmitter, the receiver operation varies only slightly with the phase of flight.  The RF squitter receiver continues to detect and decode any and all recognizable ADS-B Messages.  The report generator accepts control inputs from applications which allow it to filter out messages which are not of importance to the application.  Filtering allows for more efficient use of the available computing resources.    
Pre-flight:  Electrical power is applied to the airplane, thus powering the ADS-B system components.  The ADS-B function performs internal power up self tests.  The ADS-B 
receiver monitors the 1090 MHz frequency for squitters from other aircraft and generates reports for user systems such as a Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI).  Receiver sensitivity may be reduced in the Surface mode.  The report generator collects data about own ship such as tail number or ICAO address, used to recognize its own squitter transmissions.  Position (latitude/longitude/altitude) is acquired and continuously updated for message filtering based on range or altitude and for conflict detection.  The report generator may accept filter criteria from ADS-B applications and send to each application only the appropriate traffic reports. 

Taxi Out:   The receiver decodes messages and supplies them to the report generator.  The report generator, having received filter information from the CDTI, sends it reports only on traffic, which is within the CDTI-selected range and altitude.  The report generator, also having received filter information from a concurrently executing conflict detection application, sends it messages only from traffic whose position and altitude is consistent with aircraft or vehicles in the airport traffic pattern or movement area.  (Report filter criteria may differ between applications.) 
Take off / Departure: (same as preflight and taxi out except receiver sensitivity is at maximum in the Air mode.)  
En route:   The receiver decodes messages and supplies them to the report generator. The report generator, having received a range selection from the CDTI, sends it reports only on traffic which is within the CDTI-selected range and altitude.  The report generator, having received different filter information from another concurrently executing application, might send that further application reports on all traffic with an altitude greater than some threshold, (possibly selected to reject traffic in overflown airport patterns or on the surface) or near own altitude and within a given range. 

Approach:   The receiver decodes messages and supplies them to the report generator.  The report generator, having received a range selection from the CDTI, sends it reports only on traffic which is within the CDTI-selected range and altitude.  The report generator, having received approach filter information from another concurrently executing ADS-B 
application, might send that further application only reports consistent with aircraft in the airport traffic pattern. 

Landing / Taxi in:   The receiver decodes messages and supplies them to the report generator.  The report generator, having received a range selection from the CDTI, sends its reports on traffic that is within the CDTI-selected range and altitude.  Having received landing filter information from another concurrently executing ADS-B application that detected Gear down (i.e., "Landing"), the generator includes reports on traffic that is on the surface.  On touch down, the application filter criteria might be revised to reject airborne traffic above the local pattern altitude. 

Shutdown:   The receiver decodes messages and supplies them to the report generator until power is removed or a standby mode is selected. 

## 4.2 Operating Modes 4.2.1 Operating Modes:  Transmit

The 1090 MHz ADS-B system has two modes of operation, surface and air. Operational modes control variable link characteristics such as message types to be transmitted and squitter rates.  Switching between modes is accomplished automatically as required in Â§2.2.3.2.1.2.  Operational mode selection may be determined by reference to State Vector 
(SV) data elements such as speed.  It is possible to force the system to either mode while the aircraft is on the ground for testing (Â§2.2.11.1). 

## 4.2.1.1 Surface Mode

Surface mode is used on the ground but might be extended to low altitudes during take-off or approach.  In the Surface mode of operation, the system transmits State Vector messages and Mode Status (Flight Identification) at a reduced squitter rate and possibly with reduced receiver sensitivity levels.  When the 1090 MHz ADS-B System is implemented using a transponder, it is possible for a Mode-S ground sensor to command an airborne system to operate in the surface mode for brief periods of time (see RTCA DO-181E; Â§2.2.23.1.5.2). 

## 4.2.1.2 Air Mode

In the Air mode of operation, the system transmits all message types appropriate to its equipment class at the designated rates and power output level.  

## 4.2.2 Automatic Operation

The system transmits the required squitters for the equipment class, without crew intervention.  Own aircraft ADS-B position and velocity messages are formatted and transmitted without crew member inputs or adjustments such as mode selection or tuning. Similarly, ADS-B Messages from other sources are received, formatted into reports, and output to user systems, or displays, without crew member intervention.  (Mode selection on CDTI or other displays is acceptable since they are not considered part of the ADS-B 
function.) An exception is the Participant Address (ICAO 24-bit address).  In most installations, the address does not change and is "hard wired" at installation.  Where permitted by regulatory authorities, this address may be input by the crew. Certain messages related to Mode Status and On-Condition reports may be triggered by crew actions that satisfy the conditions for the automatic generation of an associated message. ADS-B System validity status is available to the crew, as required in Â§2.2.11.5. 

Crew member input of Mode Status (MS) information, where practical, (e.g., flight number) 
is acceptable.  The capability to acquire all message elements automatically is desirable. Automatic acquisition of data reduces crew work load and avoids data entry errors. Supplemental information may be entered via associated equipment.  

## 4.3 Self Test 4.3.1 Receive

If the system performs self tests, testing should indicate the ability to receive ADS-B  
messages. If the system generates test squitter transmissions to verify the ADS-B receiver function, the self test signal level at the antenna end of the transmission line shall not exceed â40 dBm as required in Â§2.2.11.1. 

## 4.3.2 Transmit

If the system performs self tests, testing should indicate the ability to send ADS-B Messages.  That ability implies the availability of the required message elements, whether derived internal to the system or provided by other aircraft systems.  The ability to send messages also implies the availability of the 1090 MHz data link transmitter. 

Note: The presence of valid incoming message(s) (from other than own ship) is not required to indicate the availability of a data link.  The ADS-B system may rely on the link system flags, valids, self test etc. to determine availability.  (ADS-B self test failure, attributed to a data link failure, should nominate the data link in a BIT message.) 

## 4.3.2.1 Broadcast Monitor

If the 1090 MHz ADS-B System is not implemented using a transponder, a squitter monitor verifies that the ADS-B transmitter generates squitter transmissions at a nominal rate.  The transmitter is considered to have failed when the monitor has detected squitter failure.  (ref. Â§2.2.11.2) 

## 4.3.2.2 Address Monitor

If the 1090 MHz ADS-B System is not implemented using a transponder, a Participant Address monitor is provided.  In the event that the ADS-B-transmitted Participant Address is all zeros or all ones, the system declares a failure.  (Â§2.2.11.3) 

## 4.3.2.3 Failure Annunciation

An output is provided to indicate the validity/non-validity of the ADS-B system.  Failure to generate squitters at the nominal rate, a failure detected by self-test, or a failure of the ICAO address verification causes the output to assume the invalid state.  Momentary power interrupts should not cause the output to latch in the invalid state.  The detection of a failure is available to be annunciated to the flight crew. (Â§2.2.11.5) 

## 4.4 Controls 4.4.1 Power On/Off (Optional)

The system should be powered whenever primary electrical power is available.  Circuits powering various system components or functions may be protected by individual circuit breakers.  Components or functions may receive power from multiple sources or busses (e.g. 115 vac and 28vdc). Aircraft with limited electrical system capacity may employ system power controls for energy conservation. 

## 4.4.2 Manual Test (Optional)

The system should provide a means for a manually initiated test of the system report generation function(s). 

## 4.4.2.1 Traffic Report

The manual test should cause the system to output a report of a "Test" traffic target such that the "Test" target appears on an associated CDTI display at a specified bearing and distance from the own-aircraft symbol. 

## 4.4.2.2 State Vector Report

The test should include a means for the crew or maintenance personnel to verify a subset of parameters in the own-aircraft SV report data.  The verifiable parameters should include: Position (Latitude, Longitude), Pressure Altitude, and Speed.  (e.g., The "Test" target displays own aircraft altitude, heading (or ground track) and speed (IAS or Ground Speed) 
while applying a constant offset to own aircraft latitude and/or longitude.) 

## 4.4.3 Participant Address (Optional)

At the manufacturer's option, a means may be provided to alter the unique participant address of the aircraft, within an allocated block of ICAO 24-bit addresses.   

Note: The system architecture will determine if the ICAO 24-bit address is entered into 
the data link unit or an associated peripheral device. 

## 4.4.4 Flight Number (Optional)

At the manufacturer's option, a means may be provided for the flight crew to enter the flight identification number or registration ("N" number, or equivalent). 

Note: The system architecture will determine if flight identification or registration number 
is entered into the data link unit or an associated peripheral device. 

## 4.4.5 1090 Mhz Ads-B Link Control (Optional)

At the manufacturer's option, a means may be provided for the flight crew to disable the 1090 MHz ADS-B link.  Disabling results in the cessation of transmission and/or reception of ADS-B Messages on 1090 MHz.  Control of transmission and reception of any other installed ADS-B systems is independent of the 1090 MHz ADS-B system status.  If an independent control of the ADS-B transmit system is provided to the flight crew, then the operational state of the ADS-B transmit system needs to be indicated to the flight crew, at all times. 

## 4.4.6 Standby

A means **shall** be provided for the flight crew to select a standby mode in which squitter transmissions are inhibited.  

## 4.4.7 Mode Control

The transmit function will accept appropriate data for on-condition or event driven message transmissions, as appropriate to the equipment capability classification.  At the manufacturer's option, a means may be provided for the flight crew to enter this data (e.g., Minimum Fuel, No Communications, Unlawful Interference, etc.) 
Control of Surface and Air mode switching shall not be available to the flight crew. 

## 4.4.8 Barometric Altitude

A means **shall** be provided for the flight crew to inhibit the broadcast of barometric altitude if directed to do so by ATC.

## Appendix A Extended Squitter Ads-B And Tis-B Formats And Coding Definitions

 
This Page Intentionally Left Blank 

## A Extended Squitter And Tis-B Formats And Coding Definitions A.1 Ads-B 1090 Mhz Formats And Coding A.1.1 Introduction

This Appendix is intended to be consistent with Section 2 of these MOPS.  However, in the event of conflict between this Appendix and Section 2, the requirements in Section 2 shall take precedence.   

## Notes :

1.  
This section of Appendix A defines the formats and coding for Extended Squitter ADS-B Messages.  When Extended Squitter capability is incorporated into a Mode S transponder, the registers used to contain the Extended Squitter messages are part of the transponder's Ground-Initiated Comm-B service.  This 
service consists of defined data available on board the aircraft being put into one 
of the 255 registers (each with a length of 56 bits) in the Mode S transponder by a serving process, e.g. ADS-B, at specified intervals.  The Mode S ground interrogator can extract the information from any of these registers at any time and pass it to the ground-based application.  In the case of Extended Squitter, the information in the registers defined for ADS-B are spontaneously broadcast as 
specified in RTCA/DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E).  Extended Squitter messages are generated by the Mode S transponder at periodic rates as defined by RTCA/DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E), when data is present in Register numbers 
0516, 0616, 0816, 0916, 6216 and 6516.  Each time data is loaded into Register 0A16 
the transponder will broadcast a single event-driven Extended Squitter.  Data 
loaded into Registers 0716 and 6116 while related to the Extended Squitter 
services is not used directly by the transponder for any Extended Squitter broadcast.  However the contents of these registers is available as part of the 
transponder's Ground-Initiated Comm-B service. 
2.  
If the Extended Squitter capability is implemented as a Non-Transponder Device, the convention for register numbering does not apply.  However, the data content is the same as specified for the transponder case, and the transmit times are as specified in the body of these MOPS.

## Notes:

1. The Register number is equivalent to the BDS B-Definition Subfield (BDS) value 
Â§2.2.14.4.20.b of RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.18.4.18.b).   
2. For ADS-B implementations on Mode S transponders, the data link capability report 
(Register 1016) is used to indicate Extended Squitter capability (bit 34) and the 
contents of this Register are updated within one second of the data changing and at 
least every four seconds thereafter.   
3. Register 0A16 is not to be used for GICB or ACAS crosslink readout.   
4. The term "minimum update rate" is used in this document.  The "minimum update 
rate" is obtained when data is loaded in one Register field once every "maximum update interval."   
5. A bit set in one of these Registers indicates that the service loading the Register 
indicated by that bit has been installed on the aircraft.  In this regard, these bits are 
not cleared to reflect a real time loss of an application, as is done for Register 1716. 
The details of the data to be entered into the registers assigned for Extended Squitter will be as defined in this Appendix.  Table A-1 specifies the minimum update rates at which the appropriate transponder register(s) will be reloaded with valid data.  Any valid data will be reloaded into the relevant field as soon as it becomes available at the Mode S 
Specific Services Entity (SSE) interface regardless of the update rate.  If data are not available for a time no greater than twice the specified "maximum update interval," or 2 seconds (whichever is the greater), then the status bit (if provided) will indicate that the data in that field are invalid, and the field will be ZEROed.   

## A.1.3 General Conventions On Data Formats A.1.3.1 Validity Of Data

The bit patterns contained in the 56-bit transponder registers **shall** be considered to be valid application data only if: 

1. The Mode S specific services capability is present.  This is indicated by bit 25 of the 
data link capability report contained in BDS 1,0 being set to "ONE;" 
2. The service corresponding to the application is shown as "supported" by the 
corresponding bit in the Common Usage Capability Report (BDS 1,7) being set to 
"ONE" for the Extended Squitter Registers 0516 to 0A16 inclusive. 

## Notes:

1. The intent of the capability bits in Register 1716 is to indicate that useful data is 
contained in the corresponding register.  For this reason, the bit for a register is cleared if data becomes unavailable (Â§
A.1.6.2) and set again when data insertion 
into the register resumes. 
2. A bit set in Register 1816 to 1C16 indicates that the application using this register 
has been installed on the aircraft.  These bits are not cleared to reflect a real 
time loss of an application, as is done for Register 1716.  
3. The data value is valid at the time of extraction.  This is indicated by a data field 
status bit (if provided).  When this status bit is set to "ONE," the data field(s) which follow, up to the next status bit, are valid.  When this status bit is set to "ZERO," the data field(s) are invalid. 

## A.1.3.2 Representation Of Numerical Data

Numerical data **shall** be represented as follows: 

1. Numerical data are represented as binary numerals.  When the value is signed, 2's 
complement representation is used, and the bit following the status bit is the sign bit. 
2. Unless otherwise specified, whenever more bits of resolution are available from the 
data source than in the data field into which that data is to be loaded, the data **shall** be 
rounded to the nearest value that can be encoded in that data field. 
Note:
 Unless otherwise specified, it is accepted that the data source may have less bits of resolution than the data field.   

3. When the data source provides data with a higher or lower range than the data field, 
the data shall be truncated to the respective maximum or minimum value that can be encoded in the data field. 
4. Where ARINC 429 data are used, the ARINC 429 status bits 30 and 31 are replaced 
with a single status bit, for which the value is VALID or INVALID as follows:  
a) If bits 30 and 31 represent "Failure Warning, No Computed Data" then the status 
bit **shall** be set to "INVALID."  
b) If bits 30 and 31 represent "Functional Test" then the status bit **shall** be set to 
"INVALID." 
c) If bits 30 and 31 represent "Normal Operation," "plus sign," or "minus sign," 
then the status bit **shall** be set to "VALID" provided that the data are being 
updated at the required rate.  
d) If the data are not being updated at the required rate, then the status bit **shall** be 
set to "INVALID."  
 
For interface formats other than ARINC 429, a similar approach is used. 
5. In all cases where a status bit is used, it must be set to "ONE" to indicate VALID and 
to "ZERO" to indicate INVALID.  
 This facilitates partial loading of the registers. 

## Note:

6. When specified in the field, the switch bit **shall** indicate which of two alternative data 
types is being used to update the parameter in the transponder Register. 
7. Where the sign bit (ARINC 429 bit 29) is not required for a parameter, it has been 
actively excluded.  
8. Bit numbering in the MB field **shall** be as specified in Annex 10, Volume IV, 
Â§3.1.2.3.1.3.   
9. Registers containing data intended for broadcast Comm-B **shall** have the broadcast 
identifier located in the eight most significant bits of the MB field.   

## Notes:

1. When multiple data sources are available, the one with the highest resolution should 
be selected.   
2. By default, values indicated in the range of the different fields of registers have been 
rounded to the nearest integer value or represented as a fraction.   
3. As used in these MOPS, BDS A,B is equivalent to Register Number AB16. 

## A.1.4 Extended Squitter Formats A.1.4.1 Format Type Codes

The first 5-bit ("ME" bits 1 - 5, Message bits 33 - 37) field in every Mode S Extended Squitter message will contain the format TYPE.  The format TYPE will differentiate the messages into several classes: Airborne Position, Airborne Velocity, Surface Position, Identification, Aircraft Intent, Aircraft State, etc.  In addition, the format TYPE will also encode the Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) of the source used for the position report.  The format TYPE will also differentiate the Airborne Messages as to the TYPE of their altitude measurements: barometric pressure altitude or GNSS height (HAE).  The 
5-bit encoding for format TYPE will conform to the definition contained in Table A-2.

## Notes For Table A-2:

1. "Baro Altitude" means barometric pressure altitude, relative to a standard pressure of 1013.25 millibars (29.92 in.Hg.).  It does not mean 
baro corrected altitude. 
2. TYPE codes 20 to 22 or TYPE Code 0 are to be used when valid "Baro Altitude" is not available. 
3. After initialization, when horizontal position information is not available but altitude information is available, the Airborne Position Message 
is transmitted with a TYPE Code of ZERO in bits 1-5, the barometric pressure altitude in bits 9 - 20, and bits 22 - 56 set to ZERO (0).  If 
neither horizontal position nor barometric altitude information is available, then all 56 bits of Register 0516 are set to zero.  The ZERO (0) 
TYPE Code field indicates that latitude and longitude information is not available, while the Zero altitude field indicates that altitude information is not available.   
4. If the position source is an ARINC 743A GNSS receiver, then the ARINC 429 data "label 130" data word from that receiver is a suitable 
source of information for RC, the horizontal integrity containment radius. (The label 130 data word is variously called HPL (Horizontal 
Protection Limit) or HIL (Autonomous Horizontal Integrity Limit) in different documents.   
5. The "NIC Supplement-A" in the Aircraft Operational Status Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6) enables the Report Assembly Function in ADS-B 
Receiving Subsystem to determine whether the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is announcing NIC=8 (RC < 0.1 NM) or NIC=9 (RC < 75 m). 
6. The "NIC Supplement-B" field in the Airborne Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.3.3), and NIC Supplement-A in the Aircraft Operational Status 
Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6) enables the Report Assembly Function in ADS-B Receiving Subsystem to determine whether the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem is announcing NIC=2 (RC < 8 NM) or NIC=3 (RC < 4 NM). 
7 
The "NIC Supplement-B" field in the Airborne Position Message (Â§2.2.3.2.3.3) and the "NIC Supplement-A" in the Aircraft Operational 
Status Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6) enables the Report Assembly Function in ADS-B Receiving Subsystem to determine whether the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem is announcing RC < 0.3 NM, or RC < 0.5 NM or RC < 0.6 NM.  
8. The NIC Supplement-A field in the Aircraft Operational Status Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.6) together with the NIC Supplement-C  field in the 
Surface Capability Class (CC) Code Subfield of the Aircraft Operational Status Message (Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.3.11) enable the Report Assembly 
Function in ADS-B Receiving Subsystem to determine whether the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is announcing NIC=7 with either (RC < 0.2 
NM) or  NIC=6 (RC < 0.3 NM) or  NIC=6 with (RC < 0.6 NM) or NIC=0 with (RC >= 0.6 NM or unknown). 
9. Future versions of these MOPS may limit transmission of Surface Position Messages at lower NIC and/or NACP values for Transponder-
Based systems. 

## A.1.4.1.1 Airborne Position Message Type Code A.1.4.1.1.1 Airborne Position Message Type Code If Containment Radius Is Available Notes:

1. If the position information comes from a GNSS receiver that conforms to the ARINC 
743A characteristic, a suitable source of information for the containment radius (RC), 
is ARINC 429 label 130 from that GNSS receiver.   
2. Although these requirements do not require HPL limiting, it is expected that some 
regulators will only accept installations that limit HPL.  This may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.   
If RC (containment radius) information is available from the navigation data source, then the transmitting ADS-B subsystem will determine the TYPE Code (the value of the TYPE subfield) of Airborne Position Messages as follows. 

a. If current valid horizontal position information is not available to the ADS-B 
Transmitting Subsystem, then the TYPE Code subfield of Airborne Position 
Messages will be set to ZERO (0). 
b. If valid horizontal position and barometric pressure altitude information are both 
available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will set the TYPE Code subfield of Airborne Position Messages to a value 
in the range from 9 to 18 in accordance with Table A-2. 
c. If valid horizontal position information is available to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem, but valid barometric pressure altitude information is not available, and 
valid geometric altitude information is available, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem 
will set the TYPE Code subfield of Airborne Position Messages to a value in the 
range from 20 to 22 depending on the radius of containment (RC ) in accordance with 
Table A-2. 
d. If valid horizontal position information is available to the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem, but neither valid barometric altitude information nor valid geometric altitude information is available, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will set the TYPE Code subfield in Airborne Position Messages to a value in the range from 9 to 
18 depending on the radius of containment RC in accordance with Table A-2.  (In that 
case, the ALTITUDE subfield of the Airborne Position Messages would be set to all ZEROs in order to indicate that valid altitude information is not available.) 

## A.1.4.1.1.2 Airborne Position Message Type Code If Containment Radius Is Not Available

If RC (radius of containment) information is NOT available from the navigation data source, then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will indicate NIC=0 by selecting a TYPE Code of 0, 18, or 22 in the Airborne Position Messages, as follows: 

a. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will set the TYPE Code subfield to ZERO (0) if 
valid horizontal position information is not available. 
b. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will set the TYPE Code subfield to 18 if valid 
pressure altitude information is available, or if neither valid pressure altitude nor valid geometric altitude information is available.   
If valid pressure altitude is not available, but valid geometric altitude information is available, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will set the TYPE Code subfield to 22.   
 

## A.1.4.1.1.3 Airborne Position Message Type Code During Fault Detection And Exclusion Condition

Under normal operating conditions, the RC can be directly determined from Horizontal Protection Limit (HPL) or Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL) inputs to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem from the GPS/GNSS receiver.  However, there are times when the Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) function of the GPS/GNSS receiver has detected a satellite failure but has not excluded the satellite from the navigation data solution.  For the purposes of these MOPS, the condition just described will be referred to as an "FDE Fault" which is typically annunciated by the GPS/GNSS receiver by an appropriate method.  For example, ARINC 743A compliant GPS/GNSS receivers will set Label "130" bit "11" to ONE (1) to indicate the "FDE Fault."  If an "FDE Fault" does not exist, then bit "11" is set to ZERO (0).  Of importance is the situation that even though an "FDE Fault" indication has been set, the GPS/GNSS typically continues to provide HPL or HIL data as well as Latitude, Longitude, and Velocity data while continuing to declare them to be valid on the interface.  As the "FDE Fault" condition represents a condition where the position and accuracy data cannot be guaranteed by the GPS/GNSS receiver, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will apply the following process upon detection of the "FDE Fault" annunciation:   
Note:
 If position sources can be demonstrated to overcome this degraded state of integrity when the "FDE Fault" condition occurs, then the following requirements do not apply. 

a. The "TYPE" Code of Airborne Position Messages will be set to either "18" or "22," 
whichever is applicable in order to indicate that RC is UNKNOWN. 
Note:
 The "TYPE" Code is not required to be set to ZERO (0), as to do so would 
indicate that there is NO Position Data which will result in the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem declaring an ADS-B Function Failure (see Â§2.2.11.6). 
b. Valid Latitude and Longitude Position data will continue to be processed and 
reported in the Airborne Position Message as required. 
c. The NIC Supplement-B subfield in the Airborne Position Message will be set to 
ZERO (0) in accordance with Â§A.1.4.10.6 and Table A-28 for a NIC Value of ZERO 
(0) when "TYPE" Code is set to either "18" or "22".   
d. The NIC Supplement-A subfield in the Airborne Aircraft Operational Status Message 
(TYPE=31, Subtype=0) will be set to ZERO (0) in accordance with Â§A.1.4.10.6 and 
Table A-28 for a NIC Value of ZERO (0) when "TYPE" code is set to either "18" or 
"22."   
e. The NACP subfield in the Aircraft Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, 
Subtype=0) **shall** be set to ZERO (0) in accordance with Â§A.1.4.9.9 and Table A-13 
in order to specify that the accuracy is UNKNOWN.   
f. 
The NACV subfield in the Airborne Velocity Message (TYPE=19) **shall** be set to 
ZERO (0) in accordance with Â§A.1.4.5.4 and Table A-5.    
Note:
 Factors such as surface multi-path have been observed to cause intermittent 
annunciation of "FDE Faults" by the GPS/GNSS receiver.  Such occurrences will result in the intermittent settings of the subfields addressed in subparagraphs "a," "c" and "d" above.  These intermittent conditions should be taken into account by ADS-B and Air Traffic Services that are using the data provided by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems.   

## A.1.4.1.2 Surface Position Message Type Code A.1.4.1.2.1 Surface Position Message Type Code If Containment Radius Is Available

If RC (horizontal radius of containment) information is available from the navigation data source, then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will use RC to determine the TYPE 
Code used in the Surface Position Message in accordance with Table A-2. 

## Notes:

1. If the position information comes from a GNSS receiver that conforms to the ARINC 
743A characteristic, a suitable source of information for the containment radius (RC), 
is ARINC 429 label 130 from that GNSS receiver.   
2. Although these requirements do not require HPL limiting, it is expected that some 
regulators will only accept installations that limit HPL.  This may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.   

## A.1.4.1.2.2 Surface Position Message Type Code If Radius Of Containment Is Not Available

If RC (horizontal radius of containment) information is not available from the navigation data source, then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will indicate NIC=0 by selecting a TYPE Code of 0 or 8 in the Surface Position Messages, as follows: 

a. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will set the TYPE Code subfield to ZERO (0) if 
valid horizontal position information is not available. 
b. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will set the TYPE Code subfield to 8 if valid 
horizontal position information is available.  (This TYPE Code indicates that radius 
of containment, RC, is either unknown or greater than or equal to 0.1 NM.) 

## A.1.4.1.2.3 Surface Position Message Type Code Based On Horizontal Protection Level Or Estimated Horizontal Position Accuracy

a. If valid horizontal position information is available, then the "TYPE" Code in the 
Surface Position Message will be set in the range from "5" to "8." 
b. If RC (Horizontal Radius of Containment) information is available from the 
navigation data source, the "TYPE" Code will be selected according to the RC value, 
in accordance with Table A-2. 
c. If RC is not available from the navigation data source, then the "TYPE" Code will be 
set to 8, and that NIC Supplement-A and NIC Supplement-C are set to ZERO (0). 

## A.1.4.1.2.4 Surface Position Message Type Code During Fault Detection And Exclusion Condition

Under normal operating conditions, the RC can be directly determined from Horizontal Protection Limit (HPL) or Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL) inputs to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem from the GPS/GNSS receiver.  However, there are times when the Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) function of the GPS/GNSS receiver has detected a satellite failure but has not excluded the satellite from the navigation data solution.  For the purposes of these MOPS, the condition just described will be referred to as an "FDE Fault" which is typically annunciated by the GPS/GNSS receiver by an appropriate method.  For example, ARINC 743A compliant GPS/GNSS receivers will set Label "130" bit "11" to ONE (1) to indicate the "FDE Fault."  If an "FDE Fault" does not exist, then bit "11" is set to ZERO (0).  Of importance is the situation that even though an "FDE Fault" indication has been set, the GPS/GNSS typically continues to provide HPL or HIL data as well as Latitude, Longitude, and Velocity data while continuing to declare them to be valid on the interface.  As the "FDE Fault" condition represents a condition where the position and accuracy data cannot be guaranteed by the GPS/GNSS receiver, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will apply the following process upon detection of the "FDE Fault" annunciation: 
Note:
 If position sources can be demonstrated to overcome this degraded state of integrity when the "FDE Fault" condition occurs, then the following requirements do not apply.    

a. The "TYPE" Code of Surface Position Messages will be set to "8" in order to 
indicate that RC is UNKNOWN.   
Note:
 The "TYPE" Code is not required to be set to ZERO (0), as to do so would 
indicate that there is NO Position Data which will result in the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem declaring an ADS-B Function Failure (see Â§2.2.11.6).   
b. Valid Latitude and Longitude Position data will continue to be processed and 
reported in the Surface Position Message as required. 
c. The NIC Supplement-A and NIC Supplement-C subfields in the Surface Aircraft 
Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, Subtype=1) will be set to ZERO (0) in 
accordance with Â§A.1.4.10.6 and Table A-28 for a NIC Value of ZERO (0) when 
"TYPE" Code is set to "8."    
d. The NACP subfield in the Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, 
Subtype=1) will be set to ZERO (0) in accordance with Â§A.1.4.9.9 and Table A-13 in 
order to specify that the accuracy is UNKNOWN.   
e. The NACV CC subfield in the Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message 
(TYPE=31, Subtype=1) will be set to ZERO (0) in accordance with Â§A.1.4.5.4 and 
Table A-5.   
Note:
 Factors such as surface multi-path have been observed to cause intermittent 
annunciation of "FDE Faults" by the GPS/GNSS receiver.  Such occurrences will result in the intermittent settings of the subfields addressed in subparagraphs "a," "c" and "d" above.  These intermittent conditions should be taken into account by ADS-B and Air Traffic Services that are using the data provided by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems. 

## A.1.4.2 Airborne Position Format

The Airborne Position squitter will be formatted as specified in the definition of Register 
0516 in Figure A-1.    
 Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs. 

## Note: A.1.4.2.1 Compact Position Reporting (Cpr) Format (F)

In order to achieve coding that is unambiguous world wide, CPR will use two format types, known as "**even**" and "odd."  This one-bit field ("ME" bit 22, Message bit 54) 
shall be used to define the CPR Format (F) type.  A CPR Format equal to ZERO (0) **shall** 
denote an "**even**" format coding, while a CPR Format equal to ONE (1) **shall** denote an 
"odd" format coding (Â§A.1.7.7). 

## A.1.4.2.2 Time Synchronization (T)

This one-bit field ("ME" bit 21, Message bit 53) will indicate whether or not the Time of Applicability of the message is synchronized with UTC time.  "T" equal to ZERO (0) will denote that the time is not synchronized to UTC.  "T" equal to ONE (1) will denote that Time of Applicability is synchronized to UTC time. When T=1, the time of validity in the Airborne Message format will be encoded in the 1- bit "F" field which (in addition to CPR format type) will indicate the 0.2 second time tick for UTC Time of Position Validity.  The "F" bit will alternate between 0 and 1 for successive 0.2 second time ticks, beginning with F=0 when the Time of Applicability will be an exact even-numbered UTC second. 

## A.1.4.2.3 Cpr Encoded Latitude/Longitude

The CPR Encoded Latitude/Longitude field in the Airborne Position Message will be a 34-bit field ("ME" bits 23 - 56, Message bits 55 - 88) containing the Latitude and Longitude of the Aircraft's Airborne Position.  The Latitude and Longitude will each occupy 17 bits.  The Airborne Latitude and Longitude encoding will contain Airborne CPR-encoded values in accordance with Â§A.1.7.  The unambiguous range for the local decoding of Airborne Messages will be 666 km (360 NM).  The positional accuracy maintained by the Airborne CPR encoding will be approximately 5.1 meters.  

## Notes:

1. The Latitude/Longitude encoding is also a function of the CPR format value (the "F" 
bit) described above. 
2. Although the positional accuracy of the airborne CPR encoding is approximately 5.1 
meters in most cases, implementers should be aware that the longitude position accuracy may only be approximately 10.0 meters when the latitude is either â87.0 
Â±1.0 degrees, or +87 Â±1.0 degrees.   

## A.1.4.2.3.1 Extrapolating Position (When T=1)

If "T" is set to one, Airborne Position Messages will have Times of Applicability that are exact 0.2 UTC second epochs.  In that case, the "F" bit will be ZERO (0) if the Time of Applicability is an even-numbered 0.2 second UTC epoch, or ONE (1) if the Time of Applicability is an odd-numbered 0.2 second epoch. 

Note 1:
 
Here, an "even-numbered 0.2 second epoch" means an epoch that occurs an 
even number of 200-millisecond time intervals after an even-numbered UTC 
second.  An "odd-numbered 0.2 second epoch" means an epoch that occurs an odd number of 200-millisecond time intervals after an even-numbered UTC second.  Examples of even-numbered 0.2 second UTC epochs are 12.0 s, 
12.4 s, 12.8 s, 13.2 s, 13.6 s, etc.  Examples of odd-numbered UTC epochs are 
12.2 s, 12.6 s, 13.0 s, 13.4 s, 13.8 s, etc.  
The CPR-encoded Latitude and Longitude that are loaded into the Airborne Position register will comprise an estimate of the A/V position at the Time of Applicability of that Latitude and Longitude, which is an exact 0.2 second UTC epoch.  The register will be loaded no earlier than 150 ms before the Time of Applicability of the data being loaded, and no later than 50 ms before the Time of Applicability of that data.   
This timing ensures that the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem may easily recover the Time of Applicability of the data in the Airborne Position Message, as follows: 

- 
If F=0, the Time of Applicability shall be the nearest even-numbered 0.2 second 
UTC epoch to the time that the Airborne Position Message is received. 
- 
If F=1, the Time of Applicability shall be the nearest odd-numbered 0.2 second 
UTC epoch to the time that the Airborne Position Message is received. 
Note 2:
 
If the Airborne Position register is loaded every 200 ms, the ideal time to load that register would be 100 ms before the Time of Applicability of the data being loaded.  The register would then be re-loaded, with data applicable at 
the next subsequent 0.2 second UTC epoch, 100 ms before that next subsequent 0.2 second epoch.  That way, the time of transmission of an Airborne Position Message would never differ by more than 100 ms from the Time of 
Applicability of the data in that message.  By specifying "100 ms Â± 50 ms" 
rather than 100 ms exactly, some tolerance is allowed for variations in implementation. 
The position data that is loaded into the Airborne Position register will be an estimate of the A/V position at the Time of Applicability.   

Note 3:
 
The position may be estimated by extrapolating the position from the time of validity of the fix (included in the position fix) to the Time of Applicability of the data in the register (which, if T=1, is an exact 0.2 UTC time tick).  This 
may be done by a simple linear extrapolation using the velocity provided with 
the position fix and the time difference between the position fix validity time and the Time of Applicability of the transmitted data.  Alternatively, other 
methods of estimating the position, such as alpha-beta trackers or Kalman filters, may be used. 
Every 200 ms, the contents of the position registers will be updated by estimating the A/V position at the next subsequent 0.2 second UTC epoch.  This process will continue with new position fixes as they become available from the source of navigation data. 

## A.1.4.2.3.2 Extrapolating Position (When T=0)

"T" will be set to ZERO (0) if the Time of Applicability of the data being loaded into the position register is not synchronized to any particular UTC epoch.  The position being transmitted must have a Time of Applicability that is no greater than 100 milliseconds from the time of transmission.  Additionally, the position register must be re-loaded with position data at intervals that are no more than 200 ms apart.  This ensures that the position contained in the position registers will have a Time of Applicability that is never more than 200 ms different from any time during which the register holds that data.  If the transmitted position data is loaded from the position register, the position register must be updated such that the 100 millisecond performance is achieved.   

Note:
 This may be accomplished by loading the Airborne Position register at intervals 
that are no more than 200 ms apart, with data for which the Time of 
Applicability is between the time the register is loaded and the time that it is loaded again.  For example, loading the register at 200 millisecond intervals 
would require that the time of applicability at register load time is exactly 100 
milliseconds ahead of the register load time.  Greater flexibility in the time of applicability at register load time is provided by increasing the update rate.   
If "T" is ZERO (0), then ADS-B Receiving Subsystems will accept Airborne Position Messages as being current as of the Time of Receipt.  Updating the position data as above ensures that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem does not induce more than 100 milliseconds of timing error into the transmitted position data.    

## A.1.4.2.3.3 Time-Out When New Position Data Is Unavailable

In the event that the navigation input ceases, the extrapolation described in Â§A.1.4.2.3.1 
and Â§A.1.4.2.3.2 will be limited to no more than two seconds.  At the end of this timeout of two seconds, all fields of the Airborne Position register, except the altitude field, will be cleared (set to zero).   
Note:
 The altitude field, bits 9 to 20 of the register, would only be cleared if current altitude data were no longer available.   
With the appropriate register fields cleared, the ZERO TYPE Code field will serve to notify ADS-B Receiving Subsystems that the data in the Latitude and Longitude fields are invalid. 

## A.1.4.2.4 Altitude

This 12-bit field ("ME" bits 9 - 20, Message bits 41 - 52) will provide the aircraft altitude.  Depending on the TYPE Code, this field will contain either:  

1. Barometric altitude encoded in 25 or 100 foot increments (as indicated by the Q Bit) 
or,  
2. GNSS height above ellipsoid (HAE).  
 GNSS altitude MSL is not accurate enough for use in the position report. 

## Note: A.1.4.2.5 Nic Supplement-B

The first 5-bit field ("ME" bits 1 - 5, Message bits 33 - 37) in every Mode S Extended Squitter Message contains the format TYPE Code.  The format TYPE Code differentiates the 1090ES Messages into several classes: Airborne Position, Airborne Velocity, Surface Position, Identification and Category, Aircraft Intent, Aircraft Status, etc.  In addition, the format TYPE Code also encodes the Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) value of the source used for the position report. The NIC Supplement-B is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 8, Message bit 40) subfield in the Airborne Position Message that is used in conjunction with the TYPE Code and NIC value to allow surveillance applications to determine whether the reported geometric position has an acceptable level of integrity containment region for the intended use.  The NIC integrity containment region is described horizontally using the radius of containment, RC.  The format TYPE Code also differentiates the Airborne Messages as to the type of their altitude measurements: barometric pressure altitude or GNSS height (HAE).  The 5-bit encoding for format TYPE Code and related NIC values conforms to the definition contained in Table A-28.  If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for the determination of the TYPE Code value based on the radius of containment within the past 2 seconds, then the TYPE Code value will be encoded to indicate that RC 
is "Unknown."   

## A.1.4.3 Surface Position Format

The Surface Position squitter will be formatted as specified in the definition of Register 
0616 in Figure A-2. 

 Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs. 

## Note: A.1.4.3.1 Movement

This 7-bit field ("ME" bits 6 - 12, Message bits 38 - 44) will provide information on the Ground Speed of the aircraft.  A non-linear scale will be used as defined in the Table A- 3, where speeds are given in km/h (kt).

## A.1.4.3.2 Heading A.1.4.3.2.1 Heading/Ground Track Status

This one bit field ("ME" bit 13, Message bit 45) will define the validity of the Heading value.  Coding for this field will be as follows:  0=not valid and 1= valid.  
Note: If a source of A/V Heading **is not** available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, but a source of Ground Track Angle is available, then Ground Track Angle may be used instead of Heading, provided

 that the STATUS BIT FOR 
HEADING subfield is set to ZERO (0) whenever the Ground Track Angle is not a reliable indication of the A/V's Heading.  (The Ground Track Angle is not a reliable indication of the A/V's Heading when the A/V's Ground Speed is low.  
Some regulators have already established such limits.  These limits may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.)  

## A.1.4.3.2.2 Heading/Ground Track Value

This 7-bit field ("ME" bits 14 - 20, Message bits 46 - 52) will define the direction (in degrees clockwise from true or magnetic north) of aircraft motion on the surface.  The Ground Track will be encoded as an unsigned Angular Weighted Binary numeral, with an MSB of 180 degrees and an LSB of 360/128 degrees, with ZERO (binary 000 0000) 
indicating a value of ZERO degrees.  The data in the field will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 360/128 degrees. 

Note:
 The reference direction for Heading (whether True North or Magnetic North) is 
indicated in the Horizontal Reference Direction (HRD) field of the Aircraft Operational Status Message (Â§A.1.4.10.13). 

## A.1.4.3.3 Compact Position Reporting (Cpr) Format (F)

The one-bit ("ME" bit 22, Message bit 54) CPR Format (F) field for the Surface Position Message will be encoded as specified for the Airborne Position Message.  That is, F = 0 
will denote an "**even**" format coding, while F = 1 will denote an "odd" format coding 
(Â§A.1.7.7).  

## A.1.4.3.4 Time Synchronization (T)

This one-bit field ("ME" bit 21, Message bit 53) will indicate whether or not the Time of Applicability of the message is synchronized with UTC time.  "T" equal to ZERO (0) will denote that the time is not synchronized to UTC.  "T" equal to ONE (1) will denote that Time of Applicability is synchronized to UTC time. When T=1, the time of validity in the Airborne Message format will be encoded in the 1- bit "F" field that (in addition to CPR format type) will indicate the 0.2 second time tick for UTC time of position validity.  The "F" bit will alternate between ZERO (0) and ONE (1) for successive 0.2 second time ticks, beginning with F=0 when the Time of Applicability is an exact even-numbered UTC second.   

## A.1.4.3.5 Cpr Encoded Latitude/Longitude

The CPR Encoded Latitude/Longitude field in the Surface Position Message will be a 34-
bit field ("ME" bits 23 - 56, Message bits 55 - 88) containing the Latitude and Longitude coding of the Aircraft's Surface Position.  The Latitude (Y) and Longitude (X) will each occupy 17 bits.  The Surface Latitude and Longitude encoding will contain Surface CPR-
encoded values in accordance with Â§A.1.7.  The unambiguous range for local decoding of Surface Messages will be 166.5 km (90 NM).  The positional accuracy maintained by the Surface CPR encoding will be approximately 1.25 meters.  

## Notes:

1. The Latitude/Longitude encoding is also a function of the CPR format value (the "F" 
bit). 
2. Although the positional accuracy of the surface CPR encoding is approximately 1.25 
meters in most cases, implementers should be aware that the longitude position accuracy may only be approximately 3.0 meters when the latitude is either â87.0 Â±1.0 degrees, or +87 Â±1.0 degrees. 
A.1.4.3.5.1 
Extrapolating Position (When T=1) 
This extrapolation will conform to Â§A.1.4.2.3.1 (Substitute "surface" for "airborne" 
where appropriate). 

A.1.4.3.5.2 
Extrapolating Position (When T=0) 
This extrapolation will conform to Â§A.1.4.2.3.2 (Substitute "surface" for "airborne" 
where appropriate). 

A.1.4.3.5.3 
Time-Out When New Position Data is Unavailable 
This time-out will conform to Â§A.1.4.2.3.3 (Substitute "surface" for "airborne" where appropriate). 

## A.1.4.4 Identification And Category Format

The Identification and Category squitter will be formatted as specified in the definition of Register 0816 in Figure A-4. 

Note:
 Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs. 

## A.1.4.4.1 Aircraft Identification Coding

Note:
 The coding of Aircraft Identification is defined in Â§2.2.19.1.13 of RTCA DO-
181E (EUROCAE ED-73E, Â§3.23.1.13).  It is reproduced here for convenience. 

Each character will be coded as a six-bit subset of the ICAO 7-unit coded character set 
(ICAO Annex 10, Vol. IV, Â§3.1.2.9.1.2, Table 3-9) as specified in the Table A-4.  The character set will be transmitted with the most significant bit (MSB) first.  The reported aircraft code will begin with character 1.  Characters will be coded consecutively without leading or an intervening SPACE code.  Any unused character spaces at the end of the subfield will contain a SPACE character code.

## A.1.4.5 Airborne Velocity Format

The Airborne Velocity squitter will be formatted as specified in the definition of Register 
0916 in Figure A-5. 

Note: Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs. 

## A.1.4.5.1 Subtypes 1 And 2

Subtypes 1 and 2 of the Airborne Velocity format will be used when the transmitting aircraft's velocity over ground is known.  Subtype 1 will be used for velocities under 
1000 knots and Subtype 2 will be used for aircraft capable of supersonic flight when the velocity might exceed 1022 knots. 

This message will not be broadcast if the only valid data is the Intent Change flag 
(Â§
A.1.4.5.3).  After initialization, broadcast will be suppressed by loading Register 0916 
with ALL ZEROs and then discontinuing updating the register until data input is available again. The supersonic version of the velocity coding will be used if either the East-West OR North-South velocities exceed 1022 knots.  A switch to the normal velocity coding will be made if both the East-West AND North-South velocities drop below 1000 knots. 

## A.1.4.5.2 Subtypes 3 And 4

Subtypes 3 and 4 of the Airborne Velocity format will be used when the transmitting aircraft's velocity over ground is not known.  These Subtypes will substitute Airspeed and Heading for the velocity over ground.  Subtype 3 will be used at subsonic velocities, while Subtype 4 will be reserved for Airspeeds in excess of 1000 knots. 

The Air Referenced Velocity is contained in the Airborne Velocity Subtypes 3 and 4, and the velocity information is required from only certain classes of ADS-B equipped aircraft.   
Note:
 Air Referenced Velocity Messages may be received from airborne aircraft that are also broadcasting messages containing ground referenced velocity information.  ADS-B Receiving Subsystems conformant to these MOPS are required to receive and process ground referenced and Air Referenced Velocity Messages from the same aircraft and output the corresponding reports. Although not required in these MOPS, future versions of these MOPS will specify under what conditions both ground referenced and air referenced velocity would be transmitted.  This is intended to provide compatibility with anticipated future requirements for the transmission of both types of velocity information. 

This Airborne Velocity Message will not be broadcast if the only valid data is the Intent Change flag (Â§
A.1.4.5.3).  After initialization, broadcast will be suppressed by loading Register 0916 with ALL ZEROs and then discontinuing updating the register until data input is available again. The supersonic version of the Velocity Message coding will be used if the Airspeed exceeds 1022 knots.  A switch to the normal velocity coding will be made if the Airspeed drops below 1000 knots. 

## A.1.4.5.3 Intent Change Flag In Airborne Velocity Messages

An Intent Change event will be triggered 4 seconds after the detection of new information being inserted in Registers 4016 to 4216.  The code will remain set for 18 Â±1 seconds following an intent change. Intent Change Flag coding: 
0 = no change in intent 1 = intent change 

## Notes:

1. Register 4316 is not included since it contains dynamic data that will be continuously 
changing. 
2. A four-second delay is required to provide for settling time for intent data derived 
from manually set devices. 

## A.1.4.5.4 Navigation Accuracy Category For Velocity (Nacv)

This 3-bit ("ME" bits 11-13, Message bits 43-45) subfield will indicate the Navigation Accuracy Category for Velocity (NACV) as specified in Table A-5.    
The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will accept, via an appropriate data interface, data from which the own-vehicle Navigation Accuracy Category for Velocity (NACV) may be determined, and it will use such data to establish the NACV subfields in transmitted ADS-
B Airborne Velocity Messages.   
If the external data source provides 95% accuracy figures of merit for horizontal velocity, then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will determine the value of the NACV field in the Airborne Velocity Messages, Subtypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 according to Table A-5.

## A.1.4.5.5 Heading In Airborne Velocity Messages A.1.4.5.5.1 Heading Status

This one bit ("ME" bit 14, Message bit 46) subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages, Subtype 3 or 4 will define the availability of the Heading value.  Coding for this field will be:  0 = not available and 1 = available. 

## A.1.4.5.5.2 Heading Value

This 10-bit ("ME" bits 15 - 24, Message bits 47 - 56) subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages, Subtype 3 or 4 will give the Aircraft Heading (in degrees clockwise from true or magnetic north) when velocity over ground is not available.  The Heading will be encoded as an unsigned Angular Weighted Binary numeral with an MSB of 180 degrees and an LSB of 360/1024 degrees, with ALL ZEROs (binary 00 0000 0000) indicating a value of ZERO degrees.  The data in the field will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 360/1024 degrees. 

Note:

 The reference direction for Heading (whether True North or Magnetic North) is 
  indicated in the Horizontal Reference Direction (HRD) field of the Aircraft 
  Operational Status Message (Â§
                                         ). 

A.1.4.10.13

## A.1.4.5.6 Difference From Baro Altitude In Airborne Velocity Messages

This 8-bit ("ME" bits 49 - 56, Message bits 81 - 88) subfield will give the signed difference between barometric and GNSS altitude.  (Coding for this field will be as indicated in Figure A-5 and Figure A-6). 

If Airborne Position is being reported using Format TYPE Codes 9 or 10, only GNSS HAE will be used.  For Format TYPE Codes 9 or 10, if GNSS HAE is not available, the field will be coded with ALL ZEROs.  For Format TYPE Codes 11 through 18, either GNSS HAE or altitude MSL will be used.  The basis for the Baro Altitude difference (either GNSS HAE or altitude MSL) will be used consistently for the reported difference.   
 Although the above requirements allows this subfield to be based on MSL in 

Note:
certain cases, it is expected that some regulators will only accept installations that report based on WGS-84 HAE.  HAE will be required for some State mandates and the manufacturer must ensure that when converting from HAG (e.g., MSL) to HAE, the same model used by the position source is used.  This may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.   

## A.1.4.6 Aircraft Status Register Format

The Aircraft Status register will be formatted as specified in the definition of Register 
0716 in Figure A-3. 

Note: Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs. 

## A.1.4.6.1 Purpose

Note:
 Unlike the other Extended Squitter registers, the contents of this register are not 
broadcast.  The purpose of this register is to serve as an interface between the 
transponder function and the General Formatter/Manager function (GFM, A.1.6).  The two fields defined for this format are the Transmission Rate Subfield and the Altitude Type Subfield. 

## A.1.4.6.2 Transmission Rate Subfield (Trs)

This field will only be used for a transponder implementation of Extended Squitter. The TRS will be used to notify the transponder of the aircraft motion status while on the surface.  If the aircraft is moving, the surface position squitter will be broadcast at a rate of twice per second, and identity squitters at a rate of once per 5 seconds.  If the aircraft is stationary, the surface position squitter will be broadcast at a rate of once per 5 seconds and the identity squitter at a rate of once per 10 seconds. 

The algorithm specified in the definition of Register 0716 will be used by the GFM 
(Â§A.1.6) to determine motion status and the appropriate code will be set in the TRS subfield.  The transponder will examine the TRS subfield to determine which rate to use when it is broadcasting surface squitters. 

## A.1.4.6.3 Altitude Type Subfield (Ats)

This field will only be used for a transponder implementation of Extended Squitter. 

Note:
 The transponder normally loads the altitude field of the airborne position 
squitter from the same digital source as used for addressed replies.  This is done to minimize the possibility that the altitude in the squitter is different from the altitude that would be obtained by direct interrogation.   
If the GFM (Â§
A.1.6) inserts GNSS height (HAE) into the airborne position squitter, it will instruct the transponder not to insert the baro altitude into the altitude field.  The ATS subfield will be used for this purpose. 

## A.1.4.7 Event-Driven Protocol

A message inserted in Register 0A16 (or an equivalent transmit register) will be broadcast once by the transponder at the earliest opportunity.  Formats for messages using this protocol will be identical to those defined for Register 6116  (see Figure A-7). 

Note:
                  A.1.6
      The GFM (Â§
                       ) is responsible for ensuring pseudo-random timing, priority 
       and for observing the maximum transmission rate for this register of 2 per 
       second.  Additional details are specified in Â§A.1.6.4 and in the following 
       paragraphs. 

## A.1.4.7.1 Purpose

Note:
 The Event-Driven protocol is intended as a flexible means to support the broadcast of messages beyond those defined for position, velocity, and identification.  These typically will be messages that are broadcast regularly for a period of time based on the occurrence of an event and/or having a variable broadcast rate as determined by processes external to the transponder.  Two examples are: (1) the broadcast of Emergency/Priority Status at a periodic rate during a declared aircraft emergency, and (2) the broadcast of TCAS Resolution Advisory data during a declared event.   

## A.1.4.7.2 Tcas Resolution Advisory (Ra) Broadcast

The 1090ES TCAS RA Broadcast Message contains the same information as the RA 
message readout using the GICB protocol, including the aircraft ICAO 24-bit Address.  A 
ground-based 1090ES receiver with an omni-directional receiving capability can provide TCAS RA Messages to the ground systems much sooner than with a scanning beam antenna.  The TCAS RA information is defined as a Subtype=2 of the existing 1090ES Aircraft Status Message. The airborne aircraft broadcast rates and priorities for the TCAS RA Broadcast Message are defined below and in ICAO Document 9871, Â§B.2.3.8.2.  The format for broadcasting a 1090ES Aircraft Status Message with TCAS RA Message content (1090ES Message TYPE=28, Subtype=2) is defined here in Figure A-8b, and in ICAO Document 9871, Table B-2-97b.   

## A.1.4.7.2.1 Transmission Rate

The ADS-B Aircraft Status (TYPE=28) TCAS RA Broadcast Message (Subtype=2) will be broadcast starting within 0.5 seconds after the transponder notification of the initiation of a TCAS Resolution Advisory. The ADS-B Aircraft Status (TYPE=28) TCAS RA Broadcast Message (Subtype=2) will be broadcast using the Event-Driven Protocol at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds for the duration of the TCAS Resolution Advisory.     

## A.1.4.7.2.2 Message Delivery

ADS-B Aircraft Status TCAS RA Broadcast Message delivery is accomplished using the Event-Driven protocol.  The broadcast of the TCAS RA Broadcast Message will be terminated 24 Â±1 seconds after the Resolution Advisory Termination (RAT) flag (see ICAO Annex 10, Volume IV, Â§4.3.8.4.2.2.1.3) transitions from ZERO (0) to ONE (1). The broadcast of the ADS-B Aircraft Status TCAS RA Broadcast Message takes priority over the Emergency/Priority Status broadcast, and all other Event-Driven Message types, as specified in Â§A.1.6.4.3.   

## A.1.4.7.3 Emergency/Priority Status And Mode A Code

Register 6116 contains an exact bit-for-bit duplication of the Emergency/Priority Status information that is broadcast using an Event-Driven Aircraft Status Extended Squitter Message (TYPE=28 and Subtype=1).  Subtype=1 is used specifically to provide Emergency/Priority Status information and the broadcast of the Mode A (4096) Code.  
The contents of Register 6116 will be formatted as specified in Figure A-8a. 

 Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs.  

## Note: A.1.4.7.3.1 Transmission Rate

The Aircraft Status (TYPE=28) Emergency/Priority Status ADS-B Message (Subtype=1) will be broadcast using the EventâDriven protocol.  The rate of transmission varies depending on other conditions.  If the transmission of the Mode A Code is disabled, the transmission of the "Emergency/Priority Status Message" occurs only when an emergency condition is active.  When the transmission of the Mode A Code is enabled, the transmission rate of the "Emergency/Priority Status Message" depends on whether the Mode A Code is changed, or if an emergency condition is active.   
When the Mode A Code is set to "1000," the 1090ES Transmitting Subsystem will disable the transmission of the Mode A Code and broadcast the "Emergency/Priority Message" in accordance with Â§A.1.4.7.3.1.1 only when an emergency is declared.  
Otherwise, the Mode A Code transmission is enabled and the broadcast rates of 
Â§A.1.4.7.3.1.2 apply.    

Note:
 The use of Mode A Code "1000" for this purpose is in accordance with the ICAO 
Doc 9871 provision to disable the transmission of the Mode A Code on 1090ES. This will occur at such time that the ATC systems no longer depend on the Mode A Code to identify aircraft.   

## A.1.4.7.3.1.1 "Emergency/Priority Status Message" Broadcast Rates When Transmission Of Mode A Code Is Disabled

When the Mode A Code transmission is disabled as per Â§A.1.4.7.3.1, the following transmit rates apply: 

a. The "Emergency/Priority Status Message" (TYPE=28, Subtype=1) will be broadcast 
at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds relative to the previous "Emergency/Priority Status" for the duration of the emergency condition which is established by any value other than ZERO in the "Emergency/Priority Status" subfield.   
Note:
 Emergency conditions resulting from the Mode A Code being set to 7500, 
7600 or 7700 are covered by the requirements in Â§A.1.4.7.3.1.2.   

b. In the case where there is no emergency condition established by a ZERO value in 
the "Emergency/Priority Status" subfield, then the "Emergency/Priority Status Message" will not be broadcast.   

## A.1.4.7.3.1.2 Emergency/Priority Status Message" Broadcast Rates When Transmission Of Mode A Code Is Enabled

When the Mode A Code transmission is enabled as per Â§A.1.4.7.3.1, the following transmit rates apply: 

a. The "Emergency/Priority Status" (TYPE=28, Subtype=1) will be broadcast at 
random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds relative to the previous "Emergency/Priority Status" under the following conditions: i. 
For a duration of 24 Â±1 seconds following a Mode A Code change by the pilot except if the Mode A Code is changed to 7500, 7600 or 7700.   
Note:
 The case where the Mode A Code is set to 7500, 7600 or 7700, the 
transmission of the emergency condition is covered by ii. below.  Setting the Mode A Code to 7500, 7600 or 7700 is indicated by a Permanent Alert in the "Surveillance Status" field (value of 1) (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.2).  A 
change in the Mode A Code, except to 7500, 7600 or 7700, is indicated by a Temporary Alert in the "Surveillance Status" subfield (value of 2) (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.2).   
ii. For the duration of an emergency condition by any non-ZERO value in the 
"Emergency/Priority Status" subfield, if the emergency code is cleared by the pilot changing the Mode A Code to other than 7500, 7600 or 7700, the broadcast of the "Emergency/Priority Status" Message will be continued for 24 Â±1 seconds 
as "i" above.   
b. In the absence of conditions specified in "a" above, the "Emergency/Priority Status" 
Message will be broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 4.8 to 5.2 seconds relative to the previous "Emergency / Priority Status" Message.   

## A.1.4.7.3.2 Message Delivery

The Aircraft Status (TYPE=28) Emergency/Priority Status (Subtype=1) Message delivery will be accomplished using the Event-Driven protocol (Â§A.1.4.7).  The broadcast of this message takes priority over the Event-Driven protocol broadcasts of all other message types, except for the ADS-B Aircraft Status TCAS RA Broadcast Message 
(TYPE=28, Subtype=2), which takes priority over the Emergency/Priority Status broadcast, and all other Event-Driven Message types, as specified in Â§A.1.6.4.3.   

## A.1.4.8 Periodic Status Messages

Operational Status Messages and Target State and Status Messages are Periodic Status Messages that are broadcast independently in the same manner as the Airborne Position, Surface Position, Airborne Velocity and Aircraft Identification Messages.  In previous versions of these MOPS, Operational Status and Target State and Status Messages were included under the event-driven protocol and subject to the hard limit of 2 transmissions per second in any second as per Â§A.1.6.4.  Analysis is provided that verifies that the combination of Periodic Status Messages and Event-Driven Messages does not exceed 2 
messages per second averaged over 60 seconds. 

## A.1.4.9 Target State And Status Information

Register 6216 contains an exact bit-for-bit duplicate of the Target State and Status Extended Squitter Message (TYPE=29 and Subtype=1), and will be formatted as specified in Figure A-9.   
 Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs. 

## Note: A.1.4.9.1 Transmission Rate

This message will be broadcast at random intervals uniformly distributed over the range of 1.2 to 1.3 seconds for the duration of the operation.   

Note:
 In previous versions of these MOPS, the Target State and Status Message was 
delivered using the Event-Driven protocol.   

## A.1.4.9.2 Source Integrity Level (Sil) Supplement

The "SIL Supplement" (Source Integrity Level Supplement) subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 
8, Message bit 40) field that defines whether the reported SIL probability is based on a "per hour" probability or a "per sample" probability as defined in Table A-6.

Note:
 The probability of exceeding the integrity radius of 
containment for GNSS position sources are based on a per hour basis, as the NIC will be derived from the GNSS Horizontal Protection Level (HPL) which is based on a 
probability of 1x10-7 per hour.

Note:
 The probability of exceeding the integrity radius of 
containment for IRU, DME/DME and DME/DME/LOC position sources may be based on a per sample basis. 

## A.1.4.9.3 Selected Altitude Type

The "Selected Altitude Type" subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 9, Message bit 41) field that will be used to indicate the source of Selected Altitude data that is being used to encode 
"ME" bits 10 - 20 (Message bits 42 - 52).  Encoding of the "Selected Altitude Type" is defined in Table A-7.  Whenever there is no valid MCP / FCU or FMS Selected Altitude data available, then the "Selected Altitude Type" subfield is set to ZERO (0).

Flight Control Unit (MCP / FCU) or equivalent equipment, such data will be used to encode "ME" bits 10 - 20 (Message bits 42 - 52) in accordance with Table A-8.  Use 
of MCP / FCU Selected Altitude is then declared in the "Selected Altitude Type" subfield as specified in Table A-7.   
c. Whenever valid Selected Altitude data is NOT available from the Mode Control 
Panel / Flight Control Unit (MCP / FCU) or equivalent equipment, but valid Selected 
Altitude data is available from the Flight Management System (FMS), then the FMS Selected Altitude data is used to encode "ME" bits 10 - 20 (Message bits 42 - 52) in 
accordance with Table A-8.  Use of FMS Selected Altitude is then declared in the "Selected Altitude Type" subfield as specified in Table A-7. 
d. Encoding of Selected Altitude data in "ME" bits 10 - 20 (Message bits 42 - 52) is in 
accordance with Table A-8.  Encoding of the data is rounded so as to preserve 
accuracy of the source data within  Â±Â½ LSB.   
e. Whenever there is NO valid MCP / FCU or FMS Selected Altitude data available, 
then the "MCP / FCU Selected Altitude or FMS Selected Altitude" subfield ("ME" bits 10 - 20, Message bits 42 - 52) will be set to ZERO (0) as indicated in Table A-8.

## A.1.4.9.8 Selected Heading

a. The "Selected Heading" subfield is an 8-bit ("ME" bits 32 - 39, Message bits 64 - 
71) field that contains Selected Heading data encoded in accordance with Table A-
12.   
b. Encoding of Selected Heading data in "ME" bits 31 - 39 (Message bits 63 - 71) will 
be rounded so as to preserve accuracy of the source data within Â±Â½ LSB. 
c. Whenever there is NO valid Selected Heading data available, then the Selected 
Heading Status, Sign, and Data subfields ("ME" bits 30 - 39, Message bits 62 - 71) 
will be set to ZERO (0) as indicated in Table A-12.   
Note: The Selected Heading parameter does not have a source bit in this version of these MOPS to indicate its reference orientation (True North or Magnetic North).  Implementers of the Target State and Status Message are encouraged whenever possible to use input parameters to populate this field that utilize Magnetic North orientation, as that is the de facto standard utilized by most users of this data.  However since many aircraft have flight decks that can operate in either True North or Magnetic North orientation, this field should be encoded with the current active value in the flight deck, regardless of orientation. Users of the Selected Heading data should be aware that there is no method defined in this version of these MOPS to indicate its reference orientation.

## Notes:

1. The Estimated Position Uncertainty (EPU) used in the table is a 95% accuracy 
bound on horizontal position.  EPU is defined as the radius of a circle, centered on the reported position, such that the probability of the actual position lying outside the circle is 0.05.  When reported by a GPS or GNSS system, EPU is commonly called HFOM (Horizontal Figure of Merit). 
2. RNP accuracy includes error sources other than sensor error, whereas horizontal 
error for NACP only refers to horizontal position error uncertainty. 
3. A non-excluded satellite failure requires that the NACP parameter be set to ZERO 
(binary 0000) along with RC being set to Unknown to indicate that the position has 
been determined to be invalid (see Â§A.1.4.1.1.3 and Â§A.1.4.1.2.4).   

## A.1.4.9.10 Navigation Integrity Category For Baro (Nicbaro)

This 1-bit ("ME" bit 44, Message bit 76) subfield will be used to indicate whether or not the barometric pressure altitude being reported in the Airborne Position Message (Â§A.1.4.2) has been cross-checked against another source of pressure altitude.  The NICBARO subfield will be encoded as shown in Table A-14.  If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for NICBARO within the past 2 seconds, then the NICBARO subfield will be encoded as a value of ZERO (0).

## Notes:

1. The barometric altitude value itself is conveyed within the ADS-B Position Message. 
2. The NICBARO subfield provides a method of indicating a level of data integrity for 
aircraft installed with Gilham encoding barometric altitude sources.  Because of the potential of an undetected error when using a Gilham encoded altitude source, a comparison will be performed with a second source and only if the two sources 
agree will the NICBARO subfield be set to a value of "1".  For other barometric 
altitude sources (Synchro or DADS) the integrity of the data is indicated with a validity flag or SSM.  No additional checks or comparisons are necessary.  For these 
sources the NICBARO subfield will be set to a value of "1" whenever the barometric 
altitude is valid. 
3. The use of Gilham type altimeters is strongly discouraged because of the potential 
for undetected altitude errors. 

## A.1.4.9.11 Source Integrity Level (Sil)

This 2-bit ("ME" bits 45 - 46, Message bits 77 - 78) subfield will be used to define the probability of the reported horizontal position exceeding the radius of containment defined by the NIC, without alerting, assuming no avionics faults.  Although the SIL 
assumes there are no unannunciated faults in the avionics system, the SIL must consider the effects of a faulted Signal-in-Space, if a Signal-in-Space is used by the position source.  The probability of an avionics fault causing the reported horizontal position to exceed the radius of containment defined by the NIC, without alerting, is covered by the System Design Assurance (SDA) parameter (Â§A.1.4.10.14). 

The SIL probability can be defined as either "per sample" or "per hour" as defined in the SIL Supplement (SILSUPP) in Â§A.1.4.9.2.   

## Notes:

1. For GNSS position sources the HIL or HPL is provided with a probability of 1x10-7 
per hour, which should be used to set the SIL to 3. 
2. The GPS defined HPL probability rate of 10-7 per hour is based on the GPS 
constellation fault rate of 10-4 per hour and a 10-3 probability of missed detection, 
given that the fault occurs.  Different containment radii indicated by the HPL are all 
defined at the missed detection probability of 10-3.    
3. Fault detection is an essential consideration in determining the SIL parameter.  Fault 
detection assures, at a specified probability of missed detection, that the error is no greater than a specified limit without an alert.   
4. For alternate ADS-B position sources to report integrity, they will need to be 
certified for their fault detection characteristics.   
The "SIL" subfield is encoded in accordance with Table A-15.  For installations where the SIL value is being dynamically updated, if an update has not been received from an on-board data source for SIL within the past 2 seconds, then the SIL subfield will be encoded as a value of ZERO (0), indicating "Unknown."

## Notes:

1. ADS-B does not consider TCAS Operational equal to ONE (1) unless the TCAS is in 
a state which can issue an RA (e.g., RI=3 or 4). 
2. As a reference point, RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E) Mode-S Transponders 
consider that the TCAS/ACAS System is operational when "MB" bit 16 of Register 
1016 is set to "ONE" (1).  This occurs when the transponder / TCAS/ACAS interface 
is operational and the transponder is receiving TCAS/ACAS RI=2, 3 or 4.  (Refer to 
RTCA DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E), Appendix B, Table B-3-16.)  RI=0 is STANDBY, RI=2 is TA ONLY and RI=3 is TA/RA.

## A.1.4.10 Aircraft Operational Status Message

Register 6516 contains an exact bit-for-bit duplicate of the Aircraft Operational Status Message Extended Squitter (TYPE=31 and Subtype=0/1).  The contents of the Aircraft Operational Status Message will be formatted as specified Figure A-10. 

Note:
 Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs. 

## A.1.4.10.1 Transmission Rate

The Aircraft Operational Status (TYPE=31 and Subtype=0, for airborne participants) 
ADS-B Message will be broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds when the Target State and Status Message (TYPE=29 and Subtype=1) is not being broadcast and there has been a change within the past 24 Â±1 seconds for value of any of the following message parameters: 

a. TCAS/ACAS Operational 
b. ACAS/TCAS resolution advisory active 
c. NACP 
d. SIL 
Otherwise the Aircraft Operational Status (TYPE= 31 and Subtype=0, for airborne participants) ADS-B Message will be broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 2.4 to 2.6 seconds. 

## A.1.4.10.2 Message Delivery

Message delivery is independent of the Event-Driven protocol and is classified as a Periodic Status Message.   
Note:
 In previous versions of these MOPS, the Operational Status Message was delivered using the Event-Driven protocol.   

## A.1.4.10.3 Capability Class (Cc) Codes

This 16-bit ("ME" bits 9 - 24, Message bits 41 - 56) subfield in the Airborne Aircraft Operational Status Message (Subtype=0) or 12-bit ("ME" bits 9 - 20, Message bits 41 - 
52) subfield in the Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message (Subtype=1) will be used to report the operational capability of the aircraft.  Encoding of the CC subfield will be defined as specified in Table A-23 and Table A-24.   
For an ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem compliant with DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A, if an update has not been received from an on-board data source within the past 2 seconds for any data element of the Capability Class Codes subfield, then the data associated with that data element will be considered invalid and so reflected in the encoding of that message element to reflect "No Capability" or "Unknown" capability.

## A.1.4.10.6 Navigation Integrity Category (Nic) And Nic Supplement-A

The first 5-bit field ("ME" bits 1 - 5, Message bits 33 - 37) in every Mode S Extended Squitter Message contains the format TYPE Code.  The format TYPE Code differentiates the 1090ES Messages into several classes: Airborne Position, Airborne Velocity, Surface Position, Identification and Category, Aircraft Intent, Aircraft Status, etc.  In addition, the format TYPE Code also encodes the Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) value of the source used for the position report. The NIC Supplement-A is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 44, Message bit 76) subfield in the Aircraft Operational Status Message that is used in conjunction with the TYPE Code and NIC 
value to allow surveillance applications to determine whether the reported geometric position has an acceptable level of integrity containment region for the intended use.  The NIC integrity containment region is described horizontally using the radius of containment, RC.  The format TYPE Code also differentiates the Airborne Messages as to the type of their altitude measurements: barometric pressure altitude or GNSS height (HAE).  The 5-bit encoding for format TYPE Code and NIC values conforms to the definition contained in Table A-28.  If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for the determination of the TYPE Code value based on the radius of containment within the past 2 seconds, then the TYPE Code value will be encoded to indicate that RC is "Unknown."

## Notes:

1. "N/A" means "This NIC value is not available in the ADS-B Surface Position 
Message formats." 
2. NIC Supplement-A is broadcast in the Aircraft Operational Status Message, "ME" 
bit 44 (Message bit 76, see Figure A-10).  NIC Supplement-B is broadcast in the 
Airborne Position Message, "ME" bit 8 (Message bit 40, see Figure A-1).  NIC 
Supplement-C is broadcast in the Surface Capability Class (CC) Code Subfield of the Aircraft Operational Status Message, "ME" bit 20 (Message bit 52, see Table A-24).  
3. A non-excluded satellite failure requires that the RC be set to Unknown along with 
the NACP parameter being set to ZERO to indicate that the position has been 
determined to be invalid (see Â§A.1.4.1.1.3 and Â§A.1.4.1.2.4).   

## A.1.4.10.7 Navigation Accuracy Category For Position (Nacp)

This 4-bit ("ME" bits 45 - 48, Message bits 77 - 80) subfield will be used to announce 
95% accuracy limits for the horizontal position (and for some NACP values, the vertical position) that is being currently broadcast in Airborne Position and Surface Position Messages.  Encoding of the subfield will be as shown in Table A-13.  If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for NACP within the past 2 seconds, then the NACP subfield will be encoded as a value indicating "Unknown Accuracy." 

## A.1.4.10.8 Geometric Vertical Accuracy (Gva)

This 2-bit ("ME" bits 49 - 50, Message bits 81 - 82) subfield in the Airborne Operational Status Message (Subtype=0) will be encoded as shown in Table A-29, and set by using the Vertical Figure of Merit (VFOM) (95%) from the GNSS position source used to report the geometric altitude.    
Note: The geometric altitude may be reported directly in the altitude field in the Airborne Position Message (Â§A.1.4.2.4) or indirectly using the Difference From Barometric Altitude subfield (Â§A.1.4.5.6) in the Airborne Velocity Message (Â§A.1.4.5) when barometric altitude is reported in the altitude field in the Airborne Position Message (Â§A.1.4.2.4).

## 

Note:
 For the purposes of these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A) values for 0, 1 and 2 are encoded.  It is expected that ADS-B transmitting subsystems with ADS-B Version Numbers greater than 2 will define the GVA encoding of "3" as a value less than 45 meters at some point in the future.  Therefore, ADS-B Version 2 receiving subsystems should treat the GVA encoding of "3" as less than 45 meters for data received from ADS-B Version Numbers 2 or greater.   

## A.1.4.10.9 Source Integrity Level (Sil)

This 2-bit ("ME" bits 51 - 52, Message bits 83 - 84) subfield is defined for the Target State and Status Message in Â§A.1.4.9.11 and Table A-15, and remains the same in the Operational Status Message.   

## A.1.4.10.10 Barometric Altitude Integrity Code (Nicbaro)

This 1-bit ("ME" bit 53, Message bit 85) subfield will be used to indicate whether or not the barometric pressure altitude being reported in the Airborne Position Message (Â§A.1.4.2) has been cross-checked against another source of pressure altitude.  The NICBARO subfield will be encoded as shown in Table A-14.  If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for NICBARO within the past 2 seconds, then the NICBARO subfield will be encoded as a value of ZERO (0).   

## A.1.4.10.11 Aircraft Length And Width Codes

This 4-bit ("ME" bits 21 - 24, Message bits 53 - 56) subfield will be used in the Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message (Subtype=1) to describe the amount of space that an Aircraft or Ground Vehicle occupies.  The A/V Length and Width Code will be based on the actual dimensions of the transmitting Aircraft or Surface Vehicle as specified in Table A-30.  Once the actual Length and Width of the A/V has been determined, each A/V will be assigned the smallest A/V Length and Width Code from Table A-30 for which the actual length is less than or equal to the upper bound length for that Length/Width Code, and for which the actual width is less than or equal to the upper bound width for that Length/Width Code.

If the Aircraft or Vehicle is longer than 85 meters, or wider than 90 meters, then decimal Aircraft/Vehicle Length/Width Code 15 will be used. 

Note: For example, consider a powered glider with overall length of 24 meters and 
wingspan of 50 meters.  Normally, an aircraft of that length would be in length 
category 1 (that is, have a length code of 1).  But since the wingspan exceeds 34 meters, it does not qualify for even the "wide" subcategory (width code = 1) of length category 1.  Such an aircraft would be assigned length code = 4 and width code = 1, meaning "length less than 55 meters and width less than 52 meters." 

## A.1.4.10.12 Track Angle/Heading

The Track Angle/Heading is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 53, Message bit 85) subfield of the ADS-B 
Aircraft Operational Status Message (Subtype=1, for Surface Participants) that allows correct interpretation of the data contained in the Heading/Ground Track subfield of the ADS-B Surface Position Message when the Air/Ground status is determined to be in the 
"On-Ground" state as defined in Â§2.2.3.2.1.2. 

## A.1.4.10.13 Horizontal Reference Direction (Hrd)

This 1-bit ("ME" bit 54, Message bit 86) subfield will be used to indicate the reference direction (true north or magnetic north) for horizontal directions such as Heading, Track Angle.  The Horizontal Reference Direction subfield will be encoded as specified in Table A-31.   
Note: The HRD flag only applies to the Heading/Ground Track subfield in the Surface Position Message or the Heading subfield in the Airborne Velocity Message (Subtype 3 & 4).   

|   HRD Value  | Meaning        |
|--------------|----------------|
|           0  | True North     |
|           1  | Magnetic North |

## A.1.4.10.14 System Design Assurance (Sda)

The position transmission chain includes the ADS-B transmission equipment, ADS-B 
processing equipment, position source, and any other equipment that processes the position data and position quality metrics that will be transmitted. The "System Design Assurance" (SDA) subfield is a 2-bit ("ME" bits 31 - 32, Message bits 63 - 64) field that will define the failure condition that the position transmission chain is designed to support as defined in Table A-32.   
The supported failure condition will indicate the probability of a position transmission chain fault causing false or misleading information to be transmitted.  The definitions and probabilities associated with the supported failure effect are defined in AC 25.1309-1A, AC 23.1309-1D, and AC 29-2C.  All relevant systems attributes should be considered including software and complex hardware in accordance with RTCA DO-178B (EUROCAE ED-12B) or RTCA DO-254 (EUROCAE ED-80).

## Notes:

1. Software Design Assurance per RTCA DO-178B (EUROCAE ED-12B).  Airborne Electronic 
Hardware Design Assurance per RTCA DO-254 (EUROCAE ED-80). 
2. Supported Failure Classification defined in AC-23.1309-1D, AC-25.1309-1A, and AC 29-2C. 3. Because the broadcast position can be used by any other ADS-B equipped aircraft or by ATC, the 
provisions in AC 23.1309-1D that allow reduction in failure probabilities and design assurance level for aircraft under 6000 pounds do not apply. 
4. Includes probability of transmitting false or misleading latitude, longitude, or associated accuracy 
and integrity metrics. 

## A.1.4.10.15 Sil Supplement

The "SIL Supplement" (Source Integrity Level Supplement) subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 
8, Message bit 40) field that will define whether the reported SIL probability is based on a "per hour" probability or a "per sample" probability as defined in Â§A.1.4.9.2 and Table A-6.    

## A.1.4.10.16 Tcas/Acas Operational

The "TCAS/ACAS Operational" subfield ("ME" bit 11, Message bit 43) of the CC Codes subfield in ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, SUBTYPE=0, for airborne participants) is used to indicate whether the TCAS/ACAS System is Operational or not, and remains as defined for use in the Target State and Status Message (Â§A.1.4.9.18), with the encoding as specified in Table A-21. 

## A.1.4.10.17 1090Es In

The CC Code subfield for "1090ES IN" in Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, Subtype=0 or 1) is a 1-bit field ("ME" bit 12, Message bit 44) that is set to ONE (1) if the transmitting aircraft has the capability to receive ADS-B 1090ES Messages.  Otherwise, this CC code subfield is set to ZERO (0). 

## A.1.4.10.18 Uat In

The "UAT IN" CC Code subfield ("ME" bit 19, Message bit 51, TYPE=31, Subtype=0, for airborne participants AND "ME" Bit 16, Message bit 48, TYPE=31, Subtype=1 for surface participants) in ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Messages is so called because it denotes whether the aircraft is equipped with the capability to receive ADS-B Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) Messages. The "UAT IN" CC Code in Aircraft Operational Status Messages is set to ZERO (0) if the aircraft is NOT fitted with the capability to receive ADS-B UAT Messages.  The 
"UAT IN" CC Code Subfield is set to ONE (1) if the aircraft has the capability to receive ADS-B UAT Messages. 

## A.1.4.10.19 Navigation Accuracy Category For Velocity (Nacv)

This 3-bit subfield ("ME" bits 17 - 19, Message bits 49 - 51) indicates the Navigation Accuracy Category for Velocity (NACV) as defined in Â§A.1.4.5.4, with the encoding as specified in Table A-5.   

## A.1.4.10.20 Nic Supplement-C

The NIC Supplement-C subfield in the Aircraft Operational Status Message is a one-bit subfield ("ME" bit 20, Message bit 52) that, together with the TYPE subfield in Surface Position Messages and the NIC Supplement-A in the Operational Status Message ("ME" 
Bit 44, Message Bit 76), is used to encode the Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) of the transmitting ADS-B participant. If an update has not been received from an on-board data source for the determination of the NIC value within the past 2 seconds, then the NIC Supplement subfield is encoded to indicate the larger Radius of Containment (RC).   
Table A-28 lists the possible NIC codes and the values of the TYPE subfield of the Airborne and Surface Position Messages, and of the NIC Supplement-A, NIC 
Supplement-B and NIC Supplement-C subfields that are used to encode those NIC codes in messages on the 1090 MHz ADS-B data link.   

## A.1.4.10.21 Gps Antenna Offset

The "GPS Antenna Offset" subfield is an 8-bit ("ME" bits 33 - 40, Message bits 65 - 72) 
field in the OM Code Subfield of surface format Aircraft Operational Status Messages that defines the position of the GPS antenna in accordance with the following.   

a. 
Lateral Axis GPS Antenna Offset: 
"ME" bits 33 - 35 (Message bits 65 - 67) are used to encode the lateral distance of the GPS Antenna from the longitudinal axis (Roll) axis of the aircraft.  Encoding is established in accordance with Table A-33.

## Notes:

1. Left means toward the left wing tip moving from the longitudinal center line of the 
aircraft. 
2. Right means toward the right wing tip moving from the longitudinal center line of the 
aircraft. 
3. Maximum distance left or right of aircraft longitudinal (roll) axis is 6 meters or 
19.685 feet.  If the distance is greater than 6 meters, then the encoding should be set 
to 6 meters. 
4. The "No Data" case is indicated by encoding of "000" as above, while the "ZERO" 
offset case is represented by encoding of "100" as above. 
5. The accuracy requirement is assumed to be better than 2 meters, consistent with the 
data resolution.   

## B. Longitudinal Axis Gps Antenna Offset:

"ME" bits 36 - 40 (Message bits 68 - 72) are used to encode the longitudinal distance of the GPS Antenna from the NOSE of the aircraft.  Encoding is established in accordance with Table A-34.  If the Antenna Offset is compensated by the Sensor to be the position of the ADS-B participant's ADS-B Position Reference Point 
(RTCA DO-242A, Â§3.4.4.9.7), then the encoding is set to binary "00001" in Table A- 34.

## 1. Maximum Distance Aft From Aircraft Nose Is 60 Meters Or 196.85 Feet. Notes:

2. The accuracy requirement is assumed to be better than 2 meters, consistent with the 
data resolution. 

## A.1.5 Initialization And Timeout

 Initialization and timeout functions for Extended Squitter broadcast are 
Note:

A.1.6

performed by the transponder and are specified in RTCA/DO-181E (EUROCAE ED-73E).  A description of these functions is presented in the following paragraphs to serve as reference material for the section on the GFM (Â§
). 

## A.1.5.1 Initiation Of Extended Squitter Broadcast

At power up initialization, the transponder will commence operation in a mode in which it broadcasts only acquisition squitters.  The transponder will initiate the broadcast of Extended Squitters for Airborne Position, Surface Position, Aircraft Identification and Category, Airborne Velocity, Target State and Status and Operational Status when data are inserted into Registers 0516, 0616, 0816, 0916, 6216 and 6516 respectively.  This determination will be made individually for each squitter type, as specified in Â§2.2.3.3.  
The insertion of just altitude or surveillance status data into Register 0516 by the transponder will not satisfy the minimum requirement for broadcast of the airborne position squitter.   
Note:
 This suppresses the transmission of Extended Squitters from aircraft that are unable to report position, velocity or identity information. 

## A.1.5.2 Register Timeout Notes:

1. These Registers are cleared to prevent the reporting of outdated position and velocity 
information.   
2. During a register timeout event, the "ME" field of the ADS-B Broadcast Message 
may contain ALL ZEROs, except for those fields that may be updated due to the receipt of new data. 
a. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will clear all but the altitude and surveillance 
status subfields of the Airborne Position Message, if no new position data is received within two (2) seconds of the previous input data update.   
 During a timeout event the Format TYPE Code is set to ZERO (see 

## Note:

Â§2.2.3.2.3.1.3.2).   

b. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will clear all 56-bits of the Surface Position 
Message if no new position data is received within two (2) seconds of the previous input data update.   

## Notes:

1. During a timeout event the Format TYPE Code is set to ZERO (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.3.2). 
2. When position is available, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem manages the 
movement and the ground track subfields such that the subfields and applicable status bits are set to ZERO (0) if no new data is received for the subfield within 
2.6 seconds of the last data update of the subfield.   
3. When position data is not received, all bits of the Surface Position Message are 
set to ZERO to avoid confusion with altitude data in the Airborne Position Message sent with TYPE Code ZERO (0).   
c. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will clear all 56-bits of the Airborne Velocity 
Message if no data is received within 2.6 seconds of the previous input data update.   
Note:
 The Intent Change information is not sufficient to consider that new data has 
been received (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.3).   
d. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will not clear the Aircraft Identification 
Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.5).   
Note:
 The Aircraft Identification and Category Message, is not cleared since it 
contains data that rarely changes in flight and is not frequently updated.  
With Extended Squitter installed, the Aircraft Identification and Category Message is not cleared or ZEROed once either Flight Identification or 
Aircraft Registration data has been loaded into Register 0816 during the 
current ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem power-on cycle.  The Aircraft Identification and Category Message is not cleared since it provides information that is fundamental to track file management in the ADS-B 
environment (see Â§2.2.5.1.11.c).  Implementation of Register 0816 should also 
consider the following: a. If valid Flight Identification data is available, then the data should be 
used to populate the character subfields in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message.   
b. After using Flight Identification data to populate the character subfields 
in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message in a given power-on cycle, if Flight Identification data becomes invalid or not available, then the last known valid Flight Identification data should be retained and 
used to continue population of the character subfields in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message for the duration of the power-on cycle.   
c. If valid Flight Identification data is not available, but valid Aircraft 
Registration data is available in a given power-on cycle, then the valid Aircraft Registration data should be used to populate the character subfields in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message for the duration of the power-on cycle.   
d. If the Aircraft Identification and Category Message has been populated 
using Aircraft Registration data in a given power-on cycle, and valid Flight Identification data becomes available, then the Flight Identification data should be used to populate the character subfields in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message for the remainder of the power-on cycle.   
e. Once valid Flight Identification data has been used to populate the 
Aircraft Identification and Category Message in a given power-on cycle, Aircraft Registration data should not be used to populate the character subfields of the Aircraft Identification and Category Message, even if Flight Identification data becomes invalid or not available during the power-on cycle.   
e. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will clear each of the Selected Altitude, 
Selected Heading, or Barometric Pressure Setting subfields of the Target State and Status Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.1) if no new data is received within 2.0 seconds of the previous input data update for the respective subfield.  Each of the subfields will be cleared independently of the other subfields.  That is, each of the three specified subfields will be processed mutually exclusively of the other two specified subfields. The remaining subfields of the Target State and Status Message will not be cleared, as they contain other integrity, mode, or status information.   
f. 
The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will not clear the Operational Status Messages (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.2) since the subfields of the Message contain various integrity, mode, 
or status information..   
g. The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will not clear the Event-Driven Messages (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.7.8).   
Note:
 The Event-Driven Messages do not need to be cleared since contents of such messages are only broadcast once each time that new data is received.   

## A.1.5.3 Termination Of Extended Squitter Broadcast

If input to Register 0516, or 0616 stops for 60 seconds, broadcast of the associated Extended Squitter type will be discontinued until data insertion is resumed.  The insertion of altitude by the transponder will satisfy the minimum requirement for continuing to broadcast the airborne position squitter.   
If input to Register 0916 stops for 2.6 seconds, broadcast of the associated Extended Squitter type will be discontinued until data insertion is resumed.   

## Notes:

1. Until timeout, an Extended Squitter type may contain an "ME" field of ALL ZEROs. 
2. Continued transmission for 60 seconds is required so that receiving aircraft will 
know that the data source for the message has been lost. 

## A.1.5.4 Requirements For Non-Transponder Devices

Non-Transponder Devices will provide the same functionality for initialization, Register timeout and broadcast termination as specified for the transponder case in Â§A.1.5.1 
through Â§A.1.5.3. 

1. A Non-Transponder Device will not broadcast acquisition squitters, and 
2. A Non-Transponder Device operating on the surface will continue to broadcast 
DF=18 Messages with the TYPE Code=0 at a rate specified for the Surface Position Message, even though it has lost its navigation input.   
Note:
 Continued broadcast of the Surface Position Message is needed to support 
the operation of surface multi-lateration systems. 

## A.1.6 General Formatter/Manager (Gfm)

Note:
 The General Formatter/Manager (GFM) is the name that will be used to refer to 
the function that formats messages for insertion in the Extended Squitter registers.  In addition to data formatting, there are other tasks that have to be 
performed by this function. 

## A.1.6.1 Navigation Source Selection

The GFM will be responsible for the selection of the default source for aircraft position and velocity, the commanded altitude source, and for the reporting of the associated position and altitude errors. 

## A.1.6.2 Loss Of Input Data

The GFM will be responsible for loading the registers for which it is programmed at the required update rate.  If for any reason data is unavailable for a time equal to twice the update interval or 2 seconds (whichever is greater), the GFM will ZERO old data (on a per field basis) and insert the resulting message into the appropriate register.   
Note: For Register 0516 and 0616 a loss of position data would cause the GFM to set the Format TYPE Code to ZERO as the means of indicating "no position data" since ALL ZEROs in the lat/lon fields is a legal value.   

## A.1.6.3 Special Processing For Format Type Code Zero A.1.6.3.1 Significance Of Format Type Code Equal To Zero Notes:

1. Format TYPE Code ZERO (0) is labeled "no position information."  This is intended 
to be used when the lat/lon information is not available or invalid, and still permit the reporting of baro altitude loaded by the transponder.  The principal use of this message case is to provide ACAS the ability to passively receive altitude. 
2. Special handling is required for the airborne and Surface Position Messages because 
a CPR encoded value of ALL ZEROs in the Lat/Lon field is a valid value. 

## A.1.6.3.2 Broadcast Of Format Type Code Equal To Zero

Format TYPE Code 0 will only be set by the following events: 

1. Airborne Position or Surface Position (Register 0516, and 0616) has not been loaded 
by the GFM for 2 seconds.  In this case the transponder clears the entire 56 bits of the register that timed out.  (In the case of the Airborne Position register, the altitude subfield is only ZEROed if no altitude data is available).  Transmission of the Airborne and Surface Position Extended Squitter that broadcasts the timed out register will itself stop in 60 seconds except for the Airborne Position Message when 
Altitude is still available.  Broadcast of this Extended Squitter will resume when the 
GFM begins to insert data into the register. 
2. The GFM determines that all navigation sources that can be used for the Extended 
Squitter airborne or Surface Position Message are either missing or invalid.  In this case the GFM can clear the Format TYPE Code and all other fields of the airborne position, surface position and insert this zeroed message in the appropriate register. This should only be done once so that the transponder can detect the loss of data insertion and suppress the broadcast of the related squitter. 
Note that in all of the above cases, a Format TYPE Code of ZERO contains a message of ALL ZEROs.  The only exception is the airborne position format that may contain barometric altitude and surveillance status data as set by the transponder.  There is no analogous case for the other Extended Squitter format types, since a ZERO value in any of the fields indicates no information.  No other squitter types are broadcast with TYPE 
Code equal ZERO (0). 

## A.1.6.3.3 Reception Of Format Type Code Equal To Zero

If a squitter with format TYPE Code equal to ZERO (0) is received, it will be checked to see if altitude is present.  If altitude is not present, the message will be discarded.  If altitude is present, it may be used to update altitude.  An Extended Squitter containing Format TYPE Code ZERO will only be used to update the altitude of an aircraft already in track.   

Note:
 For ACAS, this could be an aircraft that was being maintained via hybrid 
surveillance when the position data input failed.  In this case, altitude only could be used for a short period of time.  Interrogation would have to begin at the update rate for that track to ensure update of range and bearing information on 
the display. 

## A.1.6.4 Handling Of Event-Driven Protocol

The Event-Driven interface protocol will provide a general-purpose interface into the transponder function for either those messages beyond those that are regularly transmitted all the time (provided input data is available), or those that are transmitted at a fixed periodic rate.  This protocol will operate by having the transponder broadcast a message once each time the Event-Driven register is loaded by the GFM.  

Note:
 This gives the GFM complete freedom in setting the update rate (up to a 
maximum) and duration of broadcast for applications such as emergency status and intent reporting. 
In addition to formatting, the GFM will control the timing of message insertion so that it provides the necessary pseudo-random timing variation and does not exceed the maximum transponder broadcast rate for the Event-Driven protocol. 

## A.1.6.4.1 Transponder Support For The Event Driven Protocol

A message will be transmitted once by the transponder, each time that Register 0A16 is loaded.  Transmission will be delayed if the transponder is busy at the time of insertion.   

Note:
 Delay times are short, a maximum of several milliseconds for the longest 
transponder transaction.   
The maximum transmission rate for the Event-Driven protocol will limited by the transponder to twice per second.  If a message is inserted in the Event-Driven register and cannot be transmitted due to rate limiting, it will be held and transmitted when the rate limiting condition has cleared.  If a new message is received before transmission is permitted, it will overwrite the earlier message. 

Note:
 The squitter transmission rate and the duration of squitter transmissions is 
application dependent.  Choices made should be the minimum rate and duration 
consistent with the needs of the application. 

## A.1.6.4.2 Gfm Use Of The Event-Driven Protocol

Note:
 More than one application at a time may be supported by the Event-Driven 
protocol.  The GFM handles requests for broadcast by these applications and is 
the only function that is capable of inserting data into Register 0A16.  In this way, 
the GFM can provide the pseudo random timing for all applications using this protocol and maintain a maximum insertion rate that does not exceed the transponder imposed limit. 
An application that wants to use the Event-Driven protocol will notify the GFM of the format type and required update rate.  The GFM will then locate the necessary input data for this format type and begin inserting data into Register 0A16 at the required rate.  The GFM will also insert this message into the register for this format type.  This register image will be maintained to allow readout of this information by air-ground or air-air register readout.  When broadcast of a format type ceases, the GFM will clear the corresponding register assigned to this message. 

The maximum rate that can be supported by the Event-Driven protocol will be twice per second from one or a collection of applications.  For each Event-Driven format type being broadcast, the GFM will retain the time of the last insertion into Register 0A16.  
The next insertion will be scheduled at a random interval that is uniformly distributed over the range of the update interval Â±0.1 second relative to the previous insertion into Register 0A16 for this format type.   
The GFM will monitor the number of insertions scheduled in any one second interval.  If more than two would occur, the GFM will schedule the pending messages based on message priorities and queue management rules defined in Â§A.1.6.4.3 in order to ensure that the limit of two messages per second is observed while ensuring that high priority Extended Squitter Message as broadcast at the required rates.   

## A.1.6.4.3 Event-Driven Message Transmission Scheduling Function

The Event-Driven Message Scheduling Function will ensure that the total Event-Driven Message rate does not exceed 2 transmitted messages per second. The Event-Driven Message Scheduling Function will apply the following rules as a means of prioritizing the Event-Driven Message transmissions and limited the transmission rates: 

a. The Event-Driven Message scheduling function will reorder, as necessary, pending 
Event-Driven Messages according to the following message priorities, listed below in 
descending order from highest to lowest priority: (1). The broadcast of the Extended Squitter Aircraft Status Message TCAS RA 
Broadcast (TYPE=28, Subtype=2).   
(2). The 
broadcast 
of 
the 
Extended 
Squitter 
Aircraft 
Status 
Message 
Emergency/Priority Condition (TYPE=28, Subtype=1).   
(3). This priority level applies as a default to any Event-Driven Message TYPE and 
Subtype combination not specifically identified at a higher priority level above. Event-Driven Messages of this default priority level will be delivered to the transponder on a first-in-first-out basis at equal priority.   
b. The Event-Driven Message scheduling function will limit the number of Event-
Driven Messages provided to the transponder to two (2) messages per second.   
c. If (b) results in a queue of messages awaiting delivery to the transponder, the higher 
priority pending messages, according to (a) above will be delivered to the transponder for transmission before lower priority messages. 
d. If (b) results in a queue of messages awaiting delivery to the transponder, new Event-
Driven messages will directly replace older messages of the same exact Type and Subtype (where a Subtype is defined) that are already in the pending message queue.  
The updated message will maintain the same position in the message queue as the pending message that is being replaced. 

e. If (b) above results in a queue of messages awaiting delivery to the transponder, then 
pending message(s), will be deleted from the message transmission queue if not delivered to the transponder for transmission, or not replaced with a newer message of the same message Type and Subtype, within the Message Lifetime value specified in the Table A-35 below:   

| Message                 | Message                 | Message Lifetime    |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| TYPE                    | Subtype                 | (seconds)           |

Note:

 A default message lifetime of 20 seconds will be used for queue management 
unless otherwise specified. 

## A.1.7 Latitude/Longitude Coding Using Compact Position Reporting (Cpr) A.1.7.1 Principle Of The Cpr Algorithm Notes:

1. The Mode S Extended Squitters use Compact Position Reporting (CPR) to encode 
Latitude and Longitude efficiently into messages.  The resulting messages are compact in the sense that several higher-order bits, which are normally constant for long periods of time, are not transmitted in every message.  For example, in a direct binary representation of latitude, one bit would designate whether the aircraft is in the northern or southern hemisphere.  This bit would remain constant for a long time, possibly the entire life of the aircraft.  To repeatedly transmit this bit in every position message would be inefficient.  
2. Because the higher-order bits are not transmitted, it follows that multiple locations 
on the earth will produce the same encoded position.  If only a single position message were received, the decoding would involve ambiguity as to which of the multiple solutions is the correct location of the aircraft.  The CPR technique includes 
a provision to enable a receiving system to unambiguously determine the location of 
the aircraft.  This is done by encoding in two ways that differ slightly.  The two formats, called even-format and odd-format, are each transmitted fifty percent of the time.  Upon reception of both types within a short period (approximately 10 seconds for airborne formats and 50 seconds for surface formats), the receiving system can unambiguously determine the location of the aircraft. 
3. Once this process has been carried out, the higher-order bits are known at the 
receiving station, so subsequent single message receptions serve to unambiguously indicate the location of the aircraft as it moves. 
4. In certain special cases, a single reception can be decoded into the correct location 
without an even/odd pair.  This decoding is based on the fact that the multiple locations are spaced by at least 360 NM.  In addition to the correct locations, the other locations are separated by integer multiples of 360 NM to the north and south and also integer multiples of 360 NM to the east and west.  In a special case in which it is known that reception is impossible beyond a range of 180 NM, the nearest solution is the correct location of the aircraft. 
5. The parameter values in the preceding paragraph (360 and 180 NM) apply to the 
airborne CPR encoding.  For aircraft on the surface, the CPR parameters are smaller by a factor of 4.  This encoding yields better resolution but reduces the spacing of the multiple solutions. 

## A.1.7.2 Cpr Algorithm Parameters And Internal Functions

The CPR algorithm **shall** utilize the following parameters whose values are set as follows for the Mode S Extended Squitter application: 

1. The number of bits used to encode a position coordinate, Nb, is set as follows: 

Nb = 17 
For airborne encoding, used in the ADS-B Airborne Position Message and the TIS-B Fine Airborne Position Message: 
Nb = 19 
For surface encoding, used in the ADS-B Surface Position Message and the TIS-B Fine Surface Position Message: For intent encoding: 
Nb = 14 
For TIS-B encoding, used only in the TIS-B Coarse Airborne Position Message: 
Nb = 12 

Note 1:

 
The 
Nb 
parameter 
determines 
the 
encoded 
position 
precision 
(approximately 5 m for the airborne encoding, 1.25 m for the surface encoding, 41 m for the intent encoding and 164 m for the TIS-B encoding).   
2. The number of geographic latitude zones between the equator and a pole, denoted 
NZ, is set to 15.  
Note 2:
 
The NZ parameter determines the unambiguous airborne range for decoding (360 NM).  The surface Latitude/Longitude encoding omits the 
high-order 2 bits of the 19-bit CPR encoding, so the effective unambiguous range for surface position reports is 90 NM. 
The CPR algorithm **shall** define internal functions to be used in the encoding and decoding processes.  

a. The notation **floor**(x) denotes the floor of x, which is defined as the greatest integer 
value k such that k â¤ x. 
Note 3:
 
For example, **floor**(3.8) = 3, while **floor**(-3.8) = -4. 

b. The notation |x| denotes the absolute value of x, which is defined as the value x when 
x â¥0 and the value âx when x < 0. 
c. The notation MOD(x,y) denotes the "modulus" function, which is defined to return 
the value  
$$\operatorname{MOD}\!\left(x,y\right)=x-y\cdot\operatorname{floor}\!\left({\frac{x}{y}}\right){\mathrm{~where~}}y\neq0\,.$$
Note 4:
 
The value y is always positive in the following CPR algorithms.  When x is 
non-negative, MOD(x,y) is equivalent to the remainder of x divided by y.  
When x represents a negative angle, an alternative way to calculate 
MOD(x,y) is to return the remainder of (x+360Â°) divided by y.

. 
d. The notation NL(x) denotes the "number of longitude zones" function of the latitude 
angle x.  The value returned by NL(x)  is constrained to the range from 1 to 59.  
NL(x) is defined for most latitudes by the equation, 
$$\text{NL}\big{(}lat\big{)}=\text{floor}\left(2\pi\cdot\left[\arccos\left(1-\frac{1-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2\cdot NZ}\right)\right)}{\cos^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}}\cdot\left[lat\right]\right)\right)}\right]^{-1}\right),$$

where $lat$ denotes the latitude argument in degrees. For latitudes at or near the N or S pole, or the equator, the following points are defined:

For $lat=0$ (the equator), NL = 59
 
For lat = +87 degrees, NL = 2 
For lat = -87 degrees, NL = 2 
For lat > +87 degrees, NL = 1 
For *lat* < -87 degrees, NL = 1 
 
Note 5:
 
This equation for NL() is impractical for a real-time implementation.  A 
table of transition latitudes can be pre-computed using the following equation: 
$$l a t=\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\cdot\operatorname{arccos}\left(1\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2\cdot N Z}\right)}{1-\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N L}\right)}}\right)\,\,\mathrm{for}\,\,N L=2\,\,\mathrm{to}\,\,4\cdot N Z-1,$$
and a table search procedure used to obtain the return value for NL( ).  
The table value for NL = 1 is 90 degrees.  When using the look up table established by using the equation above, the NL value is not expected to change to the next lower NL value until the boundary (latitude established by the above equation) has actually been crossed when moving from the equator towards the pole.   

## A.1.7.3 Cpr Encoding Process

The CPR encoding process **shall** calculate the encoded position values XZi and YZi for either airborne, surface, intent, or TIS-B Latitude and Longitude fields from the global position lat (latitude in degrees), lon (longitude in degrees), and the CPR encoding type i 
(0 for even format and 1 for odd format), by performing the following sequence of computations.  The CPR encoding for intent always uses the even format (i = 0), whereas the airborne, surface, and TIS-B encoding use both even (i = 0) and odd (i = 1) formats. 

_Data_, (the latitude zone size in the N-S direction) is computed from the equation:

$$Data_{i}=\frac{360^{\circ}}{4\cdot NZ-i}$$

## 

b. YZi (the Y-coordinate within the Zone) is then computed from *Dlat*i and lat using 
separate equations: 
ï£«  ï£¶  For Nb = 17:  YZi = floor 2 17 âMOD lat, Dlati ( ) + 1 2 ï£¸ ï£·  ï£·   ï£­ ï£¬ ï£¬  Dlati     ï£«  ï£¶  For Nb = 19:  YZi = floor 2 19 âMOD lat, Dlati ( ) + 1 2 ï£¸ ï£·  ï£·   ï£­ ï£¬ ï£¬  Dlati     ï£«  ï£¶  For Nb = 14:  YZ0 = floor 2 14 âMOD lat, *Dlat*0 ( ) + 1 2 ï£¸ ï£·  ï£·   ï£­ ï£¬ ï£¬  Dlat0     For Nb = 12:  ( ) i i Dlat Dlat lat YZ   ï£« + â = 2 1 , MOD 2 floor 12 i ï£¶ ï£¬ ï£¬ ï£­ ï£· ï£· ï£¸   3. _Rlat_, (the latitude that a receiving ADS-B system will extract from the transmitted message) is then computed from _lat_, _YZ_, and _Dlat_, using separate equations: For _Nb_ = 17: $$Rlat_{i}=Dlat_{i}\cdot\left(\frac{YZ_{i}}{2^{17}}+\text{floor}\left(\frac{lat}{Dlat_{i}}\right)\right)$$ For _Nb_ = 19: $$Rlat_{i}=Dlat_{i}\cdot\left(\frac{YZ_{i}}{2^{19}}+\text{floor}\left(\frac{lat}{Dlat_{i}}\right)\right)$$ For _Nb_ = 14: $$Rlat_{0}=Dlat_{0}\cdot\left(\frac{YZ_{0}}{2^{14}}+\text{floor}\left(\frac{lat}{Dlat_{0}}\right)\right)$$ $$Rlat_{i}=Dlat_{i}\cdot\left(\frac{YZ_{i}}{2^{12}}+\text{floor}\left(\frac{lat}{Dlat_{i}}\right)\right)$$ For $Nb=12$

$$Rlat_{i}=Dlat_{i}\cdot\left(\frac{\chi_{i}}{2^{12}}+\text{floor}\left(\frac{lat}{Dlat_{i}}\right)\right)$$ d. _Dlon${}_{i}$_ (the longitude zone size in the E-W direction) is then computed from _Rlat${}_{i}$_ using the equation:

$$\begin{split}Dlon_{i}=&\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{360^{\circ}}{\text{NL}\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i},&\text{when}\text{NL}\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i>0\\ &360^{\circ},&\text{when}\text{NL}\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i=0\end{array}\right.\end{split}$$
Note:
 When performing the NL function, the encoding process must ensure that the NL value is established in accordance with Note 5 of Â§
.d. 

A.1.7.2
 

e. XZi (the X-coordinate within the Zone) is then computed from lon and *Dlon*i using 
separate equations: 
ï£«  ï£¶  For Nb = 17:  XZi = floor 2 17 âMOD lon, Dloni ( ) + 1 2 ï£¸ ï£·  ï£·   ï£­ ï£¬ ï£¬  Dloni     ï£«  ï£¶  For Nb = 19:  XZi = floor 2 19 âMOD lon, Dloni ( ) + 1 2 ï£¸ ï£·  ï£·   ï£­ ï£¬ ï£¬  Dloni     ï£«  ï£¶  For Nb = 14:  XZ0 = floor 2 14 âMOD lon, *Dlon*0 ( ) + 1 2 ï£¸ ï£·  ï£·   ï£­ ï£¬ ï£¬  Dlon0     For Nb = 12:  ( ) i i Dlon Dlon lon XZ   ï£« + â = 2 1 , MOD 2 floor 12 i ï£¶ ï£¬ ï£¬ ï£­ ï£· ï£· ï£¸
 

f. Finally, limit the values of XZi and YZi to fit in the 17-bit, 14-bit or 12-bit field 
allotted to each coordinate:  
For Nb = 17:  YZi = MOD YZi, 2 17 ( ),  XZi = MOD XZi,2 17 ( )      For Nb = 19:  YZi = MOD YZi, 2 17 ( ),  XZi = MOD XZi,2 17 ( )      For Nb = 14:  YZ0 = MOD YZ0,2 14 ( ),  XZ0 = MOD XZ 0,2 14 ( )      For Nb = 12:  YZi = MOD YZi, 2 12 ( ),  XZi = MOD XZi,2 12 ( ) 

## A.1.7.4 Locally Unambiguous Cpr Decoding

The CPR algorithm **shall** decode a geographic position (latitude, *Rlat*i, and longitude, Rloni,) that is locally unambiguous with respect to a reference point (lats, lons) known to be within 180 NM of the true airborne position (or within 45 NM for a surface message). 

Note:
A.1.7.7

 This reference point may be a previously tracked position that has been 
  confirmed by global decoding (Â§
                                     ) or it may be the own aircraft position, 
  which would be used for decoding a new tentative position report.  

The encoded position coordinates XZi and YZi and the CPR encoding type i (0 for the 
even encoding and 1 for the odd encoding) contained in a Mode S Extended Squitter 
message shall be decoded by performing the sequence of computations given in Â§A.1.7.5 
for the airborne and intent format types and in Â§A.1.7.6 for the surface format type. 

## A.1.7.5 Locally Unambiguous Cpr Decoding For Airborne, Tis-B And Intent Lat/Lon

The following computations **shall** be performed to obtain the decoded lat/lon for the airborne, intent, and TIS-B messages.  For intent lat/lon, i is always 0 (even encoding), whereas airborne and TIS-B lat/lon use both even (i=0) and odd (i=1) encodings.  For airborne lat/lon, Nb=17, for intent, Nb=14, and for TIS-B Nb=12 

_Data${}_{i}$_ is computed from the equation:

$$\begin{array}{c}\mbox{\it Dlat}_{i}=\frac{360^{\circ}}{4\cdot NZ-i}\end{array}$$ The latitude zone index number, $j$, is then computed from the values of $lat_{i}$, $Dlat_{i}$ and $YZ_{i}$ using the equation:

$$j=\text{floor}\Bigg{(}\frac{lat_{i}}{Dlat_{i}}\Bigg{)}+\text{floor}\Bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\text{MOD}\big{(}lat_{i},Dlat_{i}\big{)}}{Dlat_{i}}-\frac{YZ_{i}}{2^{Nt_{i}}}\Bigg{)}$$ The decoded position latitude, $Rlat_{i}$, is then computed from the values of $j$, $Dlat_{i}$, and $\overline{\text{YZ}}$, using the equation:

$$Rlat_{i}=Dlat_{i}\cdot\left(j+\frac{\text{YZ}_{i}}{2^{\text{nb}}}\right)$$

d. $Dlon_{i}$ (the longitude zone size in the E-W direction) is then computed from $Rlat_{i}$ using the equation:

$$Dlon_{i}=\begin{cases}\frac{360^{\circ}}{\text{NL}\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i},&\text{when}\text{NL}\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i>0\\ 360^{\circ},&\text{when}\text{NL}\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i=0\end{cases}$$

## 

Note:
 When performing the NL function, the encoding process must ensure that the NL value is established in accordance with Note 5 of Â§

A.1.7.2

## 

The longitude zone coordinate $m$ is then computed from the values of _lon${}_{n}$_, _Dlon${}_{n}$_, and _XZ${}_{i}$_ using the equation:

$$m=\mbox{floor}\!\left(\frac{lon_{n}}{Dlon_{i}}\right)+\mbox{floor}\!\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\mbox{MOD}\!\left(lon_{n},Dlon_{i}\right)}{Dlon_{i}}-\frac{XZ_{i}}{2^{\delta_{i}}}\right)$$

If. The decoded position longitude, _Rlon${}_{n}$_, is then computed from the values of $m$, _XZ${}_{n}$_, and _Dlon${}_{i}$_ using the equation:

$$Rlon_{i}=Dlon_{i}\cdot\left(m+\frac{XZ_{i}}{2^{\delta_{i}}}\right)$$

## A.1.7.6 Locally Unambiguous Decoding For Surface Position

The following computations **shall** be performed to obtain the decoded Latitude and Longitude for the surface position format.   

1. *Dlat*i is computed from the equation: 
$$Dlat_{i}=\frac{90^{\circ}}{4\cdot NZ-i}$$
2. The latitude zone index, $j$, is then computed from the values of $lat_{i}$, $Dlat_{i}$ and $YZ_{i}$ using the equation: $$j=\text{floor}\Bigg{(}\frac{lat_{i}}{Dlat_{i}}\Bigg{)}+\text{floor}\Bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\text{MOD}\big{(}lat_{i},Dlat_{i}\big{)}}{Dlat_{i}}-\frac{YZ_{i}}{2^{17}}\Bigg{)}$$ The decoded position latitude, $Rlat_{i}$, is then computed from the values of $j$, $Dlat_{i}$, and $YZ_{i}$ using the equation:

$$Rlat_{i}=Dlat_{i}\cdot\left(j+\frac{YZ_{i}}{2^{17}}\right)$$

4. $Dlon_{i}$ (the longitude zone size, in the E-W direction) is then computed from $Rlat_{i}$ using the equation:

$$Dlon_{i}=\left\{\begin{aligned}&\frac{90^{\circ}}{\text{NL}\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i},&\text{when}\text{NL}\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i>0\\ &90^{\circ},&\text{when}\text{NL}\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i=0\end{aligned}\right.$$
 
Note:
 When performing the NL function, the encoding process must ensure that the NL value is established in accordance with Note 5 of Â§
.d.   
A.1.7.2
 

The longitude zone coordinate $m$ is then computed from the values of $lon_{i}$, $Dlon_{i}$, and $X\!Z_{i}$ using the equation:

$$m=\mbox{floor}\!\left(\frac{lon_{i}}{Dlon_{i}}\right)+\mbox{floor}\!\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\mbox{MOD}\!\left(lon_{i},Dlon_{i}\right)}{Dlon_{i}}-\frac{X\!Z_{i}}{2^{17}}\right)$$
6. The decoded position longitude, *Rlon*i, is then computed from the values of m, XZi, 
and *Dlon*i using the equation: 
$$R l o n_{i}=D l o n_{i}\cdot\left(m+\frac{X Z_{i}}{2^{17}}\right)$$

## A.1.7.7 Globally Unambiguous Airborne Position Decoding

The CPR algorithm **shall** utilize one airborne-encoded "**even**" format reception (denoted XZ0, YZ0), together with one airborne-encoded "odd" format reception (denoted XZ1, YZ1), to regenerate the global geographic position latitude, *Rlat*, and longitude, *Rlon*.  The time between the "**even**" and "odd" format encoded position reports **shall** be not longer than 
10 seconds for airborne formats.  

Note 1: 
This algorithm might be used to obtain globally unambiguous position reports for aircraft out of the range of ground sensors, whose position reports are coming via satellite data links.  It might also be applied to ensure that local positions are being correctly decoded over long ranges from the receiving sensor.   
Note 2: 
The time difference limit of 10 seconds between the even- and odd-format 
position reports for airborne formats is determined by the maximum permitted separation of 3 NM.  Positions greater than 3 NM apart cannot be used to solve for a unique global position.  An aircraft capable of a speed of 1850 km/h (1000 kt) will fly about 5.1 km (2.8 NM) in 10 seconds.  Therefore, the CPR algorithm will be able to unambiguously decode its position over a 10-second delay between position reports.   
Given a 17-bit airborne position encoded in the "**even**" format (XZ0, YZ0) and another encoded in the "odd" format (XZ1, YZ1), separated by no more than 10 seconds (= 3 NM), the CPR algorithm **shall** regenerate the geographic position from the encoded position reports by performing the following sequence of steps: 

a. Compute *Dlat*0 and *Dlat*1 from the equation: 
$$D l a t_{i}={\frac{360^{\circ}}{4\cdot N Z-i}}$$
b. Compute the latitude index: 
$$j=\operatorname{floor}\!\left({\frac{59\cdot Y Z_{0}-60\cdot Y Z_{1}}{2^{17}}}+{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$$
c. Compute the values of *Rlat*0 and *Rlat*1 using the following equation: 
$$R l a t_{i}=D l a t_{i}\cdot\left(\mathrm{MOD}(j,60-i)+{\frac{Y Z_{i}}{2^{17}}}\right)$$
Southern hemisphere values of *Rlat*i will fall in the range from 270Â° to 360Â°.  
Subtract 360Â° from such values, thereby restoring *Rlat*i to the range from â90Â° to 
+90Â°. 

 
d. If NL(*Rlat*0) is not equal to NL(*Rlat*1) then the two positions straddle a transition 
latitudeâthus a solution for global longitude is not possible.  Wait for positions where they are equal.   
 
Note 3:
A.1.7.2
 
When performing the NL function, the encoding process must ensure that the NL value is established in accordance with Note 5 of Â§
.d.  This 
is more important in the Global Unambiguous Decode because large longitude errors are induced if the decode function is not selecting the NL value properly as discussed in Note 5 of Â§A.1.7.2.d.   
 
e. If NL(*Rlat*0) is equal to NL(*Rlat*1) then proceed with computation of *Dlon*i, 
according 
to whether the most recently received Airborne Position Message was encoded with the even format (i = 0) or the odd format (i = 1) : 
$$D l o n_{i}=\frac{360^{\circ}}{n_{i}}\,,$$

where $n_{i}=$ greater of $\left[\text{NL}(R l a t_{i})-i\right]$ and $1\,.$
f. Compute m, the longitude index: 
$$m=\mathrm{floor}\!\left(\frac{X\!Z_{0}\cdot\!\left(N\!L-1\right)-X\!Z_{1}\cdot N\!L}{2^{17}}+\frac{1}{2}\right),$$

$$\mathrm{where}\;\;N\!L=\mathrm{NL}\!\left(R l a t_{i}\right).$$
g. Compute the global longitude, Rlon0 or *Rlon*1, according to whether the most recently 
received Airborne Position Message was encoded using the even format (that is, with i = 0) or the odd format (i = 1): 
$$R l o n_{i}=D l o n_{i}\cdot\left(\mathrm{MOD}(m,n_{i})+\frac{X Z_{i}}{2^{17}}\right)\,,$$

where $n_{i}=$ greater of $\left[\mathrm{NL}(R l a t_{i})-i\right]$ and $1$.

## 

h. A reasonableness test **shall** be applied to the resulting decoded position in accordance 
with Â§A.1.7.10.2.   

## A.1.7.8 Globally Unambiguous Cpr Decoding Of Surface Position

This algorithm **shall** utilize one CPR surface position encoded "*even*" format message together with one CPR surface position encoded "odd" format message, to regenerate the geographic position of the aircraft or target. As surface-format messages are initially received from a particular aircraft, if there is no prior history of this aircraft, then a global decode **shall** be performed using "*even*" and 
"odd" format receptions, as described in this section.   

Note 1: 
If the aircraft has been transmitting airborne format messages and their receptions were in-track, then it is not necessary to use even-odd decoding.  
Beginning with the first individual Surface Position Message reception, the location can be decoded using the local-decode technique, based on the previous target location as the reference. 
Note 2:

## A.1.7.6

 
    Even if the aircraft is appearing for the first time in surface format receptions, 
    any single message could be decoded by itself into multiple locations, one 
    being the correct location of the transmitting aircraft, and all of the others 
    being separated by 90 NM or more from the correct location.  Therefore, if it 
    were known that the transmitting aircraft cannot be farther away than 45 NM 
    from a known location, then the first received message could be decoded using 
    the locally unambiguous decoding method described in Â§
                                                                                                             .  Under some 
    circumstances it may be possible for an aircraft to be first detected when it is 
    transmitting Surface Position Messages farther than 45 NM away from the 
    receiving station.  For this reason, even-odd decoding is required when 
    messages are initially received from a particular aircraft.  After this initial 
    decode, as subsequent messages are received, they can be decoded individually 
    (without using the even-odd technique), provided that the intervening time is 
    not excessive.  This subsequent decoding is based on the fact that the aircraft 
    location has not changed by more than 45 NM between each new reception 
    and the previously decoded location. 

The *even-odd* decoding process **shall** begin by identifying a pair of receptions, one in the 
"*even*" format, the other in the "odd" format, and whose separation in time does not exceed the time interval of X seconds, where X=50 seconds, unless the Ground Speed in either Surface Position Message is greater than 25 knots, or is unknown, in which cases X=25 seconds. 

## 

Note 3:
 
The limit of 25 seconds is based on the possible change of location within this time interval.  Detailed analysis of CPR indicates that if the change of location is 0.75 NM or less, then the decoding will yield the correct location of the aircraft.  To assure that the change of location is actually no larger, and 
considering the maximum aircraft speed of 100 knots specified for the transmission of the surface format, the combination indicates that 25 seconds will provide the needed assurance.  For targets on the airport surface when speeds are much less and the transmission rate is as low as one per 5 seconds, the corresponding time limit is 50 seconds. 

## 

Given a CPR 17-bit surface position encoded in the "*even*" format (XZ0, YZ0) and another encoded in the "odd" format (XZ1, YZ1), separated by no more than X seconds, the algorithm **shall** regenerate the geographic position (latitude *Rlat*, and longitude *Rlon*) 
of the aircraft or target by performing the following sequence of steps:   

a. Compute the latitude zone sizes *Dlat*0 and *Dlat*1 from the equation: 
$$D l a t_{i}={\frac{90^{\circ}}{60-i}}$$

## 

b. Compute the latitude index: 
$$j=f l o o r\Bigg(\frac{59\cdot Y Z_{o}-60Y Z_{1}}{2^{17}}+\frac{1}{2}\Bigg)$$

## 

c. Latitude.
  The following formulas will yield two mathematical solutions for latitude 
(for each value of i), one in the northern hemisphere and the other in the southern 
hemisphere.  Compute the northern hemisphere solution of *Rlat*0 and *Rlat*1 using the 
following equation: 
$$R l a t_{i}=D l a t_{i}\Bigg(M O D(j,60-i)+\frac{Y Z_{i}}{2^{17}}\Bigg)$$
 
The southern hemisphere value is the above value minus 90 degrees. To determine the correct latitude of the target, it is necessary to make use of the location of the receiver.  Only one of the two latitude values will be consistent with the known receiver location, and this is the correct latitude of the transmitting aircraft. 

d. The first step in longitude decoding is to check that the *even-odd* pair of messages do 
not straddle a transition latitude.  It is rare, but possible, that NL(*Rlat*0) is not equal to 
NL(*Rlat*1).  If so, a solution for longitude cannot be calculated.  In this event, 
abandon the decoding of this *even-odd* pair, and examine further receptions to 
identify another pair.  Perform the decoding computations up to this point and check that these two NL values are equal.  When that is true, proceed with the following decoding steps.   
Note:
A.1.7.2
 When performing the NL function, the encoding process must ensure that the 
NL value is established in accordance with Note 5 of Â§
.d.  This is 
more important in the Global Unambiguous Decode because large longitude errors are induced if the decode function is not selecting the NL value properly as discussed in Note 5 of Â§A.1.7.2.d.   
e. Compute the longitude zone size *Dlon*i, according to whether the most recently 
received surface position message was encoded with the even format (i=0) or the odd format (i=1):   
$Dlon_{i}=\frac{90^{\circ}}{n_{i}}$, where $n_{i}$ is the greater of $[NL(Rlat_{i})$ - $i]$ and $1$.

 
f. 
Compute m, the longitude index: 
$$m=f l o o r\Bigg(\frac{X Z_{0}\cdot\left(N L-1\right)-X Z_{1}\cdot N L}{2^{17}}+\frac{1}{2}\Bigg)$$
 

$${\mathrm{where}}\;N L=N L\;(R l a t_{i}\,)$$
 

g. Longitude.
  The following formulas will yield four mathematical solutions for 
longitude (for each value of i), one being the correct longitude of the aircraft, and the other three separated by at least 90 degrees.  To determine the correct location of the target, it will be necessary to make use of the location of the receiver.  Compute the 
longitude, Rlon0 or *Rlon*1, according to whether the most recently received surface 
position message was encoded using the even format (that is, with i=0) or the odd 
format (i=1): 
 
$$R l o n_{i}=D l o n_{i}\cdot\left(M O D(m,n_{i})+\frac{X Z i}{2^{17}}\right)$$
 
where ni is the greater of [NL(Rlati *) - i*] and 1. 

 
This solution for *Rlon*i will be in the range 0Â° to 90Â°.  The other three solutions are 
90Â°, 180Â°, and 270Â° to the east of this first solution.   

h. A reasonableness test **shall** be applied to the resulting decoded position in accordance 
with Â§A.1.7.10.2. 
To then determine the correct longitude of the transmitting aircraft, it is necessary to make use of the known location of the receiver.  Only one of the four mathematical solutions will be consistent with the known receiver location, and this is the correct longitude of the transmitting aircraft. 

Note:
 Near the equator the minimum distance between the multiple longitude solutions 
is more than 5000 NM, so there is no question as to the correct longitude.  For locations away from the equator, the distance between solutions is less, and varies according to the cosine of latitude.  For example at 87 degrees latitude, the minimum distance between solutions is 280 NM.  This is sufficiently large to 
provide assurance that the correct aircraft location will always be obtained. Currently no airports exist within 3 degrees of either pole, so the decoding as specified here will yield the correct location of the transmitting aircraft for all existing airports.   

## A.1.7.9 Cpr Decoding Of Received Position Reports A.1.7.9.1 Overview

Note:
 The techniques described in the preceding paragraphs (locally and globally 
unambiguous decoding) are used together to decode the lat/lon contained in airborne, surface intent and TIS-B position reports.  The process begins with 
globally unambiguous decoding based upon the receipt of an even and an odd encoded position squitter.  Once the globally unambiguous position is determined, the emitter centered local decoding technique is used for subsequent 
decoding based on a single position report, either even or odd encoding.  

## A.1.7.9.2 Emitter Centered Local Decoding

In this approach, the most recent position of the emitter **shall** be used as the basis for the local decoding. 

Note:
 This produces an unambiguous decoding at each update, since the transmitting 
aircraft cannot move more than 360 NM between position updates. 

## A.1.7.10 Reasonableness Test For Cpr Decoding Of Received Position Messages A.1.7.10.1 Overview

Note:
 Although receptions of Position Messages will normally lead to a successful 
target position determination, it is necessary to safeguard against Position Messages that would be used to initiate or update a track with an erroneous position.  A reasonableness test applied to the computed position resulting from 
receipt of a Position Message can be used to discard erroneous position updates. Since an erroneous globally unambiguous CPR decode could potentially exist for the life of a track, a reasonableness test and validation of the position protects against such occurrences. 

## A.1.7.10.2 Reasonableness Test Applied To Position Determined From Globally Unambiguous Decoding

A reasonableness test **shall** be applied to a position computed using the Globally Unambiguous CPR decoding per Â§A.1.7.7 for Airborne Participants, or per Â§A.1.7.8 for Surface Participants.  Upon receipt of the "*even*" or "odd" encoded Position Message that completes the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode, the receiver **shall** perform a reasonableness test on the position decode by performing the following: If the receiver position is known, calculate the distance between the decoded position and the receiver position, and verify that the distance is less than the maximum reception range of the receiver.  If the validation fails, the receiver **shall** discard the decoded position that the "*even*" and "odd" Position Messages used to perform the globally unambiguous CPR decode, and reinitiate the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode process. 

A further validation of the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode, passing the above test, shall be performed by the computation of a second Globally Unambiguous CPR decode based on reception of a new "odd" and an "*even*" Position Message as per Â§A.1.7.7 for an Airborne Participant, or per Â§A.1.7.8 for a Surface Participant, both received subsequent to the respective "odd" and "*even*" Position Message used in the Globally Unambiguous CPR decode under validation.  Upon accomplishing the additional Globally Unambiguous CPR decode, this decoded position and the position from the locally unambiguous CPR decode resulting from the most recently received Position Message shall be checked to be identical to within 5 meters for an airborne decode and 1.25 
meters for a surface decode..  If the two positions are not identical to within this tolerance, the validation is failed and the initial Globally Unambiguous CPR decode under validation **shall** be discarded and the track **shall** be reinitialized. 

 
Note:

 The position obtained from the initial global CPR decode is subsequently 
updated using local CPR decoding, until an independent "odd" and "**even**" 
Position Message pair has been received.  When this occurs, a second global CPR decode is performed.  The resulting position is compared to the position update obtained from the local CPR decode using the most recently received Position Message. These two positions should agree since they are computed 
from the same message. 
 

## A.1.7.10.3 Reasonableness Test Applied To Position Determined From Locally Unambiguous Decoding

A reasonableness test **shall** be applied to a position computed using the Locally Unambiguous CPR decoding per Â§A.1.7.5 for Airborne, TIS-B or Intent Participants, or per Â§A.1.7.6 for Surface Participants.  Upon receipt of the "*even*" or "odd" encoded Position Message that completes the Locally Unambiguous CPR decode, the receiver shall perform a reasonableness test on the most recently received position decode by performing the following test:   
If the difference between the TOMRs of the previously received Position Message and the most recently received Position Message is 30 seconds or less, and the difference in the reported position in the most recently received Position Message is greater than or equal to X NM,  
where: 
X=6 for Airborne Participants receiving Airborne Position Messages, or X=2.5 for Airborne Participants that have received a Surface Position Message, or X=2.5 for Surface Participants that have received an Airborne Position Message, or X=0.75 for Surface Participants receiving Surface Position Messages, then the validation will be considered failed, and:   

1) the most recently received position **shall no**t be used to update the track, and 
2) the received position **shall** be used to initiate or update a candidate duplicate 
address track or update a duplicate address track in accordance with Â§A.1.7.10.4.   

## Notes:

1. If no duplicate address or candidate duplicate address Report exists for this 
ICAO 24-bit address, the position message is used to initiate a candidate duplicate address Report.  If a candidate duplicate address Report exists, the 
position message is used to update the candidate duplicate address Report. Otherwise, the position message is used to update the duplicate address Report unless the position message fails this validation test (see Â§A.1.7.10.4).   
2. The position threshold value is based on the assumption of a maximum aircraft 
velocity of V knots (where V=600 for Airborne and V=50 for Surface) over a 
maximum time period of 30 seconds.  This yields a maximum positional difference of approximately 5 NM for Airborne, and 0.5 NM for Surface.  An 
additional measure of 1 NM for Airborne, and 0.25 NM for Surface are added to account for additional ADS-B positional measurement uncertainty.  The position threshold of 2.5 nautical miles between surface and airborne participants was derived from the assumption of 250 knots maximum speed for a target transitioning from the surface state to an airborne state over 30 seconds, yielding approximately 2 nautical miles, with an additional 0.5 NM being added to allow for positional errors.   

## A.1.7.10.4 Duplicate Address Processing

The ICAO 24-bit address transmitted in each ADS-B Message and the derived Address Qualifier is used to identify and associate the messages for a particular aircraft/vehicle. Though each aircraft/vehicle should have a unique ICAO 24-bit address, there may be occasions on which more than one aircraft/vehicle is transmitting the same ICAO 24 bit address.  It is important for ADS-B applications that receive 1090ES ADS-B Reports to have knowledge of aircraft within receiving range.  The requirements in the following subparagraphs enable detection of a duplicate address aircraft/vehicle when horizontal position separation is outside of the local CPR reasonableness test criteria of Â§A.1.7.10.3.   

## Notes:

1. Without duplicate address detection, an aircraft/vehicle that enters the range of the 
receiver with the same ICAO 24-bit address as that of an existing ADS-B Report 
would go undetected and message data from the undetected aircraft/vehicle could be 
erroneously associated with the existing ADS-B Report. 
2. Duplicate Address processing is not required for TIS-B targets.  The assumption is 
that the ADS-B Ground Stations will protect against any Duplicate Address situation. 

## A.1.7.10.4.1 Candidate Duplicate Address Report

A candidate duplicate address Report will be initiated when a position message is received for an ICAO 24-bit address that fails the local CPR reasonableness test validation of Â§A.1.7.10.3 and no candidate duplicate address Report or duplicate address Report is currently active for the received ICAO 24-bit address.  If initiated, the candidate duplicate address Report is set to Initialization State as per Â§2.2.10.2 and the position message is stored for this candidate duplicate address Report.  The ADS-B Report for which the position message did not pass the validation test of Â§A.1.7.10.3, the local CPR reasonableness test, is the primary ADS-B Report for this ICAO 24-bit address.  Once a candidate duplicate address Report is initiated, association of subsequent position messages with this ICAO 24-bit address will be first attempted on the primary ADS-B 
Report for this ICAO 24-bit address.  If the position message does not pass the validation test of Â§A.1.7.10.3 on the primary ADS-B Report, the position message will be used to attempt Track Initialization on the candidate duplicate address Report as per Â§2.2.10.2.   

## Notes:

1. TIS-B Reports and ADS-R Reports are separate and distinct from ADS-B Reports as 
per Â§2.2.17 and Â§2.2.18 so there is no duplicate address issues between these Report types and ADS-B Reports.   
2. Inter-source correlation is addressed in RTCA DO-317.   

## A.1.7.10.4.2 Duplicate Address Condition

A duplicate address condition will be declared for an ICAO 24-bit address when a global CPR decode is completed by the receipt of both an even and odd position message within 10 seconds for the candidate duplicate address and passes the global CPR reasonableness test.  Once declared, a duplicate address condition will result in the Duplicate Address Flag in the State Vector Report set to "ON" in the ADS-B Report upon output of either ADS-B Report in the duplicate address condition.  ADS-B Position Messages will be associated with the ADS-B Report in the duplicate address condition that passes the local CPR reasonableness test in Â§2.2.10.6.3.b.  Each ADS-B Report in the duplicate address condition will be updated upon receipt of other Extended Squitter Messages containing the duplicate ICAO 24-bit address since there is no means to associate these messages with the correct aircraft. ADS-B Position, Velocity, Aircraft Identification and Category and Emergency / Priority Status (Subtype=1) Messages from aircraft/vehicles with ICAO 24-bit addresses identified as Duplicate Addresses will be processed as Version ZERO (0) format Messages.  Since Target State and Status Messages can be associated with the appropriate MOPS Version Number based on the Subtype, and Operational Status Messages contain the MOPS Version Number, these messages can be decoded directly.   

## Notes:

1. The Duplicate Address Flag is used to indicate to ADS-B applications that 
information associated with that address can not be correctly associated with either ADS-B Report in the duplicate address condition.  Additionally, the correct MOPS Version Number for each of the aircraft/vehicles can not be readily determined so interpretation of message data defaults to Version ZERO (0).  
2. The update and output of both ADS-B Reports when Extended Squitter Messages are 
received with the duplicate ICAO 24-bit address results in additional overhead since output of both ADS-B Reports possibly occurs upon message reception.  However, this approach gives ADS-B applications the ability to associate information with the correct ADS-B Report if they choose to attempt to correlate using the additional 
provided information.   
The duplicate address condition will be cleared after 60 seconds has elapsed with no Position Message update for a Participant with an ADS-B Report identified in the duplicate address condition.   The relevant ADS-B Report for the Participant will be deleted from the Report Output Storage Buffer.  Output of the remaining ADS-B Report will contain a State Vector Report with the Duplicate Address Flag set to "OFF".   

Note:
 After clearing the duplicate address condition, the ADS-B Report for the 
aircraft/vehicle that continues to receive Position Messages that pass the local CPR reasonableness test, as well as other 1090ES ADS-B Messages, is retained 
and updated as per Â§2.2.10.4. 
 

## A.1.7.10.4.3 Duplicate Address Report Capacity

The ADS-B Receiving Subsystem will be capable of maintaining and processing a minimum of three concurrent duplicate address Reports.    

Note:
 The required capacity includes duplicate address Reports from both ADS-B and 
ADS-R targets.  Since duplicate address situations are expected to be infrequent events, the ability to handle three duplicate address Reports is expected to be 
sufficient. 
 

## A.1.8 Formats For Extended Squitter

The Extended Squitter messages will be formatted as defined in the following tables. 

Note: In some cases, ARINC 429 labels are referenced for specific message fields.  
These references are only intended to clarify the field content, and are not intended as a requirement to use these ARINC 429 labels as the source for the message field.

When horizontal position information is unavailable, but altitude information is available, the Airborne Position Message is transmitted with a Format TYPE Code of ZERO in bits 1-5 and the barometric pressure altitude in bits 9 to 20.  If neither horizontal position nor barometric altitude information is available, then all 56 
bits of Register 0516 are ZEROed.  The ZERO Format 
TYPE Code field indicates that Latitude and Longitude information is unavailable, while the ZERO altitude field indicates that altitude information is unavailable.

## A.2 Traffic Information Services - Broadcast (Tis-B) Formats And Coding A.2.1 Introduction Notes:

1. This section of Appendix A defines the formats and coding for a Traffic Information 
Service Broadcast (TIS-B) based on the same 112-bit 1090 MHz signal transmission that is used for ADS-B on 1090 MHz.   
2. TIS-B complements the operation of ADS-B by providing ground-to-air broadcast of 
surveillance data on aircraft that are not equipped for 1090 MHz ADS-B.  The basis for this ground surveillance data may be an ATC Mode S radar, a surface or 
approach multi-lateration system or a multi-sensor data processing system.  The TIS-
B ground-to-air transmissions use the same signal formats as 1090 MHz ADS-B and can therefore be accepted by a 1090 MHz ADS-B receiver. 
3. TIS-B data content on the 1090 MHz signal does not include all of the parameters, 
such as the System Design Assurance (SDA) and the SIL Supplement, which are normally associated with ADS-B transmissions from aircraft.  Those parameters that are not broadcast will need to be provided by the TIS-B Service Provider. 
4. TIS-B service is the means for providing a complete surveillance picture to 1090 
MHz ADS-B users during a transition period.  After transition, it also provides a means to cope with a user that has lost its 1090 MHz ADS-B capability, or is broadcasting incorrect information. 

## A.2.2 Tis-B Format Definition

TIS-B information is broadcast using the 112-bit Mode S DF=18 format as shown below in Figure A-11.

## A.2.4 Tis-B Surveillance Message Definition A.2.4.1 Tis-B Fine Airborne Position Message

The TIS-B fine airborne position "ME" field will be formatted as specified in Figure A- 12. 

 *Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs.* 

## Note: A.2.4.1.1 Icao/Mode A Flag (Imf)

This one-bit field (bit 8) will be used to indicate the type of identity associated with the aircraft data reported in the TIS-B message.  IMF equal to ZERO (0) will indicate that the TIS-B data is identified by an ICAO 24-bit address.  IMF equal to ONE (1) will indicate that the TIS-B data is identified by a "Mode A" code.  A TIS-B report on a primary radar target will indicate a "Mode A" code of ALL ZEROs. 

## Notes:

1. The AA field is coded differently for 24-bit addresses and Mode A codes as specified 
in Table A-24. 
2. A target with a ZERO "Mode A" code and a reported altitude is an SSR target. 

## A.2.4.1.2 Pressure Altitude

This 12-bit field will provide the aircraft pressure altitude.  This field will contain barometric altitude encoded in 25 or 100-foot increments (as indicated by the Q Bit).  All zeroes in this field will indicate that there is no altitude data. 

## A.2.4.1.3 Compact Position Reporting (Cpr) Format (F)

This field will be set as specified in Â§A.1.4.2.1. 

## A.2.4.1.4 Latitude/Longitude

The Latitude/Longitude fields in the TIS-B fine Airborne Position Message will be set as specified in Â§A.1.4.2.3. 

## A.2.4.2 Tis-B Surface Position Message

The TIS-B surface position "ME" field will be formatted as specified in Figure A-13. 

 Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs. 

## Note: A.2.4.2.1 Movement

This field will be set as specified in Â§A.1.4.3.1. 

## A.2.4.2.1.1 Ground Track (True) A.2.4.2.1.1.1 Ground Track Status

This field will be set as specified in Â§A.1.4.3.2.1. 

## A.2.4.2.1.1.2 Ground Track Angle

This field will be set as specified in Â§A.1.4.3.2.2. 

## A.2.4.2.1.2 Icao/Mode A Flag (Imf)

This one-bit field (bit 21) will indicate the type of identity associated with the aircraft data reported in the TIS-B message.  Coding is specified in Â§A.2.4.1.1. 

## A.2.4.2.1.3 Compact Position Reporting (Cpr) Format (F)

This field will be set as specified in Â§A.1.4.3.3. 

## A.2.4.2.1.4 Latitude/Longitude

The Latitude/Longitude fields in the TIS-B Fine Surface Position Message will be set as specified in Â§A.1.4.3.5. 

## A.2.4.3 Identification And Category Message

The TIS-B Identification and Category "ME" field will be formatted as specified in Figure A-14.  This message will only be used for aircraft identified with an ICAO 24-bit address. 

 Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs. 

Note:

## A.2.4.3.1 Aircraft Identification Coding

This field will be set as specified in Â§A.1.4.4.1. 

## A.2.4.4 Velocity Message

The TIS-B Velocity "ME" field will be formatted as specified in the Figure A-15 for Subtypes 1 and 2, and in Figure A-16 for Subtypes 3 and 4. 

 Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs. 

Note:

## A.2.4.4.1 Subtype Field

Subtypes 1 through 4 will be used for the TIS-B Velocity Message.  Subtype 1 will be used for velocities over ground under 1000 knots and Subtype 2 will be used for aircraft capable of supersonic flight when the velocity over ground might exceed 1022 knots. The supersonic version of the velocity coding will be used if either the East-West OR North-South velocities exceed 1022 knots.  A switch to the normal velocity coding will be made if both the East-West AND North-South velocities drop below 1000 knots. 

Subtypes 3 and 4 will be used when Airspeed and Heading are substituted for velocity over ground.  Subtype 3 will be used at subsonic airspeeds, while Subtype 4 will be used for aircraft capable of supersonic flight when the Airspeed might exceed 1022 knots. The supersonic version of the Airspeed coding will be used if the Airspeed exceeds 1022 knots.  A switch to the normal Airspeed coding will be made if the Airspeed drops below 1000 knots. 

## A.2.4.4.2 Icao/Mode A Flag (Imf)

This one-bit field (bit 9) will indicate the type of identity associated with the aircraft data reported in the TIS-B message.  Coding is specified in Â§A.2.4.1.1. 

## A.2.4.5 Coarse Airborne Position Message

The TIS-B coarse airborne position "ME" field will be formatted as specified in Figure A-17. 

## Notes:

1. This message is used if the surveillance source for TIS-B is not of high enough 
quality to justify the use of the fine formats.  An example of such a source is a scanning beam Mode S interrogator. 
2. Additional details are specified in the following paragraphs. 

## A.2.4.5.1 Icao/Mode A Flag (Imf)

This one-bit field (bit 1) will indicate the type of identity associated with the aircraft data reported in the TIS-B message.  Coding is specified in Â§A.2.4.1.1. 

## A.2.4.5.2 Service Volume Id (Svid)

The 4-bit SVID field will identify the TIS-B site that delivered the surveillance data. 

Note:
 In the case where TIS-B messages are being received from more than one TIS-B 
ground stations, the SVID can be used to select coarse messages from a single source.  This will prevent the TIS-B track from wandering due to the different error biases associated with different sources. 

## A.2.4.5.3 Pressure Altitude

This 12-bit field will provide the aircraft pressure altitude.  This field will contain barometric altitude encoded in 25 or 100-foot increments (as indicated by the Q Bit). 

## A.2.4.5.4 Ground Track Status

This one bit ("ME" bit 20) field will define the validity of the ground track value.  
Coding for this field will be as follows: 0=not valid and 1= valid. 

## A.2.4.5.5 Ground Track Angle

This 5-bit ("ME" bits 21 - 25) field will define the direction (in degrees clockwise from true north) of aircraft motion.  The ground track will be encoded as an unsigned angular weighted binary numeral, with an MSB of 180 degrees and an LSB of 360/32 degrees, with ZERO (0) indicating true north.  The data in the field will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 360/32 degrees. 

## A.2.4.5.6 Ground Speed

This 6-bit ("ME" bits 26 - 31) field will define the aircraft speed over the ground.  
Coding of this field will be as specified in Â§2.2.17.3.5.7. 

## A.2.4.5.7 Latitude/Longitude

The Latitude/Longitude fields in the TIS-B Coarse Airborne Position Message will be set as specified in Â§A.1.4.2.3, except that the 12-bit form of CPR coding will be used. 

## A.2.5 Tis-B And Ads-R Management Messages

The TIS-B/ADS-R Management Messages use Extended Squitter format DF=18 and CF=4 to provide information related to the provision of the TIS-B and/or ADS-R Service Volume in the specific airspace being serviced by the local ground broadcast site(s). The TIS-B/ADS-R Management Message is used to provide a specific announcement of the Service Volume and the service availability in local airspace where the TIS-B and/or ADS-R service is being supported by the ground infrastructure.   

## A.2.6 Tis-B Report Generation

The information received in TIS-B Messages is reported directly to applications, with one exception.  The exception is latitude-longitude position information, which is CPR-
encoded when it is received, and must be decoded before reporting.  In order to accomplish CPR decoding, it is necessary to track received messages, so that even-format and odd-format messages can be combined to determine the latitude and longitude of the target. In the most common case, a particular target will result in TIS-B Message receptions or ADS-B Message receptions, but not both.  It is possible, however, for both types of messages to be received for a single target.  If this happens, the TIS-B information is processed and reported independently of the ADS-B receptions and reporting. As TIS-B Messages are received, the information is reported to applications.  All received information elements, other than position, will be reported directly, including all reserved fields for the TIS-B fine format messages and the entire message content (i.e., including the complete 88-bit content of the DF, CF, AA and "ME" fields of the Extended Squitter Message) of any received TIS-B Management Message (Table A-36, for CF=4).  The reporting format is not specified in detail, except that the information content will be the same as the information content received.  The report will be issued within 0.5 seconds of the message reception.   
 

## A.2.7 Formats For 1090 Mhz Tis-B Messages

## A.3 Ads-B Rebroadcast Service - Formats And Coding A.3.1 Introduction

The TIS-B MASPS, RTCA/DO-286B defines an "ADS-B Rebroadcast Service", as a 
"Fundamental TIS-B Service," that may be provided.  The Messages of the ADS-B 
Rebroadcast Service are not transmitted by aircraft, but by ADS-B ground stations.     

## Notes:

1. This section of Appendix A defines the formats and coding for an ADS-B Rebroadcast 
Service (see the TIS-B MASPS, RTCA/DO-286B, Â§1.4.1) based on the same 112-bit 
1090 MHz Extended Squitter signal transmission that is used for DF=17 ADS-B Messages on 1090 MHz. 
2. The ADS-B Rebroadcast Service complements the operation of ADS-B and the 
Fundamental TIS-B Service (see the TIS-B MASPS, RTCA/DO-286B, Â§1.4.1) by 
providing ground-to-air rebroadcast of ADS-B data about aircraft that are not equipped for 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B, but are equipped with an alternate form of ADS-B (e.g., Universal Access Transceiver (UAT)).  The basis for the ADS-B 
Rebroadcast transmission is the ADS-B Report received at the ground station using a receiver compatible with the alternate ADS-B data link. 
3. The ADS-B Rebroadcast ground-to-air transmissions use the same signal formats as 
the DF=17 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B and can therefore be accepted by a 
1090 MHz ADS-B Receiving Subsystem, with the exceptions identified in the following sections.   

## A.3.2 Ads-B Rebroadcast Format Definition

ADS-B Rebroadcast information is transmitted using the 112-bit Mode S DF=18 format specified in Figure A-11. 

## A.3.3 Control Field Allocation

The content of the DF=18 transmission is defined by the value of the Control Field (CF). As specified in Table A-36, ADS-B Rebroadcasts (i.e., ADS-R) transmissions **shall** use CF=6 and ADS-R Management information transmissions (i.e., defining ADS-R Service Volume and service availability) **shall** use CF=4.   

 

## A.3.4 Ads-B Rebroadcast Surveillance Message Definitions

The Rebroadcast of ADS-B information on the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter data link is accomplished by utilizing the same ADS-B Message formats defined in Figure A-1 
through Figure A-10, with the exception of the need to transmit an indication to the 1090 
MHz Receiving Subsystem as to the type of identity associated with the aircraft data being reported in the ADS-B Rebroadcast Message.  This identification is performed using the ICAO/Mode A Flag (IMF), which was previously discussed in Â§A.2.4.1.1 for the TIS-B transmissions. 

The insertion of this one bit into the ADS-B Messages identified below allows the ADS-
B Receiving Subsystem to interpret the Address Field (AF) in the following manner: 

IMF = 0 
indicates that the ADS-B Rebroadcast data is identified by an ICAO 24-bit 
Address 
IMF = 1 
indicates that the ADS-B Rebroadcast data is identified by an anonymous 24- bit Address

ADS-R Reports are to be maintained and output for DF=18, with CF=6 ADS-R Messages consistent with the ADS-B Report Characteristics requirements of Â§2.2.8 and the Report Assembly and Delivery requirements of Â§2.2.10.   ADS-R Reports are to be provided for both ADS-B Version ONE (1) and Version TWO (2) formatted ADS-R Messages in accordance with the message formats provided in Â§A.3.4.    
Note:
 ADS-R Reports are for Participants that do not have ADS-B Reports since they are ADS-B Messages transmitted by the Ground for aircraft/vehicles that transmit on a different ADS-B link (e.g., UAT).  ADS-R Messages are processed by the 1090ES ADS-B Receiving Subsystems in the same manner as ADS-B 
Messages received directly from aircraft/vehicle Participants.

## B.2 Definition Of Terms

Accuracy  -  A measure of the difference between the A/V position reported in the ADS-
B message field as compared to the true position.  Accuracy is usually defined in statistical terms of either 1) a mean (bias) and a variation about the mean as defined by the standard deviation (sigma) or a root mean square (rms) value from the mean.  The values given in this document are in terms of the two-sigma variation from an assumed zero mean error. 

Acquisition Squitter  -  A short message (format DF=11) that Mode S Transponders transmit automatically, without needing to be interrogated by a radar, to announce the own-ship aircraft's presence to nearby TCAS-equipped aircraft.  (Also see Extended Squitter.) 
Active Waypoint  -  A waypoint to or from which navigational guidance is being provided.  For a parallel offset, the active waypoint may or may not be at the same geographical position as the parent waypoint.  When not in the parallel offset mode (operating on the parent route), the active and parent waypoints are at the same geographical position. 

ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast)  -  A system for airborne or surface aircraft, or other surface vehicles operating within the airport surface movement area, that periodically transmits a State Vector and other information. 

ADS-B Broadcast and Receive Equipment  -  Equipment that can transmit and receive ADS-B messages.  Defined as Class A equipment. 

ADS-B Broadcast Only Equipment  -  Equipment that can transmit but not receive ADS-
B messages. Includes transponder based equipment that is capable of receiving 1030 MHz SSR interrogations.  Defined as Class B equipment. 

ADS-B Message - A modulated packet of formatted data which conveys information used in the development of ADS-B reports. 

ADS-B Only Transmitter  -  An ADS-B transmitter that is not part of a Mode S 
transponder. 

ADS-B Rebroadcast Service  -  This is one of the Services provided by the TIS-B system 
(see the TIS-B MASPS, RTCA/DO-286A, Â§1.4.2).  The ADS-B Rebroadcast Service is a TIS-B Service in which ground stations Rebroadcast on one data link (e.g., 1090 MHz Extended Squitter as described in these MOPS) ADS-B Messages that were originally transmitted by an aircraft or vehicle on another data link (e.g., the Universal Access Transceiver, UAT).   
ADS-B Receiver or 1090 MHz Receiver  -  An ADS-B receiver that is not a TCAS 1090 
MHz receiver. 

ADS-B Report - Specific Information provided by the ADS-B user participant subsystem to external applications.  Reports contain identification, state vector, and status/intent information.  Elements of the ADS-B Report that are used and the frequency with which they must be updated will vary by application.  The portions of an ADS-B Report that are provided will vary by the capabilities of the transmitting participant. 

ADS-B Subsystem  -  The set of avionics or equipment that performs ADS-B 
functionality in an aircraft or for ground-based, non-aircraft, participants.  
ADS-B System  -  A collection of ADS-B subsystems wherein ADS-B messages are broadcast and received by appropriately equipped participant subsystems.  Capabilities of participant subsystems will vary based upon class of equipage. 

Advisory  -  An annunciation that is generated when crew awareness is required and subsequent crew action may be required; the associated color is unique but not red or amber/yellow.  (Source:  Advisory Circular AC 25 - 11). 

Aircraft Address  -  The term "address" is used to indicate the information field in an ADS-B message that identifies the ADS-B unit that issued the message.  The address provides a continent means by which ADS-B receiving units - or end applications - can sort messages received from multiple issuing units. 

Aircraft/Vehicle (A/V)  -  Either 1) a machine or service capable of atmospheric flight, or 
2) a vehicle on the airport surface movement area. In addition to A/Vs, ADS-B equipage may be extended to temporarily uncharted obstacles (i.e., obstacles not identified by a current NOTAM). 

Air Mass  -  Air mass data includes barometric altitude and air speed. Alert Zone  -  In the Free Flight environment, each aircraft will be surrounded by two zones, a protected zone and an alert zone.  The alert zone is used to indicate a condition where intervention may be necessary.  The size of the alert zone is determined by aircraft speed, performance, and by CNS/ATM capabilities. 

Along-Track Distance  -  The distance along the desired track from the waypoint to the perpendicular line from the desired track to the aircraft. 

Altitude, Barometric  -  See *barometric altitude*. Altitude, Geometric  -  See *geometric height*. Applications  -  Specific use of systems that address particular user requirements.  For the case of ADS-B, applications are defined in terms of specific operational scenarios. Barometric Altitude  -  Geopotential altitude in the earth's atmosphere above mean standard sea level pressure datum surface, measured by a pressure (barometric) altimeter. 

. 

Barometric Altitude Error  -  For a given true barometric pressure, Po, the error is the difference between the transmitted pressure altitude and the altitude determined using a standard temperature and pressure model with Po Call Sign  -  The term "aircraft call sign" means the radiotelephony call sign assigned to an aircraft for voice communications purposes.  (This term is sometimes used interchangeably with "flight identification" or "flight ID").  For general aviation aircraft, the aircraft call sign is normally its national registration number; for airline and commuter aircraft, it is usually comprised of the company name and flight number (and therefore not linked to a particular airframe); and for the military, it usually consists of numbers and code words with special significance for the operation being conducted. 

Caution  -  An annunciation that is generated when immediate crew awareness is required and subsequent crew action will be required; the associated color is amber/yellow. (Source: Advisory Circular AC25 - 11). 

Closest Point of Approach (CPA)  -  The minimum horizontal distance between two aircraft during a close proximity encounter, a.k.a. miss distance. 

Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI)  -  A function which provides the pilot/flight-crew with surveillance information about other aircraft, including their position.  The information may be presented on a dedicated multi-function display 
(MFD), or be processed for presentation on existing cockpit flight displays.  Traffic information for the CDTI function may be obtained from one or multiple sources (including ADS-B, TCAS, and TIS) and it may be used for a variety of purposes. Requirements for CDTI information will be based on intended use of the data (i.e., application). 

Collision Avoidance  -  An unplanned maneuver to avoid a collision. Conflict  -  Any situation involving two or more aircraft, or an aircraft and an airspace, or an aircraft and ground terrain, in which the applicable separation minima may be violated. 

Conflict Detection  -  The process of projecting an aircraft's trajectory to determine whether it is probable that the applicable separation minimum will not be maintained between the aircraft and either 1, another aircraft or vehicle, 2, a given airspace, or 3, ground terrain.  The level of uncertainty in the projection is reduced with increased knowledge about the situation, including aircraft capabilities, flight plan, short term intent information, etc. 

Conflict Management  -  Process of detecting and resolving conflicts. Conflict Probe  -  The flight paths are projected to determine if the minimum required separation will be violated.  If the minima are not [projected to be] violated, a brief preventive instruction will be issued to maintain separation.  If the projection shows the minimum required separation will be violated, the conflict resolution software suggests an appropriate maneuver. 

Conflict Resolution  -  The process of identifying a maneuver or set of maneuvers that, when followed, do not cause a conflict or reduce the likelihood of conflict between an aircraft and either 1, another aircraft or vehicle, 2, a given airspace, or 3, ground terrain. Maneuvers may be given to multiple aircraft to fully resolve a conflict. 

Conformance  -  The condition established when the surveillance report of an aircraft's position at some time "t" (established by the Automated Tracking function) is within the conformance region constructed around that aircraft at its nominal position at time "t", according to the agreed upon trajectory. 

Cooperative Separation  -  This concept envisions a transfer of responsibility for aircraft separation from ground based systems to the air-crew of appropriately equipped aircraft, for a specific separation function such as In-trail merging or separation management of close proximity encounters.  It is cooperative in the sense that ground-based ATC is involved in the handover process, and in the sense that all involved aircraft must be appropriately equipped, e.g., with RNAV and ADS-B capability, to perform such functions. 

Cross-link  -  A cross-link is a special purpose data transmission mechanism for exchanging data between two aircraftâa two-way addressed data link.  For example, the TCAS II system uses a cross-link with another TCAS II to coordinate resolution advisories that are generated.  A cross-link may also be used to exchange other information that is not of a general broadcast nature, such as intent information. Desired Course  -  Can be either  1) True - A predetermined desired course direction to be followed (measured in degrees from true north), or 2)  Magnetic - A predetermined desired course direction to be followed (measured in degrees from local magnetic north). 

 
Effective Update Interval  -  The time interval between successful message receipt with at least  98% probability of successful reception.  For example, if ADS-B messages are sent at one second intervals in signal-to-noise conditions with 75% probability of success per transmission, then the probability of obtaining at least one message in three tries is  
= 1. - (0.25) 3
  ~ 98.4%.  Thus the effective update interval for this case = 1 sec x 3 = 3 
sec. 

Effective Update Rate  -  The reciprocal of effective update interval, e.g.  rate = 1/3 ~ 
0.33 Hz for the example above.   
En Route  -  A phase of navigation covering operations between departure and termination phases.  En route phase of navigation has two subcategories: en route domestic/continental and en route oceanic. 

Event Driven Messages  -  Those messages that are transmitted from Mode S 
Transponder-Based ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems in response to a certain event: 
namely, the loading of the event-driven register, Mode S Transponder register 0A {HEX}.  This is according to the "event-driven protocol" described in the Mode S Transponder MOPS (RTCA/DO-181D, Â§2.2.23.1.2).  When these message formats are transmitted from Non-Transponder-Based devices, they might still be called event-driven messages, but a better term would be "*On-Condition*" messages.  (See On-Condition.) 
Extended Squitter  -  A long message (format DF=17) that Mode S Transponders transmit automatically, without needing to be interrogated by a radar, to announce the won-ship aircraft's presence to nearby ADS-B equipped aircraft.  (Also see Acquisition Squitter.)

Garble, Non-synchronous  -  Interfering reception of two or more replies.  Interfering replies received from a transponder that is being interrogated by some other source is called FRUIT. 

Geometric Dilution of Position (GDOP)  -  The ratio of position error of a multilateration system.  More precisely, it is the ratio of the standard deviation of the position error to the standard deviation of the measurement errors, assuming all measurement errors are statistically independent and have a zero mean and the same standard distribution.  GDOP is the measure of the "goodness" of the geometry of the multi-lateration sources as seen by the observer; a low GDOP is desirable, a high GDOP undesirable. (See also PDOP, HDOP and VDOP.) 
Geometric height  -  The minimum altitude above or below a plane tangent to the earth's ellipsoid as defined by WGS84. 

Geometric height error  -  Geometric height error is the error between the true geometric height and the transmitted geometric height.

The user segment consists of antennas and receiver-processors that provide positioning, velocity, and precise timing to the user. 

GNSS Altitude (MSL)  -  The height of the aircraft (or of its GNSS antenna) above the geoid, which is the surface that represents mean sea level.  The term *geoid,* as defined by the National Geodetic Survey's *Geodetic Glossary,* is the equipotential surface of the Earth's gravity field which best fits, in the least squares sense, mean sea level. 

Graticule  -  A network of lines on a map representing geographic parallels and meridians. Height Above Touchdown (HAT)  -  Specifically, the height above the Runway Intercept Waypoint.  In using this term for airborne equipment specifications, care should be taken to define the point on the aircraft (GPS antenna, wheel height, center of mass) that applies. 

Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP)  -  The ratio of user-referenced horizontal position error to measurement error of a multi-lateration system.  (See GDOP for a more detailed description.) In-Trail Climb  -  In-trail climb (ITC) procedures enables trailing aircraft to climb to a more fuel-efficient or less turbulent altitude.

Latency Compensation  -  High accuracy applications may correct for system latency introduced position errors using ADS-B time synchronized position and velocity information. 

Latitude  -  In this document, "latitude" always means "WGS-84 geodetic latitude."  That is, the latitude of a point is the angle that a line that passes through that point, and that is normal to the WGS-84 ellipsoid, makes with the equatorial plane of that ellipsoid.  North latitudes are positive, and south latitudes are negative. 

Longitude - In this document, "longitude" always means "WGS-84 geodetic longitude."  
That is, the longitude of a point is the angle between the plane of that point's local geodetic meridian and the plane of the WGS-84 prime meridian (the meridian of Greenwich).  East longitudes are positive, and west longitudes are negative. Maximum Operating Range  -  The maximum range at which it is expected that the ADS-B Airborne System will provide the performance necessary to meet the ADS-B

Transmitting Subsystems for the duration of an operational condition.  When a Mode S Transponder is used as the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, *On-Condition* messages are when Register 0A16
 is loaded with the message contents.  (See *Event-Driven Messages*.)  
Various *On-Condition* messages are described in subparagraphs under Â§2.2.3.2.7 of these MOPS, and include the Target State and Status Message (TYPE=29, Subtype=0, Â§2.2.3.2.7.1), the Aircraft Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, Subtype=0 for airborne, Subtype=1 for surface, Â§2.2.3.2.7.2), and the 1090ES Aircraft Status Message (TYPE=28, Â§2.2.3.2.7.8), which contains both the Emergency/Priority Status Message 
(Subtype=1), and the TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) Broadcast Message (Subtype=2). Passing Maneuvers  -  Procedures whereby pilots use: 1, onboard display of traffic to identify an aircraft they wish to pass; 2, traffic display and weather radar to establish a clear path for the maneuver; and 3, voice communication with controllers to positively identify traffic to be passed, state intentions and report initiation and completion maneuver. 

Planned Primary Means  -  Use of ADS-B for Planned Primary Means will be possible for selected airspace operations based upon predictable conditions, e.g., GNSS constellation, type of operation, and extent of ADS-B equipage for participating aircraft. That is, ADS-B will be available as a primary means of surveillance for particular periods of time in particular geographical regions for approved operations. 

Phase of Flight  -  The phases of flight are defined as follows: 

1. Oceanic/Remote  -  Radio updating is not viable due to either very limited 
navigation aid coverage or no navigation aid coverage. 
2. En route/Domestic  -  Aircraft sequences above 15500 feet while not actively

3. Terminal  -  Aircraft sequences below 15000 feet; or when the aircraft is in 
Approach and exceeds 3000 feet above arrival airport  elevation if there is no missed approach holding point, or the missed approach holding point is sequenced; or the aircraft is in Takeoff and exceeds 3000 feet above departure airport  elevation if no SID exist in active flight plan, or the last way point of the SID is sequenced below 15500. 
4. Approach  -  The first way point on the active approach or approach transition is 
sequenced, or the aircraft sequences below 2000 feet above arrival airport elevation.  Approach flight phase will not be active when a VFR approach is in the active flight plan. 
Position Uncertainty Category (PUC)  -  The position uncertainty category (PUC) is needed for surveillance applications to determine whether the reported position has an acceptable level of position uncertainty.  The category is based on the aircraft's estimate of position uncertainty (EPU), as defined in 3.1.2 of the RNP MASPS[9]  
Primary Means of Navigation  -  The airborne navigation equipment that meets the  
requirements of radio navigation for the intended phase of flight (route to be flown). These requirements include satisfying the necessary level of accuracy, integrity, continuity, and availability for a particular area, route, procedure, or operation.  Examples of systems which provide a primary means of navigation include: 

a. VOR for domestic en route, terminal, and non precision approach where it is 
available; 
b. VOR/DME for domestic en route above flight level 240, terminal, and non 
precision approach where it is available; 
c. OMEGA for Oceanic Operation; d. INS for Oceanic Operation; 
Protected Zone  -  In the Free Flight environment, each aircraft will be surrounded by two zones, a protected zone and an alert zone.  The protected zone must remain sterile to assure separation.  It can be envisioned as a distance-based "hockey puck" with radius equal to half the horizontal separation minimum and vertical extent equal to + half the vertical separation minimum.  The size of the protected zone is a direct reflection of the position determination accuracy. QFE  -  Local station barometric pressure setting which provides an altimeter reading of indicated altitude of the airplane above the station, whether airborne or on the ground.

For example, an aircraft taxiing behind another aircraft can be cleared to follow and maintain separation on a lead aircraft.  Station-keeping can be used to maintain a given (or variable) separation.  An aircraft that is equipped with an ADS-B receiver could be cleared to follow an FMS or GNSS equipped aircraft on a GNSS/FMS/RNP approach to an airport.  An aircraft doing station-keeping would be required to have, as a minimum, some type of CDTI. 

State Vector  -  An aircraft or vehicle's current kinematic state. Supplemental Means of Navigation  -  An approved navigation system that can be used in controlled airspace of the NAS in conjunction with a sole means of navigation. Tactical Parameters  -  Tactical information may be used to enhance the performance of designated applications.  System designs should be flexible enough to support tactical parameters; however, it is not required to provide the parameters in all implementations. 

TCAS Implementation  -  ADS-B transmit and receive capability implemented as part of a TCAS installation (1090 MHz transmit and receive). 

Terminal Area  -  A general term used to describe airspace in which approach control service or airport traffic control service is provided.

The TSD may also have the capability to provide conflict resolutions. 

Trajectory Change Point (TCP)  -  TCPs provide tactical information specifying space/time points at which the current trajectory of the vehicle will change.  This change in vehicle trajectory could be in the form of a change in altitude (climb/descent), a change in heading, a change in airspeed (increase/decrease), or any combination thereof.

## B.3 Illustrations Of Geodetic Coordinate Definitions B.3.1 Latitude, Longitude And Geodetic Height

Figure B-1 illustrates the definitions of the geodetic coordinates: latitude (Ï), longitude 
(Î»), and geodetic height (h). 

Figure B-2 illustrates the definition of latitude in more detail by showing the WGS-84 
ellipsoid with a very exaggerated eccentricity. 

## B.3.2 Latitude And Longitude Representations

Latitude and longitude are angles, and so may be represented in various angular units of measure: radians, degrees, or circles.  One important way of representing angles is as binary fractions of a circle ("angular weighted binary," or AWB).  Many avionics position data sources use ARINC 429 data buses to deliver such angular parameters as latitude, longitude, and heading, and the binary ARINC 429 data words use the angular weighted binary notation for representing angles. Figure B-3 illustrates how latitude and longitude are represented using radians, degrees, and binary fractions of a circle.

## C Aircraft Antenna Characteristics C.1 Introduction

Transmissions and receptions of signals in the 1090 MHz frequency band are affected significantly by aircraft antenna gain characteristics.  Such effects are known to be significant in the performance of the existing ATCRBS, Mode S surveillance and collisions avoidance (TCAS/ACAS) systems.  Similarly, aircraft antenna effects can be expected to be significant in the performance of Extended Squitter ADS-B. To support surveillance from the ground, ideally an aircraft antenna would provide coverage that is omnidirectional in azimuth, and that maintains signal strength when an aircraft banks and/or pitches.  Furthermore the physical antenna should be small to minimize drag.  Practical antennas installed on aircraft differ from the ideal in several ways.  The most obvious difference is that a single antenna provides good coverage over just one of the two hemispheres.  A bottom mounted antenna provides coverage in downward directions, and a top mounted antenna provides coverage in upward directions, and both top and bottom antennas provide coverage horizontally.  Primary applications of 1090 MHz Extended Squitter require full solid angle mutual observability.  Operational performance for IFR applications must be provided in any geometry between any two aircraft. Unlike ground based surveillance, message exchanges are required between all aircraft within line of sight and within range for reception prescribed for each equipment type.  Therefore the installed antenna performance must provide adequate coverage in the volume fully surrounding an airborne aircraft. It follows that there is a significant benefit in having a diversity installation consisting of both a top antenna and a bottom antenna. 

Another departure from ideal performance is caused by the obstruction of signals by the tail of the aircraft, which affects top antenna performance.  Typically a top antenna pattern will exhibit a reduction in gain in the aft direction.  Because of the size of an aircraft tail relative to one wavelength (which is about 1 foot at 1090 MHz), the signal is not completely blocked by the tail, but instead it is made weaker by several dB.  Signals in this direction may be still useful, depending on the range and other factors in the link power budget. In addition to the tail, objects such as other antennas, propeller blades, engines, wheels, and flaps can also cause blockage of 1090 MHz signals.  Furthermore it is possible for reflections from a wing or other flat surface on the aircraft to interfere constructively or destructively with the signal and cause additional fluctuations in signal strength. Considerations such as these have prompted a viewpoint that the entire aircraft should be considered as part of the antenna.  In the descriptions and data that follow, this point of view is adopted.  Antenna gain is considered to be a characterization of the installed antenna, including all effects of the aircraft. 

Given the operational requirement for mutual observability, the installed antenna(s) must support adequate received power at the maximum range for the each equipment type.  At these ranges the practical observation angles between operationally relevant aircraft for A1S/A1 equipment are limited to the values of Â±10 degrees.  At the greatest ADS B 
range for A3 the angles are limited to the same values even with extreme altitude differences which must be supported.  Mutual observation at high angle slant ranges must be continuous with adequate received power to maintain reception probability necessary to provide the Report update rates required at the current range.  Antenna gain patterns change rapidly with increasing elevation angles from horizontal.  Consequent degradation may by compensated by the improved range advantage in realistic geometric conditions producing high angular values (e.g., Â±75 degrees).  Antenna installation designs must maximize air to air surveillance functionality to be essentially free of operational holes. 

Upper and lower antenna configurations and diversity techniques will typically be necessary to support applications intended for IFR airspace procedures.  The following sections provide indications of the variations in coverage and link pattern performance expected for antenna locations and diversity systems. 

## C.2 Model Aircraft Antenna Pattern Measurements

A large set of antenna gain measurements is given in Reference C-1.  These were made using 20:1 scale aircraft models.  The measurements were made in an antenna test range.  
The model aircraft was installed on a movable mount that enabled testing in every direction.  Measurements were made in 2 degree steps in both azimuth and elevation. The measurement techniques are described in the reference.  Measurements were made for the following types of aircraft, and for several antenna locations on each aircraft, some top mounted and some bottom mounted.   
Piper Cherokee Shrike Commander 
 
Cessna 150 
 
Cessna 402B 
 
Cessna Cardinal Beech Baron 
 
Beech B99 
Twin Otter 
 
Helio U10D 
 
Gates Lear Jet Grumman Gulfstream II 
These include both high wing and low wing aircraft, single engine and twin engine aircraft, and small jet aircraft.  The focus on General Aviation types of aircraft was intended to complement data that already existed for larger air carrier types.  Photos in this reference show each of the aircraft models, and indicate the antenna locations that were tested.  The measured patterns are given in the form of polar plots showing the three principal planes for each antenna on each aircraft.  Similar model measurements were also made for several air carrier aircraft, namely, Boeing 727 Boeing 737 Boeing 707 Boeing 747 
as described in Reference C-2. 

## C.3 Analysis Of Aircraft Antenna Gain Measurements

The data given in Reference C-1 has been analyzed in several different ways, as described in Reference C-2.  This report presents a different plotting format called the 
"Gain-Contour Plot", which has the advantage of showing the entire antenna pattern (in every direction) on one plot.  The resulting plots reveal patterns that can be recognized as effects of obstruction and in some cases vertical lobing caused by reflection from a wing. These interpretations are described in the report. 

Reference C-2 also presents a statistical analysis, which is useful in system design and performance assessments.  Results are presented showing the probability of each possible value of antenna gain.  Therefore, while recognizing that certain very low values of antenna gain exist, these results indicate how common these conditions are.  Results are also presented showing the degradation in performance due to conditions of flaps down, wheels down, and banking. 

Building on those analyses and results, Reference C-3 presents a set of antenna gain contour plots for a large number of aircraft-antenna combinations.  The results are useful in that they extend the cases described in Ref. C-2, providing a much larger number of cases in which to observe the described effects. 

Building further on the results in Reference C-2, an additional analysis is given in Reference C-4.  The results provide a probability distribution of aircraft antenna gain for the entire set of aircraft, including all of the antenna locations tested (page 18).  This curve, which is the cumulative probability distribution of antenna gain values, is useful in designing a system, in which it is important to allow for many different aircraft types and antenna locations.  The application of this data to the system design of TCAS is the main subject of this report.  The results presented in Ref. C-4 are given in two ways, one for aircraft having a single bottom mounted antenna, and the other for aircraft equipped with a diversity combination consisting of a top antenna and a bottom antenna.  To characterize top-bottom diversity, this analysis assigns the antenna gain in a particular direction to be the larger of the two values (gain of the bottom antenna and gain of the top antenna). An explicit mathematical model for aircraft antenna gain is given in the TLAT report (Ref. C-5).  This is a stochastic model that is consistent with the frequency of occurrence of antenna-gain values in Ref. C-4, and includes a formula to characterize the effects of elevation angle for top and bottom antennas.  This antenna-gain model was used for the performance assessments made in the TLAT Report (Ref. C-5). In summary, the probability distribution of antenna gain values given in Ref. C-4 and C-5 
is a useful characterization of aircraft antenna gain deviations caused by banking, obstructions, and reflections.  It is the product of model measurements made on a number of aircraft, including both general aviation and air carrier types, and a number of possible antenna locations on each.  This data was used in designing the air-to-air power budget for TCAS, and has been used for air-to-air and air-to-ground transmission and reception of Extended Squitter signals.

## Appendix D 1090 Mhz Ads-B Ground Architecture Example

 
This Page Intentionally Left Blank 

## D 1090 Mhz Ads-B Ground Architecture Example D.1 Introduction And Purpose

This appendix defines examples of ground architectures that can support (1) surveillance for ATC using Extended Squitter ADS-B reports and (2) Traffic Information Service Broadcast (TIS-B) on 1090 MHz.  

## Atc Surveillance

The FAA is interested in Extended Squitter as a means of surveillance of aircraft via ground stations.  Surveillance of both airborne aircraft and aircraft on the airport surface are of interest.  The FAA has been investigating ground architectures that would be appropriate for this purpose.  The results are summarized in this appendix.  An example 
1090 ground architecture for high density airspace in a current radar environment is summarized in this appendix.  As new information arises from programs such as Safe Flight 21 (including evaluation efforts in Ohio River Valley and Alaska Capstone), the FAA and the NAS users will collectively revise the architecture to refine the course of NAS modernization. 

Note that the Traffic Information Service (TIS) capability is not included in the Extended Squitter ground station, since this service will be provided by conventional secondary radars with Mode S capability. 

## Traffic Information Service - Broadcast

Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B) on 1090 MHz is a ground-to-aircraft broadcast service that provides "ADS-B like" surveillance transmissions for aircraft that are not equipped for 1090 MHz ADS-B.  TIS-B makes non-equipped aircraft visible to an aircraft with an ADS-B receiver.  The surveillance source for this ground-to-aircraft broadcast can be a rotating beam terminal or enroute radar.  Other possible surveillance sources are enroute, terminal/approach radars and surface multilateration systems.  Such multilateration systems provide a higher update rate and better surveillance accuracy than terminal or enroute radars. 

TIS-B is considered to be an integral part of an ADS-B system since it is an important element in transition.  If Extended Squitter surveillance is in use in a region of airspace, TIS-B can make all aircraft visible to a user with a 1090 MHz receiver even though not all aircraft are equipped for Extended Squitter. 

## D.2 Atc Surveillance D.2.1 Avionics Equipage

In order to achieve a surveillance system that is based on Extended Squitter, it is necessary to define a transition strategy for integrating Extended Squitter into the existing system that will accommodate the mixed environment that will exist for many years during the transition from SSR to a possible full use of Extended Squitter.  For this reason, the following avionics equipment must be accommodated: 

1. Mode A/C transponder 
2. Mode S transponder without Extended Squitter 
3. Mode S transponder with Extended Squitter 
4. Non-transponder Extended Squitter device. 

## D.2.2 Transition Issues

A number of issues must be addressed in this transition strategy.  Significant issues include: 

1. Potential loss of independence between surveillance, navigation and communication 
functions. 
2. Validation (or at least a reasonableness test) of reported position until reliability of 
this data is established by experience. 
3. Surveillance in a mixed ADS-B/SSR environment for ATC airborne and surface 
surveillance 
4. Backup surveillance for loss of GNSS function for individual aircraft due to an 
equipment malfunction. 
5. Backup surveillance for loss of GNSS function over an extended area due to 
interference effects on GNSS operation.  
6. The ability to suppress the creation of tracks on ADS-B reports that contain 
intentionally incorrect position information (i.e., spoofers). 

## D.2.3 Ground Surveillance Of Airborne Aircraft D.2.3.1 Surveillance Techniques D.2.3.1.1 Current Technology

ATC surveillance of airborne aircraft is currently provided by narrow scanning beam SSR's often collocated with primary radars.  SSR's intended for terminal surveillance have a maximum range of 60 to 100 NM and a scan interval of 4 to 6 seconds.  En route coverage is provided by SSR's with a maximum range of 200 to 250 NM and a scan interval of 8 to 12 seconds. Different capabilities exist for these SSR's.  This includes Mode A/C only capability based on sliding window or monopulse azimuth processing.  The newest SSR's have Mode S (and Mode A/C) capability with monopulse azimuth determination.  Mode S interrogators are able to support the readout of aircraft developed information on identity, aircraft state and intent.  This latter capability is referred to as enhanced surveillance. 

## D.2.3.1.2 End State Surveillance Using Extended Squitter

The Extended Squitter technique provides formats for airborne use that are optimized for ATC surveillance.  These formats include position, velocity, ICAO address and aircraft call sign.  Provision is made to report the quality of the reported surveillance data based upon the accuracy of the navigation source data. As appropriate experience is gained and a transition is made to ADS-B, squitter receiving stations might be able to replace some current SSR's.  Terminal area squitter stations would have ranges up to 100 NM.  Squitter stations would provide coverage up to 250 NM in en route airspace and up to 300 NM as required in remote areas. The squitter stations would be capable of transmitting interrogations in order to obtain additional information from the transponder, such as intent and Mode A code. While these stations would provide omni-directional coverage, in most cases this would be achieved with an antenna having six to twelve sectors. Operation with such an antenna requires the use of a receiver associated with each antenna sector, with a single transmitter that may be switched between the sectors as required.  The use of multiple sectors will be required at high density environments for increased traffic capacity, since each receiver only has to cope with the traffic in one sector.  Such an antenna will also be required at en route stations in order to achieve the antenna gain required for long range operation.  For illustrative purposes, six-sector antennas are used in this appendix for ground system configuration examples employing multi-sector antennas. 

## D.2.3.2 Airspace Considerations

The potential for transition of ATC surveillance to Extended Squitter depends on the type of airspace being covered.  The most likely application of Extended Squitter will be in airspace that does not currently have secondary radar surveillance coverage.  This could be in a remote area or low altitude coverage in any airspace. It is unlikely that ADS-B will replace secondary radar surveillance in any high density airspace for the foreseeable future.  A principal consideration is the need for independence between surveillance and navigation in such airspace.  A second consideration is the vulnerability of satellite navigation sources to low level interference. Such an interference event could result in the loss of satellite navigation service over areas measured in tens of kilometers.  Providing backup surveillance for large numbers of aircraft will significantly increase the cost of the ADS-B ground station to the point where ADS-B may not be a cost effective replacement for radar.  ADS-B replacement of secondary radar in high density airspace will likely require the development of a robust satellite navigation source, or the use of an alternate navigation source such as an inertial platform as a backup.  

## D.2.3.3 Transition Strategy D.2.3.3.1 Validation

If necessary, position validation can be performed by a single station equipped with a multi-sector antenna.  Range would be determined by direct interrogation of the transponder, while bearing would be determined by measuring the relative amplitude of the received signals in the antenna sectors.  Aircraft equipped with a non transponder device would only be able to support bearing validation unless the ground system is equipped with multilateration capability (e.g., airport surface surveillance).   
Analysis indicates that a six-sector antenna can provide a bearing accuracy of around 2 degrees.  This should be accurate enough for a reasonableness test in low density airspace, but would not be sufficient for a terminal area. 

Where provided for backup service, multilateration can be performed in the background mode for validated aircraft for periodic revalidation of position.  When validation is performed by direct interrogation, a technique similar to TCAS hybrid surveillance could be implemented to revalidate aircraft that have flight paths in close proximity to other aircraft. 

## D.2.3.3.2 Backup

If necessary, backup surveillance could be provided in terminal environments using a time- difference of arrival multilateration technique.  Multilateration will require the use of multiple receiving stations.  This could be configured as a central station surrounded by three or more outrigger stations.  In this configuration, the central station would be a full Extended Squitter ground station with transmit and receive capability and a multisector antenna.  The outrigger stations would be simple receivers with omni-directional antennas.  If the multilateration system is provided with sufficient capacity, multilateration could provide backup for single aircraft or area failures of GNSS 
functionality. Where multilateration is not available, aircraft will need to be interrogated at the nominal scan interval.  Backup surveillance for non-transponder devices would only be possible if multiple bearing measurements are available through overlapping ground station coverage. 

## D.2.3.3.3 Mixed Equipage

Surveillance on Mode S aircraft that are not equipped with Extended Squitter can be performed using multilateration on the short squitter, or by direct interrogation. Surveillance of Mode A/C only aircraft would require an active interrogation approach. The use of active interrogations (single or whisper shout depending upon the Mode A/C traffic density) would be used to elicit Mode A or C replies at a regular rate.  In effect, the ground station operates like a TCAS unit, but with a lower interrogation rate and at higher effective radiated power due to its increased operating range.  Since the majority of the aircraft in high density environments will be Mode S equipped, at most 8 whisper/shout levels should be needed for Mode A/C surveillance out to 60 to 100 NM. The central station could obtain range and a coarse bearing estimate from its multi-sector antenna.  The position could be refined by use of multilateration data from the outriggers. The coarse position estimate would be very helpful in eliminating phantoms (position reports made up of replies from different aircraft). Side lobe suppression will be required to limit replies in the antenna side lobes. 

## D.2.3.4 Special Considerations For Precision Runway Monitoring

One surveillance application is the monitoring of aircraft on precision approaches.  This is sometimes referred to as precision runway monitoring (PRM).  Using current technology, aircraft navigate on the approach using ILS or MLS and are monitored by SSR, sometimes operating at a higher scan rate than for normal ATC surveillance.  Thus the navigation and monitoring techniques are completely independent. Consideration is being given to use GNSS as the basis for future landing systems.  If GNSS is used for this purpose, it is likely that some independent form of validation would be required for ADS-B surveillance data before it could also be used for PRM. Without independent validation, ADS-B for PRM would not be able to detect a blunder caused by a malfunction of the navigation equipment.  Such a malfunction would result in both the air crew and the ground believing that the aircraft was on the correct approach, when in fact a deviation had occurred. 

One example of a validation for PRM is the use of multilateration on the Extended Squitter transmission, as described earlier.  This technique would provide the necessary independence of surveillance and navigation. Another example of independent validation of the ADS-B reports from aircraft is readout of the ADS-B message and comparison to the ground radar position when the airport is equipped with a Mode S interrogator. Another application of ADS-B in PRM is to use CDTI and associated alert algorithms for monitoring parallel approaches.  To support this air-to-air application of ADS-B, the current ground-based techniques should be adequate as monitoring responsibility rests primarily in the cockpit. 

## D.2.4 Surface Surveillance D.2.4.1 Surveillance Techniques D.2.4.1.1 Current Technology

Current surveillance on the airport surface is provided by primary radar in the form of the Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE).  The ASDE provides reliable surveillance on all targets (regardless of equipage) but does not provide identity, which is useful for blunder detection and resolution.  For this reason, techniques for providing aircraft identity using the aircraft transponder are being considered. Surveillance on the airport surface requires that the positional error be small compared to the size of an aircraft in order to provide reliable correlation with the ASDE report.  This rules out the use of direct range and azimuth measurement, or even range-range multilateration due to the tolerance in the transponder turnaround delay.  For this reason SSR-based surface systems such as ASDE-X (first operational site planned for mid-2003) 
use time-difference of arrival multilateration, since it is based only on the difference in time of the receipt of an aircraft transmission at spatially diverse ground stations.   

## D.2.4.1.2 End State Surveillance Using Extended Squitter

The Extended Squitter design provides formats for use on the airport surface that are optimized for surface surveillance.  These formats include position, velocity, ICAO address and aircraft call sign.  The accuracy needed for surface surveillance can be supported by GNSS using local or wide area differential corrections.  

## D.2.4.2 Transition Strategy D.2.4.2.1 Validation

If necessary, validation of surface position reports can be performed using multilateration on the Extended Squitter or acquisition squitter transmission.  Once validated, the ADS-B 
reports can be used for improved surveillance performance.  Multilateration can be performed in the background mode for validated aircraft for periodic revalidation of position. 

## D.2.4.2.2 Backup

The background process of multilateration provides position and identity for short or long squitter reports that do not contain GNSS position information.  A total loss of GNSS 
service would cause the surveillance system to revert to full multilateration operation.  
This would result in lower surveillance performance since the position accuracy and update rate will be somewhat degraded and the aircraft will no longer provide velocity information.  However, surveillance could continue throughout the loss of GNSS service. 

## D.2.4.2.3 Mixed Equipage

With multilateration, the only aircraft requirement for surveillance is a periodic transmission.  All Mode S transponders (even those that do not support Extended Squitter) transmit a short squitter on an average of once per second.  This is a high enough rate to support multilateration for surface surveillance. Mode A/C transponders do not squitter, so provision would have to be made to elicit periodic replies if Mode A/C aircraft are to participate in surface surveillance during the transition period.  One approach is to modify the transponders to generate a reply once per second.  This may not be a feasible approach, since high equipment modification costs could lead operators to resist such a modification.  A second approach may be used if only a small percentage of surface aircraft are Mode A/C equipped (i.e., most aircraft are Mode S equipped).  This approach is based on the use of the whisper/shout technique used by TCAS to interrogate only a subset of the Mode A/C aircraft within range.   

## D.2.4.2.4 Asde-X Surface Surveillance System

The previous sections (Â§D.2.4.2.2 and Â§D.2.4.2.3) provided a general strategy for addressing transition issues that can lead to an end-state surface surveillance system based on Extended Squitter.  This section summarizes the high-level capabilities of an operational system in the National Airspace System, called ASDE-X, that can provide a smooth transition to end-state surface surveillance systems. ASDE-X is a new generation surface surveillance system that is being deployed in 25 airports starting in mid-2003.  It consists of the following four major system components: 

1. A surface movement "primary" radar that is similar to ASDE, but operating in 
the X-Band frequency. 
2. A Transponder-Based multilateration/ADS-B system that provides position and 
identification to all Transponder-equipped aircraft or vehicles.  The remote 
Receive/Transmit (R/T) stations of the multilateration system can interrogate Mode A/C Transponders using whisper-and-shout sequences to determine target position based on time-difference-of-arrival techniques.  The remote R/T and Receive Only (R/O) stations of multilateration also process Extended Squitters to derive position and identification information. 

3. An automation that combines all of the sensor reports (primary/secondary radars, 
multilateration, ADS-B Extended Squitter) into a single track. 
4. New high bright color displays. 
The surface multilateration system of the ASDE-X provides validation of 1090 MHz ADS-B data, as well as back-up in the event of GNSS failure.  Since surface multilateration also uses a whisper/shout technique to interrogate Mode A/C aircraft, ASDE-X can provide surveillance in a mixed equipage environment (Mode A/C and Mode S).  Additionally, ASDE-X is capable of detecting surface targets that are not equipped with any type of Transponder and those targets with malfunctioning Transponders. The FAA also plans to upgrade the existing 34 ASDE-3 systems with multilateration and multi-sensor data fusion capabilities. In the end-state when all aircraft are 1090 MHz ADS-B equipped, ASDE-X can serve as an operational platform for providing surface surveillance through its R/O or R/T stations. 

## D.2.5 Transition Strategy Summary

A strategy for transitioning from an SSR to an Extended Squitter environment has been defined.  An example of a planned operational surface surveillance system, ASDE-X, is provided to illustrate the implementation of a transition strategy.  The strategy makes use of the capabilities of those SSR transponders to support validation, backup and mixed equipage scenarios through direct range and bearing measurement and multilateration. Since the ADS-B message is contained in an SSR waveform, the same equipment that is needed for independent position measurement of the SSR transponders can also be used to receive the ADS-B squitters.  Transition is greatly simplified by the integration of the ADS-B function with the Mode S transponder. 

## D.2.6 Ground Architecture For Air-Ground Surveillance D.2.6.1 Introduction D.2.6.1.1 Purpose

The previous sections described a possible transition strategy for ATC use of Extended Squitter.  The capability of Extended Squitter ground receiving stations was defined in general operational terms.  The purpose of this section is to provide more details on the architecture that might be used to provide Extended Squitter surveillance for ground ATC use.   

## D.2.6.1.2 Overview

This section begins with a description of the currently implemented Mode S ground interrogators.  This is relevant to Extended Squitter since ADS-B surveillance data can be obtained by a conventional Mode S interrogator via direct readout of the Mode S transponder.  Such readout will likely be the initial technique for ATC use of ADS-B 
data.  This is followed by a description of the architecture of increasingly more capable Extended Squitter ground stations. 

## D.2.6.1.3 Interface Considerations

Extended squitter ground stations will require the ability to interface with other ATC surveillance resources to generate a consolidated surveillance image.  For this reason, these ground stations will be required to conform to an appropriate output interface standard (e.g., the internationally accepted Eurocontrol ASTERIX formats).   

## D.2.6.2 Mode S Ssr Ground Station

A Mode S SSR normally operates with a scanning narrow beam antenna.  This antenna is often mounted on the same pedestal as a co-located primary radar.  Terminal Mode S SSRs operate with a scan time of 4 to 6 seconds and provide coverage out to 60 to 100 NM.  En route Mode S SSRs operate with scan times of 8 to 12 seconds out to a range of 200 to 250 NM.  A functional diagram of a Mode S SSR ground station is provided in Figure D-1. 

## 

A Mode S SSR provides surveillance and data link service to Mode S equipped aircraft and surveillance service for Mode A/C equipped aircraft.  Due to the use of monopulse, (a technique for determining the off-boresight angle of received replies) surveillance to a Mode S aircraft is normally provided via a single interrogation per scan.  Additional interrogations are scheduled each scan as needed to provide data link service. One data link service supported by a Mode S SSR is the readout of transponder data registers that can be loaded by the aircraft to contain aircraft state, intent, weather data, etc.  These registers can be accessed on demand by the Mode S SSR using the ground initiated Comm-B (GICB) protocol.  This protocol is employed to provide the enhanced surveillance capability being mandated by States in the core area of central Europe. Extended squitter information that is broadcast by a Mode S transponder is stored in the GICB registers.  This means that ADS-B data is available on demand to a Mode S SSR.  
The ability to obtain GNSS position and velocity, as well as intent information, via a Mode S SSR can be an important benefit during a transition to ADS-B.  In addition, ground readout of ADS-B data provides an opportunity to monitor the status of ADS-B 
implementation and, more importantly, the reliability of this data since it can be directly compared to the Mode S radar data. 

## D.2.6.3 Extended Squitter Ground Stations D.2.6.3.1 Overview

An Extended Squitter ground station can be configured to provide different levels of performance as required. A block diagram of the subsystems that could be included in a basic Extended Squitter transmit/receive ground station is shown in Figure D-2.  The configuration shown is for a ground station with an omni-directional antenna.  A ground system with a multi-sector antenna would require a receiver and reply processors for each antenna sector.  A single transmitter would be used, with a switch to connect it to any antenna sector under control of the computer system. 

## D.2.6.3.2 Omni Antenna, Receive Only

Capabilities:  The simplest ground station only has the ability to passively receive Extended Squitter ADS-B reports. It operates with an omni directional antenna. 

Intended Use
:  This configuration is expected to be used in low density or remote airspace not currently within ATC surveillance coverage. A block diagram of this configuration is presented in Figure D-3. 

## D.2.6.3.3 Omni Antenna, Receive Only, Angle Of Arrival Capability

Capabilities:  This configuration provides the same reception capability as above, but it is augmented with a simple angle-of-arrival capability in order to obtain an approximate estimate of aircraft azimuth.  This ground station configuration can provide azimuth validation on ADS-B equipped aircraft in low density airspace.  Azimuth accuracy for such an antenna has been measured to be approximately 8 degrees, one sigma. 

Validation:  The angle-of-arrival validation capability enables the ground station to provide approximate validation of the ADS-B azimuth through direct comparison of the actively measured azimuth with the azimuth calculated from the ADS-B position report.  
In cases where overlapping coverage exists for this type of ground station, approximate aircraft positions can be developed using azimuth triangulation from the ground stations. This system allows for independent validation of ADS-B position reports. 

Intended Use:
 The approximate position location provided by this configuration would make it suitable only for use in low density airspace.  
A block diagram of this configuration is presented in Figure D-4.  Note that multiple stations of this type that have overlapping coverage could perform azimuth triangulation. 

## D.2.6.3.4 Six-Sector Antenna, Receive/Transmit

Capabilities:  This configuration provides the same reception capabilities as the preceding configuration.  In addition, it is equipped with a six-sector antenna, with one receiver per antenna beam and a single transmitter that may be switched to any beam as required. The use of the six-sector antenna allows operation into higher density than is possible with an omni antenna, since each receiver has to cope only with the squitters and Mode A/C replies received from a single antenna beam.  An analysis of side lobe structure and traffic distribution indicates that such an antenna can be expected to provide a capacity 2.5 times the capacity of a ground station using an omni-directional antenna. 

Validation and Fall-Back Surveillance:  In addition to increased capacity, the six-sector antenna enables this ground station to provide a higher level of validation than the omni directional configuration.  This is due to the ability of the six-sector antenna to provide azimuth measurement to an accuracy of 2-3 degrees using a simple amplitude monopulse processor.  This coarse azimuth capability together with measured range (for a transponder implementation of Extended Squitter) can also be used to provide fall-back surveillance in the event of the loss of the navigation input for ADS-B.  Fall-back surveillance refers to a lower performance form of surveillance that can be used during an outage of the principal surveillance system. 

Mode S and Mode A/C Surveillance:  The six-sector antenna enables this ground station configuration to provide improved surveillance on Mode S and Mode A/C equipped aircraft compared to the previous configuration. 

Intended Use:  This configuration is expected to be used in low to medium density en route airspace where a fall-back azimuth accuracy of 2-3 degrees may be operationally acceptable. Antennas with a greater number of sectors may be used to achieve higher capacity or improved azimuth measurement accuracy as required. A block diagram of this configuration is presented in Figure D-5. 

 

## D.2.6.3.5 Multilateration Augmentation

Capabilities:  This configuration is equipped with a number of receiving sites for the purpose of providing a time-difference of arrival multilateration capability. Multilateration augmentation may be added to any combination of the ground station configurations listed in Â§D.2.6.3 provided that three or more sites are located in view of target aircraft in the surveillance volume.  Multilateration stations can be very simple, consisting of a 1090 MHz receiver, a reply processor, a means to accomplish accurate time stamping, and a communications modem.  The physical size would be small, about the size of an SSR transponder.  However, intersite communications would be required and 3 or more sites would have to be in view of a particular aircraft in order to obtain a multilateration solution. 

Backup Surveillance:  Depending on the geometry of the ground stations, multilateration position accuracy can equal or exceed that of an SSR.  With this level of position accuracy, backup surveillance is possible.  Backup surveillance refers to an alternative surveillance capability that can be used during an outage of the principal surveillance system that provides equivalent performance to the principle system. 

Mode S and Mode A/C Surveillance:  Mode S and Mode A/C surveillance capability can also be provided via active interrogation.  The coarse position information provided by the six-sector antenna would be very useful in eliminating false targets that could otherwise result from performing multilateration on non-discrete Mode A Code replies. 

Intended Use
:  The level of capability provided by this configuration would be appropriate for use in a terminal area.   
A block diagram showing multilateration augmentation to a representative mix of ground station types providing primary and backup surveillance is presented in Figure D-6. 

 
  
 

## D.2.7 Ground Architecture For Surface Surveillance D.2.7.1 Overview

The purpose of this section is to describe the ground architecture that may be used for surface surveillance using Extended Squitter.  As indicated above, transition and validation requirements will require the use of multilateration is support of surface surveillance.  In addition, inputs from air-ground surveillance devices will also be required to monitor arriving aircraft 

## D.2.7.2 Extended Squitter Surface Ground System

Extended squitter ground stations for surface surveillance can be 1090 MHz receive only or may have 1030 MHz transmit capability in order to (optionally) manage surface squitter rates.  These stations would use omni or single sector beam antennas as appropriate to cover the airport maneuvering area.   

## D.2.7.3 Candidate Ground Architecture

A candidate ground architecture for surface surveillance is shown in Figure D-7.  This architecture features a surveillance server with data fusion capability to provide a surveillance picture based on the combined resources of ADS-B, multilateration, ASDE and the airport surveillance radar (ASR).  This surveillance information is used to support a conflict alert algorithm.  The surveillance and conflict alert results are provided to ground ATC.  Provision is also made to data link alerts to the cockpit. 

## D.2.8 Integration With Other Radars And Automation Systems D.2.8.1 Overview

With the introduction of ADS-B, the surveillance architecture will consist of a mix of primary and secondary air surveillance radars, one or more of the ADS-B ground station options described earlier in this Appendix and surface surveillance sensors including multilateration and ASDE.  The sensors represent a mix in several respects: 

- 
several different primary and secondary models,  
- 
airport and en route equipage each support several different combinations of the primary and secondary models, 
- 
surveillance installations interface with several different automation systems. 
A few areas of CONUS, as well as parts of Alaska and Hawaii, currently have coverage gaps that may be filled with ADS-B ground stations, most likely with some degree of overlap.  Most other areas currently have primary and secondary radars that provide substantial multiple coverage overlaps.  The implementation of ADS-B ground stations in these areas will increase the basic coverage as well as the number of overlaps. Aircraft transponder equipage currently varies and it may well vary in the future with the ADS-B 
equipage options being considered. 

Given this substantial mix and the growth toward free flight, made possible with ADS-B, there is an underlying need for a flexible integration scheme that can exploit the improved surveillance track database to produce unified tracks.  That is, the sum of the track data available on a target from multiple surveillance sensors (radars and ADS-B) 
and from neighboring installations can be fused to provide a unified track on each target with much higher accuracy for ATC and ATM purposes.  The FAA has been investigating methods that can fuse data from multiple and varied sensors toward this end goal. 

## D.2.8.2 The Need For Fusion

The need for sensor data fusion is predicated on several related key factors.  They include: 

- 
the surveillance sensor mixes encountered in the US and  Internationally, 
particularly in European airspace,  
- 
the absolute imperative to maintain safety as aircraft with mixed equipage share the same airspace will not allow reduced safe spacing requirements with current 
automation mosaicing techniques, 
- 
the potential to reduce cost by reducing numbers of surveillance sensors may be enabled by fusing tracks from the remaining overlapping sensors,  
- 
fused ground based surveillance from all sensor types supports a seamless gateto-gate view of aircraft and surface vehicle surveillance which will support future automation and procedural alternatives, 
- 
fused data will provide a source of information to support an ADS-B related 
product  known as Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B), 
- 
supporting ATC and ATM in a Free Flight Environment requires improved surveillance performance in both air-air and air-ground modes, and  
- 
efficiency  in operations made possible by improved surveillance performance  
may lead to reduced separation minimums and reduced controller workload 

## D.2.8.3 Architecture Considerations

Surveillance and Automation teams within the FAA are currently investigating several technical issues that must be considered in selecting an effective and affordable fusion architecture approach.  Consideration must also be given to hardware and software implementations that can be introduced as part of a larger transition in the NAS modernization process.  Conceptually, each automation end point will be supported by one or more surveillance servers and a surveillance hub.  Together they will provide the necessary interface to process and integrate data, which can be synchronous or asynchronous and can be displaced in time due to sensor locations.  Data formats will have to be upgraded to incorporate longer data messages per target, preserve sensor data accuracy and event time and introduce new message content such as pilot intent.  Key technical considerations include: 

- 
the number and type of sensors and automation systems which are to be served, 
- 
the interface data format (ASTERIX is the primary candidate), 
- 
the flexibility for compensating sensor bias (registration) errors since these are usually the limiting factor in fusion,  
- 
the selection of data combining techniques , that is the combining of data reports before fused track files are formed versus the fusing of individual sensor track files versus a hybrid combination of both methods, 
- 
adaptability to sensor failures, 
- 
communication requirements in terms of data link bandwidth, 
- 
processor sizing and placement, 
- 
current and projected state-of-the-art in fusion,  
- 
the establishment of requirements to be applied to the surveillance data fusion system. 
Figure D-8 illustrates an example of the many sites and types of equipage that would introduce target data to a surveillance hub and surveillance servers that implement fusion and provide a unified target database to automation. 

 

## D.2.9 Atc Surveillance Summary

The Extended Squitter system provides a wide range of options for aircraft surveillance. For surveillance of airborne aircraft, these options range from simple, low cost, ADS-B 
receive-only ground stations, to a six-sector configuration with multilateration that can provide ADS-B service plus surveillance of Mode A/C/S aircraft suitable for use in a terminal area.  In the highest density airspace, the option exists for the use of Mode S Secondary Surveillance Radars that will support the surveillance of all Transponderequipped aircraft in addition to readout of ADS-B data. For surface surveillance, these options include ADS-B only, or ADS-B in combination with multilateration to support transition and validation activities. 

## D.3 Traffic Information Service Broadcast (Tis-B) D.3.1 Overview

The formats and protocols required for avionics implementing TIS-B on 1090 MHz are specified in the body of these MOPS and in Appendix A.  Ground processing for TIS-B 
on 1090 MHz must implement these same formats and compatible algorithms to interoperate with airborne equipment. 

Specific requirements for the ground processing component of TIS-B are contained in the TIS-B MASPS.  The TIS-B MASPS contain requirements for TIS-B in a link independent manner.  The purpose of this section of Appendix D is to provide additional guidance on implementing ground processing for TIS-B service on 1090 MHz. 

## D.3.2 Ground Determination Of Extended Squitter Equipage

The normal mode of TIS-B operation on 1090 MHz is to transmit traffic information only for targets that are not equipped with Extended Squitter.  It is therefore necessary for TIS-B ground processing to determine which aircraft are Extended Squitter equipped. Mode S transponders are equipped to provide a data link capability report in response to an interrogation from a Mode S ground radar.  This data link report contains a bit flag to indicate if the transponder is equipped for Extended Squitter.  However, this bit flag is not a reliable indicator of actual Extended Squitter operation.  The bit flag is a static indication of the capability of the transponder support for Extended Squitter formats and protocols.  It would not reflect the loss of extended quitter operation due to a malfunction of the transponder or to the navigation input. The recommended technique for determining active Extended Squitter operation is to monitor 1090 MHz for Extended Squitter reception in an omni directional fashion.  The most convenient way to implement this monitoring is to equip the 1090 MHz TIS-B 
ground stations to receive as well as transmit.  This approach will also provide Extended Squitter determination for aircraft equipped with non-transponder devices. 

## D.3.3 Ground Radar Data Considerations

Wherever possible, the ground radar data used as the basis for TIS-B service should be based upon Mode S surveillance.  The availability of ground surveillance data identified with the aircraft 24-bit address for Mode S equipped aircraft significantly enhances the correlation of ground surveillance data with received Extended Squitters.  If an ATCRBS radar is used as the basis for TIS-B service, correlation between the ground radar data and the received Extended Squitters must be based only on position and altitude since Mode A code is not provided by any of the ADS-B systems. 

## D.3.4 Tis-B Format Selection

Two types of formats are defined for TIS-B on 1090 MHz:  

 
1. Fine Formats The fine TIS-B formats are similar to those used for Extended Squitter ADS-B operation. These formats are intended for use with surveillance data that is the same quality as that used for ADS-B.  Examples of such data quality are surveillance inputs obtained by monitoring other ADS-B links, or a ground-based multilateration system. 

 
The following fine TIS-B format types are defined: Airborne Position Airborne Velocity Surface Position Identification and Category 2.  Coarse Format The coarse format combines both position and velocity data into a single message.  It is intended for use with surveillance data sources that are not accurate enough to warrant the use of the fine formats.  The principal example is surveillance data derived from a scanning beam ground radar. 

## D.3.5 Ground Architecture D.3.5.1 Overview

Because of the limited range and geometry of a single ground station, a network of ground transmitting stations will be required.  Each station will have associated with it two types of coverage.  One is the radio coverage of the transmitted signal.  The radio coverage volume is the airspace that can be usefully reached by signal from the ground station.  The other type of coverage is the service coverage.  This is the geometric scope of responsibility that the ground station assumes for the TIS-B broadcast.  The service coverage is, by definition, a subset of the radio coverage. 

The TIS-B service area could be composed of a number of hexagonal cells.  Each cell defines the area of service for the TIS-B transmitter located in the center of that cell. Overlap (or buffer zone) at cell boundaries only needs to be large enough to ensure continuity of service across the cell boundary.  A minimum service overlap between adjacent cells is desirable in order to eliminate unnecessary duplicate TIS-B 
transmissions.  Since TIS-B aircraft position reports are expected to be reasonably accurate in order to provide useful service, a buffer zone of 2 NM is assumed at cell boundaries. 

A description of a typical TIS-B cell is presented in Figure D-9. 


## D.3.5.2 Tis-B Cell Size Considerations

The cell size has an important role in determining TIS-B operating characteristics.  A 
Smaller cell size is desirable for the following reasons: 
 

1. A reduced maximum transmission range increases the probability of squitter 
reception. 
2. A smaller cell contains fewer aircraft.  This lowers the cell transmission rate and thus 
reduces the hot spot effect. 
3. Due to earth curvature effects, a shorter operating range results in better low altitude 
coverage.

The requirements for transmitter power and receiver sensitivity are different for the different avionics classes.  These requirements, given in Â§2.2, can be summarized as follows.

As a result of these differences, the maximum air-to-air range differs from class to class.  
Following are the values of air-to-air range as limited by these power level requirements.  
In other words, these are the air-to-air ranges in an interference-free environment.  These results apply to a receiving aircraft having the worst-case value of MTL for that class, and they apply to 95 percent of transmitting aircraft whose transmitter power levels are characterized by the models described in Appendix P.  Aircraft antenna gains for both transmitting aircraft and receiving aircraft are characterized by the TLAT antenna-gain model (ref., "*Technical Link Assessment Report*", Appendix D, RTCA Free Flight Select Committee, Eurocontrol ADS Programme, March 2001).  For Class A0 and Class A1S, the results apply to a single bottom mounted antenna.  For the other classes, the results apply to top-bottom antenna diversity.

## F. Masps Compliance Matrix F.1 Introduction

In previous versions of this document, Appendix F, in Section F.2, contained a traceability matrix mapping the compliance of these MOPS with all requirements specified in the ADS-B 
MASPS (RTCA DO-242/DO-242A).  A similar traceability matrix was also produced for the "Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for the Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B)" RTCA DO-
282A.  These traceability matrices permitted both ADS-B link MOPS to be assessed as to their compliance with the ADS-B system requirements specified in the ADS-B MASPS.   

## F.2 Ads-B Masps Compliance Matrix

The development of revised MOPS, for both UAT and 1090ES, has been performed in direct support of FAA and EASA rulemaking for ADS-B equipage, without first revising the ADS-
B MASPS.  Agreed-to changes which necessitate changes to ADS-B system requirements and are not merely link implementation specific have been documented in a series of Issue Papers maintained within RTCA Special Committee 186.  These Issue Papers will serve as the basis for a future revision of the ADS-B MASPS (presumably RTCA DO-242B).  At the time of publication of these MOPS, it is planned that part of any future revision of the ADS-B 
MASPS will include a matrix listing all MASPS requirements and mapping the corresponding requirement(s) from the current versions of both the UAT and 1090ES ADS-B 
link MOPS to the updated MASPS requirements.   

## F.3 Traffic Information Services - Broadcast (Tis-B) Masps Compliance

TIS-B complements the operation of ADS-B by providing ground-to-air broadcast of surveillance data on aircraft that are not equipped for 1090 MHz ADS-B.  The basis for this ground surveillance data may be an ATC Mode S radar, a surface or approach multilateration system or a multi-sensor data processing system.  The TIS-B ground-to-air transmissions use the same signal formats as 1090 MHz ADS-B and can therefore be accepted by a 1090 MHz ADS-B receiver. 

It is anticipated that these MOPS will meet all of the requirements that flow down from the TIS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-286B).

## G 1090 Mhz Ads-B Transition Issues For Avionics G.1 Introduction

The objective of the 1090 MHz ADS-B System is to provide a real-time operational data interface between aircraft and ground vehicle user systems, and with ground-based Air Traffic System (ATS) controllers and automation.  As a new technology component of operational systems, ADS-B will be introduced on an incremental basis to gain operational experience with the technology and to validate both the ADS-B delivery system and the implementation of applications that use ADS-B reports. While this document addresses only the ADS-B equipment and its interfaces, ADS-B 
design and performance requirements must anticipate that applications, substantively supported by ADS-B reports, will be expected to provide users reliable, safe situational awareness and an acceptable basis for IFR operational procedures.  Upon validation of ADS-B report and report delivery performance, ADS-B is intended to become a key component of systems used for the separation of aircraft. This Appendix addresses transition issues for ADS-B avionics.  ADS-B transition strategy and the evolution of ADS-B implementation within ATS ground systems and automation are discussed in Appendix D.    

## G.2 Air-To-Air Ads-B Applications

Initial demonstration of acceptable ADS-B performance and validation of acceptable designs of operator interfaces are likely to be based primarily upon air-to-air applications. Such applications identified for demonstration and potential early operational implementation include improved visual acquisition under VFR conditions, improved terminal operations in low visibility conditions, enhanced operations for en route and oceanic phases of flight, improved separation assurance in non-radar airspace, and parallel approaches to closely spaced runways under IFR conditions.  ADS-B equipment implementations in air transport class platforms during this initial period are anticipated to take advantage of existing Mode S and TCAS avionics and will be integrated into airframes using existing on-board data busses and infrastructure.  Other initial ADS-B 
implementations are likely to be optimized toward targeted initial applications â
expandability of these implementations will be a key factor as the transition to ADS-B progresses.  Implementation of the reception of Flight Information Service-Broadcast (FIS-B) and Traffic Information Service-Broadcast (TIS-B) information within ADS-B 
avionics may be considered. 

## G.3 Aircraft Integration

This document addresses both standalone implementations of ADS-B equipment and implementations integrated into existing aircraft configurations based on Mode S transponders and TCAS/ACAS equipment.  Other aircraft integration issues include interfaces (e.g., to Flight Management Systems and GPS navigation equipment) to obtain source data for ADS-B messages.  Separation of functions, specific interdependencies, hardware/software partitioning and failure detection/mitigation requirements must ensure the integrity, availability, and reliability of all functions to the extent necessary for the multiple services supported.  Furthermore, as the NAS transitions to the use of GNSS, with appropriate augmentations for particular phases of operation, the ADS-B equipment should be able to use upgraded source data without the ADS-B equipment itself requiring retrofit. 1090 MHz technology is supported by U.S. and international standards specifically for ATS surveillance and separation services.  Additionally, the technology is central to the collision avoidance function TCAS/ACAS now required for many commercial operators to provide an independent supplement to the ground-based ATS system.  Implementation of 1090 MHz ADS-B data delivery capabilities will be facilitated through application and adaptation of existing standards and equipment to the maximum extent consistent with the ADS-B MASPS, RTCA DO-242A, in providing for air-to-air and air-to-ground situational awareness and separation support capabilities.   

## G.4 Air-Ground Surveillance Applications

For ground-based surveillance applications, initial validation of ADS-B will be supported, where possible, using the existing ground surveillance infrastructure.  For example, it is intended that 1090 MHz ADS-B messages may be correlated against Secondary Surveillance Radars (SSRs) and enhancements made to those radars to support distribution of ADS-B information to appropriate ground-based systems.  Further, transponder-based ADS-B implementations in aircraft are likely to be polled by SSRs when the ground-based surveillance systems require further data: such ADS-B 
implementations will need to support this interrogation. 

## G.5 Operational Approvals

It is recognized that data provided via ADS-B will be used in applications that will be evaluated on an end-to-end basis for each intended use.  Approval of specific operational use will be predicated on the results of an analysis of the total systems involved.  Data availability, reliability, and integrity will be a significant factor in these approvals.  As operational experience with ADS-B is achieved, it is anticipated that application-specific standards will be developed to facilitate operational approvals.

## H Report Assembly Guidance H.1 Scope And Purpose

This Appendix is provided as a guide to the implementation of the Report Assembly Function in an ADS-B Receiving Subsystem.  The actual *requirements* on the Report Assembly Function are to be found in Section 2 of this MOPS, particularly subsections Â§2.2.8 and Â§2.2.10.  This Appendix is provided as a narrative guide to those requirements and to how they might be met. 

## H.2 Data Flow Into And Out Of The Report Assembly Function

See Figure H-1, which is a copy of Figure 2-20 from Section 2 of this document.  The Report Assembly Function takes ADS-B Messages after they have been received and corrected for possible bit errors by the Message Input Processing.  From these messages it composes ADS-B reports and delivers those reports to the report output storage buffer, from which they can be retrieved by the user application.  The actual interface between the report output storage buffer and the ADS-B user application is beyond the scope of these MOPS.

## H.2.1 Optional Report Control Interface

The dashed-line arrow in Figure H-1 represents an optional Report Control Interface by which an application may configure the output of the Report Assembly Function for its particular needs.  The requirements on this optional interface have not been specified in this document.  This interface, if present, might be used in the following ways. 

a. The Report Control Interface could let the application specify for which ADS-B 
Participants it desires to receive reports, and for which participants it does not require reports.  For instance, an application might specify, via the Report Control Interface, 
that it does not require reports for aircraft that are more than 50 nautical miles away from the own-ship.  Again, the application might use the Report Control Interface to specify that it does not require reports concerning targets that are above (or below) a specified altitude. 

b. The Report Control Interface could let the application specify, for specific targets, 
which report data elements are required and which may be omitted.  For example, a Paired Approach application (as in RTCA DO-242A, Â§D.1.14) would require more 
information about the target with which the own-ship is paired for the approach than a concurrently running Aid To Visual Acquisition application would require for other nearby ADS-B Participants. 

## H.2.2 Type 1 And Type 2 Report Assembly Functions

The concept of Type 1 and Type 2 Report Assembly Functions, as described in Â§2.2.6, subparagraphs "b" and "c," is similar to, but not quite the same as, that of the optional report control interface. 

- 
A Type 2 Report Assembly Function has the full functionality.  That is, it is capable 
of meeting all
 Report Assembly Function requirements.  If a Report Control Interface 
is provided, then the user application may use that interface to throttle back the Report Assembly Function, causing it to provide fewer report elements for some or all of the targets. 
- 
A Type 1 Report Assembly Function has reduced functionality customized for a particular set of user applications.  Although the outputs of a Type 1 Report Assembly Function are similar to those of a Type 2 function with a Report Control 
Interface, in the case of the Type 1 function it has already been statically preconfigured to meet the specific needs of a particular user application or set of applications. 

## H.2.3 Tis-B Report Assembly Function

The requirements for the generation of TIS-B reports are provided in Â§2.2.17.4.6.  These MOPS do not specify the reporting format for TIS-B reports.  However, the information content is specified by Â§2.2.17.4.6.  The generation of TIS-B reports is substantially less complex than ADS-B report generation since in the former case the report elements, except for position and Time of Applicability, are directly mapped from the TIS-B message contents.  The remainder of this Appendix deals only with the ADS-B report generation function. 


 

## H.3 Messages And Reports H.3.1 Ads-B Messages (Input Data For Report Assembly)

Table H-1 lists the types of ADS-B Messages that may be received and used when assembling ADS-B reports.   

| Message                                    | Reference    |

## H.3.2 Ads-B Reports (Data Delivered By Report Assembly Function) H.3.2.1 State Vector Reports

Table H-2 lists the fields in State Vector (SV) Reports and the sources of the data in those fields. The SV Report contains three different Times of Applicability (TOA): TOA-P, TOA-V, and TOA-R.  The third column of Table H-2 indicates for each SV Report element, which of these three times of applicability is the TOA for that report element.  In a minimum system, in which the Report Assembly Function outputs SV Reports only when a position or velocity message is received, TOA-R, the Time of Applicability of the SV Report, would always be either TOA-P or TOA-V, the Time of Applicability of the position or velocity message which triggered the outputting of that report.  In a morethan-minimum system that outputs SV Reports at additional times, the TOA of the report, TOA-R, may differ from either TOA-P or TOA-V.  For Aircraft/Vehicles on the airport surface, both position and velocity related information are conveyed within the Surface Position Messages (Â§2.2.3.2.4).  Therefore the TOA for the SV Report elements associated with both position and velocity information are listed in Table H-2 as TOA-P.

## Notes:

1. The Geometric Altitude must be computed by the Report Assembly Function, using the 
barometric pressure altitude from the Airborne Position Message and the difference between barometric and geometric altitudes from the Airborne Velocity Message.  Â§H.4.3 below 
describes one acceptable computation method. 
 2. The Airspeed and Magnetic Heading values are only available from Airborne Participants that 
are not
 providing information about their velocities over the ground.  Normally, an Airborne 
Participant would emit "Subtype 1" or "Subtype 2" Airborne Position Messages, which do provide the N/S and E/W components of its velocity over the ground.  But, if velocity over the ground were not available, an Airborne Participant could emit "Subtype 3" or "Subtype 4" Velocity Messages, that contain Airspeed and Heading fields. 
3. The Surveillance Status/Discretes includes elements mapped from both the Airborne Position 
and the Airborne Velocity Messages.  See Â§2.2.8.1.21 for details. 
4. The "Report Time of Applicability" field, as defined in Â§2.2.8.1.4, contains three separate data 
sub-elements for reporting the Time of Applicability (TOA) for:  TOA-R for the estimated 
position and estimate velocity information; TOA-P the position information; and TOA-V for the 
velocity information. 
5. For details of the fields in SV Reports, see Â§2.2.8.1 of this document and subsections of that 
section.

## Notes:

1. Certain message parameters are conveyed within both the Aircraft 
Operational Status Message and also within the Target State and Status 
Message.  In this case the Mode Status Report will use the most recently received message that contains the required data element (i.e., source will be either the Aircraft Operational Status Message 
OR the Target State and 
Status Message.  In the case of the Capability Codes and Operational Mode parameters, the Target State and Status Message conveys only a subset of the 
codes conveyed by the Aircraft Operational Status Message.  For this case the Mode Status Report will report the codes always using data from the Aircraft Operational Status Message for those codes only reported in this message type.  For the case where the same codes are conveyed in both message types, then the most recently received message will be used for Report Assembly.  Thus when both message types are being received a combination of data extracted from the Aircraft Operational Status Message 
AND
 the Target State and Status Message may be required to fully report the 
most current Capability Codes and Operational Status.

## H.4 Estimating Report Field Values

Notice from Table H-2 in Â§H.3.2.1 above that not all of the information required in the fields of a State Vector (SV) Report is received in the same type of message.  Indeed, some SV Report elements, such the Geometric Altitude, can only be computed by combining information from more than one type of 1090 MHz ADS-B Message.  
Notice also that "Estimated Latitude," "Estimated Longitude," "Estimated N/S Velocity," and "Estimated E/W Velocity" fields, SV Report items #14 to #17, all have TOA-R as their Times of Applicability.  These fields together present an estimate of the horizontal position and horizontal velocity that is time-registered to the same Time of Applicability. 

The Report Assembly Function must estimate the values of the horizontal position (latitude and longitude) SV Report elements at TOA-R, the Time of Applicability of the report, based on the data received in Position and Velocity Messages that are received at different times.  At the option of the implementer, the SV Report may also contain estimated horizontal velocity fields that are applicable at TOA-R.  This estimation may be implemented in a variety of ways, such as by alpha-beta filters, alpha-beta-gamma filters, Kalman filters, or linear extrapolation.  The following subparagraphs discuss the estimation of some of the SV Report field elements in a little more detail. 

## H.4.1 Estimating Horizontal Position (Latitude And Longitude)

SV Report elements #14 and #15, "Estimated Latitude" and "Estimated Longitude," contain the position of the ADS-B Participant at the Time of Applicability of the SV 
Report (TOA-R, a sub-element of SV item #3).  For an Airborne Participant, the Report Assembly Function must estimate the horizontal position of that participant at the Time of Applicability of the Report (TOA-R) based on the values it has received in Airborne Position and Airborne Velocity Messages from that ADS-B Participant. 

As Figure H-2 illustrates, at most latitudes - everywhere except in very close proximity to the N or S pole - the change in latitude, âÏ, and the change in longitude, âÎ», due to the own-ship moving for a short time ât with East-West velocity component *dx/dt* and North-
South velocity component *dy/dt* may be approximated by the formulas 

$$\begin{array}{l}{{\Delta x=\frac{d x}{d t}\Delta t=R\cdot\Delta\lambda\cdot\cos\phi}}\\ {{\Delta y=\frac{d y}{d t}\Delta t=R\cdot\Delta\phi}}\end{array}$$
where R is the radius of the sphere used to represent the earth and latitude, Ï, and longitude, Î», are expressed in radians. 

If the radius R of the sphere used to represent the earth is chosen so that one minute of arc on a meridian - one minute of latitude - is one nautical mile, and the velocities V
NS and VEW
  are expressed in knots (nautical miles per hour), and the changes in latitude and in longitude are expressed in degrees, then the formulas become 

$\Lambda_{\text{Latt}}$$\Lambda_{\text{deg}\,\text{rees}}=\frac{V_{\text{NS}}\cdot\Lambda_{\text{sec}\,\text{conds}}}{3600}$

$\Lambda_{\text{Longitude}}$$\Lambda_{\text{deg}\,\text{rees}}=\frac{V_{\text{EW}}\cdot\Lambda_{\text{sec}\,\text{conds}}}{3600\cdot\text{cos}(Latitude)}$
This approximation is adequate for extrapolating the position of an ADS-B Participant forward in time over an interval ât of a few seconds. 

For the case when the target position is very close to the North or South pole, however, where the cosine of the latitude approaches zero, the above approximation is inadequate.  
Figure H-3 shows the situation for an ADS-B Participant that is in close proximity to the pole.  As Figure H-3 shows, for such a situation the latitude-longitude graticule is no longer adequately represented by a rectangular grid.  If ADS-B Receiving Subsystem is to be used in aircraft that travels over the poles, the position-extrapolation algorithm used in that equipment should be designed to handle the situation shown in Figure H-3. 

Implementers should take particular care when the (North or South) own-ship latitude exceeds 89 degrees. 

## H.4.2 Estimating Horizontal Velocity

State Vector Report elements #7 and #8, "North/South Velocity" and "East/West Velocity," contain the horizontal velocity of an airborne ADS-B Participant as received in the most recent Airborne Velocity Message from that ADS-B Participant.  The Time of Applicability of these Report elements is the Time of Applicability of that most recent Airborne Velocity Message (TOA-V, a sub-element of SV item #3), so no estimation or extrapolation is required. Likewise, SV Report elements #9 and #10, "Ground Speed" and "Heading While on the Surface" contain the horizontal velocity of a surface ADS-B Participant as received in the "Movement" and "Heading" fields of the most recent Surface Position Message from that ADS-B Participant.  The Time of Applicability of these Report elements is the Time of Applicability of that Surface Position Message (TOA-P, a sub-element of SV item #3), so no estimation or extrapolation is required; the E/W and N/S south components of the "Estimated Velocity" are merely computed by converting the velocity from polar form (Ground Speed and Heading) to rectangular form (E/W and N/S velocity). 

However, SV Report elements #16 and #17, "Estimated North/South Velocity" and "Estimated East/West Velocity" contain the participant's horizontal velocity at time TOA-R, the Time of Applicability of the SV Report, which may not be the same as the Time of Applicability of the most recent Velocity Message.  These Report elements are optional at the discretion of the implementer (see Â§2.2.8.1.19 and Â§2.2.8.1.20).  If these Report elements are provided, the estimation may be done in a variety of ways, including linear extrapolation, alpha-beta or alpha-beta-gamma filters, and Kalman filters. Appendix K discusses the results of simulation studies for some of these methods. 

## H.4.3 Computing Geometric Altitude (Height Above Wgs-84 Ellipsoid)

If an Airborne Position Message from a particular ADS-B Participant has TYPE Code 20, 21, or 22, then the "altitude" field in that message contains the geometric altitude (Height Above WGS-84 Ellipsoid) for that ADS-B Participant at the Time of Applicability of that Message.  But SV Report element #6, "geometric altitude" is the altitude at TOA-R, the Time of Applicability of the SV Report, not the Time of Applicability of the Airborne Position Message.  The ADS-B Report Assembly Function must compute the geometric altitude, h, at the Time of Applicability of the Report, tR
 = TOA-R.  This could be done by linear extrapolation, by an alpha-beta filter, alpha-beta-gamma-filter, or Kalman filter. 

Most Airborne Position Messages, however, will have TYPE Codes in the range from 9 to 18, indicating that their "altitude" fields contain barometric pressure altitude, H
P, rather than the geometric altitude, h.  It is still possible for the Report Assembly Function to estimate a value for SV element #6, geometric altitude, at the Time of Applicability of the SV Report, tR
 = TOA-R.  One way to do this would be by linear extrapolation, using 

- 
H
P(tP
), the pressure altitude from the most recently received Airborne Position 
Message, 
- 
Diff(t
V
), the  difference of geometric altitude from pressure altitude, from the most 
recently received Airborne Velocity Message, and 
- 
dH
P
/dt or *dh/dt,* the vertical rate from the most recently received Airborne Velocity 
Message. 
Let: 
 = TOA-P, 
 
HP(tP) = 
barometric pressure altitude from the most recent Airborne Position Message, for which the Time of Applicability is tP
 
Diff(t) = h(t) - H
P*(t) =* difference between geometric altitude, h, and barometric 
pressure altitude, HP
, as a function of time, t,  and 
 
h(t
R) =  
geometric altitude, h, at the time of validity, tR
 = TOA-R, of the SV 
Report 
R
Then h(t
), the geometric altitude at the Time of Applicability of the SV Report, could be estimated as follows: 

$$h\big{(}t_{{}_{R}}\big{)}=H_{{}_{P}}\big{(}t_{{}_{R}}\big{)}+\mathit{Diff}\big{(}t_{{}_{R}}\big{)}$$ $$=H_{{}_{P}}\big{(}t_{{}_{P}}\big{)}+\big{(}t_{{}_{R}}-t_{{}_{P}}\big{)}.\frac{dH_{{}_{P}}}{dt}+\mathit{Diff}\big{(}t_{{}_{V}}\big{)}+\big{(}t_{{}_{R}}-t_{{}_{V}}\big{)}.\frac{d}{dt}\big{(}h-H_{{}_{P}}\big{)}$$
If the rate of change of the difference, *Diff = h - H*P, is small, it might be ignored, so that the final term in the above formula, "(tR-tV)Â·d(h-HP*)/dt*" is omitted.  It would probably be appropriate, however, to track *Diff = (h-H*P) as received in successive Airborne Velocity Messages.  The tracking filter, which might be an alpha-beta filter, an alpha-beta-gamma filter, or a Kalman filter, could then provide an estimate of the rate of change, d(h-HP
)/dt. 

## H.5 Tracking Ads-B Participants

The ADS-B Report Assembly Function must assemble reports giving the status of multiple ADS-B Participants.  With respect to each such Participant, the Report Assembly Function transitions between several states, as specified in Â§2.2.10. When the first message from a Participant is received, the Report Assembly Function enters "Initialization State" with respect to that participant.  It assigns a block of memory to hold messages from that Participant. 

When both "**even**" and "odd" Airborne Position or Surface Position Messages have been received from the Participant, so that an unambiguous decoding of the Participant's CPR- encoded position into latitude and longitude can be performed, the Report Assembly Function enters "Acquisition State" with respect to that Participant and begins to output SV Reports for that Participant into the Report Output Storage Buffer.  The "Report Mode" field in those reports (SV item #19) is set to indicate "Acquisition Mode." When both an unambiguously decoded position and a velocity have been received for the participant, the Report Assembly Function enters "Track State" for that participant, and begins to output SV Reports in which the "Report Mode" field is set to "Track." 

## H.6 Track Acquisition And Coast Considerations

State Vector update intervals of 3 (three) seconds are required (1 second desired) by the ADS-B MASPS for short range surveillance applications.  Long range airspace deconfliction applications, on the other hand, can be supported by state vector update intervals of 12 seconds or longer dependent on range.  Track files must be initiated and maintained on all ADS-B Participants of interest to the supported applications, while the different applications are likely to have different target acquisition and track maintenance needs. Recognizing this, this document requires the ADS-B Report Assembly Function to retain information on an ADS-B System Participant for at least 200 seconds when the Report Assembly Function is in "Acquisition" or "Track" state with respect to that participant. The information provided in the State Vector Reports (i.e., separate times of applicability for velocity, position, and estimated (i.e. time-registered) position and velocity information), combined with the fact that ADS-B Reports are not required to be generated for an ADS-B Participant unless a new ADS-B Message has been received from that Participant, gives the following characteristics to a minimum system: 

- 
Information may be associated with and retained for an ADS-B Participant longer 
than required for the particular applications serviced by the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem. 
- 
The ADS-B application has the information required for it to make all necessary 
determinations on coasting, dropping, etc., of an ADS-B System Participant. 
- 
Acquisition/reacquisition time for ADS-B System Participants is reduced. 
ADS-B implementations which output ADS-B Reports for a System Participant without receiving a new ADS-B Message from that Participant contain a separate Time of Applicability for the extrapolated State Vector information.  By comparing the various Times of Applicability in the SV Report, the application will be able to determine the risk of error in the extrapolated ADS-B Report.

## I Extended Squitter Enhanced Reception Techniques I.1 Purpose And Scope

The purpose of this Appendix is to provide a description of improved squitter reception techniques.  Elements of improved squitter reception include (1) the use of amplitude to improve bit and confidence declaration accuracy, (2) more capable error detection/correction algorithms, (3) more selective preamble detection approaches, and (4) combinations of the above. The improved techniques presented in this Appendix represent one way of achieving the performance requirements specified in Â§2.2.4.4 for enhanced squitter reception.  The squitter processing configuration used as the basis for these performance requirements is specified in Â§I.5. 

The reception techniques, as required in Â§2.2.4.3.4 of these MOPS, are also described in this appendix for comparison with the enhancements. 

## I.2 Background

Squitter reception includes the detection of the Mode S 1090 MHz waveform preamble, declaration of the bit and confidence values, error detection, and (if necessary) error correction.  The current techniques for squitter reception are based upon techniques developed for use in Mode S narrow-beam interrogators and for TCAS.  In both of these applications, the rate of Mode A/C FRUIT (see glossary) that is stronger than the Mode S 
waveform is relatively low, nominally less than 4000 FRUIT per second. 

Early applications investigated for Extended Squitter, prior to the development of this document, included long range air-ground surveillance, surface surveillance and support for TCAS.  Of these three applications, the only one with the potential for operating in significantly higher FRUIT environments was the air-ground application.  For this application, it is possible to use sectorized antennas (6 to 12 sectors) to limit the amount of FRUIT detected by any receiver. 

Extended Squitter applications have now been defined in DO-242A, including long range 
(up to 90 NM) air-air surveillance in support of free flight.  This type of surveillance is referred to as Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI).  For this application, sectorized antennas are not an option.  In high-density environments, it is possible to operate with FRUIT rates of 40000 FRUIT per second and higher. 

Even with these FRUIT rates, Extended Squitter reception using current techniques will provide useful performance.  However, operation of Extended Squitter in very high Mode A/C FRUIT environments has led to the development of improved squitter reception techniques to support long range CDTI in high-density environments. 

## I.3 Current Squitter Reception Techniques

Receiving systems for Mode S replies and squitters are currently implemented operationally in ground based Mode S interrogator/receiver systems and in TCAS avionics.  For TCAS, the current reception techniques are defined in RTCA DO-185B 
(EUROCAE ED-143).  These current reception techniques are the basis for the reception requirements in these MOPS (see Â§2.2).  The enhanced techniques that are the subject of this Appendix are not required in this version of the MOPS, but are planned to be required in a future version. 

## I.3.1 Overview Of Current Techniques

Extended squitter uses the 112-bit Mode S waveform shown in Figure I-1.  Other than bit assignments, this is the same as the long reply waveform currently used operationally for air-ground replies and for air-air coordination messages in TCAS.  This waveform encodes data using pulse position modulation (PPM).  A chip in the leading half of the bit position represents a binary ONE.  A chip in the trailing half bit position represents a binary ZERO.  Reception of the Squitter begins with the detection of the four-pulse preamble.  At preamble detection a dynamic threshold is set 6 dB below the level of the preamble.  Any signal received below this threshold will not be seen by the squitter reception processor.  This eliminates the effect of low level Mode A/C and Mode S FRUIT on the reception process. 

 
 
Once all of the bits have been received, error detection is performed using the 24-bit CRC contained in the PI field.  If no error is detected, the squitter is passed on to surveillance processing.  If an error is detected (indicated by a non-zero error syndrome) an error correction technique is applied.  The current error correction algorithm can correct the errors caused by one stronger overlapping Mode A/C FRUIT. 

## I.3.2 Current Techniques For Bit And Confidence Declaration

Currently, bit values are declared by comparing the amplitudes of the centers of the two chips; the chip with the greater amplitude is declared the bit value.  This amplitude comparison technique limits bit errors caused by FRUIT of lower level than the squitter being received (Figure I-2, parts a and b).

e.  Multiple sample technique (enhancement)
 The vertical scale represents log video signals. 

## Note:

Currently confidence for each bit is declared by observing if signals are above threshold on both chips.  If only one chip is above threshold, it is declared to be high confidence since there is no evidence of overlapping FRUIT.  If both chips have amplitude above threshold, low confidence is declared since some form of interference had to be present to cause this condition (Figure I-2, part c). 

Since the nominal width of a Mode A/C pulse is 0.45 microsecond, an interfering Mode A/C pulse can affect only 1 of the 2 chips of a Mode S bit position.  If the chip affected is the one with the Mode S pulse, the level of the pulse in the chip will be altered, but since it is the only chip with energy, the bit will be declared as high confidence.  If instead the interfering pulse affects the blank chip, pulses will exist in both positions and the Mode S 
bit will be declared as low confidence.  Since the bit decision is based on the larger pulse, if the Mode A/C FRUIT is stronger than the Mode S signal, any such bit will be declared in error, while if the Mode S signal is stronger, any such bit will be declared correctly. 

## I.3.3 Current Error Detection And Correction Techniques I.3.3.1 Overview

When a Mode A/C FRUIT interferes with a Mode S Extended Squitter, some of the Mode S bits may be declared in error.  The current Mode S error correction algorithm attempts to correct these errors by locating a string of 24 consecutive bits such that the low confidence bits in the window cover the bits in the corresponding error syndrome [reference I-1].  If such a window is found, all low confidence bits matching the syndrome are flipped, and the message is declared correct. 

## I.3.3.2 Sliding Window Technique

This algorithm operates by examining successive 24 bit windows, starting with bits 89- 112 of the message.  In order to achieve a successful error correction, each message bit in the window corresponding to a one (1) in the error syndrome must have its value complemented (i.e., a one is changed to a zero (0) and a zero is changed to a one).  This complementing can only be done if each of the bits is declared to be low confidence.  If so, each of the bits is complemented and the message is declared to be error corrected.  If not, the window is shifted one bit downward, a transformed syndrome is computed and the process repeats.  The process ends when a correctable error pattern has been found, or the sliding window reaches the beginning of the message.  In order to control undetected errors, correction is not attempted if there are more than 12 low confidence bits in the window. This technique provides error correction in cases where a Mode S message has been overlaid with one stronger Mode A/C FRUIT (that caused all bit errors) and one or more weaker Mode A/C FRUIT that were above the dynamic threshold (and caused only low confidence bits).  This technique is well suited to the low levels of Mode A/C FRUIT 
observed in a narrow-beam Mode S interrogator or a TCAS.  This technique is not appropriate for high FRUIT rate environments since it produces a high undetected error rate; for this reason, its use is prohibited in Â§2.2.4.4. 

## I.4 Enhanced Squitter Reception Techniques I.4.1 Enhanced Preamble Detection

Preamble detection identifies the beginning of an Extended Squitter reception.  The process has two outputs: (1) the start time of the signal and (2) the received power level of this signal.  This process includes validation that uses the receptions during the first 5 bits in the data block and several other validation tests.  Following is a description of a particular enhanced preamble detection technique that has been used successfully in achieving the performance required in these MOPS. 

## I.4.1.1 Log Video Samples

The preamble detection process described here operates on data in the form of samples of the log video received waveform.  Specifically, the sample rate is 10 samples per microsecond, although other sample rates, including 8 samples per microsecond, have been found to be effective.  In developing these enhanced decoding techniques, both an 8 MHz and 10 MHz sampling rate implementation were tested.  It was determined that the 
10 MHz sampling rate yielded better reception performance.  In general, a higher sampling rate will perform better because of more samples for bit and confidence decoding.  For these MOPS, the 10 MHz sampling rate implementation was used to establish the reception performance required for Class A3 equipment, and the 8 MHz sampling rate implementation was used to set the required performance for the Class A2 equipment. 

## I.4.1.2 Threshold

The preamble detection process includes a threshold power level used to discard very weak receptions.  Typical value = -88 dBm (referred to the antenna) for an A3 receiver. The Minimum Triggering Level (MTL), which is the point of 90 percent receptions in the absence of interference, is typically about 4 dB higher than the threshold. 

## I.4.1.3 Valid Pulse Position

A sample that is above threshold and also is followed consecutively by N or more samples above threshold is defined to be a "Valid Pulse Position."  If the sample rate is 10 per microsecond, then N = 3.  This definition has the effect of defining a pulse as an event in which at least 4 consecutive samples are above threshold.  For other sample rates, N is adjusted so that a pulse is declared when the signal is above threshold for more than 0.3 microseconds. 

## I.4.1.4 Leading Edge

A Leading Edge is declared for a particular sample if it is a Valid Pulse Position and also has substantial slope in the interval before this sample and less than substantial slope in the next interval.  Substantial slope is defined by the power change between one sample and the next.  The slope threshold is 48 dB per microsecond (applicable to receiver bandwidth of approximately 8 MHz).  Therefore if the sample rate is 10 samples per microsecond, the threshold is 4.8 dB. 

## I.4.1.5 Initial Detection Of A 4-Pulse Preamble

The preamble detection process begins when four pulses have been detected, having the spacing of the Mode S preamble.  The detection criterion is: 

- Finding four pulses having timing of 0 - 1.0 - 3.5 - 4.5 microsecond 
- Two or more of these must be Leading Edges. 
- The others can be Valid Pulse Positions - Sample tolerance can be plus or minus 1 (but not both) 
Note that the power levels in the four pulses need not agree.  Note also that trailing edges are not used. 

## I.4.1.6 Arrival Time

The signal arrival time is initially estimated to be the leading edge of the first of these four pulses.  Subsequently this is adjusted by +1 or -1 sample if two or more of the other three pulses have leading edges with that timing. 

## I.4.1.7 Reference Level Generation

A Reference Power Level is generated during preamble detection for use in re-triggering and during demodulation of the data block.  Step 1 is to identify a set of samples to use. Among the four preamble pulses, those whose leading edges agree with the preamble timing are used; samples from the other pulses are not used.  Next, for each pulse used, select the M samples after the leading edge sample.  If the sample rate is 10 per microsecond, then M = 3.  For other sample rates, the value of M is equal to the value of N defined in Â§I.4.1.3. 

Step 2 is an algorithm to generate the Reference Level from these samples.  For each sample, compute the number of other samples that are within 2 dB.  Then find the maximum of these counts.  If the maximum count is unique, then the sample used to form that count is taken to be the Reference Level. 

Otherwise, when there are two or more samples whose counts are maximum and equal, discard any samples whose counts are less than this maximum.  For the remaining samples, find the minimum power and then discard any samples that are more than 2 dB stronger than that minimum.  Compute the average of the remaining samples.  This is taken to be the Reference Level for the preamble. 

## I.4.1.8 Overlapping Signals And Re-Triggering

The preamble detection process is capable of processing multiple overlapped preambles, but the data block processing, which is more extensive, can only accept one signal at a time.  For this reason, a re-triggering function is included.  This function will reject certain preamble detections when a subsequent stronger signal is received. One step in the re-triggering process checks for overlap by later Mode S signals having certain specific timing offsets.  For example, if the subsequent signal is 1 microsecond later, then two of the preamble pulses in the later signal coincide with preamble pulses in the original signal, which can cause a problem if the later signal is stronger.  The potential problem is that the stronger pulses can cause the power estimate for the first signal to be too high, and therefore prevent re-triggering.  This type of problem can also occur if the timing difference is 3.5 or 4.5 microseconds.  Figure I-3 illustrates the 1 microsecond overlap that motivates this test. 

1-Microsecond Test.  To counter this potential problem, the next step after preamble detection is to check for excessive power in pulse positions 1.0, 2.0, 4.5, and 5.5 microseconds after the start.  For each of these pulse positions, one sample is used to estimate the power of a pulse at that time.  Letting T = 0 denote the time one sample after the leading edge time of the first preamble pulse, then the four pulses are taken to be the samples at times T = 1.0, 2.0, 4.5, and 5.5 microseconds.  From these four power measurements, the minimum is used to compare against the maximum of the samples at T 
= 0 and 3.5 microseconds.  If this difference indicates that the preamble under consideration is -3 dB or weaker relative to the other four samples, then this preamble is rejected.  
3.5-microsecond test.  A similar test is performed to protect against overlap by a stronger signal 3.5 microseconds later.  The minimum power in samples at T = 3.5, 4.5, 7.0, and 8.0 is compared against the maximum of the samples at T = 0 and 1.0 microseconds.  If this difference indicates that the preamble under consideration is -3 dB or weaker relative to the other four samples, then this preamble is rejected. 

4.5-microsecond test.  A similar test is performed to protect against overlap by a stronger signal 4.5 microseconds later.  The minimum power in samples at T = 4.5, 5.5, 8.0, and 9.0 microseconds is compared against the maximum of the samples at T = 0, 1.0, and 3.5 
microseconds.  If this difference indicates that the preamble under consideration is -3 dB or weaker relative to the other four samples, then this preamble is rejected. 

## I.4.1.9 Consistent Power Test

Another test is applied to validate the preamble.  This test asks whether at least two of the four preamble pulses agree in power level with the Reference Level to within +/-3 dB.  If not, this preamble is rejected. 

## I.4.1.10 Df Validation

An additional validation is made using the first five bits in the data block.  Each of the five bits is considered to consist of two chips, each of duration 0.5 microseconds.  Pulse detection is carried out for the 10 chips as follows.  For a particular chip, a pulse is detected if a Valid Pulse Position is found at the leading edge time for this chip or within +/-1 sample of the leading edge time.  The preamble is then validated if, for each of these five bits, a pulse is detected either in the first chip or in the second chip or both and the peak amplitude of the pulse is equal to 6 dB below the preamble reference level or greater.  Otherwise the preamble is rejected.  The peak amplitude is determined by using the highest amplitude sample of the M samples that comprise the pulse (where M = N + 1 
for N as defined in Â§I.4.1.3). 

## I.4.1.11 Re-Triggering

After a preamble is detected, the preamble detection process continues to be applied searching for later preambles.  All of the steps described above are applied even when detected preambles are overlapped.  If a particular preamble detection has survived these tests, its reference level and the amplitude of each of the five data pulses during DF validation is now compared against any earlier signal currently being processed.  If the new signal is stronger by 3 dB or more, then the earlier signal is rejected, so that data block demodulation of the new signal can proceed.  Otherwise (if an earlier signal is being processed and the new signal is not stronger by 3 dB or more), the new signal is rejected, so that the earlier signal processing can continue. 

## I.4.1.12 Preamble Detection Summary

Figure I-4 summarizes the preamble detection process. 


## I.4.2 Enhanced Bit And Confidence Declaration I.4.2.1 Overview

The current technique of declaring a bit based upon the higher of the two chips will generate bit errors in cases of higher level overlapping Mode A/C FRUIT (Figure I-2, part c).  The use of amplitude to correlate the received pulse with the preamble pulse level will improve bit declaration accuracy.  Four techniques have been investigated. One is a very simple approach that uses only the amplitude measured at the center of each chip.  The remaining three use a more capable approach that takes advantage of all samples per chip that are taken to establish bit and confidence.  Each of these techniques is described in the following paragraphs. The following description of the center sample technique is intended to provide an example of processing performance needed to meet the requirements of Class A1S and A1 equipment.  This description also serves as an introduction to the three more capable approaches.  The center sample technique will not provide sufficient performance to meet requirements specified for Class A2 and A3 equipment in the test procedures of Â§2.4.4.4. The specified performance for these latter classes of equipment can only be met by an approach that performs equivalently to one of the multi-sample techniques. 

## I.4.2.2 Use Of Center Amplitude

An improvement in the declaration of Mode S data bits can be achieved if the actual amplitudes of the center samples of the '1' and '0' chips can be measured for each data position, rather than just a comparison of which chip sample is greater.  All Mode S pulses, including those of the preamble, have approximately the same level (within 1 or 2 dB).  Thus if the preamble level is measured, the expected level of each data pulse will be known.  Then if both center samples of a data position are above threshold, but only one is within a Â±3 dB band centered at the preamble level, it would be reasonable to assume that the corresponding chip is the correct Mode S pulse location.  This is illustrated in Figure I-2, part d. Figure I-5 illustrates the new data and confidence declaration algorithms that result when the actual sample amplitudes can be measured, and both samples are above threshold.  As shown in Figure I-5, a bit is high confidence when 1 and only 1 of the two samples correlate with the preamble level.  The correlating sample, rather than the larger sample, is declared to be the true data value.  If both samples, or neither sample, correlates with the preamble, a low confidence bit is declared.  In this case, the larger sample is selected as the bit value, as in the current technique. 

a. One in window
b. One in window c. Neither in window, second larger
d. Both in window, second larger
The major advantage of this scheme is the significant reduction in low confidence and bit errors generated for the Mode S message.  Presently, any data position with both samples above threshold is declared low confidence.  This translates to a low confidence declaration whenever an above-threshold Mode A/C FRUIT overlaps a Mode S empty chip position.  If the Mode A/C signal is of greater power, the bit position is declared in error. With the center amplitude technique, a low confidence bit is declared only when the Mode A/C FRUIT is within 3 dB of the Mode S signal.  Mode A/C FRUIT of either lower or higher power in general cause neither errors nor low confidence bits.  Thus the region of concern for Mode A/C aircraft is reduced from all the aircraft at closer range to just those at approximately co-range.  This is particularly significant when the system is attempting to listen to far-range Mode S aircraft. It is occasionally possible for this new algorithm to produce high confidence bit errors. The most likely case occurs when two Mode A/C pulses overlay the same Mode S bit position.  If one overlaps the data pulse, and drives its sample out of the preamble window, then an error will result if the other Mode A/C pulse lands on the other chip and its amplitude is within the preamble window.  Such occurrences will in general create a rejected message, rather than an undetected error. 

## I.4.2.3 Use Of Multiple Amplitude Samples

The above amplitude data declaration approach can be improved if all 10 samples (5 per chip) that are taken for each Mode S bit position are utilized in the decision process.  In particular, the event of both center samples within the preamble window can often be resolved. For example, consider the typical such situation depicted in Figure I-2, part e. Although both center samples are within the window, the fact that the earlier chip has all samples within the window, whereas the later chip has several samples below the window suggests that the signal is present in the earlier chip.  This error situation can often be rectified when all 10 samples are examined.  Also, in some cases when an interference pulse overlaps a signal pulse, the small frequency difference will produce variations in amplitude, whereas the signal by itself would be more constant, and such patterns can be useful in declaring the bit and confidence. 

## I.4.2.3.1 Baseline Multi-Sample Technique

The multi-sample enhanced bit and confidence declaration technique makes use of all 10 samples for each Mode S bit position to determine the bit and confidence values.  Sample amplitudes in each chip are compared to the amplitude reference level established by the preamble to quantify the number of samples in each chip that: 

(a) match the preamble amplitude indicating the presence of a pulse, or (b) are significantly lower in amplitude indicating a lack of transmitted energy. 
The first step is to establish an amplitude window that will include samples that are within +/- 3 dB of the preamble reference level and a minimum amplitude threshold set to 6 dB below the reference level.  Samples that fall within the window are considered to match the preamble and samples that are below the minimum threshold are considered to indicate a lack of transmitted energy.  The samples are categorized as follows: 

A: within the +/- 3 dB preamble window B: below threshold (6 dB or more below the preamble) 
The second step is to count the number of samples in each chip that are of each category.  
Less weight is given to the samples near the transitional areas of each chip (the transitional samples are the first and last samples of each chip).  To facilitate this, samples other than those at each end will count double.  Therefore, with weighting factored in, and a 10 MHz sampling rate, the counts for each category will range from 0 to 8 for each chip (1 sample at each end + 3 samples in-between x 2).  The four counts are summarized as follows: 
1ChipTypeA = #of weighted samples in the 1 chip of type A (Match Preamble) 1ChipTypeB = #of weighted samples in the 1 chip of type B (Lack energy) 0ChipTypeA = #of weighted samples in the 0 chip of type A (Match Preamble) 
0ChipTypeB = #of weighted samples in the 0 chip of type B (Lack Energy) 

 
Next, two equations using the above counts will produce two scores that indicate how well the sample pattern matches a transmitted 0 and how well the sample pattern matches a transmitted 1.  The equations are as follows: 
1Score = 1ChipTypeA - 0ChipTypeA +  0ChipTypeB - 1ChipTypeB 
0Score = 0ChipTypeA - 1ChipTypeA + 1ChipTypeB - 0ChipTypeB 

 
The highest score determines the bit value.  In the case of a tie, the bit defaults to zero (0).  If the difference is 3 or more the bit is high confidence.  The confidence threshold of 3 was determined by testing the algorithm with a 10 MHz sampling rate with thousands of iterations with a high FRUIT rate.  If the algorithm is applied with a different sampling rate, the appropriate confidence threshold may need to be determined under similar test conditions. 

## I.4.2.3.2 Multi-Sample Technique With Full Table Lookup

To take advantage of the differences between a pure signal and a combination of signal plus interference, a technique was developed based on a lookup table, whose contents are derived from many runs of a simulation.  Specifically, each of the 10 samples is quantized into four levels:  

0: below threshold (-6 dB relative to the preamble) 
1: above threshold but below the +/- 3 dB preamble window 
2: within the +/- 3 dB preamble window 3: above the +/- 3 dB preamble window 
Since there are 10 samples, with 4 possible values each, a Mode S data position can have 
410  = 1048576 (1M) different sample patterns.  Two 1-bit tables, each stored in a 1M x 1 
ROM, are defined over the set of patterns: the first declaring the bit position to be a '1' or 
'0', the second high or low confidence.  Once the pattern existing for a given bit is determined, two table lookups supply the proper declaration.  If higher sampling rates are used, the number of sample patterns and the table size will increase exponentially. 

These tables are generated by running millions of simulations of Mode S messages in 40000 FRUIT per second environments.  For each bit of each trial, the pattern and the correct Mode S bit value are noted.  The result could be, for example, 5876 examples of pattern 16453, of which 5477 occurred when the Mode S bit was a "1."  The table values are then defined as follows, assuming an "uncertainty parameter" value of 10%: 
H1: 90% or more of the samples occurred when the bit was a '1' 
L1: 
50% - 90% of the samples occurred when the bit was a '1' 
L0: 
10% - 50% of the samples occurred when the bit was a '1' 
H0: 10% or fewer of the samples occurred when the bit was a '1'. 

Since pulse shapes are critical to this method, live data verification of the table entries is required to establish these values. 

## I.4.2.3.3 Multi-Sample Technique With Reduced Table Lookup

The above 10 sample approach requires lookup tables of size 1M, adding cost to the hardware implementation of the decoder.  A variation of this method that only requires tables of size 1K, called the 5-5 approach, has been designed to reduce this expense. 

The 5-5 method forms two estimates of the bit data and confidence values, one using the odd samples (1-3-5-7-9) and the other using the even samples (2-4-6-8-10); the final decision is then a combination of the individual estimates.  Since each set includes samples in both chip positions, pattern matching is still possible, although the fineness of the pattern variation is cut in half.  Since only 5 samples are in each set, and each sample is quantized to the same 4 levels as above, 45
 = 1024 patterns are possible for each set. 

To counteract the loss of resolution, and to aid in the combining operation, 3 levels of confidence (high, medium, and low) are defined for each pattern.  Following the simulation generation scheme described above, the table values are defined as follows: 
H1: 90% or more of the samples occurred when the bit was a '1' 

M1: 70% - 90% of the samples occurred when the bit was a '1' L1: 
50% - 70% of the samples occurred when the bit was a '1' 
L0: 
30% - 50% of the samples occurred when the bit was a '1' 
M0: 10% - 30% of the samples occurred when the bit was a '1' 
H0: 10% or fewer of the samples occurred when the bit was a '1'. 
The values of 10% and 30% are parameters; the value of 30% was selected to provide the performance discussed below.  Since 3 confidence levels now exist, the confidence lookup table for each sample set is sized 1024x2.  The total table requirement for data and confidence, for the two sample sets, is thus 1024x6. 

Once the values and confidences are determined for each set of samples, odd and even, the composite values actually declared for the bit are found according to Table I-1. 

|    | Odd     |     |     | Even     |     |     |
|----|---------|-----|-----|----------|-----|-----|
|    | H1      | M1  | L1  | H0       | M0  | L0  |
| H1 | H1      | H1  | H1  | L0       | H1  | H1  |
| M1 | H1      | H1  | L1  | H0       | L0  | L1  |
| L1 | H1      | L1  | L1  | H0       | L0  | L0  |
| H0 | L0      | H0  | H0  | H0       | H0  | H0  |
| M0 | H1      | L0  | L0  | H0       | H0  | L0  |
| L0 | H1      | L1  | L0  | H0       | L0  | L0  |

Note that if either sample set is high confidence, that set's data value rules unless the samples conflict and are both high confidence.  Also notice that two agreeing medium confidence samples produce a high confidence result.  With the parameter for medium confidence set at 30%, the probability of error for medium confidence agreement is 0.3 x 0.3 = 0.1, which matches the 10 sample probability of error for a high confidence decision.  Finally, when the sample decisions conflict at the same confidence level, a low confidence 0 is declared for lack of a better estimate. If a sampling rate other than 10 MHz is used, the number of samples from the odd and even samples and the resulting table sizes will be adjusted accordingly.  For example, if a 8 MHz sampling rate is used, there are 4 samples in each set, and each sample is quantized to the same 4 levels as above, 44 = 256 patterns are possible for each set.  The total table requirement for data and confidence, for the two sample sets, is thus 256x6.  If a 16 MHz sampling rate is used, there are 8 samples in each set, and each sample is quantized to the same 4 levels as above, 48
 = 65536 (64K) patterns are possible for each set.  The total table requirement for data and confidence, for the two sample sets, is thus 64Kx6.  Once the values and confidences are determined for each set of samples, odd and even, the composite values are declared according to Table I-1 independent of the sampling rate. 

## I.4.3 Enhanced Error Detection And Correction Techniques I.4.3.1 Overview

Three new error detection/correction techniques have been developed.  The first, termed the "Conservative" technique is a variation on the current Sliding Window technique, intended to reduce the undetected error rate.  The second, termed the "Whole Message" technique, models the effect of whole Mode A/C FRUIT on the bit and confidence declarations.  The third, termed the "Brute Force" technique, performs a bounded exhaustive search of all combinations of bit reversals for low confidence bits.  The following sections describe these techniques in more detail. 

## I.4.3.2 Conservative Technique

The sliding window technique is suitable for the low FRUIT environments of a rotating beam antenna (long range, narrow beam) or a TCAS (omni-directional, short range).  
However, the FRUIT environment for the long-range air-to-air application (which uses omni-directional antennas) may be very severe and therefore, the sliding window technique cannot be used because of undetected error considerations. For the very severe FRUIT environments, a simpler approach, known as the conservative technique is used.  Using this technique, error correction is only attempted if all of the low confidence bits in the message are within a 24-bit window, and there are no more than 12 low confidence bits.  This constraint limits the application of error correction to signals that nominally had only a single overlapping stronger Mode A/C FRUIT.  This is a conservative approach in that the conditions for attempting error correction are much more restrictive than with sliding window.  It produces a lower level of successful error correction since it does not attempt to correct messages with multiple Mode A/C overlaps.  However, it produces a very low undetected error rate, as intended. If the conditions for applying the conservative technique are met, the error syndrome is generated for the window position and (as for the sliding window technique) a check is made to see if the ones (1) in the error syndrome correspond to low confidence bits in the window.  If so, error correction is accomplished.  If not, the process is terminated. If the low confidence bits span less than 24-bits, more than one window could be defined to span them.  This will not effect the error correction action, since regardless of the 24-
bit window selected to span the low confidence bits, the ones (1) in the error syndrome will identify the same message bits.  That is, if the window is moved one bit, the error syndrome will shift by one bit. Note that in the above description, there is only one possible successful error correction possibility.  Regardless of the specific 24-bit window position, the same message bits are identified.  All of the bits corresponding to a one (1) in the error syndrome must be complemented.  This can only happen if they are all low confidence.  Therefore, there is at most, one correctable error pattern that can be achieved with the conservative error correction technique. 

## I.4.3.3 Whole Message Error Detection And Correction Technique

The limitation of the current error correction technique described in I.3.3 of being able to handle only a single overlapping Mode A/C FRUIT has led to the development of the Whole Message error correction technique, which can be applied when the Conservative technique has failed.  This technique is designed to handle up to five overlapping FRUIT, provided they do not overlap each other, hence creating "individual interference regions." This technique is applicable only when the center sampling technique is used (Â§I.4.2.2). As described in Â§I.3.2, the correctness of low confidence bits depend upon the amplitude of the Mode A/C interference relative to the Mode S squitter:  if the Mode A/C FRUIT is stronger than the Mode S signal, any low confidence bit will usually be declared in error, while if the Mode S signal is stronger, any low confidence bit will usually be declared correctly.  This observation leads to the following hypothesis, which serves as the basis of the Whole Message error correction routine: 
For a given Mode A/C interference region, either all low confidence bits will be correct, or all low confidence bits will be wrong. 

Although this hypothesis is generally correct, it should be noted that three effects can lead to its violation: 

1. If the interfering Mode A/C FRUIT is at approximately the same power level as the 
Mode S signal, or 
2. If the interfering Mode A/C FRUIT pulses are wider than 0.50 microseconds (the 
spec allows up to 0.55 microseconds, and some out-of-spec transponders even go 
beyond this value), or 
3. If the Mode S signal is near enough to the noise level for noise to corrupt some of the 
samples. 
The Whole Message algorithm attempts to divide the Mode S message into disjoint 24-bit regions, one for each presumed Mode A/C interfering FRUIT.  Then the syndrome of each region, assuming all bits to be in error, is generated (see below in Â§I.4.3.4 for an explanation of syndrome generation for bit sets).  Finally, all possible combinations of syndromes are considered.  If one and only one combination matches the Mode S syndrome, all low confidence bits within the interference regions corresponding to the winning combination are reversed.  Flowcharts for the Whole Message error correction technique are presented in Figure I-6 and Figure I-7.  Figure I-8 presents an example of the application of this method. 

## Assume Error Syndrome = B12472

Therefore, Invert All Low Confidence Bits in Regions 1 & 3 

## I.4.3.4 Brute Force Error Correction Technique

If the bit declaration algorithm has performed its function properly, all errors in Mode S data values will reside in bits declared low confidence.  If this is true, a simple approach to error correction is to try all possible combination of low confidence bits, and accept the set that matches the error syndrome (provided only one success is discovered).  For obvious reasons, this method has been named the Brute Force Technique.  It is applicable to any method of data and confidence declaration, with or without amplitude.  As illustrated in Figure I-9, Brute Force error correction is applied after the other techniques have failed. 

Implementation of this technique depends upon the fact that each Mode S bit position corresponds to a unique syndrome, and that sets of bits produce a syndrome that is the exclusive OR of all individual bit syndromes.  For example, if bit 1 is the only bit declared in error, the error syndrome at the receiver will be hex 3935EA, while bit 31 
produces hex FDB444, and bit 111 has syndrome hex 000002.  Thus if those three bits are all declared in error, the error syndrome will be calculated to be hex C481AC.  The table of individual bit syndromes is pre-calculated and stored in the receiver. It is possible for two or more subsets of the low confidence bits to match the syndrome. In such cases, the message is rejected, and no harm is done.  However, if a high confidence bit has been declared in error, and a single subset of the low confidence bits matches the syndrome, the message will be "corrected" to the wrong message, producing an undetected error.  (If no subset matches the syndrome, it must be true that a high confidence bit error has been made, and the message is rejected.) 
Clearly, for processing time and error bounding reasons, the maximum number of low confidence bits to process must be limited.  The number of cases to consider is given by 
2n.  If n low confidence bits exist for a message; this grows exponentially with n (32 at n 
= 5, 4096 at n = 12).  The undetected error rate is proportional to the number of cases, and thus also grows exponentially with n.  Fortunately, the Hamming distance of 6 for the Mode S parity code implies that undetected errors are essentially zero if n</=5 is enforced.  For this reason, a value of n = 5 has been used in the development of the brute force algorithm. 

## I.5 Improved Reception Performance In A High Fruit Environment

For improved reception performance in a high FRUIT environment, the optimum configuration has been found to be: 

1. Enhanced preamble detection (Â§I.4.1) 2. Bit and confidence declaration based on the Baseline Multi-sample Technique 
(Â§I.4.2.3.1) 
3. Error detection using the Mode S 24-bit CRC technique (Ref.  RTCA DO-185B, 
EUROCAE ED-143) 
4. First pass error correction using the conservative technique (Â§I.4.3.2) 5. Second pass error correction using the brute force technique with n=5 (Â§I.4.3.4) 
The process proceeds as follows.  Preamble detection and bit and confidence declaration are performed.  Next, Mode S error detection is applied.  If the message passes, the process ends, and the message is delivered.  If an error is detected, then conservative error correction is applied, and if a correction results, then the process ends, and the message is delivered.  If the constraint for conservative correction is not satisfied, then the brute force technique is applied. The above configuration was used as the basis for the performance required for enhanced squitter reception as specified in Â§2.2.4.4. 

## I.6 Summary

New techniques have been developed for enhancing reception of Extended Squitters in environments of high interference.  The new techniques include improvements in preamble detection, improvements in declaration of information bits and confidence bits within the squitter message, and improvements in error detection/correction. These developments were originally carried out using pulse-level simulation to assess the resulting performance.  Subsequently flight tests have been conducted using these techniques, making comparisons relative to the current techniques.  Both the simulation and flight test results indicate that substantial improvements in performance are achievable using these techniques when operating in an environment of high interference.

## ) J Determining The Navigation Accuracy Category For Velocity (Nacv J.1 Purpose And Scope

This Appendix describes the manner in which GNSS position sources, which do not output velocity accuracy, can be characterized so that a velocity accuracy value associated with the position source can be input into ADS-B equipment as part of the installation process.  Section J.4 discusses the expected velocity accuracy performance of GNSS during stable flight (the NACV
 is specified in such a manner that it needs to accommodate velocity errors during normal maneuvers of the aircraft).   

## V J.2 Rationale For Table 2-22, "Determining Nac Based On Position Source Declared Horizontal Velocity Error

Until recently, acceptable means to substantiate a navigation source's capability to support NAC
V were not clearly established in Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor minimum operational performance standards.  In light of this deficiency, a "best-method" 
was originally established in Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.5 of RTCA DO-260A (ADS-B Version Number=1) to utilize the HFOM/VFOM quality indicator as a surrogate for setting the NACV value.  The rationale for this method was documented in Appendix J of DO-260A.  
However, the use of HFOM/VFOM to set NACV
 was not considered acceptable, since it does not provide an appropriate indication of the true horizontal velocity error as established by the position sensor manufacturer.   
To remedy this deficiency, the FAA requested RTCA SC-159 to develop test procedures for a velocity accuracy test to characterize the 95% horizontal and 95% vertical velocity accuracies during normal maneuvers as specified in RTCA/DO-229D and RTCA/DO- 253B receiver MOPS.  These tests can be used to substantiate Global Positioning System (GPS), GPS/Space-Based Augmentation System (SBAS), or GPS/Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) equipment to support an ADS-B NAC
V =1 requirement of horizontal velocity error less than 10 meters/second (95th percentile with HDOP of 1.5 
or less) and vertical velocity error less than 50 feet/second (95th percentile, with VDOP of 3.0 or less).  Additional test procedures were developed to substantiate equipment that supports a NACV =2 requirement of horizontal velocity error less than 3 meters/second and vertical velocity error less than 15 feet/second.  However, these tests are not adequate for demonstrating more stringent ADS-B NACV levels (i.e., NACV
 = 3, or greater) - 
such tests are expected to be developed as more demanding ADS-B applications mature. 

Navigation equipment manufacturers can submit the results of this testing with their TSO application or as additional information if they have already received TSO approval, for acceptance as approved data.  Manufacturers of navigation equipment that pass these tests should document their equipment's 95% figure of merit velocity accuracy in their installation manual (or provide a velocity accuracy quality metric output for direct use by the ADS-B equipment.)  The velocity output has no explicit integrity beyond the 95% figure of merit for the stated HDOP and VDOP. 

## = 1 Or 2 J.3 Tests To Determine Velocity Accuracy For Support Setting Nacv

The ADS-B installations with a position source capable of providing velocity accuracy should have the NAC
V
 derived from the position source, and the velocity accuracy should be validated during the position source manufacturer's certification testing.  The following procedures, developed by RTCA SC-159, are one means of accomplishing this testing.   
The purpose of GNSS velocity accuracy test is to characterize the 95% horizontal and 95% vertical velocity accuracies during normal maneuvers as specified in RTCA/DO- 229D and RTCA/DO-253B receiver MOPS for equipment intended to support either NAC
V =1 or NACV
 = 2.  Test procedures for higher levels are expected to be developed as more demanding ADS-B applications mature. 

The tests to verify velocity accuracy performance shall be run for each of the scenarios described below for all operating modes of the receiver where a valid position and/or velocity could be output by the receiver. 

Note:
 It is possible that a given receiver may use a different velocity algorithm when 
computing an un-augmented GPS position solution versus computing a solution augmented with differential corrections.  In that case, this test must be repeated 
for both the augmented and un-augmented modes of operation.  Even in the case where the velocity algorithm is the same whether in un-augmented or augmented mode, there are still enough variables like the software path, inputs, outputs etc., 
that it is required to repeat the test.  However it is not required to repeat the test for different sub-modes of an un-augmented or augmented mode where the inputs, velocity algorithm and outputs are the same.

## Notes:

1. The components of the jerk in the North and East direction depend on the heading chosen in the 
scenario.  The total jerk is the not to exceed vector combination of north, east, and down jerk 
components.  The maximum total jerk to quickly achieve the desired dynamics should be used, but the jerk should not exceed the normal maneuver total jerk requirement of 0.25g/s.   
2. The actual times may vary based on the simulator scenario control settings. 
 
6. Signal and RF Interference conditions can be modified during static period to aid 
acquisition.  Ensure the receiver enters the desired Operation mode before dynamics and appropriate signal and interference conditions are applied.   
7. Use the simulator velocity truth data (Vi east_truth, Vi *north_truth*) and the GNSS receiver 
velocity data (Vi east, Vi north
) to determine the horizontal velocity error   after the 
GNSS receiver has entered the desired Navigation mode with the specified signal and RF Interference conditions:   
$$h_{i}={\sqrt{(V_{i}^{e a s t\_r a t h}-V_{i}^{e a s t})^{2}+(V_{i}^{r o n r h\_r a t h}-V_{i}^{n o r h})^{2}}}$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N}\Biggl(\frac{1.5\bigl(h_{i}\bigr)}{H D O P_{i}}\Biggr)^{2}$$

hi
N - Number of sample points used 
For this test, the number of samples shall include all samples where the receiver is in the desired Navigation mode and when in motion.   
Note:
 The minimum of samples is 420 for 1 Hz solution and 2100 for 5 Hz solution 
(i.e., 5* 420). 

The receiver velocity data and the HFOM
V data shall be used to determine the percentage of samples bounded by the HFOMV as shown below.  The test passes only if TSh,b is greater than or equal to 0.95.   

$$\begin{array}{l}{{T S_{h,b}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}b_{h,i}}}\\ {{N=\mathrm{number~of~samples}}}\\ {{b_{h,i}=\begin{cases}1&{h_{i}\leq H F O M_{V}}\\ 0&{h_{i}>H F O M_{V}}\end{cases}}}\end{array}$$

## J.3.1.2 Vertical Velocity Accuracy Test Conditions Commensurate With Nacv = 1

Note: Since this Appendix was developed, the vertical rate accuracy requirement has 
 =1 but remains here in the event that been decoupled from the NACV  parameter.  The test for vertical rate is not necessary to establish the NACV

1. Ensure the simulator scenario has enough GPS satellites to provide a VDOP of 3.0 or 
less.   
2. One satellite shall set at maximum power (including maximum combined satellite 
and aircraft antenna gain), and the other satellites shall be set at minimum power (including minimum antenna gain).

## Notes:

1. The components of the jerk in the North and East direction depend on the heading chosen in the 
scenario. The total jerk is the not to exceed vector combination of north, east, and down jerk components.  The maximum total jerk to quickly achieve the desired dynamics should be used, but the jerk should not exceed the normal maneuver total jerk requirement of 0.25g/s. 
2. The actual times may vary based on the simulator scenario control settings. 
3. The value of X must be at least 63 seconds to have enough samples during vertical acceleration. 
 
6. Signal and RF Interference conditions can be modified during static period to aid 
acquisition.  Ensure the receiver enters the desired Operation mode before dynamics and appropriate signal and interference conditions are applied. 
7. Use the simulator velocity truth data (Vi
vertical_truth) and the GNSS receiver velocity 
data (Vi
vertical

vertical) to determine the vertical velocity error (vi) after the GNSS receiver has 
entered the desired Navigation mode with the specified signal and RF Interference 
conditions: vi =| Vi
vertical_truth - Vi

## J.3.1.3 Pass/Fail Determination

The 95% Vertical Velocity accuracy statistic shall be computed using the formula given below.  The equipment shall be considered pass only if the statistic is less than 50 ft/s.   

$$\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\frac{3\!\!\left(\nu_{i}\right)}{V D O P_{i}}\right)^{2}$$

## 

Where: 

vi
 - is the vertical velocity error (ft/sec) 
N - Number of sample points used  
For this test, the number of samples shall include all samples where the receiver is in the desired Operation mode.   
 The minimum of samples is 420 for 1 Hz solution and 2100 for 5 Hz solution. 

Note:
The receiver velocity data and the VFOM
V data shall determine the percentage of samples bounded by the VFOMV
 as shown below.  The test passes if   is greater than or equal to 0.95.    

$$\begin{array}{l}{{T S_{_{v,b}}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}b_{_{v,i}}}}\\ {{N=\mathrm{number~of~samples}}}\\ {{b_{_{v,i}}=\left\{\begin{matrix}1&{{\nu}_{i}\leq V F O M_{_{V}}}\\ 0&{{\nu}_{i}>V F O M_{_{V}}}\end{matrix}\right.}}\end{array}$$

## = 2 J.3.2 Additional Tests To Demonstrate Accuracy Commensurate With Nacv

The following procedure is one acceptable means for equipment capable of better accuracy performance to demonstrate compliance with the horizontal velocity error requirement of less than 3 m/s. 

1. Run the scenario in Table J-1 with all satellites set at high power and no RF 
interference.  
2. This accuracy evaluation shall only include those data samples collected during the 
acceleration period. 
. 
3. Find the particular hi (noted as Tacc) so that 95% of hi samples are less than or equal 
to Tacc 
4. Re-run the scenario in Table J-1 with the same satellite and RF interference 
conditions as the 10 m/s (NAC
V=1) test. 
5. This time only the data samples during the non-acceleration period with the specified 
signal and RF Interference conditions are used. 
$$\begin{array}{r l}{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\end{array}{\left(\begin{array}{l}{{1.5{\overline{{\left(h_{i_{-n o n n}_{-a c c}\right)}}}}}\\ {{\overline{{H D O P}_{i_{-n o n}_{-a c c}}}}}\end{array}\right)}}\end{array}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}$$

 is less than 3 m/s.   
7. The test passes only if T
acc + Tnon_acc
8. The velocity FOM is evaluated in the same way as for the 10 m/s test, i.e., the 
samples during acceleration and non-acceleration periods of the above 2 runs are 
evaluated together against the 0.95 threshold.   
The vertical velocity requirement of 15 ft/s should be tested using the exact same philosophy as the test of 3 m/s above but with the scenario in Table J-2. 

## J.4 Expected Gnss Velocity Accuracy In Stable Flight

Although NACV will accommodate derived velocity lags at turn rates of up to 0.5g, it over-bounds by a substantial amount the 95% velocity error of about 0.2 m/s per axis which should be expected in stable flight1
.  This conservative bounding of expected GPS 
velocity quality has led application designers and simulators to incorrect impressions of the potential value of the instantaneous velocity provided in the GPS state vector.  
Velocity lag errors have long been an issue in the use of ATC automation derived velocity with radars as the sensor input.  Assurance that better velocity is available when flight dynamics permit is obtained by separately specifying acceptable ATC tracker errors for stable and turning tracks.  The STARS requirement on estimated heading error is indicated by values in Table J-3.   

| Stable Flight    | Transient Tracks    |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Speed            |                     |
| Heading error    | Heading error       |
| (knots)          |                     |
|                  |                     |
| 100              | 12                  |
| 250              | 6                   |
| 400              | 3                   |

 
 equal to 1 or 2.    
Based on experience with GPS, and without requiring changes to the GPS receiver acceptance test requirements, there seems to be no risk in adding some clarification to the use of NACV by ATC automation systems indicating that considerably better than the high turn rate limiting encoded error value should be expected in the normal flight conditions which apply for the supported application.  Normally experienced velocity errors at the 95th percentile should be on the order of one tenth of the encoded maximum value, for NACV

## K Velocity Accuracy As Affected By Report Assembly K.1 Purpose

This appendix provides documentation of analyses performed on velocity accuracy of the Mode S Extended Squitter.  This analysis is intended to compare the velocity accuracy that results from the characteristics of the Extended Squitter against the velocity accuracy requirements given in the ADS-B MASPS.  

## K.2 Background

The 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B system transmits the surveillance state vector (position, velocity) information in two pieces.  In order to form the full state vector some method of state vector reconstruction must be applied.  This may involve filtering the incoming messages to time register a full state vector, reporting latent data in the state vector report, or a combination of both. 

Two methods of state vector reconstruction are analyzed: 

1. After receipt of a position message, update the position half of the state vector report 
but do not update velocity.  After receipt of a velocity message, update both position (by extrapolation using the latest velocity data) and velocity (using the most recently received velocity message).  (This is referred to as "minimum technique".) 
2. After receipt of either a position or velocity message, update both halves of the state 
vector report by applying a Kalman filter or other tracking filter.  (This is referred to as "Kalman technique".) 
This Appendix analyzes the results using these two alternatives.  The analysis is performed in two ways: 

1. Use the ADS-B MASPS in a strict sense: Examine velocity errors after each state 
vector update. 
2. Examine velocity errors once a second regardless of whether an ADS-B Message is 
received and an ADS-B State Vector Report is issued. 
The analysis below applies to short-range surveillance, for which the nominal surveillance update period is 3 seconds.  A related analysis is provided in Reference K-1, which applies to longer-range air-to-air surveillance, for which the nominal surveillance update time is 12 seconds.  The results in Reference K-1 are consistent with the results given in this Appendix. 

## K.3 Scenarios And Results

To evaluate velocity accuracy, Monte-Carlo simulations of a maneuvering scenario were run.  Statistical results on velocity accuracy were then collected using the scenario shown in Figure K-1.  In this scenario, the aircraft travels at 150 knots, and executes 180 degree turn with a turn rate of 3 degrees per second.  This results in an acceleration of slightly less than 0.5 g (where g is the acceleration due to gravity), the ADS-B MASPS defined limit condition for state vector accuracy. 

Figure K-2 shows results for velocity errors after each state vector report update.  In addition to the segmented message based results, results for a benchmark full state-vector message are included.  Sending this hypothetical message at an update period of T=3 seconds, and a probability of receipt of 0.95 was simulated.  These values correspond directly to the ADS-B MASPS requirements, from RTCA DO-242A, Table 3-4(a).  The probability of Extended Squitter reception of 0.46 per message used in Figure K-2 was chosen because it is the minimum probability that assures reception of both a position message and a velocity message within a 3 second period with 0.95 probability. It is observed that a benchmark full state vector update meets the ADS-B MASPS requirements as stated.  This is because both position and velocity of the state vector report are updated with recent information upon receipt of a state vector message.  The only errors introduced in velocity are quantization errors.  The simulated quantization errors were chosen to meet the ADS-B MASPS requirements. According to a literal interpretation of the ADS-B MASPS, the segmented state vector does not meet the ADS-B MASPS required accuracy for velocity after each state vector report update.  However, the following analysis shows that state vector reports provided by the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter system have operational characteristics that conform to those implied by the ADS-B MASPS.  The largest errors are observed when ADS-B 
receives position and velocity is not updated.  Applying a Kalman filter to the segmented messages still does not result in compliance with the literal ADS-B MASPS 
requirements.  With the segmented message set, the velocity portion of the state vector report lags the actual velocity after receipt of a position message.  Without updating velocity after the receipt of a position message, the velocity is as old as the last velocity received.  Applying a Kalman filter, velocity updates occur whenever a position report is received, but the resulting velocity estimates still lag the true velocity more than the MASPS allows. 

Figure K-3 illustrates results of sampling the velocity error in 1 second epochs.  In this case the velocity of a benchmark full state vector update with T=3 seconds will lag the true velocity for several seconds after each update.  Since we do not expect ADS-B 
applications to synchronize their use of ADS-B data to the message transmission period, the error analysis shown in Figure K-3 may better represent the error observed by an ADS-B application than the error analysis shown in Figure K-2. In a sense, the curve labeled "benchmark full state vector" in Figure K-3 represents the effective error observed by an application randomly sampling state vector reports that meet the letter of the ADS-B MASPS requirement.  The benchmark full state vector curve can be thought of as the intent of the ADS-B MASPS, and ADS-B systems whose errors fall at or below this curve are meeting the operational intent of the ADS-B MASPS. In this context, the squitter velocity accuracy needs reexamination.  It is observed in Figure K-3 that the Extended Squitter state vector report accuracy is better than the benchmark full state vector curve for required (pd=0.46) detection probabilities, with or without a Kalman Filter.  The benchmark is achieved with a Kalman filter and update probabilities as low as 0.26, and without a filter and update probabilities as low as 0.38.   

## K.4 A Minimum Report Assembly Technique

Following the requirements of Â§2.2.8.1, this section describes a minimum implementation of a state vector report assembly technique. 

There are two methods of updating a state vector; one is used when a position report is received, and the other is used when a velocity measurement is received.  For simplicity, only equations for the x coordinate of a state vector are shown here; an identical process was used for the y coordinate as well. 

 position measurement a state vector is updated as follows: 
Upon receipt of the nth

$$\hat{x}(n)=x_{m}\left(n\right)$$ (4-1)

$$\hat{x}(n)=\dot{x}_{m}\left(k\right)$$ (4-2)
where

)
(
Ë

Ë
n x n x
ï¦
 is the x component of the state vector. 

Upon receipt of the mth velocity measurement the state vector is updated as follows: 

  ) )( ( ) 1 ( Ë ) ( Ë m x dt m x m x m ï¦ + â =             (4-3)  ) ( ) ( Ë m x m x m ï¦ ï¦ =                    (4-4) 
where dt is the time difference between the last measurement and the current measurement.  

## K.5 A Kalman Filter Report Assembly Technique

The Kalman filter that was used in this analysis, and may be suitable for implementation for ADS-B, consists of three independent, two state Kalman filters.  The filter's state consists of position and velocity.  The state is tracked in each of three orthogonal Cartesian dimensions (x, y, and z).  The state estimates are assumed to be independent in each of the three dimensions. Linear dynamics are assumed in each of the three dimensions.  The filter takes as input the measured position or velocity, the previous track state, and the previous track state covariance.  The filter also requires as input the time of the measurement.  The filter produces as output an updated track state and covariance. 

The filter, which is identical in all three dimensions, will now be detailed. 

## K.5.1 Filter State And Covariance

The filter maintains a state consisting of position and velocity and a state covariance matrix that represents the uncertainty in the state estimate. 

The filter state estimate in the x-dimension is represented by the vector: (
)
t x x
Ë
Ë
ï¦
.  Note that here the variable "x" is used to show the filter state in one of the three dimensions; the y and z dimensions have a state and covariance representation which exactly parallels that of x.  The covariance matrix of the state estimate in the x-dimension is represented by the matrix: 

$$\left(\begin{array}{l l}{{\sigma_{\hat{x}}^{2}}}&{{\sigma_{\hat{x}\hat{x}}}}\\ {{\sigma_{\hat{x}\hat{x}}}}&{{\sigma_{\hat{x}}^{2}}}\end{array}\right)$$
where 

2
Ë
x
Ï
 represents the variance in the position estimate; 
2
Ë
x
ï¦
Ï
 represents the variance in the velocity estimate; 
x
xË
Ëï¦
Ï
 represents the covariance of position and velocity. 

## K.5.2 Initial State And Covariance

Before any measurements are received, the state estimates and the state covariance matrix are initialized.  The state estimate is initialized by setting both the position and velocity estimate to zero.  The state covariance matrix is initialized according to equation 5-1: 

$$\left(\begin{array}{cc}\sigma_{\hat{x}}^{2}&\sigma_{\hat{x}\hat{x}}\\ \sigma_{\hat{x}\hat{x}}&\sigma_{\hat{x}}^{2}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\infty&0\\ 0&\infty\end{array}\right)$$ (5-1)
For the purposes of an actual implementation, infinity can be represented by a large real number. 

## K.5.3 Kalman Filter Steady State Algorithm

The standard Kalman filter consists of five steps: 

1. State extrapolation 
2. Covariance matrix extrapolation 
3. Residual calculation 4. State vector update 
5. Covariance matrix update. 
The first two steps are identical regardless of whether the measurement is a position, velocity, or both.  The last three steps depend on the form of the measurement.  

## K.5.3.1 State Extrapolation

The first step in the filter is to extrapolate the state estimates to the time of the current measurement.  Equations 5-2 detail the mechanics of the state extrapolation: 

$\hat{\hat{x}}=\hat{x}+\hat{\hat{x}}(dt)$

$\hat{\hat{x}}=\hat{\hat{x}}$

$\hat{\hat{x}}=\hat{\hat{x}}$
where x
Ë Ë  is the predicted (extrapolated) x position; 
x
Ë Ë
ï¦ is the predicted velocity in the x direction; 
x
Ë is the current position estimate for x; 
x
Ë
ï¦ is the current velocity estimate in the x direction; 
dt is the time difference between the current measurement and the last state update. 

## K.5.3.2 Covariance Matrix Extrapolation

The next step in the filtering process is the extrapolation of the covariance matrix.  

$$\sigma_{\hat{\hat{x}}}^{2}=\sigma_{\hat{x}}^{2}+\left(dt\right)^{2}\sigma_{\hat{x}}^{2}+2dt\sigma_{\hat{x}\hat{x}}+\frac{Q\left(dt\right)^{4}}{4}$$ (5-3) $$\sigma_{\hat{\hat{x}}}^{2}=\sigma_{\hat{x}}^{2}+\left(dt\right)^{2}Q$$ (5-4) $$\sigma_{\hat{x}\hat{x}}^{2}=\sigma_{\hat{x}\hat{x}}^{2}=\sigma_{\hat{x}\hat{x}}^{2}+\left(dt\right)\sigma_{\hat{x}}^{2}+\frac{\left(dt\right)^{3}Q}{2}$$ (5-5)
where Q is the process (plant) noise variance.   
Typical values are on the order of 0.0025 g2.  In our simulations, a second, higher value was used for Q when the ADS-B message indicated that a turning maneuver was taking place.  The maneuver Q was set at 0.0625 g2. 

## K.5.3.3 Track Residual, Filter Gain, Track Smoothing, And Covariance Update Calculations

The next three steps in the Kalman filter involve calculating the covariance of the measurement residual, calculating the filter gain, and updating the track state covariance estimate. These calculations are dependent on the exact form of the measurement, and therefore differ depending on whether the received measurement is position or a velocity. 

## K.5.3.3.1 Residual Variance, Gain, Track Smoothing, And Covariance Update For Position Measurement

If the received measurement contains position information only, the filter gain is a two element vector and is calculated as shown below. 

First, the residual (or innovations) variance is calculated: 

$\sigma^{2}_{v}=\sigma^{2}_{\tilde{x}}+\sigma^{2}_{x_{m}}$ (5-6)
where 
 
2
m x
Ï
is the variance of the position measurement. 

The gain vector (w) is then calculated according to equations (5-7) and (5-8): 

$$w_{0}=\frac{\sigma_{\hat{\hat{x}}}^{2}}{\sigma_{v}^{2}}$$ (5-7) $$w_{1}=\frac{\sigma_{\hat{\hat{x}}\hat{\hat{x}}}^{2}}{\sigma_{v}^{2}}$$ (5-8)
The update of the state estimate is performed according to equations (5-9) and (5-10): 

$$\hat{\hat{x}}=\hat{\hat{x}}+w_{0}\left(x_{m}-\hat{\hat{x}}\right)$$ (5-9) $$\hat{\hat{x}}=\hat{\hat{x}}+w_{1}\left(x_{m}-\hat{\hat{x}}\right)$$ (5-10)
where 
 
m x is the current position measurement. 

The update of the covariance matrix is then performed according to equations 5-11, 5-12, and 5-13: 

$$\sigma^{\,2}_{\,\hat{x}}=(1-w_{0})\sigma^{\,2}_{\,\hat{x}}$$ (5-11) $$\sigma_{\,\hat{x}\hat{x}}=(1-w_{0})\sigma_{\,\hat{x}\hat{x}}$$ (5-12) $$\sigma^{\,2}_{\,\hat{x}}=\sigma^{\,2}_{\,\hat{x}}-w_{1}\sigma_{\,\hat{x}\hat{x}}$$ (5-13)
The update of the state and covariance completes the Kalman filter operations for the current measurement. 

## K.5.3.3.2 Residual Variance, Gain, Track Smoothing, And Covariance Update For Velocity Measurement

In the case of a velocity measurement, the residual is the difference between the velocity prediction and the velocity measurement; the residual variance is then: 

$$\sigma^{2}_{v}=\sigma^{2}_{\hat{x}}+\sigma^{2}_{\hat{x}_{m}}$$ (5-14)
where 
2
m x
ï¦
Ï
 is the variance of the velocity measurement. 

The filter gain vector is then calculated as shown below: 

$$w_{0}=\frac{\sigma_{\frac{\hat{\chi}\hat{\chi}}{\hat{\chi}}}}{\sigma_{\frac{\hat{\chi}}{\hat{\chi}}}^{2}}$$ (5-15) $$w_{1}=\frac{\sigma_{\frac{\hat{\chi}}{\hat{\chi}}}^{2}}{\sigma_{\frac{\hat{\chi}}{\hat{\chi}}}^{2}}$$ (5-16)
The track state is then updated through use of the velocity residual: 

$$\hat{x}=\hat{\hat{x}}+w_{0}\left(\hat{x}_{m}-\hat{\hat{x}}\right)$$ (5-17) $$\hat{\hat{x}}=\hat{\hat{x}}+w_{1}\left(\hat{x}_{m}-\hat{\hat{x}}\right)$$ (5-18)
Finally, the track state covariance is updated as per equations 5-19 through 5-21: 

$$\sigma^{2}_{\hat{\hat{x}}}=\sigma^{2}_{\hat{\hat{x}}}-w_{0}\sigma_{\hat{\hat{x}}\hat{\hat{x}}}$$ (5-19) $$\sigma_{\hat{\hat{x}}\hat{\hat{x}}}=(1-w_{1})\sigma_{\hat{\hat{x}}\hat{\hat{x}}}$$ (5-20) $$\sigma^{2}_{\hat{\hat{x}}}=(1-w_{1})\sigma^{2}_{\hat{\hat{x}}}$$ (5-21)

## K.6 Real Time Performance Evaluation

The Kalman filters described above were implemented in ANSI C, compiled using the Metrowerks "CodeWarrior" compiler with full optimization, and bench-marked on two Macintosh machines.  The two machines were the Macintosh Power PC 7500 running at 100 MHz and a Macintosh Quadra running at 33 MHz.  The Power PC uses the Motorola 601 processor; the Quadra uses a Motorola 68040 processing chip. Table K-1 shows the average run times for a position and velocity Kalman filter update measured on these machines using the CodeWarrior profiler.  Run times on more recent processors should be appreciably smaller.

## K.7 Conclusions

The 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B implementation, which segments state vectors into multiple messages, has been shown to meet the operational intent of the ADS-B 
MASPS velocity accuracy requirements associated with a 3 second 95% state vector update period without filtering in regimes where the probability of message reception after participant acquisition is greater than 0.38.  To meet the ADS-B MASPS state vector update requirements for this scenario, the message reception probability must be 
0.46 or higher.  Therefore, velocity accuracy has been shown not to be the limiting factor for meeting the requirements for this scenario.  Based on Figure K-3 results, acceptance tests for report assembly should recognize that user applications can still be supported with test results meeting the limits articulated in Figure K-2.

## L Impact Of Radio Frequency Interference On Extended Squitter Report Integrity L.1 Undetected Report Error Rate

ADS-B system integrity is defined in the MASPS (RTCA DO-242A, Â§3.3.6.5) in terms of the probability of an undetected error in a report received by an application, given that the transmitting ADS-B system participant is supplied with correct source data.  An important component of ADS-B integrity is attributable to radio interference, whose effects are largely controlled by the use of error detection and correction applied upon reception.  Several different techniques for error detection and correction have been considered, including the techniques currently used in TCAS (defined in the TCAS MOPS, RTCA DO-185B) and several new techniques, described in Appendix I.  The rate of undetected errors is a key consideration in the development of new techniques, because of the inherent trade between undetected error rate and reliable acceptance of signals.  Analysis and simulation have been used by two organizations to evaluate performance in terms of undetected error rate in a number of cases.  Results of these evaluations, carried out for the LAX-99 interference environment, are summarized in Table L-1 and shown in more detail in Figure L-1.  From the results in the table, it has been concluded that the undetected error rate increases as receiver MTL is reduced, and that the conservative error correction technique and the enhanced error correction technique are effective in controlling the error rate.  As a result, these MOPS standards now require conservative error correction or enhanced error correction for all equipment Classes other than A0.  Note, therefore, that some of the rows in Table L-1 are hypothetical combinations that are not allowed by these MOPS.

The last row of Table L-1 applies directly to Class A3 equipment, and the first row applies to Class A0.  Because of the higher MTL values in Classes A2, A1 and A1S, relative to A3, lower error rates are expected, but because of the statistical nature of the Monte Carlo technique, it was not practical to evaluate these cases directly.  The summary that follows provides error rate bounds for these two classes. 

 
Class A3, error rate is approximately 0.05 x (10-6
) per report

Class A2, error rate < 0.05 x (10

Class A1, error rate < 0.05 x (10
) per report 
-6
 
Class A0, error rate is approximately 0.09 x (10
) per report. 
 
Based on the results in Table L-1, that show that lower MTL is associated with higher error rates, a more detailed study was undertaken, producing the results in Figure L-1.  
Reception rates are shown here as a function of received power level, giving both acceptance of valid signals (the upper curve) and undetected errors (the lower curves).  A Monte Carlo simulation was used to obtain these results.  The data in Figure L-1 is limited to the RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 reception techniques, which do not have the benefit of conservative or enhanced error correction.  Otherwise, the error rates are much lower, and it is more difficult to assess performance using the Monte Carlo technique. 

More specifically, the upper curve in Figure L-1 shows the probability of correct signal acceptance, including the effects of error detection and correction, as a function of received signal power.  The lower curves represent the probability that an undetected error is received and is reflected in an ADS-B report.  Simulation results are shown here in two forms, normalized to the transmission rate in the lower curve, and normalized to the reception rate in the middle curve. The results show a clear trend in which the error rate, expressed either way, degrades as received signal power decreases.  This behavior is consistent with the results in Table L- 1.  Together they underscore the need for the additional performance requirement when receiver MTL is enhanced relative to TCAS receivers.

## Appendix M Extended Range Reception Techniques

 
This Page Intentionally Left Blank 

## M Extended Range Reception Techniques M.1 Purpose And Scope

The purpose of this Appendix is to provide a description of techniques for extending the effective air-to-air reception range of 1090 MHz ADS-B systems.  Two reception techniques are explored:  (1) use of a directional antenna with an integral low noise preamplifier for 1090 MHz Extended Squitter reception;  (2) optimized 1090 MHz ADS- B reception employing a reduced bandwidth receiver to provide improved reception sensitivity under low-to-moderate 1090 MHz FRUIT conditions.  Also the transmission power for Class A3 airborne installations is discussed. 

## M.2 Background

The ADS-B MASPS, RTCA DO-242A, specifies the required air-to-air reception range for a number of ADS-B applications.  The one application identified by RTCA DO-242A with the longest reception range requirement is the Long Range Conflict Management application.  When the requirements of all applications defined by RTCA DO-242A are considered, the required reception range varies as a function of target bearing from the receiving aircraft.  Specifically as defined in RTCA DO-242A, Note 3 to Table 3-4(a), the required air-to-air reception range that would be applicable to Class A3 ADS-B 
systems is: 

- 
90 NM required (120 NM desired) in the forward direction 
- 
64 NM required (85 NM desired) +/- 45 degrees of forward direction 
- 
45 NM required toward the port and starboard directions 
- 
40 NM required (42 NM desired) toward the aft 
 
RTCA DO-242A defines the Long Range Conflict Management (i.e., flight path deconfliction) application as being applicable to "cooperative separation in oceanic/low density en route airspace."  Thus as currently defined by the ADS-B MASPS, this application is not explicitly required to be supported in moderate to high traffic density en route or terminal airspace.  Currently the most demanding applications applicable to high density, high interference airspace are associated with separation assurance and sequencing.  RTCA DO-242A only requires air-to-air reception ranges of 40 NM to support such applications.   However, RTCA DO-242A includes similar notes under Tables 2-8 and 3-4(a) stating that  "â¦the operational concept and constraints associated with using ADS-B for separation assurance and sequencing have not been fully validated. It is possible that longer ranges may be necessary.  Also, the minimum range required may apply even in high interference environments, such as over-flight of high traffic density terminal areas."  The latter statement in this note applies by reference to the Long Range Conflict Management application. Additional optimizations in the design of airborne 1090 MHz ADS-B systems may prove useful in satisfying the air-to-air reception range requirements associated of future ADS- B applications. 

## M.3 Current Reception Range

The most capable class of ADS-B receiver specified by these MOPS is for Class A3.  
This receiver class is specified to have an MTL of â84 dBm.  An A3 class receiver when used in conjunction with omni-directional diversity aircraft antennas is intended to satisfy the requirement of RTCA DO-242A for an air-to-air reception range of 90 NM.  This assumes all of the target aircraft of interest at the maximum range are equipped with Transmitter Class A3 having a transmit power (at the antenna) of 125 watts to 500 watts (see M.5 below).  The 90 NM reception range capability is thus focused on users operating in high altitude airspace where the most capable class of avionics would be applicable.  Also the Class A3 requirements included in these MOPS that are associated with a 90 NM reception range were predicated on a low-density airspace with low levels of RF interference. 

## M.4 Techniques For Extended Reception Range

The focus of this Appendix is on detailing techniques to provide for extended reception range (i.e., beyond 90 NM) in the forward direction, especially in low to moderate 1090 MHz FRUIT environments.  Certain of these techniques apply only to receivers and antennas not shared with TCAS or used for by Mode S transponders for transmissions. This is a consequence of employing antennas and receiver characteristics that are optimized specifically for the reception of 1090 MHz Extended Squitters in support of the ADS-B function.  The described techniques for enhanced reception range apply primarily to Class A3 receivers.  Further, these techniques apply specifically to extending the ADS-B reception range between aircraft operating in high altitude en route or oceanic airspace.  Some of the described techniques are expected to also prove useful in supporting increased air-to-air reception range while over-flying high density, high interference operational environments. The approach described would add a dedicated directional receive-only antenna to the top of the airframe in combination with a 1090 MHz receiver optimized for extended squitter reception. 

## M.4.1 Optimized 1090 Mhz Antenna

The proposed approach for supporting an extended squitter reception range would include the provision of an additional dedicated aircraft 1090 MHz receive-only antenna (i.e., a third antenna in addition to the baseline diversity antennas) with a gain pattern that is optimized for the required ADS-B system performance requirements, as summarized in section M.2 above.  The baseline aircraft antenna configuration that is applicable to Class A3 ADS-B airborne systems is assumed to employ omni-directional top and bottom diversity antennas and are assumed to be consistent with the characteristics described in Appendix C.  A more optimum aircraft antenna configuration is possible where a third antenna is added that is optimized specifically for the reception of 1090 MHz Extended Squitters at the maximum range in the forward direction.  Such an optimized aircraft antenna configuration employing 3 antennas must still support reception at the ranges required by RTCA DO-242A in non-forward directions and must, at least, not degrade reception performance in the highest 1090 MHz FRUIT environments.  A candidate optimized aircraft antenna configuration is described below that satisfies these constraints. 

In this optimized configuration the diversity top and bottom aircraft antenna have antenna gain pattern characteristics as in a baseline 1090 MHz ADS-B configuration (i.e., omnidirectional).  However, for extended reception range these standard diversity antennas are supplemented with a top-mounted multi-element directional antenna providing a nominal 
+2 to +5 dB of additional gain in the forward direction, as compared to an omnidirectional antenna.  A typical configuration for the enhanced directional aircraft antenna is summarized below: 

- 
employs one driven quarter wavelength element and one or more passive elements. The elements are tuned to provide peak gain and minimum VSWR at or near 1090 MHz. and providing a nominal +2 to +5 dB gain increase at or just above the horizon in the forward direction (exclusive of any internal amplification), as compared to the baseline omni-directional antenna. 
- 
includes an internal low noise preamplifier with 12 dB to 15dB of gain and a noise 
figure at 1090 MHz. consistent with the overall MTL requirements of the receiving system. 
The directional top antenna is to be used in combination with omni-directional top and bottom diversity antennas and each of the three antennas would be connected to independent 1090 MHz receivers.  Since the directional top antenna would be dedicated to ADS-B reception, this could allow for a more optimum mounting location to be selected in support of the goal of providing improved reception performance from the forward direction.  This would typically lead to a desired mounting location forward on the airframe's top center-line. 

## M.4.2 Optimized Receiver Characteristics M.4.2.1 Optimized Receiver Bandwidth

Class A3 receivers that are not shared with TCAS are specified to have an MTL (at the antenna) of â84 dBm (Table 2-81 of these MOPS).  The out-of-band rejection for a message frequency difference of + 5.5 MHz is specified by Table 2-82 of these MOPS to be at least 3 dB above this MTL.  These out-of-band rejection characteristics correspond to a receiver design that employs intermediate frequency (IF) filtering with an effective bandwidth of approximately 8 MHz.  Modeling of the enhanced decoding techniques, as defined in Appendix I of these MOPS, have shown that reducing the IF bandwidth to significantly less than 8 MHz (e.g., 4 MHz) may slightly degrade the enhanced decoder performance in very high 1090 MHz Mode A/C FRUIT environments.  However, such a reduction in the IF bandwidth will allow for decreased receiver MTL values resulting in improved reception range when used in low-to-moderate Mode A/C FRUIT 
environments.  An optimum 1090 MHz Extended Squitter airborne architecture would allow for use of a narrower bandwidth receiver connected to a dedicated top-mounted directional antenna, as described in section M.4.1 above.   
The use of a dedicated ADS-B receiver with reduced bandwidth provides the opportunity for improving the sensitivity of the receiver.  The MTL for Class A3 receivers, conformant to these MOPS, is â84 dBm or lower (Table 2-81).  Airborne installations may achieve up to a 3 dB improvement from this reception performance level (i.e., MTL less than or equal to -87 dBm) as a direct result of the reduction of the receiver bandwidth, as described above. 

Additional improvements in receiver sensitivity are possible with the use of a low noise preamplifier mounted near or integral with the dedicated receiving antenna as described in section M.4.1 above.  If an antenna-mounted low noise preamp is used in combination with a narrow bandwidth receiver, then a receiver MTL as low as â90 dBm may be possible.  Such a configuration could be used to provide for maximum reception range in a low to moderate 1090 MHz. FRUIT environment. 

## M.4.2.2 Optimized Receiver Extended Squitter Decoding

Class A3 receivers are required by these MOPS to incorporate enhanced reception techniques.  The associated test procedures of these MOPS are consistent with an 8 MHz sampling rate of the received video waveform (i.e., 8 samples per bit).  Higher sampling rates are known to provide improved probability of correct decoding when using the baseline multi-sample enhanced decoding techniques defined in Appendix I in a high Mode A/C FRUIT environment.  Therefore, a sampling rate of 10 MHz or higher is recommended for use as a means of extending the reception range of 1090 MHz ADS-B 
in high Mode A/C FRUIT environments. Applying a decoder with a higher sampling rate is expected to help offset the degradation to decoding performance that would result from use of a reduced bandwidth receiver as described in M.4.2.1 above. 

## M.5 Transmission Power

Currently all 1090 MHz ADS-B airborne systems, other than Class A0, are required by these MOPS to have a transmit power within the range of 21 dBW (125 watts) to 27 dBW (500 watts), as measured at the antenna port.  As noted in Â§2.2.2.1.1.4 of these MOPS: "Future version of these MOPS may require that Class A3 1090 MHz ADS-B systems have a transmission capability with a minimum RF peak power of 23 dBW (200 Watts) measured at the antenna terminals."  As the ADS-B MASPS mature, further refinements to the air-to-air range requirements are expected.  Also as the ASA MASPS are completed new requirements may emerge that require either improvements in received update rates or increased reception ranges.  A 1090 MHz ADS-B airborne installation satisfying only the minimum transmit power requirement of 21 dBW, as currently required by these MOPS, is expected to be compatible with the 90 NM reception range requirement, as applicable to Class A3 systems, only under near ideal conditions (with a nominal antenna gain patterns and in a RF non-interference environment).  A 2dB increase in the minimum transmit power from 21 dBW to 23 dBW for Class A3 airborne systems is expected to offer a meaningful improvement in the actual air-to-air reception range supported between Class A3 users, especially under nonideal conditions.

## N Proposed Rtca Do-260B/Eurocae Ed-102A Provisions For Backward Compatibility With Rtca Do-260/Eurocae Ed-102 And Rtca Do-260A Message Formats N.1 Introduction N.1.1 Purpose Of This Appendix

This Appendix: 

a) Defines the formats and coding for Extended Squitter ADS-B Messages that are 
broadcast by ADS-B Version Zero (0), RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 
conformant 1090 MHz ADS-B Subsystems; 
b) Defines the formats and coding for extended squitter ADS-B Messages that are 
broadcast by ADS-B Version One (1), RTCA DO-260A conformant 1090 MHz ADS-B Subsystems; 
c) Defines how the ADS-B report generation function of ADS-B Version Two (2) 1090 
MHz ADS-B Receiving Subsystems is to utilize messages received from targets that are broadcasting with either ADS-B Version Zero (0) or ADS-B Version One (1) 
message formats. 

## N.1.2 Message Version Number

The ADS-B Version Number for all 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages originating for each specific ADS-B target is determined from the decoding of the ADS-B Version Number subfield of the Aircraft Operational Status Message.  An ADS-B Version Two (2) 
Receiving Subsystem initially assumes that the messages conform to ADS-B Version Zero (0) message formats, until or unless, received ADS-B Version Number data indicates otherwise.  The ADS-B Version Number is retained and associated with all messages from that specific target.  This ADS-B Version Number is used for determining the applicable message formats to be applied for the decoding of all 1090 MHz ADS-B 
Messages received from that target.   

## N.2 1090 Mhz Ads-B Version Zero (0) Message Processing N.2.1 Ads-B Version Zero (0) Message Types

Table N-1 provides those ADS-B Version Zero (0) (i.e., originating from a RTCA DO-
260/EUROCAE ED-102 conformant 1090 MHz ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem) 1090 
MHz ADS-B Messages that are to be used for ADS-B report generation by a ADS-B 
Version Two (2) conformant 1090 MHz ADS-B Receiving Subsystem.   
Note: Table N-1 lists only those ADS-B Version Zero (0) 1090 MHz ADS-B Message types that are required to be received and used for ADS-B report generation by a ADS-B Version Two (2) 1090 MHz ADS-B Receiving Subsystem.  The other ADS-
B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages Types defined by RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE 
ED-102, including Messages Types 29 and 30, are not to be used by ADS-B 
Version Two (2) ADS-B Receiving Subsystems for the purpose of ADS-B report generation.

## N.2.1.1 Message Type Codes

The first 5-bit field in every 1090 MHz ADS-B Message contains the message format TYPE.  As shown in Table N-2, the TYPE Code (i.e., format type) is used to differentiate the ADS-B Messages into several classes: airborne position, airborne velocity, surface position, identification, aircraft status, etc. The general definition for all ADS-B Messages Types used for ADS-B Version Zero (0) 
ADS-B Messages has been retained for ADS-B Version One (1) and ADS-B Version Two (2) Messages.  It must be noted for ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages, format TYPE Code 29 was defined but the corresponding messages are not to be transmitted.  For ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Subsystems, TYPE Code 29 was associated with intent messages conveying Trajectory Change Point (TCP) information. Although the message formats for TCP related messages were defined within RTCA DO- 260/EUROCAE ED-102, the requirements and the associated test procedures prohibited the broadcast of such messages. RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 defined TYPE Code 30 for Aircraft Operational Coordination Messages.  The requirements and associated provisions for Aircraft Operational Coordination Messages have now been withdrawn by this version of these MOPS.  Although RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 (i.e., Version Zero) conformant implementations are not prohibited from transmitting Aircraft Operational Coordination Messages (i.e., using TYPE Code 30), ADS-B Version Two (2) conformant ADS-B 
Receiving Subsystems have no requirement for the reception and processing of these broadcasts. ADS-B Version Two (2) ADS-B Receiving Subsystems will generate ADS-B Reports based only on the reception of ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages with ADS-B 
Message TYPE Code values of 0 through 22, 28 and 31.

## N.2.2 State Vector Reports Generated Using Version Zero (0) Messages

The following subparagraphs summarize the ADS-B State Vector Report generation requirements (see Â§2.2.8.1) for ADS-B Version Two (2) systems when receiving ADS-B 
Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages with ADS-B Message TYPE Code values of 0 
through 22, 28 and 31.    
The contents of State Vector Reports are specified in Table 2-83.  The contents of the State Vector Reports are composed primarily from the information received from airborne aircraft in Airborne Position Messages and Airborne Velocity Messages or for aircraft/vehicles on the airport surface in Surface Position Messages.  Many of the parameters contained within these messages are encoded the same, and occupy the same positions with the overall message structure, for both ADS-B Version Zero (0) and for ADS-B Version Two (2) messages.  However, in a few cases the decoding and/or report assembly processing must be handled differently for ADS-B Version Zero (0) messages as compared to that required by these MOPS (see Â§2.2.8.1) for ADS-B Version Two (2) 
messages.  The following subparagraphs describe the required use of ADS-B Version Zero (0) messages for ADS-B report generation by a ADS-B Version Two (2) compliant ADS-B Receiving Subsystem. 

 

## N.2.2.1 State Vector Report To 1090 Mhz Ads-B Message Mapping

Table 2-83 specifies the overall State Vector Report format and the source for each parameter that is to be reported when the target aircraft/vehicle is broadcasting with ADS-B Version Two (2) ADS-B Message formats.  In a similar fashion, Table N-3 below defines the 1090 MHz ADS-B Message-to-State Vector Report mapping that will be used when the target aircraft/vehicle is broadcasting using ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B 
Messages.  Note that there are some minor differences in the specific names applied to certain otherwise identical ADS-B Version Zero (0) versus ADS-B Version Two (2) messages subfields.  The only new or changed State Vector Report parameter between RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 (i.e., Version Zero) and these MOPS is the Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) parameter, which has replaced Navigation Uncertainty Category (NUC) from ADS-B Version Zero (0) of these MOPS.  The following subparagraph discusses the NIC parameter and its mapping from ADS-B 
Version Zero (0) messages to the State Vector Report.  The remaining State Vector Report parameters are described in Â§2.2.8.1. The formats of the ADS-B Version Zero (0) 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages are specified in Figure N-1 through Figure N-7.

## Notes For Table N-3:

1. 
In the "Data Structure" column (i.e., column 10), "S" indicates the "sign-bit," "M" indicates the Most Significant Bit of the data field, "d" indicates data bits in the field, 
"L" indicates the Least Significant Bit of the data field, "0" indicates the bit is to always be set to a value of zero (0) and "x" indicates "Don't Care" bits in the data field. 
2. 
If data is not available to support theses fields, then the entire data field shall be set to ALL ZEROs if the field is delivered to the application. 
3. 
The Report Type Identifier is used to identify the type of ADS-B Report being generated as defined in Â§2.2.8.1.1.1. 
4. 
Items annotated with Note 4 represent "Critical" State Vector items, however certain items are only applicable while airborne and others only applicable while on the 
surface (see Notes 5 and 6 below). 
5. 
Parameters annotated with Note 5 are only present in the State Vector Report when the aircraft is airborne 
6. 
Parameters annotated with Note 6 are only present in the State Vector Report with the aircraft is on the airport surface 
7. 
Estimated values may be either an actual value from a received message, if available, or a calculated value such as produced by a surveillance tracker algorithm.  For example it is possible for a surveillance tracker to produce an updated estimate of the target's 
horizontal position based on just the receipt of a new velocity message. 
8. 
The Time of Applicability is actually a grouping of 3 individual parameters as defined in Â§2.2.8.1.4 

## N.2.2.2 Navigation Integrity Category (Nic)

The ADS-B Version Zero (0) Surface and Airborne Position Messages have associated with each specific TYPE Code a corresponding Horizontal Protection Limit and a 95% 
Containment Radius (RC).  For the purpose of generating a State Vector Report, RTCA 
DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 (i.e., Version Zero) mapped these message parameters to a Navigation Uncertainty Category (NUC).  As defined by Table 2-14, ADS-B Version Two (2) Surface and Airborne Position Messages associated the ADS-B Message TYPE 
Code with the parameters of Horizontal Containment Limit (RC) and Navigation Integrity Category (NIC).  Although ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages were not defined by RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 to directly include a value for NIC, the values defined by Table 2-14 for RC
 and NIC have been selected such that the it is possible to map the TYPE Code values from ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Message to a corresponding value for NIC.  The Surface and Airborne Position Message TYPE Codes associated with ADS-B Version Zero (0) 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages are mapped to the NIC values shown in Table N-4 and Table 2-200 for the purpose of generating State Vector Reports.

## Notes For Table N-4:

1. 
"Baro-Altitude" refers to barometric pressure altitude, relative to a standard pressure of 1013.25 millibars (29.92 in Hg).  It does not refer to baro corrected 
altitude.   
2. 
The GNSS height (HAE) defined in Type Codes 20 to 22 is used when baro altitude is not available. 
3. 
The radius of containment (RC
), is derived from ARINC 429 label 130, which is variously called HIL (Horizontal Integrity Limit) or HPL (Horizontal Protection 
Level). 
 

## N.2.2.3 Movement

The Movement subfield conveyed in Version Two (2) Surface Position Messages is different than the Movement subfield contained in Version Zero (0).  The encoding of the Version Zero (0) Movement subfield is contained in Figure N.2. 

Note:
 ADS-B Applications must use the version number to properly decode the Movement subfield.   

## N.2.3 Mode Status Reports

Table 2-90 defines the overall Mode Status Report format and the source for each parameter that is to be reported when the target aircraft/vehicle is broadcasting with ADS-B Version Two (2) ADS-B Message formats.  In a similar fashion, Table N-5 below defines the 1090 MHz ADS-B Message-to-State Vector Report mapping that will be used when the target aircraft/vehicle is broadcasting using ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B 
Messages.  Note that there are differences in the message parameters available from ADS-B Version Zero (0) versus ADS-B Version Two (2) ADS-B Messages.  As a result, Mode Status Reports related to target aircraft/vehicles broadcasting ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages are substantially less complete than Mode Status Reports generated from ADS-B Version Two (2) ADS-B Messages.  The following subparagraphs discuss those Mode Status Report parameters that must be processed and/or mapped differently for ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages.  The remaining Mode Status Report parameters not specifically addressed in the following subparagraphs will be generated as specified in Â§2.2.8.2 (i.e., using the same mapping as for ADS-B Version Two (2) ADS-
B Messages). The formats of the ADS-B Version Zero (0) 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages are specified in Figure N-1 through Figure N-7.

## Notes For Table N-5:

1. 
In the "Data Structure" column (i.e., column 10), "S" indicates the "sign-bit," "M" indicates the Most Significant Bit of the data field, "d" 
indicates data bits in the field, "L" indicates the Least Significant Bit of the data field, "0" indicates the bit is to always be set to a value of zero (0), and "x" indicates "Don't Care" bits in the data field. 
2. 
If data is not available to support these fields, then the entire data field shall be set to ALL ZEROs. 
3. 
The Report Type Identifier is used to identify the type of ADS-B Report being generated as defined in Â§2.2.8.1.1.1. 
4. 
This parameter is not available for aircraft/vehicles broadcasting Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages.  If included in the Mode Status report the 
value of this parameter is to be set to all zeros otherwise it may be omitted from the Mode Status Report and its omission indicated in the Report Type and Structure Parameter using the format defined in Table 2-84. 
5. 
This parameter is not available for aircraft/vehicles broadcasting Version Zero (0) ADS-B messages.  This parameter is to be omitted from the Mode 
Status Report and its omission indicated in the Report Type and Structure Parameter using the format defined in Table 2-84. 

## N.2.3.1 Ads-B Version Number

The format of the Aircraft Operational Status Message substantially differs between the ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Message format shown in Figure N-7 and the ADS-B 
Version Two (2) ADS-B Message format specified in Â§2.2.3.2.7.3 of these MOPS.  The ADS-B Version Two (2) Aircraft Operational Status Message format includes an explicit ADS-B Version Number subfield (ME bits 41-43).  For a ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-
B Aircraft Operational Status Message, these same bits are unassigned and are expected to be set to a value of ZERO (0). An ADS-B Version Two (2) Receiving Subsystem will, as a default, assume the received messages are using ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Message format unless, or until, an Aircraft Operational Status Message is received and the ADS-B Version Number is confirmed to be other than Zero (0).  However, in the case of a ADS-B Version Two (2) 
ADS-B Subsystem's reception of an Aircraft Operational Status Message, the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem will decode "ME" bits 41-43 and determine if the target aircraft is broadcasting messages that are ADS-B Version Zero (0), or Version One (1), or Version Two (2), and then decode the remainder of the message in accordance with the message format applicable to that ADS-B Version Number. 

Note:
 The ADS-B Version Number determined from the decoding of the ADS-B Version 
Number subfield of the Aircraft Operational Status Message must be retained 
and associated with the specific target since it is used in determining the applicable formats to be used for the decoding of the other message types.   

## N.2.3.2 Emitter Category

The ADS-B Report Assembly Function will extract "TYPE" and "ADS-B Emitter Category" from the Aircraft Identification and Category Message (Figure N-3) and encode the "Emitter Category" field of the Mode Status Report as shown in Table 2-93.  
The Emitter Category conveyed in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message is mapped into the Mode Status Report, Emitter Category field as specified by Table 2-93.  
However, it must be noted that in the ADS-B Version Zero (0) Aircraft Identification and Category Message, the Emitter Category subfield conveys a subset of the Emitter Categories allowed by the Mode Status Report.   

## N.2.3.3 A/V Length And Width Code

The A/V Length and Width Code is not conveyed by ADS-B Version Zero (0) 1090 
MHz ADS-B Messages.  This parameter is only included in the Mode Status Report when reporting on an aircraft or vehicle that is on the airport surface.  When no A/V 
Length and Width Code is available, as is the case for target A/V that are broadcasting ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages, the A/V Length and Width Code parameter will not be included in the Mode Status Report and its omission so indicated in the Report Type and Structure Parameter using the coding specified in Table 2-91.   

## N.2.3.4 Emergency/Priority Status

The Emergency/Priority Status conveyed in the Aircraft Status Message (Figure N-6) will be directly mapped into the Mode Status Report, Emergency/Priority Status field as specified in Â§2.2.8.2.9.  However, it must be noted that in the ADS-B Version Zero (0) 
Aircraft Extended Squitter Status Message, the Emergency/Priority Status subfield conveys a subset of the Emergency/Priority Status categories allowed by the Mode Status Report.   

## N.2.3.5 Capability Codes

The ADS-B Version Zero (0) Operational Status Message (Figure N-7) conveys Control Codes with information limited to TCAS and CDTI capabilities, as shown in Table N-6.  
The ADS-B Version Zero (0) Aircraft Operational Status Message format specifies coding only for the case of CC-4 (En Route Operational Capabilities).  Therefore the CC-
1, CC-2 and CC-3 subfields, as specified in Figure N-7, are to be considered reserved and not used for ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages.   
For the case of CC-4, this 4-bit (bits 9-12) subfield will be mapped to the Capability Code field of the Mode Status Report as shown in Table N-6.  The remaining bits within the Mode Status Report Capability Code field will be set to Zero (0).  If no Aircraft Operational Status Message has been received, then the Capability Code field may be omitted from the Mode Status Report and its omission so indicated in the Report Type and Structure Parameter using the coding specified in Table 2-91.

## N.2.3.6 Operational Modes

ADS-B Version Zero (0), RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 conformant, ADS-B 
Message formats do not define coding for the Operational Mode subfield of the Operational Status Message.  Therefore the OM-1, OM-2, OM-3 and OM-4 subfields, as shown in Figure N-7, are to be considered reserved and not used for ADS-B Version Zero (0) Messages.  Mode Status Reports for target aircraft/vehicles broadcasting ADS-B 
Version Zero (0) ADS-B Messages will not include the Operational Mode field in the report and indicate the omission of this parameter in the Report Type and Structure Parameter using the coding specified in Table 2-91.    

## ) N.2.3.7 Navigation Accuracy Category For Position (Nacp

The ADS-B Version Zero (0) ADS-B Surface and Airborne Position Messages have associated with each specific TYPE code a corresponding Horizontal Protection Limit and a 95% Containment Radius (i.e., position error).  For a ADS-B Version Two (2) Receiving Subsystem, the TYPE codes of the received ADS-B Version Zero (0) 
Messages will be mapped into the value of the Navigation Accuracy Category for Position (NAC
P) as shown in Table 2-200 and below in Table N-7 for the purpose of generating the Mode Status Report.

| 22             | Airborne Position             |

 
Note:
 The Position Error column of the table indicates the greater of the horizontal or vertical 95% containment radius as listed in Table N-4 for ADS-B Version Zero 
(0) messages.   
 

## ) N.2.3.8 Navigation Accuracy Category For Velocity (Nacv

The ADS-B Version Zero (0) Airborne Velocity Message (see Figure N-4 and Figure N- 5) includes a subfield that conveys the Navigation Uncertainty Category for Velocity (NUC
) field of Mode Status Report.   
R).  The received value of NUCR will be mapped directly one-for-one to the Navigation Accuracy Category for Velocity (NACV
 

## N.2.3.9 Source Integrity Level (Sil)

The Source Integrity Level (SIL) defines the probability of the integrity containment region described by the NIC parameter being exceed for the selected geometric position source, including any external signals used by the source.  The value of SIL can only be inferred from the information conveyed in ADS-B Version Zero (0) Messages.  Table 2-
200 and Table N-8 provide the mapping between the message Type Code for a ADS-B 
Version Zero (0) Transmitting Subsystem and the value of SIL to be reported by a ADS- B Version Two (2) Receiving Subsystem within the Mode Status Report (see 
Â§2.2.8.2.14).

## ) N.2.3.10 Barometric Altitude Integrity Code (Nicbaro

The Barometric Altitude Integrity Code (NIC
BARO) parameter of the Mode Status Report is a 1-bit flag used to indicate if the barometric altitude being reported in the State Vector Report has been cross-checked against another source of pressure altitude.  The ADS-B 
Version Zero (0) Messages do not include information related to the cross-checking of barometric altitude.  Therefore, Mode Status Reports for target aircraft/vehicles broadcasting ADS-B Version Zero (0) Messages will not include the NICBARO
 field in the report and therefore will indicate the omission of this parameter in the Report Type and Structure Parameter using the coding specified in Table 2-91.   

## N.2.3.11 Track/Heading And Horizontal Reference Direction (Hrd)

ADS-B Version Zero (0) Airborne Velocity Messages with Subtype equal to 3 or 4 
include a "Magnetic Heading Status Bit" as shown in Figure N-4.  A 1090 MHz ADS-B 
Receiving Subsystem, upon receiving an Airborne Velocity Message with a Subtype of 3 or 4, must decode the Magnetic Heading Status Bit to determine if Magnetic Heading Data is "Available."  The ADS-B Receiving Subsystem will set the value of the True/Magnetic Heading subfield (see Â§2.2.8.2.17, of the Mode Status Report), as specified in Table N-9.

## Notes:

1. When no valid data is available the "Track/Heading and HRD" parameter may be 
reported as ALL ZEROs, or omitted, from the Mode Status Report and the omission of this parameter indicated in the Report Type and Structure Parameter using the coding defined in Table 2-91. 
2. As defined in Â§2.2.8.2.17, when receiving ADS-B Version Two (2) Messages, the 
Track/Heading and HRD information are conveyed within the Operation Status Message.  However, when receiving ADS-B Version Zero (0) Messages the 
equivalent information can be determined for airborne aircraft from the value of the "Subtype" subfield and for Subtype=3 or 4 messages the value of the "Magnetic Heading Status Bit" of the Airborne Velocity Message (Figure N-4 and Figure N-5).  
When a target aircraft/vehicle is on the surface a value of 01 should be reported when a Surface Position Message (Figure N-2) is received with the "Ground Track 
Status Bit" set to a value of ONE (1) indicating that the valid ground track data is provided. 
3. ADS-B Version Zero (0) Airborne Velocity Messages, Subtypes 3 and 4 always report 
Heading relative to Magnetic North, never relative to True North.   

## N.2.4 Air Referenced Velocity Reports

The requirements of Â§2.2.8.3.2 for Air Referenced Velocity (ARV) Reports apply to the ARV Report Assembly requirements when the target aircraft is broadcasting either ADS- B Version Zero (0) or Version Two (2) Message formats.   

## N.2.5 Target Status Reports

RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 defined a message format using message TYPE 
Code 29 to convey Aircraft Trajectory Intent information in the form of Trajectory Change Point (TCP) information.  A 1090 MHz ADS-B Receiving Subsystem conforming to these MOPS does not use any message with a TYPE Code of 29 that is received from a ADS-B Version Zero (0) Transmitting Subsystem for the purpose of report generation.   
Note:
 Prior to generation of a Target Status Report, the 1090 MHz ADS-B Receiving Subsystem must positively confirm that any received message with a TYPE Code of 29 has originated from a target aircraft with an ADS-B Version Number other than Zero (0).  The ADS-B Version Number can be determined from the contents of the ADS-B Version Number subfield of the Aircraft Operational Status Message (see Â§2.2.8.2.5 and Â§N.4.2).   

## N.3 1090 Mhz Ads-B Version 1 Message Processing N.3.1 Ads-B Version One (1) Message Types

ADS-B Version One (1) (i.e., originating from a RTCA DO-260A conformant 1090 MHz ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem) 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages are the same basic message types as ADS-B Version Two (2).  Some messages have different formats and contain additional or eliminated message subfields. The Target State and Status Message changed from ADS-B Version One (1) to ADS-B 
Version Two (2).  ADS-B Version One (1) Transmitting Subsystems use Subtype Zero 
(0) for the Target State and Status Message, and ADS-B Version Two (2) Transmitting Subsystems use Subtype One (1) for backward compatibility.  ADS-B Version Two (2) 
Receiving Subsystems do not generate Target State Reports from ADS-B Version One 
(1) Target State and Status Messages, but utilize the accuracy and integrity parameters in the Message (see Â§N.3.2 and Â§N.3.3).  See Â§N.4.2 for ADS-B Version One (1) Message formats.  ADS-B Version One (1) Transmitting Subsystems do not broadcast the Extended Squitter Aircraft Status Message (Subtype 2), the 1090ES TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) Message.    

## N.3.1.1 Message Type Codes

The first 5-bit field in every 1090 MHz ADS-B Message contains the message format TYPE.  The TYPE Code (i.e., format type) is used to differentiate the messages into several classes: airborne position, airborne velocity, surface position, identification, aircraft status, etc.  The general definition for all ADS-B Messages Types used for ADS-
B Version One (1) Messages has been retained for ADS-B Version Two (2) Messages.    

## N.3.2 State Vector Reports Generated Using Version One (1) Messages

The following subparagraphs summarize the ADS-B State Vector Report generation requirements (see Â§2.2.8.1) for ADS-B Version Two (2) systems when receiving ADS-B Version One (1) ADS-B Messages.    
The contents of State Vector Reports are specified in Table 2-83.  The contents of the State Vector Reports are composed primarily from the information received from airborne aircraft in Airborne Position Messages and Airborne Velocity Messages or for aircraft/vehicles on the airport surface in Surface Position Messages.  Many of the parameters contained within these messages are encoded the same, and occupy the same positions with the overall message structure, for both ADS-B Version One (1) and for ADS-B Version Two (2) Messages.  However, in a few cases the decoding and/or report assembly processing must be handled differently for ADS-B Version One (1) Messages as compared to that required by these MOPS (see Â§2.2.8.1) for ADS-B Version Two (2) Messages.  The following subparagraphs describe the required use of ADS-B Version One (1) Messages for ADS-B Report generation by a ADS-B Version Two (2) compliant ADS-B Receiving Subsystem.   

## N.3.2.1 State Vector Report To 1090 Mhz Ads-B Message Mapping

Table 2-83 specifies the overall State Vector Report format and the source for each parameter that is to be reported when the target aircraft/vehicle is broadcasting with ADS-B Version Two (2) ADS-B Message formats.  In a similar fashion, Table N-10 below defines the 1090 MHz ADS-B Message-to-State Vector Report mapping that will be used when the target aircraft/vehicle is broadcasting using ADS-B Version One (1) 
Messages.  Note that there are some minor differences in the specific names applied to certain otherwise identical ADS-B Version One (1) versus Version Two (2) Messages subfields.  The following subparagraph discusses the NIC parameter and its mapping from ADS-B Version One (1) Messages to the State Vector Report.  The remaining State Vector Report parameters are described in Â§2.2.8.1. The formats of the ADS-B Version One (1) 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages are specified in Figure N-8 through Figure N-17.

## Notes For Table N-10:

1. 
In the "Data Structure" column (i.e., column 10), "S" indicates the "sign-bit," "M" indicates the Most Significant Bit of the data field, "d" indicates data bits in the field, "L" 
indicates the Least Significant Bit of the data field, "0" indicates the bit is to always be set to a value of zero (0) and "x" indicates "Don't Care" bits in the data field. 
2. 
If data is not available to support theses fields, then the entire data field shall be set to ALL ZEROs if the field is delivered to the application. 
3. 
The Report Type Identifier is used to identify the type of ADS-B Report being generated as 
defined in Â§2.2.8.1.1.1. 
4. 
Items annotated with Note 4 represent "Critical" State Vector items, however certain items are only applicable while airborne and others only applicable while on the surface (see Notes 5 and 6 below). 
5. 
Parameters annotated with Note 5 are only present in the State Vector Report when the aircraft is airborne. 
6. 
Parameters annotated with Note 6 are only present in the State Vector Report with the aircraft is on the airport surface. 
7. 
Estimated values may be either an actual value from a received message, if available, or a calculated value such as produced by a surveillance tracker algorithm.  For example it is possible for a surveillance tracker to produce an updated estimate of the target's horizontal position based on just the receipt of a new velocity message. 
8. 
The Time of Applicability is actually a grouping of 3 individual parameters as defined in Â§2.2.8.1.4.   

## N.3.2.2 Navigation Integrity Category (Nic)

As defined by Table 2-14, ADS-B Version Two (2) Surface and Airborne Position Messages have associated with each specific ADS-B Message TYPE Code a corresponding Horizontal Containment Limit (RC
) and Navigation Integrity Category 
(NIC).  The TYPE Code is used along with the NIC Supplement-A in the Operational Status Message to decode the NIC.  The Surface and Airborne Position Message TYPE Codes associated with ADS-B Version One (1) 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages along with the NIC Supplement-A are used to map to the NIC values shown in Table N-11 for the purpose of generating State Vector Reports.

## Notes For Table N-11:

1. 
"Baro-Altitude" refers to barometric pressure altitude, relative to a standard pressure of 1013.25 millibars (29.92 in Hg).  It does not refer to baro corrected 
altitude.   
2. 
The GNSS height (HAE) defined in Type Codes 20 to 22 is used when baro altitude is not available. 
, is derived from ARINC 429 label 130, which is variously called HIL (Horizontal Integrity Limit) or HPL (Horizontal Protection Level). 

3.

## N.3.2.3 Movement

The Movement subfield conveyed in Version Two (2) Surface Position Messages is different than the Movement subfield contained in Version One (1).  The encoding of the Version One (1) Movement subfield is contained in Figure N-9.    
Note:
 ADS-B Applications must use the version number to properly decode the Movement subfield.    

## N.3.3 Mode Status Reports

Table 2-90 defines the overall Mode Status Report format and the source for each parameter that is to be reported when the target aircraft/vehicle is broadcasting with ADS-B Version Two (2) Message formats.  In a similar fashion, Table N-5 below defines the 1090 MHz ADS-B Message-to-State Vector Report mapping that will be used when the target aircraft/vehicle is broadcasting using ADS-B Version One (1) Messages.  Note that there are differences in the message parameters available from Version One (1) 
versus ADS-B Version Two (2) Messages.  The following subparagraphs discuss those Mode Status Report parameters that must be processed and/or mapped differently for ADS-B Version One (1) Messages.  The remaining Mode Status Report parameters not specifically addressed in the following subparagraphs will be generated as specified in Â§2.2.8.2 (i.e., using the same mapping as for ADS-B Version Two (2) Messages). The formats of the ADS-B Version One (1) Messages are specified in Figure N-8 through Figure N-17.

## Notes:

1. In the "Data Structure" column (i.e., column 10), "S" indicates the "sign-bit," "M" indicates the Most Significant Bit of the data field, "d" indicates 
data bits in the field, "L" indicates the Least Significant Bit of the data field, and "x" indicates "Don't Care" bits in the data field. 
2. The Report Type and Structure Identifier is used to identify the type of ADS-B Report being generated and the data parameters provided in the report 
as specified in Â§2.2.8.1.1.   
3. The A/V Length and Width Code parameter is only applicable to Mode Status Reports for aircrafts or vehicles that are on the airport surface. 

## N.3.3.1 Ads-B Version Number

The format of the Aircraft Operational Status Message differs between the ADS-B 
Version One (1) Message format shown in Figure N-14 and the ADS-B Version Two (2) 
Message format specified in Â§2.2.3.2.7.3 of these MOPS.  There are additional parameters in ADS-B Version Two (2) Aircraft Operational Status Message that are not contained in ADS-B Version One (1) Messages.  A ADS-B Version Two (2) Receiving Subsystem will, as a default, assume the received messages are using ADS-B Version Zero (0) Message format unless, or until, an Aircraft Operational Status Message is received and the ADS-B Version Number is confirmed to be other than Zero (0).  
However, in the case of a ADS-B Version Two (2) Subsystem's reception of an Aircraft Operational Status Message, the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem will decode "ME" bits 41-
43 and determine if the target aircraft is broadcasting messages that are ADS-B Version Zero (0), Version One (1), or Version Two (2), or higher, and then decode the remainder of the message in accordance with the message format applicable to that ADS-B Version Number.   
Note:
 The ADS-B Version Number determined from the decoding of the Version Number subfield of the Aircraft Operational Status message must be retained and associated with the specific target since it is used in determining the applicable formats to be used for the decoding of the other message types.   

## N.3.3.2 Emitter Category

The ADS-B Report Assembly Function will extract "TYPE" and "ADS-B Emitter Category" from the Aircraft Identification and Category Message (Figure N-10) and encode the "Emitter Category" field of the Mode Status Report as shown in Table 2-93.  
The Emitter Category conveyed in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message is mapped into the Mode Status Report, Emitter Category field as specified by Table 2-93.   

## N.3.3.3 A/V Length And Width Code

This parameter is only included in the Mode Status Report when reporting on an aircraft or vehicle that is on the airport surface.  When no A/V Length and Width Code is available, the A/V Length and Width Code parameter will not be included in the Mode Status Report and its omission so indicated in the Report Type and Structure Parameter using the coding specified in Table N-13.

Note: In RTCA DO-260A encoding of decimal ZERO (0) A/V Length/Width Code was specified as Length=15 meters and Width=11.5 meters.  However, there may be ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems implemented that are consistent with the interpretation of the ICAO SARPs of defining an ALL ZERO condition to be interpreted as "No Data or Unknown."  Version TWO Reports based on receiving an ALL ZERO A/V Length/Width Code from a Version One (1) 
Transmitting Subsystem will be reported as "Unknown."   

## N.3.3.4 Emergency/Priority Status

The Emergency/Priority Status conveyed in the Aircraft Status Message (Figure N-13) and the Target State and Status Message (Figure N-15) will be directly mapped into the Mode Status Report, Emergency/Priority Status field.   

## N.3.3.5 Capability Codes

The ADS-B Report Assembly Function will extract the "Capability Class Codes" data from Aircraft Operational Status Messages and the Target State and Status Messages and provide the Capability Class Codes to the user application in the Mode Status Report in the binary format specified in Table N-12.   
Capability Class Codes from the ADS-B Operational Status and the Target State and Status Messages, **shall** be mapped bit for bit into the 3-byte long Capability Class Codes field of the ADS-B Mode Status Report as specified in Table N-14. When valid "Capability Class" data is not available for a given parameter, then the Capability Class data sent to the user application for that parameter is set to ALL ZEROs. 

When a Mode Status Report is generated and when the only received update to the 
"Capability Class" data has come from a Target State and Status Message, the reported value of all Capability Class parameters are based on the most recently received Operational Status Message, except updated with the data (i.e., TCAS parameter) received in the subsequent Target State and Status Message.

Note:
 Direct Mapping means the message bit state (i.e., 0 or 1) remains the same when mapped into the Mode Status Report.  Inverse Mapping means the message bit state is reversed when mapped into the Mode Status Report. 

## N.3.3.6 Source Integrity Level (Sil)

The Source Integrity Level (SIL) defines the probability of the integrity containment region described by the NIC parameter being exceed for the selected geometric position source, including any external signals used by the source.  In ADS-B Version One (1), the Surveillance Integrity Level parameter represented this probability as well as other elements of integrity.  The Surveillance Integrity Level may have also included the reliability of the aircraft systems given by a failure rate corresponding to the equipment design assurance.  In ADS-B Version Two (2), this aspect of integrity is represented by the System Design Assurance (SDA) parameter.  The ADS-B Report Assembly Function will extract the Surveillance Integrity Level data from Aircraft Operational Status Messages and the Target State and Status Messages and provide the Source Integrity Level to the user application in the Mode Status Report in the binary format.   
Note:
 Applications using Reports from ADS-B Version One (1) participants may be able to use the Surveillance Integrity Level to derive both Source Integrity Level and System Design Assurance (SDA).   

## N.3.3.7 Track/Heading And Horizontal Reference Direction (Hrd)

The ADS-B Report Assembly Function will extract the Track Angle/Heading (see 
Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.1.7) and the Horizontal Reference Direction (HRD) (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.13) flag bits from the Aircraft Operational Status Message (see Â§2.2.3.2.7.2) and set the True/Magnetic Heading field in the Mode Status Report in the binary format specified in Table N-12.  This item within the Mode Status Report is used to indicate the nature of the Horizontal Direction information being reported in the State Vector Reports and Target State Reports.  This applies to the aircraft reported Horizontal Direction (in the State Vector Report).  The encoding of bits 0 and 1 of the report True/Magnetic Heading field shall be as specified in Table N-15.  Bit 1 of the True/Magnetic Heading field indicates when Ground Track is being reported (i.e., set to zero) or when Heading is being reported (i.e., set to one).  Bit 0 of the True/Magnetic Heading field indicates when Heading based on True North (i.e., set to zero) or when heading based on Magnetic North (i.e., set to one) is being reported.

Note:
 Bits 2 through 7 of byte 32 of the True/Magnetic Heading subfield are always set to ZERO (0). 

## N.3.4 Air Referenced Velocity Reports

The requirements of Â§2.2.8.3.2 for Air Referenced Velocity (ARV) Reports apply to the ARV Report Assembly requirements when the target aircraft is broadcasting either ADS-
B Version One (1) or ADS-B Version Two (2) ADS-B Message formats.   

## N.3.5 Target State Reports

Since the content and use of Target State Reports changed between ADS-B Version One 
(1) and Version Two (2), there is no requirement to output ADS-B Version One (1) 
Target State Reports.   

## N.4 Formats For Version Zero (0) And Version One (1) 1090 Mhz Ads-B Messages

1090 MHz ADS-B Receiving Subsystems conformant to these MOPS (RTCA DO- 260B/EUROCAE ED-102A) are required to receive and decode all ADS-B Version Two 
(2) compliant messages plus, for backward compatibility, must receive and decode certain messages types conforming to the previous RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102, ADS-B Version Zero (0) formats, and RTCA DO-260A, ADS-B Version One (1) formats.   

## N.4.1 Formats For Version Zero (0) 1090 Mhz Ads-B Messages

The following figures define the format of ADS-B Version Zero (0) Extended Squitter Messages that must be received and decoded and used for the generation of ADS-B 
reports as defined in Â§N.2.2 through Â§N.2.5.   

## Notes:

1. In some cases, ARINC 429 labels are referenced for specific message fields.  These 
references are only intended to clarify the field content, and are not intended as a requirement to use these ARINC 429 labels as the source for the message field. 
2. The formats of the ADS-B Version Zero (0) Messages that are not required to be 
received and used for report generation by a ADS-B Version Two (2) Receiving 
Subsystem are not shown in the following figures.

## N.4.2 Formats For Version One (1) 1090 Mhz Ads-B Messages

The following figures define the format of ADS-B Version One (1) Extended Squitter Messages that must be received and decoded and used for the generation of ADS-B 
Reports as defined in Â§N.3.2 through Â§N.3.5.   

## Notes:

1. In some cases, ARINC 429 labels are referenced for specific message fields.  These 
references are only intended to clarify the field content, and are not intended as a requirement to use these ARINC 429 labels as the source for the message field. 
2. The formats of the Version One (1) ADS-B Messages that are not required to be 
received and used for report generation by a Version Two (2) 1090 MHz ADS-B 
receiving system are not shown in the following figures.

## Appendix O Accommodation Of Trajectory Change Reporting

## O Accommodation Of Trajectory Change Reporting O.1 Introduction

In addition to the ADS-B requirements on which these MOPS are based, RTCA DO-242A also provides a description of additional intent communications for which future requirements are being considered.  The provisions in this Appendix are not intended to be implemented in systems compliant with this version of these MOPS. 

Trajectory Change (TC) Reports are defined, although operational applications and resulting broadcast requirements are still under development.  Anticipating the possible use of TC Reports in the future, this Appendix provides corresponding specifics for implementing this communication using Extended Squitter.  The analysis in this Appendix assumes that all communications of intent information will be non-addressed air-to-air broadcasts.  However, it should be noted that as applications are developed that require long-range intent information, especially data supporting reports beyond TC+1, it is quite possible that information will be transmitted air-to-ground and/or in addressed communications such as the Mode S interrogation-reply data link between transponder equipped aircraft and radar ground stations. 

TC Reports are an extension to the Trajectory Change Point (TCP) reporting that was described in both RTCA DO-242 and RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102.  During the update to the ADS-B MASPS to version RTCA DO-242A it was concluded that the previously defined TCP reporting provisions were not sufficient for the intended purpose. The preliminary requirements reflected in RTCA DO-242A for TC Reports are intended to accommodate a variety of airborne capabilities.  Thus, some aircraft may broadcast only a subset of the TC information allowed for by RTCA DO-242A in the TC Report structure.  Section 2.1.2.19.2 of RTCA DO-242A describes the operational requirements for TC Reporting and Â§3.4.8 of RTCA DO-242A provides the technical and performance requirements for TC Reporting.  RTCA DO-242A does not define the minimum set of TC 
related parameters that must be broadcast.  RTCA DO-242A defines preliminary requirements for reporting of information related to the first through forth point at which the aircraft trajectory will change.  The associated reports are designated as TC+0, TC+1, TC+2 and TC+3 reports.  RTCA DO-242A suggests that additional TC Reports may ultimately be defined.  This Appendix specifically addresses only the accommodation of TC+0 and TC+1 reports with an indication of the potential support for additional TC Reports. 

## O.2 Summary Of Trajectory Change Reporting Requirements

RTCA DO-242A, Table 3-24 defines the content requirements for TC+0 and TC+n Reports.  The broadcast of messages supporting TC+0 Reports will be required for all Class A2 and Class A3 ADS-B equipped aircraft, as per RTCA DO-242A, Table 3-3(a). The broadcast of messages supporting TC+n Reports would only be required of Class A3 ADS-B equipped aircraft, as per RTCA DO-242A, Table 3-3(a). Table O-1 below defines the requirements for TC Report content is a simplified version derived from the Table 3- 24 of RTCA DO-242A.

## O.3 1090 Mhz Ads-B Message For Trajectory Change Information

The Trajectory Change information will be broadcast from the aircraft using a Trajectory Change (TC) Message.  Message TYPE Code 27 has been reserved for this purpose as indicated in Table 2-14 of these MOPS.  For Message TYPE Code 27 a 2-bit SUBTYPE 
subfield will be defined with 4 codes reserved for conveying the Trajectory Change information associated with TC+0 and TC+1 Reports (as required by RTCA DO-242A). The TYPE Code plus the SUBTYPE subfield would occupy the first 7 bits of the 56-bit ME field of the extended squitter.  This results in the 49 remaining bits being available to convey the Trajectory Change information.  With this limitation on the transmission frame size, the broadcast of Trajectory Change information will need to be segmented. Two Trajectory Change Messages will be required to convey the complete set of Trajectory Change information defined for a complete TC+0 or a TC+n Report. The preliminary concept would be to define the 4 Message SUBTYPES as shown in Table O-2. 

| SUBTYPE = 00         | TC+0 Basic Information    |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| SUBTYPE = 01         | TC+1 Basic Information    |
| SUBTYPE = 10         | 1                         |
| st                   |                           |
| Supplemental Message |                           |
| SUBTYPE = 11         | 2                         |
| nd                   |                           |
| Supplemental Message |                           |

 For SUBTYPEs 00 and 01 there would be 49 bits available to convey the basic information needed for generation of TC+0 and TC+1 reports.  SUBTYPEs 10 and 11 would be used for TC Messages that convey the additional information necessary to generate a TC+0 or a TC+1 Reports that is beyond the basic TC information being conveyed in the SUBTYPE=00 or 01 Messages.  The TC Message format for conveying TC supplemental information will use the TC Report Sequence Number and the TC Report Cycle Number to allow the Supplemental TC information to be correctly associated the intended Basic TC Messages. If the TC Basic Message can support the minimum application requirements for the TC Report, and can therefore be transmitted without an associated TC Supplement Message, a means conveying whether or not TC Supplemental Messages are being broadcast must be provided.  (Possible means include coding schemes within TC Basic Messages, or within Operational Status Messages.) Table O-3 shows how the information required for a TC+0 and TC+1 reports would be conveyed by the 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages. 

It is proposed that if TC+3 or subsequent Trajectory Change points are desired, with the 1090 MHz system, these would be supported only as an addressed air-ground service and would not be supported as a broadcast service using Extended Squitter.

## Notes:

1. Report elements indicated by RTCA DO-242A as reserved are not assigned bits.  If required by a future ADS-B MASPS revision, such report elements would be 
accommodated within a Supplemental TC Message using the "spare" bits. 
2. Although RTCA DO-242A assumes 4 bits are provided for this parameter, less than eight values were assigned by RTCA DO-242A with the remainder being reserved.  In 
order to provide the most efficient use of the 1090 MHz ADS-B Message structure, the allowed values for this parameter within the TC+0 and TC+1 Messages will be 
restricted to the range of 0 to 7, requiring only 3 bits for encoding.  If in the future a need arises that requires values that cannot be accommodated within 3 bits, then a 
binary value of "111" could be used to indicate that the value of the parameter is 7 or greater, and the specific value would then be included in the Supplemental TC 
Message. 

## O.4 Transmission Rate Requirements

RTCA DO-242A does not define a specific update rate requirement for TC+0 or TC+1 
Reports.  However, RTCA DO-242A, Appendix N provides an estimate for TC+0 Reports where air-to-air update rates are range dependent.  RTCA DO-242A, Table N-8 
defines a nominal update interval at 95% probability for TC+0 Reports as: Range < 20 NM --- Update Interval = 12 seconds (Class A2 and A3 systems) Range = 40 NM --- Update Interval = 18 seconds (Class A2 and A3 systems) Range = 90 NM --- Update Interval = 41 seconds (Class A3 systems) RTCA DO-242A, Table N-8 also defines a 12-second update interval following a TC+0 
state change at ranges to 40 NM. 

No update rates are provided for air-to-ground delivery of TC information, nor is the role of the ground ATM system adequately considered in the operational concept presented in the RTCA DO-242A, Appendix N. 

The 1090 MHz ADS-B TC Messages required to support conveying the complete information defined by RTCA DO-242A for a TC+0 Report includes both the TC+0 
Basic and the 1st Supplemental TC Messages.  However, it may be possible to transmit the TC+0 Basic Message at a higher rate than the TC Supplemental Message since the TC+0 Basic Message provides the most essential information and a small delay in receiving updates to the supplemental information may be acceptable.  It is also probable that some or perhaps many Class A2 and A3 aircraft will not be equipped to provide other than the Basic TC information.  In this case, if it is operationally determined that this information is satisfactory to support the desired applications, then the Supplemental TC Message would not be required.  It is not possible at this time to establish the specific update rate requirements for the individual data elements defined by RTCA DO-242A for the TC+0 Reports.  As the operational concepts and definition of applications that use TC Reports mature, this may become possible.  The other 1090 MHz ADS-B Messages and their associated nominal broadcast rates that will routinely be broadcast for an Airborne Class A2 or A3 system are: 

| Position:           | 2.0 per second    |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Velocity:           | 2.0 per second    |
| AC ID & Type:       | 0.2 per second    |
| Operational Status: | 0.4 per second    |
| Target State:       |                   |
| Total:              |                   |
| 0.8 per second      |                   |
| 5.4 per second      |                   |

 These MOPS, as well as the Mode S Transponder MOPS (RTCA DO-181D), limit the total transmission rate of all Extended Squitters to 6.2 per second.  This means that if implemented under the current overall rate limit of 6.2 squitters per second, the broadcast of Trajectory Change information would need to be limited to not more than 0.8 messages per second.  Given this current overall limit of 6.2 squitters per second, only TC+0 can be considered and supported.  Support for TC+1 Messages will require an increase in the overall rate limit.  Since the complete set of TC information requires both a Basic TC Message plus a TC Supplemental Message, there are two alternatives: 

1. Broadcast both the Basic TC+0 Message and the associated Supplemental TC 
Message at a rate of 0.4 (i.e., at 2.5 second intervals). 
2. If it is deemed appropriate to update the data elements contained in the 
Supplemental TC Message at a lower rate than the information included in the Basic TC+0 Message, then it may be appropriate to broadcast the Basic TC+0 Message at perhaps 0.5 messages per second and the TC+0 Supplemental Message at perhaps a 
rate of 0.3 messages per second. 
As indicated above, there may be many aircraft that are only capable of broadcasting the information included in the Basic TC Message (i.e., TC Supplemental Message not being broadcast), in which case the Basic TC Message could be broadcast at the rate of 0.8 messages per second. 

Even support for TC+0 could be enhanced by allowing for a total Extended Squitter broadcast rate above the current limit of 6.2 squitters per second.  Ideally, the TC+0 related messages, or at least the Basic TC+0 Message would be broadcast at the same rate as that used for the Target State Messages (0.8 per second).  If both of the TC+0 Supplemental Messages were each to be broadcast at 0.8 per second, then the maximum Extended Squitter broadcast rate would need to be raised to 7 per second for those aircraft equipped to provide the full set of TC information. Accommodating both the TC+0 and TC+1 related messages will require that the maximum allowed Extended Squitter rate be increased to at least 7 squitters per second and more realistically to perhaps on the order of 8 squitters per second. These above suggested maximum rates are considered appropriate to satisfy the RTCA DO-242A preliminary requirements and estimates for aircraft-to-aircraft reporting of Trajectory Change information in moderate to perhaps high density airspace (at up to 40 NM).  In low density airspace the reception probabilities increase because of lower 1090 MHz fruit rates and as a result, more modest transmission rates would suffice to support the required reception ranges and TC Report update rates.   

## O.5 Estimated Performance O.5.1 Tc+0 Performance Estimate

There are many factors that will impact the ability of the 1090 MHz ADS-B system to deliver Trajectory Change information.  As discussed above in Â§O.4 there are a number of alternatives as to the rate at which TC+0 messages are broadcast.  The broadcast rate will depend on both the aircraft equipage (e.g., only able to provide basic TC information versus more extensive TC information) and also on the ability to revise the Mode S transponder standards, both within RTCA and ICAO, to permit an increase in the peak transmission rates for Extended Squitters.  The full set of TC+0 Report information must be split into two Extended Squitter Messages for transmission.  For the case where a given aircraft is only capable of providing the information contained in the Basic TC+0 Message, reception of this single message type will be sufficient to generate an TC+0 Report.  For the case of an aircraft equipped to provide the full TC+0 information set, then the reception of both a Basic TC+0 and a Supplemental TC+0 Message would be required in order to update the TC+0 Report.   
Given these uncertainties and potential variations in the broadcast capabilities, estimates were developed for three alternative cases for the broadcast of TC+0 Messages. Simulations runs have not been specifically conducted for these alternative cases.  Rather a simplified approach was employed where the per squitter reception probability was calculated that would be required to satisfy the RTCA DO-242A, Appendix N guidance material for TC+0 Report nominal update rates.  The simulation results were then reviewed to estimate at what range the calculated per squitter reception probability would be supported.  Since two different simulations were used to estimate the performance, both the results from the Johns Hopkins-APL simulations and the results from the MIT 
Lincoln Laboratory simulations are provided.  These simulations are described in Appendix P of these MOPS.  The simulation results are presented for both a low density traffic environment as well as the postulated future Los Angles traffic environment for the year 2020.  The LA2020 scenario with 24000 Mode A/C fruit per second interference level was used for the analysis of TC reception performance in a high density environment.  The effects of increased loading on the 1090 MHz channel from the increased rate of Extended Squitter transmissions that would be necessary to accommodate TC Reporting have not been considered in the analysis.  The effect of the increased channel loading is expected to be minor for the case where the total Extended Squitter transmission rate is limited to 6.2 squitters per second.  As the requirements for TC Reporting mature, further studies should be conducted to determine an appropriate upper limit on Extended Squitter transmission rates and under what conditions such maximum transmission rates would be permitted. 

Note that the applicability of TC reporting is currently limited within RTCA DO-242A to air-to-air ranges of up to 40 NM within high density airspace as represented by the LA2020 scenario, and up to 90 NM in low density airspace.  RTCA DO-242A does note, however, that "the minimum range required may apply even in high interference environments, such as over-flight of high traffic density terminal areas." RTCA DO-242A also proposed increased reporting rates following a change in certain elements of the TC Reports.  The 1090 MHz ADS-B system could accommodate this by temporarily lowering the broadcast rate of lower priority messages.  This is supported by the message scheduling function defined in these MOPS.  However, the potential requirement for increased TC+0 reporting rates following a change in TC information is not specifically considered in the following performance analysis (i.e., only the nominal TC+0 reporting case is considered). 

## Case 1 â

The first case to be considered is that in which only the Basic TC+0 Message is being broadcast.  In this case it is assumed that the TC+0 Messages would be broadcast at the same rate as used for the Target State and Status Messages (i.e., 0.8 messages per second).  In order to support the ADS-B MASPS guidance for TC+0 Report updates at 
95% probability, the nominal required per message reception probability is described by the formula:  0.95 = 1 - (1-Pmessage)N  or rewriting for calculating the necessary per squitter reception probability:  Pmessage = 1 - (1 - 0.95)1/N   where N is the number of transmissions within the required received update interval.  The following table indicates the per message reception probability needed to satisfy the RTCA DO-242A guidance for the nominal air-to-air reporting of TC+0 information at ranges of 20, 40 and 90 NM. 

| TC+0 Report         | "Required" Message    |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Air-Air Range       |                       |
| Nominal Update Rate | Reception Probability |
| 20 NM               | 12 Seconds            |
| 40 NM               | 18 Seconds            |
| 90 NM               | 41 Seconds            |
|                     |                       |

In **Case 1**, the effective reporting rate for TC+0, in which only a Basic TC+0 Message is being broadcast, would be essentially the same as for TS Reports as described in Appendix P.  The estimated TC+0 reporting rate is summarized in the Table O-5 and Figures O-1, O-2 and O-3 for the LA2020 and low traffic density scenarios.  These performance estimates are for the case of Class A3 receiving systems.

## Case 2 â

For **Case 2**, the full TC+0 information set is split between a Basic and a Supplemental TC+0 Message and each message is broadcast at the rate of 0.8 messages per second. This case would only be possible if the allowed peak Extended Squitter broadcast rate were increased to 7 Extended Squitters per second or greater.  In order to support the ADS-B MASPS guidance for TC+0 Report updates at 95% probability the nominal required per message reception probability is described by the formula:  0.95 = [1 - (1-
Pmessage)N]2   or rewriting for calculating the necessary per squitter reception probability:  
Pmessage = 1 - [1- (0.95)1/2]1/N   where N is the number of transmissions within the required received update interval.  Table O-6 indicates the per message reception probability needed to satisfy the RTCA DO-242A guidance for the nominal air-to-air reporting of TC+0 information at ranges of 20, 40 and 90 NM. 

| TC+0 Report         | "Required" Message    |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Air-Air Range       |                       |
| Nominal Update Rate | Reception Probability |
| 20 NM               | 12 Seconds            |
| 40 NM               | 18 Seconds            |
| 90 NM               | 41 Seconds            |

In **Case 2**, the effective reporting rate for TC+0 information, in which both a Basic TC+0 
Message and a Supplemental TC+0 Message is being broadcast, the estimated TC+0 reporting rate is summarized in Table O-7 and Figure O-4, Figure O-5 and Figure O-5 for the LA2020 and the low traffic density scenarios for the case of Class A3 receiving systems.

## Case 3 â

For **Case 3**, it is assumed that both a TC+0 Basic and a TC+0 Supplemental Messages would be broadcast at 0.4 messages per second.  This would be the worst-case situation, in which the peak Extended Squitter transmission rate is limited to 6.2 squitters per second, where the aircraft is sending the full TC+0 information set and where the supplemental information could not be updated at a lower rate than the basic information. In order to support the ADS-B MASPS guidance for TC+0 Report updates at 95% 
probability, the nominal required per message reception probability is described by the formula:  0.95 = [1 - (1-Pmessage)N]2   or rewriting for calculating the necessary per squitter reception probability:  Pmessage = 1 - [1- (0.95)1/2]1/N   where N is the number of transmissions within the required received update interval.  The Table O-8 indicates the per message reception probability needed to satisfy the RTCA DO-242A guidance for the nominal air-to-air reporting of TC+0 information at ranges of 20, 40 and 90 NM. 

| TC+0 Report         | "Required" Message    |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Air-Air Range       |                       |
| Nominal Update Rate | Reception Probability |
| 20 NM               | 12 Seconds            |

| 90 NM               | 41 Seconds            |

In **Case 3**, the effective reporting rate for TC+0, in which both a Basic TC+0 Message and a Supplemental TC+0 Message is being broadcast, and the broadcast rate for each is 0.4 messages per second, the estimated TC+0 reporting rate is summarized in Table O-9 and Figure O-7, Figure O-8 and Figure O-9 for the LA2020 and the low traffic density scenarios for the case of Class A3 receiving systems.

## O.5.2 Tc+1 Performance Estimate

The broadcast of TC+1 information in support of an air-to-air application should only be considered on 1090 MHz if the allowed peak Extended Squitter rate is increased above the current RTCA MOPS and ICAO SARPs limit of 6.2 squitters per second.  If the limit were increased to the order of 8 to 8.6 squitters per second then the performance for TC+1 reporting would be similar to that described above in Â§O.5.1 for **Case 1** and Case 
2.  However, in order to limit channel loading and in order to gain ICAO acceptance for an increase in the peak allowed squitter rate, the transmission of TC+1 Messages might need to be limited to operations above a fixed altitude threshold, such as only in high altitude en route airspace where airborne flight path de-confliction might be operationally authorized. 

## O.6 Other Factors And Issues

The performance estimates presented above in Â§O.5 address only the air-to-air reception of TC information.  It is possible that the primary needs for TC information are not best served by the exclusive use of ADS-B as the delivery mechanism and/or are not best offered as an air-to-air service.  For example, this could be the case with high density terminal environments where the responsibility for aircraft separation will remain the responsibility of the ATC controller and supported by the ground automation tools.  For this case, addressed Mode S services may be a technically superior method for the ground ATC automation system to obtain the aircraft's intent information.  Once the intent information is obtained by the ground ATC automation and used by the ground decision support tools, it may be appropriate to employ an addressed (or broadcast) ground-to-air communications service to provide airborne applications with the information they to achieve conflict free flight paths.   
The air-to-ground performance for 1090 MHz Extended Squitter is substantially better than for the air-to-air case.  This is a consequence of the use of substantially higher gain antennas at the ground stations and the ground station receivers are subjected to substantially lower levels of co-channel interference (i.e., fruit) as a result of Earth curvature and other line-of-sight obstructions.  Also ground stations equipped with sector antennas are expected to achieve further improvements improved signal strength and reduced interference levels.  Furthermore, the networking of multiple ground stations can provide a more robust service with higher effective update rates.  The rate at which TC 
information is broadcast may need to be tailored to satisfy the most important of the operational needs.  This could imply that the broadcast rate, and perhaps the information contents of TC Messages, be varied depending on the operational environment in which the aircraft is operating.  A simple example would be to include an altitude dependency on the types of intent information being broadcast (e.g., TC+1 only broadcast above a fixed altitude). 

## O.7 Conclusions

The predicted performance for the reception of Trajectory Change information on 1090 MHz ADS-B is expected to well exceed the RTCA DO-242A, Appendix N, guidance on TC+0 Report update rates in low density environments where air-to-air ranges in excess of 100 NM are possible. For the future LA2020 high density scenario the two simulation models employed for this assessment have produced similar results.  Both sets of simulation results indicate that for Class A3 receivers receiving broadcasts from Class A3 transmitters it may be possible to satisfy the ADS-B MASPS guidance for TC+0 reporting at air-to-air ranges of approximately 40 to 50 NM if only TC Basic messages are being transmitted as described in Case 1.  The performance for all three (3) Cases are summarized in Table O-10.  At longer air-to-air ranges the effective update rate for TC+0 Reports would fall below the ADS-B MASPS guidance, but may prove usable for certain applications at ranges up to 60 NM where TC+0 updates rates of less than 40 seconds may be practical. The performance for the reception of TC broadcasts from Class A2 systems being received by Class A3 systems is predicted to fall short of the ADS-B MASPS guidance in the case of the LA2020-[24k] scenario.  For the case the ADS-B MASPS guidance on TC 
Report rates is predicted to be satisfied at air-to-air ranges to on the order of 20 to 30 NM if only TC Basic messages are being transmitted as described in Case 1.  The performance for all three (3) Cases are summarized in Table O-10.  However, beyond 30 NM the TC reporting rates may prove to be useful to certain applications at ranges of perhaps up to 40 NM where a TC Report update rate of less than 30 seconds may be possible. However, in order to support such air-to-air ranges in the LA2020-[24k] scenario, and also to support the TC Report complete set of parameters defined in RTCA DO-242A, the peak transmission rate for Extended Squitters would need to be increased above the currently allowed maximum of 6.2 squitters per second.  Support for TC+1 would also require an increase in the maximum rate allowed for Extended Squitter transmission.   
For the case of an enroute aircraft directly over-flying LAX, the duration of time in which the air-to-air performance would be limited to the above ranges is perhaps 5 
minutes or less.  This is a consequence of the simulation models only considering the case in which the receiving aircraft is in the worst-case interference environment (i.e. 

near LAX).  Experience from the 1090 MHz data collection conducted by the FAA in 1999 suggests that the 1090 MHz interference levels peak in the immediate vicinity of LAX and decrease away from this area. It must be noted that the above analysis and conclusions are based on the air-to-air delivery of TC information in support of airborne based applications.  In certain operational environments it may be more appropriate to focus on the air-to-ground delivery of TC information in support of ground-based ATC automation tools, rather than in support of airborne based applications.  It is expected that for the air-to-ground delivery of TC Messages, the desired update rates could be achieved using the 1090 MHz ADS-B system within a future high density environment, such as represented by the LA2020 scenario.

## P 1090 Mhz System Performance Simulation Results P.1 Introduction

The air-to-air performance of 1090 MHz Extended Squitter (1090 ES) has been evaluated, as described in this Appendix.  Two detailed evaluations were carried out using different techniques, although the air traffic scenarios evaluated were the same. The results from the two evaluations are relatively close and tend to support each other. One evaluation was carried out by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), and is described in Section P.2.  The other evaluation was performed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory (LL), and is described in Section P.3.  In both cases, the evaluations were applied to the Los Angeles Basin High Density (LA) scenario and the Low Density scenario defined in the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A).  This scenario is a future estimate derived by applying a growth factor of 1.5 to measured values.  For the LA scenario, two cases were considered.  In order to represent two potential worstcase interference environments, a nominal case with Mode A/C FRUIT rate of 24000 per second, herein referenced as "LA-[24k]," and a more severe case of 30000 Mode A/C 
FRUIT per second, herein referenced as "LA-[30k]."  These scenarios are intended to represent the worst-case location for ADS-B reception within the LA Basin. 

In other respects, very similar or identical models were used in the two evaluations. 

ï§ 
Aircraft Antenna Gain.  The Technical Link Assessment Team (TLAT) model for 
aircraft antenna gain was used in both evaluations.  This model, which is documented 
in Reference P-1, includes a function giving antenna gain vs. elevation angle, and 
also includes a statistical component, which has a defined distribution.  The statistical distribution has a bell-shaped curve, skewed slightly toward negative values. 
ï§ 
Transmitter Power
.  The following statistical models were used in both evaluations.  
For class A0, power referred to the antenna is uniformly distributed between 48.5 and 
51.5 dBm.  For class A1 and class A2, power referred to the antenna input is uniformly distributed between 51 and 54 dBm.  For class A3, power referred to the antenna is uniformly distributed between 53 and 56 dBm. 
ï§ 
Receiver MTL
.  Receiver MTL was treated as a constant in both evaluations, and was 
set to the worst-case value permitted by these MOPS. 
ï§ 
Fruit rates
.  Steps were taken to match the FRUIT rate models in the two evaluations.  
This was done by beginning with the APL model, running the part of the evaluation whose output is FRUIT rate and power distribution, shown separately for Mode A/C 
FRUIT and Mode S FRUIT.  These curves were then used as inputs to the LL 
evaluation.  The LL evaluation was performed under FRUIT conditions matched to 
the APL FRUIT rate results. 
Analytical models and detailed simulations of data links operating in future scenarios are necessary to assess expected capabilities in stressed circumstances.  Accurately modeling future capabilities for potential system designs in a fair way, however, is challenging. Since validation of simulation results in future environments is unrealistic, other means of verification such as the following are required.  System characteristics represented in these simulations should agree with actual measurements on components of the proposed design, e.g., bench measurements on prototype equipment and calibrated flight test data should be used, when possible, for the receiver/decoder capabilities and as comparison with modeled link budgets.  Similarly, suitable interference models help to support estimates of how these conditions may change in future scenarios.  Credibility of any simulation results for future scenarios also requires that they be able to model current conditions and provide results that appropriately agree with measurements made under these conditions.  Existing tools have been used as crosschecks where possible for the final detailed simulations and models.  The differences between the results of the two evaluations are not surprising, given the above considerations and the different simulation approaches. 

## P.2 Performance Evaluation By Apl

This section presents the evaluation of 1090 ES performance by APL, using the simulation models and techniques discussed below. 

## P.2.1 1090 Extended Squitter Detailed Simulation Features And Methodology

The APL 1090 ES detailed simulation is written in C and allows for horizontal, constantvelocity motion of the aircraft in the scenario.  The simulation reads in the inputs specifying the particular case to be run (including a co-channel interference environment file produced by the Volpe/TASC simulator cited as Reference P-2), generates all of the ADS-B transmissions and additional interference for 300 seconds, calculates signal levels and times of arrival for each of these transmissions, and determines the corresponding message error rates for each ADS-B transmission at the individual times of arrival by all aircraft within line of sight of the victim receiver.  This information is then written to an output file, one entry line for each ADS-B transmission, which is then analyzed by postsimulation software.  A number of the real-world effects included in the simulation are discussed in Section P.2.1.1.  Section P.2.1.2 will describe the post-simulation processing of the data. 

## P.2.1.1 1090 Es Detailed Simulation Features

This section describes some of the features of the 1090 ES detailed simulation: 

- 
Propagation and other losses.
  The 1090 ES simulation calculates the free-space 
propagation loss for each transmission, using the range between transmitter and receiver at the time of transmission.  There is also a receiver cable loss of 3 dB incorporated in the calculation.  An optional transmit cable loss is also included in the simulation, but since the transmit powers have been defined at the antenna, the transmit cable loss has been set to zero for this study. 
- 
Antenna gains.  The antenna gain model used here was that specified in the TLAT 
Report [Reference P-1]. 
- 
Propagation delays.
  The propagation delay incurred by the signal in traversing the 
free space between transmitter and receiver has been included in the 1090 ES simulation. 
- 
Co-channel interference.  The 1090 ES transmissions co-exist with transmissions 
from other sources at the same frequency, such as Mode A/C, Mode S, and TCAS replies.  These transmissions are responses to interrogations originating from ground interrogators and, in the case of TCAS, other aircraft.  The ground interrogator 
environment is described in the TLAT report [Reference P-1].  All A2 and A3 
aircraft are assumed to be equipped with TCAS, for a total of 40% of all aircraft in the LA- scenario.  The cases evaluated had no loading of the channel due to Mode S 
air-ground data link.  Several different estimates of the co-channel interference environment were examined for the high-density LA scenario: 

ï 24000 Mode A/C, 2500 Mode S at levels greater than â84 dBm ï 30000 Mode A/C, 3600 Mode S at levels greater than â84 dBm 
 
For the low density scenario, a rate of 5000 Mode A/C was used. 
- 
Co-site interference.
  Co-site transmissions of 1090 ES messages, DME 
interrogations, Mode S interrogations and replies, whisper-shout interrogations, and Mode A/C replies are all modeled as interference in the 1090 ES simulation.  All of 
these are treated as "self-interference," and it is assumed that no 1090 ES reception 
may occur during any of these co-site transmissions (including a 15 microsecond "ramp-down" period added to the end of each co-site transmission).  (See RTCA DO- 282 for more detailed explanation of the co-site interference environment.) 
- 
Multiple interference sources.
  The arrivals of 1090 ES messages at the victim 
receiver is a random process, due to the random nature of the transmissions and the propagation delays.  There may be a number of messages and other interfering signals (e.g., Mode A/C) overlapping one another, and these overlaps will be for variable amounts of time.  This interference is accounted for in the multi-aircraft 
simulation.  Multiple interferers are treated in the receiver performance model by combining their interference levels in a way consistent with bench test measurements. The simultaneous presence of 1090 ES interference, co-channel interference, and 
self-interference is treated in a detailed fashion by the model. 
- 
Alternating transmissions.
  The model simulates the alternating transmission 
sequence between top and bottom antennas as specified for A1, A2, and A3 equipage.  For A0 equipage, the model simulates transmission from a top antenna. 
- 
Receiver diversity.
  For A1, A2, and A3 equipage, the model simulates receiver 
diversity by calculating the message error rate at both the top and bottom receive antennas and calculating the joint reception probability.  For A0-equipped aircraft, reception is only permitted from a top antenna. 
- 
Transmit power variability.
  The transmit power specified at the antenna of an aircraft 
is chosen from a uniform distribution given by the limits specified by the authors of 
these MOPS for the aircraft equipage.  For this analysis the ranges used were: 
ï A3:  
53-56 dBm 

ï A2/A1:  
51-54 dBm 
ï A0:  
48.5-51.5 dBm 

be produced and deployed.  It should be noted, however, that these MOPS 
allow for larger ranges of transmit powers and include, for example, the possibility of an A3 transmit power as low as 51 dBm. 

- 
Receiver re-triggering.  The 1090 ES simulation checks each individual ADS-B 
message arriving at the victim receiver for its message error rate.  This procedure amounts to allowing for re-triggering in the receiver, i.e. the potential for the receiver 
to switch from receiving a message to a stronger message signal that arrives after the start of the reception of the first message. 

- 
Receiver performance model.
  The receiver performance model used in the 1090 ES 
simulation is based on experimental data collected on 1090 receivers that were provided for that purpose.  The measurement data for these receivers were modified by simulation results provided by MIT Lincoln Laboratories (LL) and the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center (FAATC).  These simulation results were designed to emulate the enhanced decoding techniques, which have been incorporated as performance requirements for 1090 ES equipment.  The development of the receiver performance model is described in Section 2 of this Appendix.  The assumed sensitivity of the receiver is different for the different equipage classes, -84 dBm for class A3 and -79 dBm for A2/A1 equipage.  This represents the signal level at which 90% of the messages are received correctly in the absence of interference.  
This parameter was validated in the simulation by examination of the signal vs. 
message error rate in the absence of interference.  However, because the MOPS requirement of 15% message success at â87 dBm for A3 equipage is a more severe constraint, the effective MTL required is around â85.5 dBm for A3 aircraft.  This is the value that was used in this analysis.  The A1 equipage class receiver does not require the enhanced decoding techniques, so a different receiver performance model was used to evaluate A1 performance. 
- 
Message transmission frequency and content.
  Section 2.2.3 defines the types of 
messages, their content, and the frequency of messages transmitted for each category of aircraft equipage.  This is modeled in detail by the 1090 ES simulation. 

## P.2.1.2 Calculation Of The Performance Metrics

The result of the 1090 ES detailed simulation is a file containing time-ordered information about each ADS-B squitter transmitted by every aircraft within line-of-sight of the victim receiver during the 300-second duration of the simulation.  The main elements of information for each individual squitter include squitter type (information content) and the probabilities of reception on each of the top and bottom receive antennas.  Each squitter will have individual reception probabilities which depend not only on signal level at each receive antenna at that time, but also on the interference environment at each of the antennas during the arrival of the squitter. For each transmitting aircraft in a range bin of width ten nautical miles, the time-ordered sequence of squitters is then examined, and, using Monte Carlo techniques and the reception probabilities at each of the antennas, it is determined which of that transmit aircraft's squitters are successfully decoded by the receiver during the 300-second interval.  From these successes, the State Vector update times are determined by computing the time difference between arrivals of successive squitters containing either position or velocity information.  These update times are then ordered, and the 95th percentile value is then chosen.  This value represents the 95th percentile update time for that particular transmitting aircraft.  This procedure is then followed for each transmitting aircraft, resulting in a 95th percentile update time for each aircraft. 

All of the 95
th percentile update times for all of the aircraft in each range bin are then ordered, and the 95th percentile of these update times is selected for the 95-95 State Vector update time.  Thus, 95% of the aircraft in each range bin will have a 95% State Vector update time that is better than the 95-95 value for that bin. 

The same procedure is then followed for the messages supporting Target State (TS) Reports, to determine the 95-95 update time for that type of message.  The results of this analysis are presented in Sections P.2.3.2 and P.2.4.2 below, and results and conclusions are presented in Section P.2.5. 

## P.2.2 Receiver Performance Model P.2.2.1 Background

In order to develop a receiver performance model for 1090 Extended Squitter (ES) to be used for the Technical Link Assessment Team (TLAT) ADS-B data link evaluation, bench test measurements of the Message Error Rate (MER) receive performance were made on an available 1090 ES receiver, which included a number of features of enhanced decoding.  Development of this receiver performance model is described in the TLAT Report Appendix I.  Subsequent to publication of the TLAT Report in April, 2001, the results of these measurements, compared with flight test measurements, led to the judgment that this receiver implemented a multi-sample technique that was not as effective at decoding 1090 ES messages as the multi-sampling technique incorporated in these MOPS.  Thus, although some features of enhanced decoding were implemented in the tested receiver, it was felt that better performance could be achieved through modification of the decoding processing.  For A2 and A3 category aircraft, these MOPS require performance equivalent to that achieved by the multi-sample techniques. Therefore, the receiver performance model was adapted to reflect those requirements. 

## P.2.2.2 Modifications To The Receiver Performance Model

The FAATC and LL developed and implemented simulations to predict 1090 ES receiver performance using enhanced decoding techniques, including multi-sampling.  Several cases of Mode A/C interference were investigated, which led to detailed results for these cases being available for comparison with the predictions of the receiver performance model.  The model was adjusted to account for these cases, resulting in a "modified receiver performance model." 
This modified receiver performance model was discovered to produce optimistic predictions in high-density environments, when compared with the overall results of the FAATC and LL predictions in these environments.  It is not surprising that the results, which were based on a very small sample of the interference space, should differ from what is produced when extrapolated to and averaged over the entire high-density interference space.  It was decided that it is more important to reflect the overall effects of the entire interference environment than to exactly replicate the few individual cases upon which the revised model was based. 

The methodology adopted for this second modification of the receiver performance model was to "map" the model results to be consistent with the simulation results of the FAATC or LL, as appropriate.  FAATC results were achieved by feeding video signals into a 1090 ES receiver front end and performing non-real-time software processing to determine message reception in a simulated high-density Mode A/C environment.  The results were presented as the total message success probability as a function of the received desired signal level for the total Mode A/C interference environment.  Individual cases were not identified, so a message success probability for a given signal level represents the averaging done over many different individual interference situations which characterize the entire interference environment. 

For the A2 receiver, LL results were achieved by software simulation of signals and highdensity interference (including phase and frequency fluctuations) and performing pulseby-pulse non-real-time analysis to determine message reception.  Again, as for the A3 results from the FAATC, the A2 results from LL (see Figure P-19) were presented as the total message success probability as a function of the received desired signal level for the total interference environment. 

When compared to the results from the FAATC and LL simulations, which sampled the entire interference environment, the receiver performance model was found to be overly optimistic in its predictions of performance.  In order to compensate for this bias, the receiver performance model was "mapped" separately to conform to the results of each of the two simulations, as illustrated for an A3 receiver in a 30000 Mode A/C FRUIT 
environment shown in Figure P-1 below.  This mapping was done separately to adjust the receiver performance model to the various interference levels and receiver sensitivities. 

 
Each of the various mappings (corresponding to scenario, FRUIT level, and multisampling type) was used for the appropriate receiver case.  For example, to evaluate Class A3 performance in the 24000 Mode A/C LA scenario, the receiver performance model was mapped to match the FAATC results for the 10 MHz sampling rate enhanced decoder for this FRUIT rate. 

## P.2.3 Los Angeles Basin High Density (La) P.2.3.1 La Scenario Description

This scenario is based on the LA Basin 1999 maximum estimate.  It is assumed that air traffic in this area would increase by a few percent each year until it would be 50 % higher than in 1999.  The distribution of aircraft in the scenario is based on approximations of measured altitude and range density distributions. 

The following assumptions are made for the airborne and ground aircraft, and ground vehicles for the LA Basin  scenario: 

- 
The density of airborne aircraft is taken to be: 
ï§ 
Constant in range from the center of the area out to 225 nautical miles (5.25 
aircraft/NM), (i.e., the inner circle of radius one NM would contain 
approximately five aircraft, as would the ring from 224 to 225 NM) and 
ï§ 
Constant in area from 225 NM to 400 NM (.00375 aircraft/NM2
). 
- 
There are assumed to be a fixed number of aircraft on the ground (within a circle of 
radius 5 NM at each airport), divided among LAX, San Diego, Long Beach, and five other small airports, totaling 225 aircraft.  Half of the aircraft at each airport were assumed to be moving at 15 knots, while the other half were stationary.  In addition, a total of 50 ground vehicles are distributed at these airports as well. 
- 
The altitude distribution of the airborne aircraft is assumed to be exponential, with a mean altitude of 5500 feet.  This distribution is assumed to apply over the entire area. 
- 
The airborne aircraft are assumed to have the following average velocities, determined by their altitude.  The aircraft velocities for aircraft below 25000 feet are uniformly distributed over a band of average velocity Â±30 percent. 
ï§ 
0 - 3000 feet altitude 
130 knots 

ï§ 
3000 - 10000 ft  
200 knots 
ï§ 
10000 - 25000 ft 
300 knots 
ï§ 
25000 - up 
 
450 knots 

- 
The aircraft are all assumed to be moving in random directions. 
- 
In the LA scenario, ADS-B equipage Class A0 aircraft are assumed to fly below 
18000 feet.  All other aircraft are assumed to be capable of flying at any altitude.  The aircraft in the LA scenario are assumed to be in the following proportions: 
ï§ 
A3 
30% 
ï§ 
A2 
10% 
ï§ 
A1 
40% 
ï§ 
A0 
20% 
The scenario for the LA high density case contains a total of 2694 aircraft: 1180 within the core area of 225 NM, 1289 between 225-400 NM, and 225 on the ground.  This represents a scaling of the estimated maximum 1999 LA Basin levels upward by 50 percent.  Of these aircraft, 471 lie within 60 NM of the center.  (This includes aircraft on the ground.)  Around ten percent of the total number of aircraft are above 10000 ft in altitude, and more than half of the aircraft are located in the outer (non-core) area of the scenario. An attempt was made to at least partially account for the expected lower aircraft density over the ocean.  In the third quadrant (between 180 degrees and 270 degrees), for distances greater than 100 NM from the center of the scenario, the density of aircraft is reduced to 25 % of the nominal value used.  The other 75% of aircraft that would have been placed in this area are distributed uniformly among the other three quadrants at the same range from the center.  This results in relative densities of 1:5 between the third quadrant and the others. 

## P.2.3.2 La Results And Analysis

The ADS-B MASPS requirements for ADS-B air-to-air surveillance range and report update interval are used to assess how each ADS-B link performs in relation to the free flight operational enhancements identified by the RTCA Safe Flight 21 Steering Committee.  These requirements specify the minimum range for acquisition of the State Vector, Mode Status and Target State Reports where applicable, as well as the maximum update periods allowed for this information (See ADS-B MASPS, RTCA DO-242A).  
These air/air criteria specify ranges, use of short-term intent information (TS Reports), and update times.  The projected Trajectory Change (TC) long-term intent reporting capabilities of 1090 ES are described in Appendix O of these MOPS. Results are presented as a series of plots of 95% update times as a function of range for State Vector updates and intent updates, where applicable.  The 95% time means that at the range specified, 95% of aircraft pairs will achieve a 95% update rate at least equal to that shown.  The 95-95 metric was calculated by placing the aircraft in range bins of ten (10) NM width and plotted in the form of histograms.  The ADS-B MASPS requirements are also included on the plots for reference.  Since the transmit power and receiver configuration are defined for each aircraft equipage class, performance is shown separately for each combination of transmit-receive pair types for A2 and A3 class equipment.  Results are shown in Figure P-2 through Figure P-13 and conclusions are presented below.  Note that, due to unavailability of receiver performance results for A2 
in the 30000/second Mode A/C environment, results for A2 are presented only for the 24000/second case.  The ADS-B MASPS requirements for State Vector, and projected requirements for TS Report updates are also shown on the plots.  Performance in compliance with MASPS requirements is indicated by results that are below the MASPS line.  


The results for LA shown in Figure P-2 through Figure P-13 are summarized in Table P-
1.  The values in the table are determined from the histograms by looking at the bars in the ten-mile bins and using the upper range for the last bin that is under the requirement line.  For example, in Figure P-13 above, the ten-mile bar from 10-20 NM is the last bin under the requirement line, so the range for the 95-95 metric for A2-to-A2 TSR updates is 20 NM.

## P.2.4 Low Density Scenario P.2.4.1 Low Density Scenario Description

In addition to the high-density LA scenario described above, a scenario was also run to represent low-density traffic levels.  This scenario, for simplicity, was developed by scaling the current LA Basin distributions downward by a factor of five, amounting to 360 total aircraft.  These aircraft are uniformly distributed in the horizontal plane within a circle of 400 nautical miles.  In the vertical direction, they are distributed uniformly between 25000 feet and 37000 feet.  The velocities are all set to 450 knots and are randomly distributed in azimuth.  All of the aircraft are assumed to be A3 equipped. 

## P.2.4.2 Low Density Results And Analysis

Results of the simulation runs for the low-density scenario are shown in Figure P-14 and Figure P-15, and conclusions are presented below.  The ADS-B MASPS requirements for State Vector and TSR updates are shown as black lines on the plots.  The ADS-B 
MASPS specify that the maximum ranges for air-air update rates required for A3 to 90 NM (120 NM desired), while the Eurocontrol criteria extend to 150 NM for A3. Performance in compliance with MASPS requirements is indicated by results that are below the black line. 

 
The results for the low-density scenario may be summarized as follows: 

- 
ADS-B MASPS air-air requirements and desired criteria are met for State Vector and 
TS Report updates at all ranges specified by the ADS-B MASPS for the low density scenario. 

## P.2.5 Results And Conclusions

This section summarizes the results of the APL simulation studies and states conclusions that may be drawn about expected 1090 ES performance in the scenarios considered. This summary will be presented in Section P.2.5.2.  Section P.2.5.1 will first point out a number of considerations that should be taken into account when interpreting the results. 

## P.2.5.1 Considerations

The following considerations should be noted when interpreting the results of this analysis: 

- 
The transmit power distribution for A3 transmitters, which was used for this analysis, 
was uniform from 53-56 dBm.  These MOPS allow for A3 transmitters to extend as low as 51 dBm.  This corresponds more closely to the transmit power distribution assumed for A2 class aircraft in this analysis; therefore, for a class A3 aircraft with a transmit power near the lower limit of the allowed range, it would be expected that performance would be given by A2 transmit results, rather than A3. 
- 
The receiver performance model that was used for this analysis was based on nonreal-time simulation results provided by the FAATC and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Several manufacturer representatives have indicated that they felt that performance equivalent to that required by these MOPS was achievable.  Still, there has been no 
testing of performance on MOPS-compliant equipment, and until this is done the 
receiver performance model has not been validated and remains hypothetical.  In addition, the receiver performance model thus derived was designed to match the average performance predicted by the simulation results discussed above.  This was necessary due to time and resources constraints and may add some additional uncertainty to the results. 
- 
The results of this study should not be directly compared with any analysis not described in this Appendix, without taking into account differences in assumptions and analysis techniques.  For example, the 1090 ES analysis in the TLAT report 
[Reference P-1] assumed different transmit power distributions, receiver decode 
performance, and Mode A/C interference levels, so it is not surprising that the results of that study differ from those reported here. 
- 
Finally, in evaluating expected performance through the use of simulations, it is important to be aware of the inherent uncertainties in results due to the indeterminate nature of the assumptions, as well as the uncertainties in the modeling process itself. This is true for performance predictions resulting from any type of simulation technique.  For example, in this analysis it was assumed that the number of aircraft in the LA Basin would increase by 50%, that most aircraft would be Mode S equipped, that a number of TCAS improvements would be universally deployed, and that the A3 transmit power would be as described above.  These assumptions all include associated uncertainty; modifying any of the assumptions could result in a change in predicted performance. 

## P.2.5.2 Summary

Keeping in mind the conditions described in the previous section, the performance of 1090 Extended Squitter in the two scenarios examined may be summarized as follows: 

- 
In the LA high density air traffic scenario, this analysis concludes that A3 aircraft should be capable of participating with other A3 aircraft in the applications defined in RTCA DO-242A which require State Vector and TS Report for ranges up to and including 40 NM.  For applications that require State Vector only, the range is extended to 60-70 NM, depending on the interference environment.   
- 
In the low density air traffic scenario, this analysis concludes that A3 aircraft should be capable of participating with other A3 aircraft in the applications defined in RTCA DO-242A which require State Vector and TS Report for all required and desired ranges.   
- 
In the LA-[24k] (24000 Mode A/C) high density air traffic scenario, this analysis concludes that A3 aircraft should be capable of participating with A2 aircraft in the applications defined in RTCA DO-242A which require State Vector only for ranges up to and including 40 NM.  The exchange of TS Report information is limited to 20 NM between A2 and A3 equipage aircraft.   
- 
In the LA-[24k] (24000 Mode A/C) high density air traffic scenario, this analysis 
concludes that A2 aircraft should be capable of participating with A2 aircraft in the applications defined in RTCA DO-242A which require State Vector only for ranges 
up to and including 30 NM.  The exchange of TS Report information is limited to 20 NM between A2 equipage aircraft.   

- 
Neither A1 nor A0 equipage was evaluated for this analysis. 
This analysis has not evaluated the effect of transmitting more detailed intent information, such as TCRs.  Future revisions of these MOPS should consider modifying the transmit power requirement for A3 equipage, so that the minimum power corresponds to that assumed in this analysis.  In addition, improved A2 performance could be achieved by modifying either or both of the MTL requirement and the enhanced decoding techniques used. 

## P.3 Performance Evaluation By Mit Lincoln Laboratory

MIT Lincoln Laboratory employed two simulation tools to determine ADS-B reception performance as a function of range for the LA (as defined in Â§P.2.3.1) and low density scenarios.  The first tool is a pulse-level simulation, whose output gives the probability of correct reception of an Extended Squitter signal as a function of received signal power level.  The second tool is a track-level simulation, whose input is the per-squitter reception probability from the pulse-level simulation, and whose output gives the performance over a time period, such as 12 seconds.  When applied to long-range air-toair surveillance, this simulation can be used to determine the maximum range at which 95 percent or more of the targets are being received sufficiently reliably to be in track and being updated regularly as required by the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A). 

## P.3.1 Pulse Level Simulation

The pulse-level simulation generates a sample-by-sample received Extended Squitter signal in the presence of interference, consisting of Mode A/C FRUIT and Mode S 
replies and squitters, in both long and short formats.  When used in this study, the interfering reception rates and power distributions were selected to match the interference environment in Los Angeles in two cases and the low density environment in the other. The interference rates and power distributions are described below. 

## P.3.1.1 Formulation Of The Pulse-Level Simulation

This simulation was originally created for developing enhanced reception techniques for Extended Squitter.  The simulation represents signals and interference as 1090 MHz radio frequency waveforms having amplitude and phase, so that destructive and constructive summation is represented.  Each transponder is assigned a specific carrier frequency, which need not be exactly 1090 MHz.  The frequency offsets were random, uniformly distributed over +/-1 MHz in this study.  Minor pulse width deviations were also incorporated in this study.  All pulses have rise times and fall times that correspond to the effects of both transmitter and receiver.  The simulation can be run using different values of receiver bandwidth.  Bandwidth was set equal to 8 MHz in this study.  In addition to the received interference, the simulation also includes receiver noise, whose power was - 100.7 dBm referred to the antenna in this study. 

The received waveform, which is a sum of the Extended Squitter signal and all overlapping interference plus noise, is then converted to a log video waveform, which is sampled at a steady rate.  These steps are illustrated in Figure P-16.  The simulation can be run at a sampling rate of 8 samples per microsecond or 10 samples per microsecond.  
The rate of 8 per microseconds was used in this evaluation.  The log video samples are then processed using the enhanced reception techniques.  These techniques include an improved form of preamble detection, the 4-4 table method of declaring the 112 bits and associated confidence bits, and the error detection/correction technique called "Brute Force, n=5". 

8 samples per 
microsec.

To generate reception probability as a function of received power level, the process is as follows.  The user assigns a total number of aircraft (1000 aircraft for example) and provides a range distribution.  The simulation generates the ranges of these aircraft using a pseudo-random process, following the given range distribution.  Then for each aircraft, the nominal value of received power level is calculated using the following formula: 
Nom. Received power (dBm at antenna) = -83.5 - 20 log10(range/100 NM) 
The next step is to apply a random power deviation to account for both transmitter power differences from aircraft to aircraft and antenna gain effects.  The user also assigns a transmission rate for each of the three types of signals.  The simulation is run for a fixed time period set by the user, typically 10 seconds.  For each transmitting aircraft, the transmissions are made random in time, uniformly distributed over the run time.  The reception times are modeled as a Poisson process, having a constant average reception rate for each of the three types of signals. These particular assignments of nominal power and power deviations are used only in the pulse-level simulation, and only for the purpose of generating a FRUIT distribution appropriate for the environment being studied. 

As each Extended Squitter is received, it is processed to determine whether the 112 bit message is correctly received, including the effects of error detection/correction.  All such receptions, whether correct or not, are saved in bins according to the received power level.  Five-dB bins were used in this study.  After the full run, which includes several thousand reception opportunities in each of the major bins of interest, the number of correct receptions in compared with the total number of opportunities.  The probability of correct reception is computed as the ratio: 
Probability of correct reception = (no. of correct receptions)/(no. of opportunities) 

## P.3.1.2 Interference Rates And Power Distribution

In running the pulse-level simulation for the Los Angeles environments, it was necessary to specify the rates and power distributions of the interfering signals.  For Los Angeles, this was done based on results from airborne measurements in the LA Basin in 1999 and on results from the Volpe simulation [Reference P-3].  It was found that the power distribution of Mode A/C FRUIT from the LA Volpe simulation agrees with the airborne measurements above â75 dBm, except being higher in FRUIT rate, which would be expected because of the future higher aircraft densities.  The Volpe results were then used to provide the FRUIT-rate input to the Lincoln Laboratory pulse-level simulation.  Figure P-17 shows the Mode A/C and Mode S FRUIT rates and power distributions used as inputs for this study.  This applies to a scenario called "LA-[24k]," in which the receiving aircraft is located near LAX airport at 40000 feet altitude.  Mode S interference is characterized by short Mode S transmissions from each aircraft at a rate of 6 per second, and long Mode S transmission at a rate of 5.4 per second.  The total Mode A/C FRUIT rate when referred to a power level of -84 dBm at antenna is 24000 FRUIT per second, for bottom antenna receptions.  For top antenna receptions the corresponding FRUIT rate is 18000 FRUIT per second. 


## P.3.1.3 Pulse-Level Simulation Results For A3 To A3

The pulse-level simulation was run for the LA scenario with two different cases of FRUIT levels representing different interference environments for future higher aircraft densities.  The first case called "LA-[24k]" has 24000 Mode A/C FRUIT per second, as described above.  The second, more severe case, called "LA-[30K]," has 30000 Mode A/C FRUIT per second, with the same Mode S interference as in LA-[24k].  The pulselevel simulation results are shown in Figure P-18 for Air-to-Air performance of A3 to A3. 

## P.3.1.4 Pulse-Level Simulation Results For A2

The pulse-level simulation is used to determine reception probability as a function of received signal power level.  The simulation results, plotted in Figure P-19, show a comparison between MTL = -79 dBm (Class A2) and MTL = -84 dBm (Class A3), for the LA-[24k] environment. 

 
The results indicate that the only significant effect is near MTL.  Class A2 reception probability is reduced in the vicinity of the MTL power level, and otherwise nearly the same as for Class A3.  A curve fit was applied to the data in Figure P-19, for use in the Track-Level Simulations and is shown in Figure P-20. 

## P.3.2 Track-Level Simulation

After the pulse-level simulation has generated results in the form of reception probability as a function of received signal power, the track-level simulation can be used to determine system performance. 

## P.3.2.1 Formulation Of The Track-Level Simulation

The track-level simulation is formulated using a Monte Carlo technique in which one run represents one pair of aircraft at a given air-to-air range.  In each run, pseudo random variables are used to generate the antenna gain values and the transmitter power for that particular transmitting aircraft. The TLAT model is used for the statistical variation of aircraft antenna gains.  The scenario considered in these runs applies to altitudes that are nearly the same, and for which the antenna vertical patterns are not used.  Altitude differences were studied separately, as described below. After being generated at random, the antenna gain values are held constant for that particular pair of aircraft.  The cases being addressed in this study apply to antenna diversity on both the transmitting and the receiving aircraft.  Therefore each aircraft pair has four antenna gain values.  These four values are generated independently in the simulation.  Transmitter power is generated at random using a given distribution.  For a Class A3 aircraft, is modeled as uniformly distributed over 53 to 56 dBm referred to the antenna. 

The simulation is run for a particular air-to-air range.  Using the transmitter power and the four antenna gains, the four values of received power are calculated (top-to-top, topto-bottom, bottom-to-top, and bottom-to-bottom).  For each case the probability curve 
(from the pulse-level simulation) is then used to determine the reception probability for that particular antenna combination. 

Receiver blanking caused by co-site interference is included at this point.  The values of reception probability calculated as above are now multiplied by 0.93 to account for these effects. To account for receiving antenna diversity, the probability of correct reception is calculated using the following formula: 

$$\mathrm{Prob}(\mathrm{correct})=\mathrm{Maximum}[\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{top})\;,\;\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{bot})]$$
where **P(top)** and **P(bot)** are the reception probabilities for top only and bottom only.  In other words, only the better of the two receiving antennas is used; the other does not contribute to performance. Subsequently, to account for transmitting antenna diversity, the reception probability is calculated separately for top-transmit and bottom-transmit, and then these two values are averaged.  This averaging is based on the fact that each antenna transmits 50 percent of the squitters. This process yields the value of reception probability for a particular pair of aircraft.  The process is repeated for a large number of aircraft pairs (1000 pairs).  Performance for the 95th percentile pair is determined by sorting the 1000 values and identifying the value that is exceeded by 95% of the population.  This result gives the 95-percentile reception probability for the range being considered.  Repeating the process for different ranges provides system performance as a function of range. 

## P.3.2.2 Track-Level Simulation Results For A3-To-A3

For the LA-[24k] scenario, both the pulse-level simulation and the track-level simulation were run, yielding the results given in Table P-2, and shown in Figure P-21 and Figure P-
22. 

| RANGE    | Prob (95)             |

| 20       | 0.429                 |
| 30       | 0.272                 |
| 40       | 0.185                 |
| 50       | 0.130                 |

| 100      | 0.045                 |

 
The results in Figure P-22, showing State Vector update time, were generated from the probability values as follows.    In a time T, the number of reception opportunities is: 

$$\mathbf{N}=\mathbf{T}\ /\ 0.25\ \mathrm{seconds}.$$
Given the reception probability from the pulse-level simulation, the probability of correct reception during the time T is therefore: 

$$\mathrm{P(recept.~in~T)=1~-\left(1~-p1\right)^{N}}$$
where p1 is the single-squitter reception probability.  Requiring 95% reception in time T, or **P(recep. in T) = 0.95**, the solution for time T is: 

$$\mathrm{T95=0.25\ *\ln(0.05)\ /\ln(1\ -\ p1)}$$
This calculation is made for each pair of aircraft among 1000 pairs.  The results are sorted, in order to determine the T95 value for which performance is as good or better for 95% of the aircraft pairs.  The result is denoted **T95/95** to indicate that it applies to 95% 
surveillance update reliability for 95% of aircraft pairs. 

## P.3.2.3 Track-Level Simulation Results For A2-To-A2

Using the curve fit shown in Figure P-20, the Track-Level simulation was run for 1000 
aircraft pairs (one aircraft transmitting and one receiving).  The formulation of the simulation is documented in Â§P.3.2.1.  The simulation includes co-site interference in the form of 93% receiver availability. For the case of A2 to A2 aircraft pairs, the results are shown in Table P-3.

## P.3.2.4 Track-Level Simulation Results For A3-To-A2

The other case to consider is Class A3 transmissions received by Class A2 aircraft.  The only difference between this case and the first case is the higher power level of the A3 transmitters.  In the model being used, A3 transmitters are between 53 and 56 dBm whereas Class A2 transmitters are between 51 and 54 dBm.  This difference affects the results as a 2 dB change in ranges for each level of performance.  Therefore the results in Table P-3 can be converted to the results in Table P-4 for the A3 to A2 case.

These results are plotted in Figure P-23 and Figure P-24, where they are compared with the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A) standards.  Air-to-air surveillance is seen to satisfy the MASPS standards in both cases, A2-to-A2 and A3-to-A2.  Air-to-air communication of TS Report information (Figure P-24) satisfies the MASPS standards for A3-to-A2, whereas in the case of A2-to-A2, performance falls short of the MASPS 
beyond about 24 NM. 


## P.3.3 Effects Of Altitude

In the normal formulation, the two aircraft are considered to be at approximately the same altitude, and therefore the elevation-angle portion of the antenna gain model was not used 
(only the statistical portion was used).  For an additional study of altitude effects, the formulation was changed so that the transmitting aircraft has a specific altitude (a parameter entered by the user) while the receiving aircraft is at the fixed altitude of 40000 
feet.  Therefore the results depend on the transmitter altitude.  The TLAT model of aircraft antenna gain as a function of elevation angle was used in this study [Reference P-
1]. 

The results for several values of transmitter altitude are shown in Figure P-25 and Figure P-26.  The results indicate that performance is somewhat degraded when the transmitter is changed from 40000 feet to 5000 feet.  The degradation is more pronounced at shorter range, which seems reasonable because of the steeper elevation angles.  Beyond 50 NM, performance is not changed significantly. 

Note:
 Altitudes marked in the figure apply to the transmitting aircraft.  The receiving aircraft is at 40000 feet. 

Looking at intermediate results from the simulation, one can see several reasons why altitude would not be expected to have much effect at long range.  For long range, the elevation angle change is small.  For example, for range of 100 NM and transmitter altitude of 5000 feet, the elevation angles are +/-3.3 degrees.  According to the TLAT 
antenna gain model, this causes a drop by only 1.1 dB for one antenna and a boost by 1.0 dB for the other.  The effects are small and nearly identical. 

Figure P-26 indicates that the slope of the performance curves is similar to the slope of the TSR requirement.  As a result, the relatively small degradation in TSR performance in this figure causes the MASPS intersection point to drop more dramatically.  Although the MASPS requirement is not strictly met beyond that point, the performance is only a few seconds different from the requirement. In conclusion, the results from the normal runs, in which altitude differences were not used, have been shown to be accurate at long ranges, regardless of the actual altitude of the transmitting aircraft.  The results indicate that performance is not very sensitive to transmitter altitude between 20000 feet and 40000 feet, although sensitivity increases for very low transmitters. 

## P.3.4 Higher Fruit La Environment

In performing the evaluation for the higher-FRUIT case, 30000 Mode A/C FRUIT per second, the same process was followed.  The results are included in Figure P-21 and Figure P-22. 

## P.3.5 Low Density Environment

The Low Density Environment defined in the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A) was also evaluated.  The aircraft are uniformly distributed in area over a circle of 400 NM radius.  The total number of aircraft is 360, so the density is 0.0007 aircraft per square NM. 

## P.3.5.1 Reception Probability Versus Signal Power

In evaluating performance in this environment, the first step was to determine reception probability as a function of range.  The conclusion is that the MTL curve by itself is an appropriate characterization of reception performance as a function of received power in the low density environment.  The MTL curve used in this evaluation was based on bench tests performed at the FAATC.  The curve satisfies both MTL requirements (90% at -84 dBm and 15% at -87 dBm) and is otherwise the worst-case curve. 

## P.3.5.2 Low Density Environment Track-Level Simulation

The track-level simulation was then run, using the same procedure as was used for LA- [24k] except for the probability input curve, which embodies the characteristics of the low density environment.  The runs apply to Class A3 transmissions received by Class A3 aircraft.  Both aircraft have antenna diversity.  A receiver dead time factor of 0.93 was also used. The simulation results are given in Table P-5 and shown in Figure P-27 and Figure P-28.  
These results exhibit more statistical fluctuations than in the previous cases, which can be attributed to the abruptness of the MTL curve.  As a result, the simulation was run twice at each range.  Both points were tabulated and plotted, to indicate the degree of accuracy in these results as influenced by the number of trials (1000 aircraft pairs contributing to each point).

The results exhibit an interesting flat spot from 80 to 110 NM.  Looking at this, one can see that it is a result of the steep MTL curve.  It's not common, but occurs at around the 
95 percentile worst cases, that one of the two transmitting antennas has higher power, for which reception is the maximum value (0.93), while the other transmitting antenna has lower power, for which reception is zero.  Therefore the overall probability is (0.93 + 0)/2 = 0.465.  This is the probability value at the flat spot. The results in Figure P-28 indicate that the MASPS standards for State Vector are met out to about 130 NM air-to-air range for Class A3-to-A3.  The same evaluation was performed for TS Reports, and the results indicate that the MASPS standards are met out to about 130 NM for Class A3-to-A3 avionics. 

## P.4 Summary Of Do-260A Performance Analysis

Table P-6 and Table P-7 summarize the results from the simulations run by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), and by MIT Lincoln Laboratory 
(LL).  These tables show to what range the report update requirements from the ADS-B 
MASPS, RTCA DO-242A where met for a given equipment class combination and Mode A/C FRUIT level.  Also shown is the range to which the update requirements are required and desired as described in RTCA DO-242A. 

Note:
                                                                          P.1
     For the high density scenarios of 24000 and 30000 Mode A/C FRUIT (see Â§
                                                                             ), 
       RTCA DO-242A specifies that operational ranges are only to extend to 40 NM.  
       However, it should be noted that as applications are developed and validated, 
       these required ranges might be extended to 90 NM in high density airspace for 
       A3 equipment.

The above summary tables show that the 1090 MHz ES ADS-B system, as defined in these MOPS, will meet the report update requirements from RTCA DO-242A beyond the required ranges for A3 equipment interacting with A3 equipment at recommended power levels.  It should be noted, however, that if the operational range of 40 NM for high density airspace would be increased to that of 90 NM used for low-density airspace, the performance of the 1090 MHz ES system would not meet the update requirements through that extended range. 

For State Vector update performance, the requirements for RTCA DO-242A are also met for A3 equipment interacting with A2 equipment at recommended power levels. Performance requirements up to 40 NM for State Vector updates will be met in the high density environments between A3 and A2 equipment, however, results are unclear if A2- to-A2 communications will meet the 40 NM requirement in LA.  The results show that update requirements will not be met in high density airspace for the TS Reports for A2 
equipment interfacing with either A2 or A3 systems.  
The transmission rate for A2 equipment has been selected in light of the current 6.2 transmissions per second limit and is tailored to A3 equipment, and retains capability to support the Trajectory Change Reports (see Appendix O).  Future editions of these MOPS may consider increasing the transmission rate of short term intent information supporting TS Reports for A2 equipment in order to provide longer range performance in the highest density environments. 

As described in Â§P.3.3, relatively small variations in predicted TSR performance may result in significant differences in the ranges at which the MASPS TSR updates rates are satisfied. Table P-6 shows performance for the MASPS low density scenario with two different Mode A/C FRUIT rates.  These results indicate for Mode A/C FRUIT rates approaching 
5000 per second that the 1090 MHz system for A3-to-A3 interactions offers the MASPS desired range of 120 NM. The performance results reported in Appendix P were derived from two independent evaluations, one by APL and the other by LL.  Examination of Tables P-6 and P-7 shows (only) three differences in simulated performance results provided by APL and LL that impact the determination of whether particular RTCA DO-242A requirements are projected to be met by the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter system in the LA air traffic scenario (Table P-6, A2 transmitter and A2 receiver at 24000 Mode A/C FRUIT; Table P-7, A3 transmitter and A3 receiver at 30000 Mode A/C FRUIT; and Table P-7, A3 
transmitter and A2 receiver at 24000 Mode A/C FRUIT).  A significant effort was made to understand the reason for any differences between the results reported by each evaluation.  The APL and LL evaluation techniques, while using similar assumptions on, for example, probability of correct reception of a single Extended Squitter as a function of received signal power, use different simulator architectures and, for A3 receivers, a different sampling rate.  These differences, in conjunction with uncertainties inherent in the simulation processes, are the likely source of the differences in the values for update ranges obtained. 

## P.5 Additional Performance Analysis

Additional analysis was carried out for this publication in order to examine the performance of 1090 ES in more dense traffic environments and also to evaluate the performance of the newly-defined single-antenna A1 category of equipage.  In order to be consistent with the performance criteria used in the rest of this appendix, it was decided to use the same update interval criteria that were used in Appendix P of RTCA DO-260A.  These criteria were based on initial estimates of the application requirements provided by the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A) that were published in 2002.  Since the publication of RTCA DO-260A, much work has been done to refine the air-to-air applications and the accompanying requirements, so the performance criteria may change.  It is possible that applications will be developed that require performance more demanding than RTCA DO-242A (longer ranges or high update rates).  The opposite is also possible, that the RTCA DO-242A criteria used here are more demanding than what will be needed for the actual applications of ADS-B.  For further information on more recent range and update requirements, see RTCA DO-289, RTCA DO-312, and RTCA 
DO-314.  In addition, work is in progress to define new air-to-air applications. 

## P.5.1 East Coast Air Traffic Scenarios

Several new air traffic scenarios were developed for this analysis.  Since ADS-B shares the 1090 MHz frequency with existing SSRs, TCAS, and other systems, understanding the interference environment is necessary to provide confidence in the predictions of future interference environments in which the system will operate.  The Northeast corridor of the United States was the selected environment to base future air traffic and interference predictions since high air traffic density, TCAS equipage, and SSRs contribute to a busy 1090 MHz environment. A flight test was conducted on January 26, 2006 in the Northeast corridor of the United States for the purpose of measuring and assessing airborne receptions of 1030/1090 MHz activity. An additional flight test was conducted on July 25, 2007 where 1030 and 1090 
MHz measurements similar to the January 2006 flight test were taken.   In both cases, the receiving aircraft was instrumented for recording of the flight path and both 1030 MHz and 1090 MHz receptions, for later detailed analysis. Simultaneously with the airborne measurements in July 2007, radar recordings were also made to show the density and distribution of airborne aircraft.  The distribution of the traffic was captured by taking snapshots of all aircraft seen by 33 east coast enroute and terminal radars.  The composite picture was created by converting the measured radar coordinates of all the aircraft at the time of the snapshot into latitude and longitude, superimposing the pictures seen by all the radars, and eliminating duplicate reports of the same aircraft as seen by multiple radars.  The resulting measurements of aircraft density and distribution are shown in Figure P-29. 

## 

This was a major measurement and data-analysis program, which included a detailed simulation of the 1030 MHz and 1090 MHz reception that would be expected given the number of airborne aircraft and the known ground based radars [ref. P-2].  The end result was an improved understanding of the signal environment and the behavior of 1030/1090 MHz avionics in a dense environment.   

## P.5.2 Future Interference Environments

Building upon the measured values of aircraft density and airborne signal receptions, four models were developed to represent future higher density conditions.  Figure P-30 shows the aircraft density conditions in these four models as compared with the measurements.   

## 

 
 
Each of the four new environments can be characterized by a growth factor relative to the measurements of aircraft density.  Table P-8 shows the four growth factors, and also lists the Mode S and ATCRBS FRUIT rates, received airborne for comparison.  These values of FRUIT rate apply to receptions stronger than -84 dBm referred to the antenna.  
Whereas the measured number of aircraft within a range of 100 NM varied by time-ofday and also according to the center point of the calculation, for this purpose the maximum value was used to characterize the measured density and to calculate the growth factors of the four new environments.

In considering future higher aircraft densities, it is necessary to consider possible changes in the frequency management by the FAA of 1030/1090 MHz.  For example, the FAA recognizes that the rate of All-Call interrogations by SSRs is higher than needed by about 
2:1 and the FAA is implementing a plan to make a 2:1 reduction.  The following frequency management changes were included in this study: 

- 
All-Call 2:1 Reduction
.  Looking many years into the future, it is reasonable to 
assume that the 2:1 reduction in All-Call rate has been made, and that assumption 
was used in this study.   
 
- 
Terra Fix
.  The FAA is planning to phase-out the Terra Fix, and it was assumed 
that is will be phased-out for environments 1, 2, 3, and 4.   
 
- 
Fewer SSRs
.  With increasing ADS-B, the FAA is planning to reduce the number 
of SSRs by 50 percent.  For this study, an SSR reduction by 8 percent was assumed for all four interference environments. 
 
 
There are several other possible frequency management changes that were not included in the study: 
 

- 
Extended All-Call Lockout
.  Although the FAA is considering extending All-Call 
Lockout beyond 60 NM, that change was not assumed in this study. 
 
- 
TCAS Hybrid Surveillance
.  It is generally expected that Hybrid Surveillance 
will improve the efficiency of TCAS and reduce the effects of TCAS on the frequency band use. 
 
- 
Unwanted Mode A Replies
.  Airborne measurements have revealed a mechanism 
in which unwanted Mode A replies are triggered by low-level Mode S 
interrogations.  This problem is limited to certain transponder models, and transponder standards have been changed to eliminate the problem in the future. But it was assumed in this study that this problem will not be controlled in the future. 
 
- 
TCAS Interference Limiting
.  Some limitations in the effectiveness of TCAS 
interference limiting have been observed.  It was assumed for this analysis that no steps will be taken in the future to keep Interference Limiting working effectively.   
 
- 
Full Mode S Sensor Networking and Mode S Operation
.  The FAA currently 
operates many of its Mode S capable radar systems as Mode A/C systems, and sensor networking is not used.  Mode S use of full sensor networking will minimize the radar systems actively interrogating a Mode S transponder regardless of how much overlapping coverage there is.  It was assumed for this analysis that full sensor networking would not change in the future.   

## P.5.3 Air-To-Air Performance Results

This section presents the air-to-air performance results in the four interference environments described in the previous section. 

## P.5.3.1 Performance For Class A1-S

The single-antenna A1 category of ADS-B equipage (A1S) was evaluated for air-to-air performance using the four new interference environments.  The analysis applies when both transmitter and receiver are equipped with class A1S. The air-to-air ranges considered and the corresponding requirements for Nominal Update Interval are the requirements given in RTCA DO-242A.  The results are given in Table P-9.

These results indicate that this avionics class would be quite limited in range in areas having densities as high as the four new models. 

## P.5.3.2 Performance For Class A3

Class A3 avionics were evaluated in the same manner.  The results are given in Table P-
10, which apply when both the transmitting aircraft and the receiving aircraft are equipped with Class A3 avionics.

## Note:

These results clearly show that increasing aircraft density and increasing interference would have an effect limiting air-to-air range.  The RTCA DO-242A requirements would be satisfied out to 20 NM in all four new environments, but for the longer-range column (40 NM) the Update Interval requirement would not be satisfied if the actual environment grew more dense than Environment 2 (growth by more than a factor of 1.7).   
Following is a comparison of these new results for A3-to-A3 ranges together with other results in Appendix P and the power-limited range given in Appendix E.  These results exhibit a monotonically decreasing air-to-air range as the density of aircraft and interference increases.

## Q Proposed Future Runway Threshold Speed On-Condition Message

Applications are under development that rely on knowledge of aircraft planned final approach speed.  The requirements for these applications may be included in future RTCA documents and may be reflected in future versions of these MOPS.  Until this work is concluded, this Appendix suggests a coding scheme for those desiring early implementation of this capability.  The provisions in this Appendix are not intended to be implemented in systems compliant with this version of these MOPS.   

## Q.1 Background

There are at least two applications under development that are expected to use planned runway threshold information to enhance airport capacity.  The best documented is one that uses planned aircraft approach speeds for enhancing the capacity of converging runway configurations for airports such as Chicago's O'Hare.  Potential capacity gains of 10-20 arrivals per hour in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) for such airports have been estimated (See Mundra and Smith, 2001).  Another possibility is approach spacing.  This analysis is currently underway, and may yield capacity benefits of the order of 3 to 4 arrivals per hour for any single runway operation under certain wind conditions. To enable these procedures, the expected or planned speed of the aircraft across the threshold (i.e., the landing speed) must be known at least 10 to 15 minutes prior to touchdown.  In practice, a logical time for computing and down-linking this speed is probably at top of descent.  If transmitted more than 20 minutes before touch down, provision should also be made for at least one revised estimate. 

This information would be input directly into terminal automation for aircraft spacing. This would thus be safety critical information and adequate reliability must be ensured, whether through redundancies or multiple transmissions.

## Appendix R Extended Squitter Broadcast Rate Analysis

 
This Page Intentionally Left Blank 

## R Extended Squitter Broadcast Rate Analysis R.1 Purpose And Scope

The purpose of this Appendix is to provide a calculation of 1090 MHz Extended Squitter broadcast rates for different operational scenarios to show that transmission rates achieved over a 60 second period meet the required average rate over 60 seconds, and that there is no need to implement a function to limit the total number of 1090 MHz Extended Squitters transmitted over a certain period of time.   

## R.2 Background

This version of these ADS-B MOPS, specifies different types of 1090 MHz Extended Squitters with different transmission rates (see Table 2-79) There is no requirement to limit the transmissions over a 1 second period, other than a maximum of 2 Event-Driven Messages.  The transmission rate averaged over 60 seconds must be less than or equal to 6.2 squitters per second.

## S Gps Time Tag And Utc Time Synchronization S.1 Introduction

In Â§2.2.3.2.3.5, these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A) require that the validity of the Airborne Position Messages be established at exact 0.2 UTC epochs when the "Time" (T) subfield is set to "1."  Section Â§2.2.3.2.3.6 then requires that the CPR encoding be alternated between EVEN and ODD encodings each 0.2 UTC epoch. Section Â§2.2.3.2.3.6.b Note 2 is more specific in that it requires that the distribution of EVEN and ODD encodings for each 0.2 UTC epoch be started on an EVEN epoch. Figure S.1 illustrates the intended encoding.  Inspection of Figure S-1 shows that the intent is to start the even/odd CPR encoding distribution starting at the beginning of the Even Epoch with an EVEN sub-epoch.  The result is an equal number of even and odd sub-epochs distributed over two seconds.  Further inspection of Figure S-1 shows that synchronization could also be done at the beginning of the ODD Epoch provided that the odd/even CPR encoding distribution starts with an ODD sub-epoch.

In Â§2.2.3.2.4.5 and Â§2.2.3.2.4.6, these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A) 
then provide similar requirements for the Surface Position Messages. In Â§2.2.5.1.6.2 these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A), then establish requirements for the ADS-B Transmit Subsystem to accept the GPS/GNSS Time Mark in order to synchronize the 0.2 second UTC epochs when the "Time" (T) subfield is set to "1."  At the time that these requirements were first established during the development of RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 it was established that the leading edge of the GPS Time Mark would be within Â±5 milliseconds of the beginning of the epoch.  Likewise, it was established that position, velocity, and time (PVT) data can be expected from the GPS no later than 200 milliseconds after the leading edge of the Time Mark.  Review of most GPS systems has indicated that PVT data is being provided within 200 milliseconds of the Time Mark.  However, review of the relationship between the leading edge of the Time Mark and the beginning of the UTC Epoch indicates that the Time Mark and UTC Epoch are not tightly coupled.  Table S-1 provides data taken from one major GPS vendor.  Note that the data is based on the ARINC "140" and "150" labels received which are detailed in Table S-2 and S-3. 

Review of Table S-1 indicates that the particular GPS gives UTC Time of the Time Mark Leading Edge as **17:08:49.79439544677** which is approximately 0.8 seconds into the ODD epoch or approximately 0.2 seconds before the beginning of the EVEN epoch. Other data reviews indicate that re-cycling of power on the GPS will result in a completely different relationship between the Time Mark and the UTC Time of the Time Mark Leading Edge.  Consequently, it appears that the industry cannot count on the GPS 
Time Mark and the UTC of the Time Mark being close to the actual beginning of the epoch.  Therefore, a method is needed to synchronize the Time Mark and the UTC Time of the Time Mark such that the exact 0.2 UTC sub-epochs required by ADS-B can be established based on the time provided by the UTC Time of the Time Mark Leading Edge. The following sections detail an acceptable method for synchronizing the UTC Time of the Time Mark Leading edge such that exact 0.2 UTC sub-epochs can be established with the proper even/odd CPR encoding sub-epoch distribution.   
Note: 
 The time of 17:08:49.79439544677 or **17:08:49.8** will be used as the Reference Time in the following discussions in section S.1 inclusive.

## S.2 Method For Time Mark / Utc Time Synchronization

The following sub-sections detail the method of establishing synchronization to the UTC Time based on receipt of the GPS Time Mark, Label "150" and Label "140" from the GPS receiver.  Note that appropriate formats for the "150" and "140" labels were previously provided in Table S-2 and S-3 respectively. 

Advantages of the method are: 

a. Synchronization can be performed at virtually any time during the epoch based on 
the time given in the "150" and "140" words. 
b. Once synchronization is established, it should not need to be repeated more 
frequently than approximately every 10 seconds.  As a worse case, synchronization would be done every two seconds.   
Figures S-2a and S-2b detail the synchronization method.  Review of the figures indicates that each of the flow diagram boxes has a number from "1" to "33" shown in bold "Red" font inside the box.  These "Block" numbers are used as reference numbers in the following sections.   

## S.2.1 Start Of Synchronization (Block #1 Through 3)

Synchronization starts with waiting for the Leading Edge of the GPS Time Mark (Block #2).  Upon detection of the leading edge of the Time Mark, a timer is started to count the time that expires from the leading edge of the Time Mark.  Figure S-2a Block #3 
identifies this timer as timertag_edge
.  This timer should be an UP counter with a minimum resolution of approximately 1.0 milliseconds.  Those systems that desire better precision should use much finer resolution of perhaps 100 microsecond increments.  Range of the counter should be up to 1.0 second at the maximum.   

## S.2.2 Wait For Gps Data (Block #4)

Next, wait for GPS data to be received from the GPS receiver.  This must include Latitude, Longitude, North/South Velocity, East/West Velocity, Label "150" UTC, and Label "140" UTC Fine data as a minimum to execute the synchronization process. Ensure that all data is properly stored for later use in the synchronization process.   

 

## S.2.3 Compute Current Time (Block #5)

Current Time represents the time at which the synchronization process computations are completed:  Specifically, Current Time is given by the following Equation 1. 

Equation 1: 
timecurrent = timein_label_140 + timertag_edge + time est_comp 

in_label_140
where: 
time
 represents the time in fractional seconds provided in the 
label "140" word received from the GPS receiver.   
tag_egde
 
timer
 represents the time in fractional seconds that is indicated by 
the timer started in Block #3.   
est_comp
 
time
 represents the estimated time of computation that it will take 
to complete the synchronization computation process.  This time may be considered optional since the time of computation is expected to be short.   
 

## S.2.4 Determine Sub-Epoch Base And Remainder (Block #6)

The sub-epoch**base** is used to establish which sub-epoch the current time resides in and should be a number from "0" to "4."  Specifically, sub-epoch**base** is given by the following Equation 2:    
Equation 2: 
sub-epochbase = floor(timecurrent
/0.200)   
where: 
floor represents the integer "floor" function  
 
timecurrent represents the current time established in Equation 1 for Block 
#5.   

Notes:
1.
Red Numbers in each Block are for reference.
2.
Synchronization Process has ended as data has been turned over to the Extrapolator.
3.
Synchronization Process has ended as data has been computed forward, CPR encoded, loaded into the appropriate register and available for transmission .
Example: 
let timecurrent
 = 0.680 seconds Then, sub-epoch base = 3 which means that 3 sub-epochs of 0.2 
seconds have been used up to get to time current Next, we need to know the amount of time remaining to time current after the subepoch**base**.  That is, how far into the next sub-epoch is time**current**?  This parameter is referred to as time**mod_0.2** and is defined in the following Equation 3. 

Equation 3: 
timemod_0.2 = mod(timecurrent
,0.2) 
where: 
mod represents the modulus function of time current divided by 0.200.  
Effectively, the function returns the remainder of time**current** divided by 
0.200. 

 = mod(0.680, 0.200) = 0.080 seconds Example: 
timemod_0.2
 

## S.2.5 Determine Current Sub-Epoch Base (Block #7 And 8)

The sub-epoch**base** was computed in S.2.4 and is used to establish proper synchronization in any EPOCH and maintain the proper Even/Odd encoding distribution.  Figure S-3 
illustrates how the sub-epochbase aligns with the Even/Odd encoding distribution for the EVEN Epoch. 

Now, referring to Figure S-2a, Block #7 determines whether the time is in the EVEN or ODD Epoch based on the least significant bit (LSB) of the "Seconds" provided in Label "**150.**"  If time is in the EVEN epoch, then the sub-epoch base is either even or odd and aligns with the expected Even/Odd distribution for an EVEN epoch as illustrated in Figure S-3.  However, if Label "150" indicates that time is in an ODD epoch, subepoch**base** needs to be increased by "1" as done in Block #8 of Figure S-2a.  Subepochbase
 + 1 will then be either odd or even and align with the expected Odd/Even distribution for an ODD epoch as illustrated in Figure S-3.

## S.2.6 Determine Current Sub-Epoch Even Or Odd Encoding (Block #9 Through 11)

Figure S-2a, Block #9 then checks the results out of Block #7 or #8 to see if the LSB of the resultant sub-epoch**base** is either "0" or "1."  If "0", then the Current**sub-epoch** is SET to 
"EVEN" as indicated by Block #10.  Otherwise, the resultant sub-epoch**base** is "1" and the Current**sub-epoch** is SET to "ODD" as indicated in Block #11. 

 = 3 as in Section S.2.4.   
Example: 
Consider the case where the sub-epochbase Then, for an EVEN epoch, "1" is not added as per Block #7.  The subepoch base remains at three and Block #9 and #11 will result in the Currentsub-epoch being set to ODD.  Review of Figure S-3 confirms that the sub-epoch encoding should be ODD for the given sub-epoch 3 in the EVEN epoch. 

Then, for an ODD epoch, "1" is added as per Block #7 and #8.  The subepoch base increases from 3 to 4 which results in Block #9 and #10 setting the Currentsub-epoch to EVEN.  Review of Figure S-3 confirms that the sub-epoch encoding should be EVEN for the given sub-epoch 3 in the ODD epoch. 

## S.2.7 Compute Time To Next Exact 0.2 Second Sub-Epoch (Block #12)

Block #12 establishes the exact amount of time remaining to the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch.  Time**to_next_sub-epoch** is defined in Equation 4 as follows: 
Equation 4: 
time**to_next_sub-epoch** = 0.2 - timemod_
0.2 
mod_0.2
 is as computed or defined in section S.2.4 Equation 3.  
where:  
time Next, for convenience purposes, the Time of Applicability (TOA) at the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch is set to be equal to the time to_next_sub-epoch as per the following Equation 5. 

Equation 5: 
TOA = time to_next_sub-epoch 

## S.2.8 Set Count Down Timer To Next Sub-Epoch (Block #14)

Figure S-2a Block #14 simply loads a count-down timer with the value of TOA and initiates the timer to count down.  Action that is necessary upon terminal count down of the counter is addressed in section S.2.11, for Block #26. 

## S.2.9 Determine If There Is Sufficient Computation Time (Block #15)

Figure S-2b, Block #15 is necessary to determine if there is sufficient time to compensate the Current Position prior to the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch.  The time of 5 milliseconds shown in Block #15 is *ARBITRARY* and is based on the particular vendor design as the vendor needs to be able to establish how much time is required to complete the position compensation.   

## Sufficient Time Available:

a. 
If there is sufficient time available, then position is compensated to be applicable at the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch.  Then once the next exact 0.2 
second sub-epoch is reached, the up-dated position is extrapolated forward to the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch to provide the updated position.  The updated position is then CPR encoded and loaded into the appropriate register in order to be available for randomized transmission when required. 

The key thing here is that position is only compensated to be accurate at the next 0.2 second sub-epoch.  After that, further compensation is left to the Extrapolation process.  Note that the compensation is done prior to the Count Down Timer expiration in Figure S-2b Block #26. 

This entire process is covered in detail in Section S.2.9 and Figure S-2b Block #20 
through #25. 

b. 
Insufficient Time Available: 
If there is insufficient time to compensate the position prior to the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch, then the position must be compensated after the Count Down Timer expiration in Figure S-2b Block #26.  In this case, the position will be compensated directly to the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch that occurs AFTER 
the Count Down Timer has expired.  The compensated position is then saved, CPR 
encoded and loaded into the appropriate register in order to be available for randomized transmission when required.  As such, the compensated position DOES 
NOT go through the extrapolation process in this case as it has already been extrapolated forward. 

The entire computational process discussed in this subparagraph is covered in detail in Section S.2.12.2 and Figure S-2b Block #27 through #29, Block #31 and Block 
#32.  However, prior to the computational process which takes place after Count-
Down Timer expiration, the process must be set up via decision logic prior to Timer expiration as discussed in Section S.2.11 and Figure S-2b Block #16 through Block #19.    

## S.2.10 Sufficient Computation Time (Block #20 Through #25)

The following sub-sections apply if there is Sufficient Computation Time as discussed previously in Â§S.2.10.a.    

## S.2.10.1 Compute Position At Next 0.2 Sub-Epoch (Block #20)

Figure S-2b Block #20 compensates the position information to be valid or applicable at the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch when there is time to do the compensation prior to the start of *that* next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch.  First, the amount of time to be compensated for is computed by the following Equation 6. 

Equation 6: 
timecompensate = TOA - time
in_label_140 
where: 
TOA is as previously computed in section S.2.7 and Equation 5. 

timein_label_140
 is as previously discussed in section S.2.3.   
Next, the Next Latitude Position or better defined as the Latitude Position at the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch is computed as shown in the following Equation 7.   

Equation 7: 
Latnext = Lat110_120 + N/S_vel166 * time
compensate 
110_120
where: 
Lat is the current latitude position value provided in ARINC 
Labels "110" and "120" as received from the GPS receiver during the same time frame as the UTC time words were received from the GPS 
receiver. 

N/S_vel
166
 is the current North/South velocity value provided in ARINC 
Label "166" as received from the GPS receiver during the same time frame as the UTC time words were received from the GPS receiver. 

time compensate is as defined in Equation 6 
Next, the Next Longitude Position or better defined as the Longitude Position at the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch is computed as shown in the following Equation 8. Equation 8: 
Lonnext = Lon111_121 + E/W_vel174 * time compensate 
111_121
where: 
Lon is the current longitude position value provided in ARINC 
Labels "111" and "121" as received from the GPS receiver during the same time frame as the UTC time words were received from the GPS receiver. 

E/W_vel
174
 is the current East/West velocity value provided in ARINC 
Label "174" as received from the GPS receiver during the same time frame as the UTC time words were received from the GPS receiver. 

time compensate is as defined in Equation 6. 

## S.2.10.2 Save Position For Extrapolation (Block #21)

Figure S-2b Block #21 saves the Lat**next** and Lonnext values computed in section S.2.10.1 
to be used by the next extrapolation process which will come after the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch.   

## S.2.10.3 Determine Next Sub-Epoch Even/Odd Encoding (Block #22 Through #24)

Figure S-2b Block #22 through #24 then establish the Even/Odd encoding format that should be used by the Extrapolation Process which occurs after the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch. 

Basically, IF the current sub-epoch is ODD (see Figure S-3), *THEN* the Nextsub-epoch is EVEN.    
sub-epoch Conversely, IF the current sub-epoch is **EVEN** (see Figure S-3), *THEN* the Next
 
is ODD.    

 

## S.2.10.4 Clear Position Load Flag (Block #25)

Remembering that this entire section, (e.g., S.2.10) deals with the condition where there is sufficient time to compensate position prior to the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second epoch, it is important to note that position has been compensated to the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second epoch.  When that happens, the Extrapolation Process will then properly extrapolate the position to the next exact 0.2 second epoch and then proceed to the CPR encoding. THEREFORE: 
CLEAR the **Position Load Flag** which may have been set in prior synchronization processes in section S.2.11.2 (Block #19). 

THEN: 
PROCEED to section S.2.12 (Block #26).   

 

## S.2.11 Insufficient Computation Time Process Set Up (Block # 16 Through 19)

As previously discussed, Section S.2.9.b, indicates that computational process must be properly set up prior to Count-Down Timer expiration when the position computation must be done after the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch.  This setup process is now addressed in detail in the following sub-sections in regard to Figure S-2b Block #16 through Block #19.   

 

## S.2.11.1 Determine The Next Sub-Epoch Even/Odd Encoding (Block # 16 Through 18)

Figure S-2b Block #16 through #18 are used to establish the Even/Odd encoding format that should be used by the CPR Encoding algorithm after receiving updated Position data directly from the synchronization process as opposed to having come from the extrapolator. 

Basically, IF the current sub-epoch is ODD (see Figure S-3), *THEN* the Nextsub-epoch is ODD. 

Conversely, IF the current sub-epoch is **EVEN** (see Figure S-3), **THEN** the Next sub-epoch is **EVEN**. 

Note that the EVEN/ODD encoding is different from that in section S.2.10.3 specifically because the position will have been extrapolated an additional 0.2 milliseconds such that the extrapolator at the beginning of the 0.2 second sub-epoch is *by-passed*.   

 
S.2.11.2 
SET the Position Load Flag (Block #19) 
Figure S-2b Block #19 is used to SET the Position Load Flag to indicate that the Position Needs to be Compensated and Loaded after the Count-Down Time has expired, thereby indicating the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch.    

 

## S.2.12 Timer Count Down And Position Flag Status (Block # 26 Through #27)

Count-Down Timer expiration is determined by Figure S-2b Block #26 and indicates the start of the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch.  At that time, there are two choices that have been set up by the previous processing that need to be resolved as discussed in the following sub-sections.   

 

## S.2.12.1 Position Load Flag Not Set (Block # 27 )

If the Position Load Flag is *NOT SET*, then the position has been extrapolated to the beginning of the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch.  As such, the position is ready to be extrapolated to the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch by the extrapolator which executes shortly after the beginning of the 0.2 second sub-epoch. 

As indicated by Note 2 in *Figure S-2b*, the *Synchronization Process is DONE* at this point and the Extrapolation Process will take over in the next 0.2 second sub-epoch as shown in Figure S-2b Block #30.  After the Extrapolation, the Position is CPR Encoded as shown in Figure S-2b Block #31 and loaded into the appropriate register as shown in Figure S-2b Block #32. 

 

## S.2.12.2 Position Load Flag Set (Block # 27) S.2.12.2.1 Compute Position To Be Loaded (Block # 28)

If the Position Load Flag *IS SET*, then the Position data must be extrapolated to the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch **PLUS** an additional 200 milliseconds.  First, the amount of time to be compensated for is computed by the following Equation 9.   
Equation 9: 
time**compensate** = 0.2 + TOA - time in_label_140 
where: 
TOA is as previously computed in section S.2.7 and Equation 5. 

timein_label_140
 is as previously discussed in section S.2.3.   
Next, the Next Latitude Position is computed as shown in section S.2.10.1 Equation 7 
and in Figure S-2b Block #28.   
Next, the Next Longitude Position is computed as shown in section S.2.10.1 Equation 8 
and in Figure S-2b Block # 28.    

 

## S.2.12.2.2 Save Position For Load (Block #29)

The new position computed in section S.2.12.2.1, e.g., Block #28, is then saved for extrapolation to a new position update in subsequent sub-epochs that occur **AFTER** the synchronization process.   

 

## S.2.12.2.3 Cpr Encode New Position Data (Block # 31)

The new position computed in section S.2.12.2.1, e.g., Block #28, is then CPR Encoded as shown in Figure S-2b, Block #31.   
Note that the position data was not routed to the Extrapolator (Figure S-2b, Block #30) as was previously done in section S.2.12.1.   

 

## S.2.12.2.4 Load Bds Buffer (Block # 32)

Last, but not least, the CPR encoded (section S.2.12.2.3) position data is loaded into the appropriate register as shown in Figure S-2b Block #32.  At this point, the data is ready for random access for transmission by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. 

As indicated by Note 3 in *Figure S-2b*, the *Synchronization Process is DONE* at this point as data has been extrapolated to the next exact 0.2 sub-epoch, CPR encoded, and loaded into the appropriate register to be accessed for transmission.   

 

## S.2.13 Established Processing Loop (Block # 30 Through #33)

Figure S-2b Block #30 through Block #33 represent blocks that should already be part of the position extrapolation function used by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. 

Block #30 represents the Extrapolation function which extrapolates position to the next exact 0.2 second sub-epoch. Block #31 represents the CPR encoding process which encodes the position data into the format necessary for ADS-B transmission. 

Block #32 represents the storage of the CPR encoded position data for subsequent access by the transmitting function of the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem. 

Block #33 represents the requirement that the extrapolation process is continued at subsequent 0.2 second sub-epochs until the next synchronization process.  Although, Block #33 infers that the re-synchronization process should start at the beginning of an EVEN epoch, previous discussion in the first paragraph of section S.1 indicates that the re-synchronization process can be started at the beginning of an ODD epoch.  As such, the synchronization process detailed in this document is designed to work in both cases and will work starting with either the EVEN or ODD epoch.  Actually, the synchronization process detailed herein establishes proper synchronization when starting anywhere within an EVEN or an ODD epoch. 

## S.3 Summary / Conclusion

The Synchronization Method described in this document should ensure that proper synchronization is established to the beginning of an ODD or EVEN epoch as defined by UTC time provided in ARINC Labels "150" and "140."  Likewise, the Method ensures that the EVEN/ODD sub-epoch distribution is properly initiated during the synchronization process.  As such, the Method can be applied at any time and still insure proper synchronization and sub-epoch encoding distribution. 

As a disclaimer, the Synchronization Method described in this document represents an acceptable method of achieving the synchronization task.  Other methods that achieve equivalent results should be considered as being equally acceptable.

## T Introduction And Tutorial For Compact Position Reporting (Cpr) T.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Appendix is to provide explanations and derivations of the Compact Position Reporting (CPR) equations given in Appendix A.  CPR encoding and decoding can be implemented without using any of the information in this Appendix but, if a CPR implementation has problems, the information in this Appendix may be helpful in resolving the issue.   

## T.2 Motivation For Compact Position Reporting (Cpr)

CPR was developed for ADS-B messages broadcast on the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter 
(1090ES) data link to reduce the number of bits required to convey participant latitude and longitude.  Position resolution for 1090ES messages is approximately 5.1 meters for airborne participants and 1.3 meters for surface participants (see Section T.3).  The circumference of the earth is approximately 40 000 kilometers so 40 000 000 m/5.1 m = 
~7 800 000 discrete position values.  7 800 000 position values would require 23 bits in a message.  Longitude is expressed over a range of 360Â° so longitude would require the full 23 bits.  Latitude is expressed over a range of 180Â° so only 3 900 000 discrete position values or 22 bits would be required.  Following similar reasoning, surface position would require 25 bits for longitude and 24 bits for latitude.  CPR conveys position with 17 bits each for latitude and longitude plus 1 "CPR format" bit.

CPR saves 10 bits per position message for airborne participants and 14 bits per position message for surface participants.  Position messages are broadcast twice per second under most conditions so CPR saves 20 bits/second for airborne participants and 28 bits/second for surface participants.  The maximum message transmission rate allowed for each 1090ES ADS-B participant is 6.2 messages/second.  Of the 112 bits in each 1090ES 
message, only 56 are available for the ADS-B payload.  The first 5 ADS-B payload bits are reserved for the message type so 51 bits from each message are available for data.  51 
bits/message multiplied by 6.2 messages/second is 316 bits/second.  CPR saves 6% - 9% 
of the available bits for other uses.  

## T.3 Cpr Coordinate System

CPR can be thought of as a coordinate system and a set of coordinate transformation algorithms.  The coordinate system is spherical and comparable to the latitude/longitude reference system commonly used for navigation.  The coordinate transformation algorithms convert between latitude/longitude and CPR coordinates.  The coordinate transformation algorithms are commonly called "CPR encoding" and "CPR decoding." 
In the CPR coordinate system, the globe is divided into zones.  "Latitude zones" start at the equator and go to both poles.  "Longitude zones" start at the Prime Meridian and proceed eastward around the globe.  Latitude zones are approximately 360 nautical miles 
(NM) in height measured in the north-south direction.  Longitude zones are approximately 360 NM in width measured in the east-west direction.  The number of longitude zones is reduced as one moves from the equator to the poles to maintain approximately constant zone width. 

There are two sets of slightly different sized zones in both latitude and longitude.  One set of zones is called "even" and the other is called "odd."  Figure T-1 and Figure T-2 depict latitude and longitude zones on a global scale where the red lines represent even zone boundaries and the blue lines represent odd. 

 
Each zone is identified with a zone index number.  Imagine a tailor's tape measure marked with even and odd latitude zones as shown in the left side of Figure T-3.  The tape measure has 4NZ = 60 even zones and 4NZ-1 = 59 odd zones numbered beginning with zone index 0.  The zone boundaries will line up at the beginning and end of the tape measure but nowhere else.  The tape measure is wrapped around the globe starting with zone index 0 extending north from the equator.  The tape passes over the north and south poles and returns to the equator as shown on the right side of Figure T-3.   
Longitude zone indexing is the same as latitude zone indexing except zone index 0 is just east of the Prime Meridian and the zone numbers increase in the eastward direction.  As mentioned above, the number of longitude zones around the globe varies with latitude and this is reflected in the zone index numbers. 

Latitude and longitude zones are divided into bins.  Each zone contains 2Nb equal sized bins.  The value of Nb varies with the type of position being encoded.  Bins are numbered starting with 0 at the southern edge of latitude zones and the western edge of longitude zones.  More details on sizing are provided in the following sections. 

Every point on the globe is identified in the CPR coordinate system with a latitude zone index, latitude bin number, longitude zone index, longitude bin number and CPR format (even or odd zone size). 

## T.3.1 Latitude Zones

Latitude zones are symmetrical about the equator.  The height of a latitude zone is called Dlati.  The subscript i has a value of 0 to indicate the height of an even zone or a value of 
1 to indicate the height of an odd zone.  *Dlat*i is defined in terms of the constant NZ.  NZ 
is the number of even latitude zones in one quadrant of the globe and has a value of 15.  
The latitude zone size, Dlati
, is determined with Eq 1. 

  $$D l a t_{i}={\frac{360^{\circ}}{4N Z-i}}$$ $$\begin{array}{l}{{N Z=15}}\\ {{i=0\ \mathrm{for~even~encoding}}}\\ {{i=1\ \mathrm{for~odd~encoding}}}\end{array}$$
Since there are 4 quadrants around the globe, there are 60 even latitude zones and 59 odd zones.  Even latitude zones are approximately 360 NM high and odd latitude zones are approximately 366 NM high measured in the north-south direction.   
The definition of *Dlat*i is depicted in Figure T-4.   
Latitude zones are divided into bins.  There are 2Nb bins in each latitude zone.  Each latitude bin is identified by the integer bin number YZi.  YZi is the bin number relative to the southern edge of the latitude zone (in both the northern and southern hemispheres). The subscript i indicates whether the value of YZ is relative to an even zone (i=0) or an odd zone (i=1).  The CPR decoding algorithms produce a latitude value (a real number) 
from YZi which is the latitude at the centerline of the bin.  This value is called the bin centerline latitude.  
Figure T-5 shows the relationship between latitude bins and zones. 

 
The bin height, which is equal to the encoding resolution, is the latitude zone height divided by the number of bins per zone.  Section Â§A.1.7.2 defines the number of bits used for encoding to be 17 for airborne position, 19 for surface position and 12 for Coarse TIS-B position.  The resulting bin sizes are shown in Table T-2.

The CPR encoding algorithm transforms latitude into even and odd bin numbers.  Figure T-6 is an example showing even and odd bin numbers for airborne position at 43.054Â°N.  
Red lines delimit the even zone and blue lines delimit the odd zone.  The point of interest, colored magenta, is in even bin number 23025 and odd bin number 7349.   
Although not produced by the encoding algorithm, the zone index number for both the even and odd zones at the latitude in Figure T-6 is 7. 

## T.3.2 Longitude Zones And Bins

Longitude zones and bins are similar to latitude zones and bins.  For a given position type 
(i.e., airborne, surface, coarse TIS-B), the number of bins per longitude zone is equal to the number of bins per latitude zone.  The main difference between latitude and longitude zones is that the number of longitude zones circling the globe is a function of latitude. The CPR coordinate system keeps the encoding resolution (i.e., bin width in meters) as close to a constant as possible everywhere on the globe.  Since the number of bins per zone is fixed, the zone width (in NM) must also remain close to constant.  The distance around the globe along lines of constant latitude is smaller near the poles than near the equator.  The CPR algorithm keeps the longitude bin and zone width approximately constant by reducing the number of zones as latitude increases.   
Note that the linear (not angular) widths of the longitude zones in Figure T-7 are all approximately equal and that the number of zones around the globe decreases as the magnitude of latitude increases.  The number of even longitude zones at a given latitude is called NL.  The latitudes at which the number of longitude zones changes are called 
"NL Transition Latitudes."  These are represented by black lines of constant latitude in Figure T-2 and Figure T-7.  NL Transition Latitudes generally do not coincide with latitude zone boundaries. 

For all CPR computations, NL is calculated using the "recovered latitude" Rlati.  *Rlat*i is obtained by converting a bin number to a bin centerline latitude.  The rationale for this is discussed in Section T.4.  The equation for the number of longitude zones (NL) as a function of latitude is specified in Eq 2: 
 = 0Â° (the Equator), NL = 59 
i For Rlati For Rlat
 = +87Â° or lat = -87Â°, NL = 2 
i For Rlat
 > +87Â° or *lat* < -87Â°, NL = 1 
For all other latitudes (-87Â° < Rlat i < 0Â° and 0Â° < Rlati
 < +87Â°): 

$$NL(Rlat_{i})=floor\left(2\pi\left[\arccos\left(1-\frac{1-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\right)}{\cos^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}}\bullet\left|Rlat_{i}\right|\right)\right)}\right]^{-1}\right)$$ (A.1.7.2.d)
Note in Eq 2 that NL is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the recovered latitude and that the result of the computation on the right hand side is quantized by the floor function.  As the magnitude of the recovered latitude increases (i.e., from the equator to the poles), NL changes *after* the recovered latitude crosses the NL Transition Latitude.  
This is illustrated in Figure T-8. A rearranged version of Eq 2 gives NL Transition Latitudes as a function of the number of longitude zones.  The rearranged equation is presented in Eq 3: 

(

 $$lat_{\mbox{\tiny{NL Transition}}}=\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\bullet\arccos\left(1\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos\!\left(\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\right)}{1-\cos\!\left(\frac{2\pi}{NL}\right)}}\right)\right)\mbox{for}\,\,\,\mbox{\it NL}=2\,\,\mbox{to}\,\,4NZ-1$$ [A.1.7.2.d, note 5]
The longitude angular zone width, Dloni
 (in degrees of longitude) depends on the value of NL and is given by Eq 4: 

$$\begin{split}Dlon_{i}=&\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{360^{\circ}}{NL\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i}\,,&\text{when}\,\,\,NL\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i>0\\ 360^{\circ},&\text{when}\,\,\,NL\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i=0\end{array}\right.&\text{Eq4}\\ \end{split}$$
A visual representation of these equations is shown in Figure T-9.  Red lines are even longitude zone boundaries and blue lines are odd longitude zone boundaries.  Black lines of constant latitude are the transition latitudes defined by Eq 3.  
Zone indexing for longitude is similar to latitude except that zone index 0 extends east from the Prime Meridian and the "tape measure" continues eastward around the globe, returning to the Prime Meridian.  The number of zones on the "tape measure" varies with recovered latitude as described above. Longitude zones are divided into bins in the same manner as latitude zones except that bin number zero is located at the western edge of each zone and bin numbers increase to the east.  Even bin numbers are represented by the variable XZ0 and odd bin numbers are represented by the variable XZ1. 

Figure T-10 is an example showing even and odd bin numbers for airborne position at 76.06Â°W.  Red lines delimit the even zone boundary and blue lines delimit the odd zone boundary.  The point of interest, colored magenta, is in even bin number 119938 and odd bin number 16559. 

The longitude zone index number for both the even and odd zones at the longitude shown in Figure T-10 is 33.  

## T.4 Cpr Encoding

The first step of the encoding process is to determine the latitude zone size Dlati.  Dlati is calculated with Eq 1.   
The second step of the encoding process converts the input latitude into an output bin number YZ
i.  The input latitude can be any real number between -90Â° and +90Â°.  YZi is limited to a finite set of integers (0 to 131072) which represent bin numbers.  Eq 5 converts input latitude lat into a bin number YZi
. 

$$YZ_{i}=floor\Bigg{(}2^{\text{\tiny{3b}}}\bullet\frac{MOD\big{(}lat,Data_{i}\big{)}}{Data_{i}}+\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{)}$$ Eq 5 (A.1.7.3.b)
 
The modulus function returns the number of degrees between lat and the southern edge of the zone containing lat.  Dividing this by the latitude zone size *Dlat*i produces the 
"fraction into the zone" or "zone fraction" of the input latitude.  The product of the zone fraction and the number of bins in the zone (i.e., 2Nb
) is approximately the bin number of the input latitude.  The product is not necessarily an integer so it is rounded to the nearest integer by adding Â½ and taking the floor of the sum.  
The third step in the encoding process is to recover the bin centerline latitude of YZ
i.  
Because Eq 5 performs rounding, the bin centerline latitude of YZi will not equal the input latitude in most cases. 

$$Rlat_{i}=Dlat_{i}\Bigg{(}\frac{YZ_{i}}{2^{3b}}+floor\Bigg{(}\frac{lat}{Dlat_{i}}\Bigg{)}\Bigg{)}$$ Eq 6 (A.1.7.3.c)
 
YZi /2Nb is the zone fraction of YZi.  floor(*lat/Dlat*i) is the zone index number.  The first latitude zone north of the equator is index number 0.  The sum of the terms inside the parentheses is the number of whole zones plus the zone fraction of YZi.  The product of this sum and *Dlat*i, the number of degrees per zone, is the bin centerline latitude of YZi
.  
In the fourth step, Rlat i from Eq 6 is used to determine NL from Eq 2 or from a lookup table based on Eq 3.  Then, *Dlon*i is calculated with Eq 4.  Using *Rlat*i in the determination of NL ensures that the transmitted value of YZi is consistent with the value of NL used for longitude encoding.  The step also ensures that only one value of NL is used for any latitude within a single latitude bin.  The receiver only knows the latitude that is recovered from YZi and must determine NL based on this value alone.  If more than one value of NL were used for latitudes in the same bin, the receiver would have no reliable way to determine which value of NL was appropriate.  
The next step is to encode the longitude.  This is done with Eq 7. 

$XZ_{i}=floor\Bigg{(}2^{\%_{b}}\bullet\frac{MOD\big{(}lon,Dlon_{i}\big{)}}{Dlon_{i}}+\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{)}$ Eq 7
[A.1.7.3.e]
Eq 7 works in the same manner as Eq 5 except that the inputs and results are longitude values. 

The final step trims YZi and XZi to the number of bits available in the position message.  
For surface position, this fits a 19 bit number into a 17 bit space by discarding the 2 most significant bits.  For airborne and coarse TIS-B position, this step takes care of the case where the latitude or longitude falls within the most northern or most eastern Â½ bin in a zone.  YZi or XZi calculated from Eqs 5 or 7 would equal 2Nb in these cases which is too large be encoded in the respective position messages.  This step drops the most significant bit leaving only a string of zero bits for transmission.  See Figure T-11 for an example with latitude. 

For latitude in shaded region

(most northern 1/2 bin of latitude zone)

$$YZ_{i}=floor\Bigg{(}2^{N_{0}}\cdot\frac{MOD(lat,Data_{i})}{Data_{i}}+\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{)}\hskip56.905512ptYZ_{i}=0$$

$YZ_{i}$ will evaluate to $2^{N_{0}}$. _Max value that will fit in position message is $2^{N_{0}}$-1._

\[\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[width=142.26378pt]{./figures/
The following equations from section A.1.7.3.f trim YZi and XZi to the appropriate number of bits:   

$YZ_{i}=MOD\Big{(}YZ_{i},2^{17}\Big{)}$$XZ_{i}=MOD\Big{(}XZ_{i},2^{17}\Big{)}$$for$$Airborne$$encoding$

$YZ_{i}=MOD\Big{(}YZ_{i},2^{17}\Big{)}$$for$$Surface$$encoding$

$XZ_{i}=MOD\Big{(}XZ_{i},2^{17}\Big{)}$$for$$Course$$TIS-B$$encoding$

## T.5 Cpr Decoding

Every latitude and longitude can be mapped to a unique triple of zone index, bin number and CPR Format.  However, only the bin number and CPR Format are transmitted in position messages.  Receivers must recover the latitude and longitude using only the transmitted bin numbers and CPR Format.  Remember that any latitude bin number YZi will exist in each latitude zone and that there are 15 even and 14 Â¾ odd latitude zones in both the northern and southern hemispheres.  The ambiguity in longitude is similar except the number of longitude zones varies from 1 to 59 depending on latitude.  These MOPS provide two methods for recovering the zone and determining the position of a target in section A.1.7.  One method is called Globally Unambiguous CPR Decoding and the other is called Locally Unambiguous CPR Decoding.  These methods are commonly called "global decoding" and "local decoding." 
Most implementations use global decoding to determine position when a target is first acquired and then switch to local decoding for ongoing position updates.  Global decoding can determine the location of a target anywhere on the globe but must have one even CPR format position message and one odd CPR format position message received within 10 seconds of each other to perform a valid decode.  Local decoding is limited to a range of Â±Â½ zone in latitude and longitude from the last position update but can use an encoded position of either format with no time limit between updates. 

## T.5.1 Global Decoding For Airborne And Tis-B Position

Global decoding uses the bin numbers from one even position message and one odd position message to determine which zones contain the target and to recover the latitude and longitude.  The target could be anywhere on the globe and global decoding will still work correctly.   

## T.5.1.1 Airborne And Tis-B Latitude Global Decoding

A receiver needs to determine the zone index of the target because the zone index is not transmitted in position messages.  Global decoding works on the idea that the zone index is related to the offset between the southern edges of the even and odd zones that contain the latitude bin numbers transmitted in the two position messages.  The principle is illustrated for latitude in Figure T-12   

## 

Figure T-12 is a magnified view of the first three zones north of the equator in Figure T-
3.  The latitude bin numbers YZ0 and YZ1, which are received in separate even and odd position messages, are also shown. Zone Offset (ZO) is the difference in size between an even zone and an odd zone.  This difference, in degrees, is defined by Eq 8. 

$$Z O=D l a t_{1}-D l a t_{0}={\frac{360^{\circ}}{4N Z-1}}-{\frac{360^{\circ}}{4N Z}}={\frac{360^{\circ}}{4N Z(4N Z-1)}}$$ $$Z O={\frac{360^{\circ}}{(59)(60)}}$$
 
Observe in Figure T-12 that as the zone index number increases, the offset between zone southern boundaries also increases by the value of ZO.  The difference in latitude between the southern edges of the even and odd zones with index 1 is ZO and the difference in latitude between the southern edges of zones with index 2 is 2ZO.  The zone index number and offset between zone southern boundaries are linearly related.  
Therefore, the offset between zone southern boundaries can be used to determine the zone index number. Global decoding is easier to see if the following two assumptions are made: 

Assumption 1. P0 and P1 have the same latitude (e.g., stationary target or one 
moving due east or due west). 
Assumption 2. P0 and P1 are in zones with the same index number. 
Figure T-12 incorporates these assumptions.  The offset between zone southern boundaries (x) of the zones with index number 2 (measured in Zone Offsets) is the number of Zone Offsets from the southern edge of the even zone to YZ0 (ZOYZ0) minus the number of Zone Offsets from the southern edge of the odd zone to YZ1 (ZOYZ1
).  The result will be a number that is very close to an integer, which is the expected answer, because zones are always offset by an integer multiple of the Zone Offset.  If the result (x) is rounded to the nearest integer (j), the zone index number of the even or odd zone containing P0 or P1 will be equal to the number of Zone Offsets (j) between the zone southern boundaries.   
The number of Zone Offsets from the southern boundary of the zone to YZ
0 (ZOYZ0) or YZ1 (ZOYZ1) is the product of the number of Zone Offsets per zone (ZOi) and the zone fraction of YZ0 or YZ1
.  The number of Zone Offsets per zone is determined with Eq 9. 

$$Z O_{i}=\left\{{\frac{D l a t_{i}}{Z O}}\right\}=\left\{{\frac{\left({\frac{360^{\circ}}{4N Z-i}}\right)}{\left({\frac{360^{\circ}}{360^{\circ}}}\right)}}\right\}$$ $$\frac{\left(\frac{360^{\circ}}{4NZ-i}\right)}{\left(\frac{360^{\circ}}{4NZ\big{(}4NZ-1\big{)}}\right)}$$

$$ZO_{i}=\frac{4NZ\big{(}4NZ-1\big{)}}{4NZ-i}=\begin{cases}4NZ-1=59\ \ when\ i=0\ \big{(}even\big{)}\\ 4NZ=60\ \ when\ i=1\ \big{(}odd\big{)}\end{cases}$$
).   
The zone fraction is the bin number of P0 or P1 divided by the number of bins in the zone 
(YZi/2Nb i Eqs 10 & 11 define the number of zone offsets from the southern edge of a latitude zone to a bin with coordinate YZ
.   

$ZO_{YZ0}=59\Bigg{(}\frac{YZ_{0}}{2^{N}}\Bigg{)}$ for even zones_ Eq 10.

 

$ZO_{YZ1}=60\Bigg{(}\frac{YZ_{1}}{2^{3h}}\Bigg{)}$ for odd zones_

Eq 11
Subtracting Eq 11 from Eq 10 produces the number of Zone Offsets between the southern boundaries of the zones containing P0 and P1.   

$$x=ZO_{Y20}-ZO_{Y21}=59\Bigg{(}\frac{YZ_{0}}{2^{3h}}\Bigg{)}-60\Bigg{(}\frac{YZ_{1}}{2^{3h}}\Bigg{)}$$

Eq 12

$$x=\frac{59YZ_{0}-60YZ_{1}}{2^{3h}}$$
The number of Zone Offsets between zone southern boundaries must be an integer because of the way zones are defined.  P0 and P1 will not have exactly the same latitude in most cases because, even if the input latitudes are equal, the CPR encoding process will result in the centerline of the even bin being a slightly different latitude than the centerline of the odd bin.  Therefore, x must be rounded to the nearest integer to determine the true (i.e., integer) number of Zone Offsets between zone southern boundaries.  Eq 13 rounds the result of Eq 12 to the nearest integer.  The result is the equation given in A.1.7.7.b.   

$$j=f l o o r{\big|}\ x$$ $$=floor\bigg{(}x+\frac{1}{2}\bigg{)}$$ $$j=floor\bigg{(}\frac{59YZ_{0}-60YZ_{1}}{2^{30}}+\frac{1}{2}\bigg{)}$$ [A.1.7.7b]
Assumption 1 is not practical for real applications because aircraft and ground vehicles move during the period between position messages.  The rounding performed by Eq 13 
will accommodate up to Â½ Zone Offset between P0 and P1.  Assumption 1 can be relaxed to allow up to Â½ Zone Offset between P0 and P1 including vehicle movement, position errors and CPR quantization errors. 

Note:
  Appendix A, Section Â§A.1.7.7, Note 2 states that airborne position global decodes cannot be performed with even-odd position message pairs received more than 10 seconds apart because the distance between the reports for a target moving at 
1000 knots must be less than 3 NM.  The 3 NM limit comes from the requirement that the latitude (or longitude) change between P0 and P1 not exceed Â½ ZO.  
From Eq 8, ZO â 0.10169Â°. Â½ ZO â 0.05085Â° â *3.051 NM.* 
Assumption 2 is also impractical because P0 and P1 could end up in zones with different zone index numbers.  An example is shown in Figure T-13.   

$$\begin{array}{l}{{x=Z O_{Y Z0}\cdot Z O_{Y Z1}\approx\cdot59Z O+1Z O=\cdot58Z O}}\\ {{j=f l o o r(x+\sfrac{1}{1/2})=f l o o r(Z O_{Y Z0}\cdot Z O_{Y Z1}+\sfrac{1}{1/2})}}\\ {{j=\cdot59Z O+1Z O=\cdot58Z O}}\end{array}$$
In Figure T-13, P0 is in a zone with index number 2 while P1 is in a zone with index number 1.  The value of j in Figure T-13 will be -58 because Even Zone 1 is 59 Zone Offsets tall and the bottom of Odd Zone 1 is 1 Zone Offset above the bottom of Even Zone 1.  The Modulus function defined in Appendix A can be used to recover the zone index number when the offset between zone southern boundaries is negative.  The Modulus function is repeated in Eq 14. 

$MOD\big{(}x,y\big{)}=x-y\bullet floor\bigg{(}\frac{x}{y}\bigg{)}$ where $y\neq0$ [A.1.7.2.c]
The value of y is chosen to produce the zone index number from j.  Figure T-14 depicts the relationship between j and the index number of each zone.

## Relationship Between J And Zone Index

If y in Eq 14 is replaced with the number of even (60) or odd (59) zones around the globe (refer to the "tape measure" in Figure T-3) and if x is replaced with j, Eq 14 becomes: 

$MOD\big{(}j,4NZ-i\big{)}=j-\big{(}4NZ-i\big{)}\bullet floor\bigg{(}\frac{j}{4NZ-i}\bigg{)}$ Eq 15
The range of j is -59 to +58.  The quantity *4NZ-i* is either 59 or 60.  *floor(j/(4NZ-i))* will be 0 when j is positive and -1 when j is negative.  When j is positive, the second term of Eq 14 is zero and the zone index equals j.  When j is negative, the sign in front of the second term is positive and the value of the term is *4NZ-i*.  These forms of the equation match the forms shown in Figure T-14.  The zone index can be determined from j using Eq 16. 

i NZ j MOD Index Zone â = 4 ,   Eq 16  â = 60 , ( ) ( ) i j MOD Index Zone
The latitude is recovered using the zone index and bin number (YZi).  The bin number divided by the number of bins in a zone equals the zone fraction of the bin number. Multiplying the height of a zone by the sum of the zone index and the zone fraction will produce the bin centerline latitude of YZi
. 

$Rlat_{i}=Dlat_{i}\Bigg{(}MOD\big{(}j,60-i\big{)}+\frac{YZ_{i}}{2^{Nb}}\Bigg{)}$ Eq 17.

Rlat0 is the latitude of the even position message used in the global decode and *Rlat*1 is the latitude of the odd position message.  Recalling the tape measure of Figure T-3, the northern hemisphere will have zone index numbers between 0 and 14 and latitude values between 0Â° and 90Â°.  The southern hemisphere will have zone index numbers between 45 and 59 and latitude values between 270Â° and 360Â°.  Latitudes between 90Â° and 270Â° are invalid.  Southern hemisphere latitude values can be put in the range of 0Â° to -90Â° by subtracting 360Â° from the result of Eq 17 or by using Eq 18. 

$Rlat_{i}=MOD\big{(}Rlat_{i}+180^{\circ},360^{\circ}\big{)}-180^{\circ}$ Eq 18

## T.5.1.2 Airborne And Tis-B Longitude Global Decoding

Longitude global decoding is similar to latitude global decoding in that even and odd messages are used to count zone offsets and determine the zone index.  The concept of offset between zone southern boundaries is replaced with the idea of offset between zone western boundaries.  The measured offset is rounded to the nearest integer, which is named m instead of j, and the Modulus function is used to get the zone index from positive or negative values of m.  The rule that the even and odd positions must be within 
Â½ Zone Offset of each other also applies to longitude global decoding. 

The main difference between longitude global decoding and latitude global decoding is that the number of longitude zones around the globe varies with latitude.  There are always 60 even zones and 59 odd zones around the globe in latitude global decoding.  In longitude global decoding, there are between 1 and 59 longitude zones, as depicted in Figure T-2.   
The first step in longitude global decoding is to ensure that the values of NL for the even and odd positions are the same.  If they are different, the Zone Offset sizes will be different and the equation to compute the number of Zone Offsets will produce erroneous results.  Eqs 17 and 18 will produce one latitude for each bin number used in the latitude global decode (i.e., *Rlat*0 and Rlat1
).  NL for each of these latitudes is computed with Eq 
2.  If the NL values are different, the receiver must wait until a pair of even and odd messages arrive that produce the same value for NL. 

If the NL values are the same, longitude global decoding proceeds using the same logic as latitude global decoding.  In Eqs 8 and 9, the factor 4NZ, the number of even latitude zones around the globe, is replaced with NL, the number of even longitude zones around the globe at Rlat
0 and Rlat1
.  Eq 8 for the size of the Zone Offset becomes Eq 19. 

$ZO=Dlon_{1}-Dlon_{0}=\frac{360^{\circ}}{NL-1}-\frac{360^{\circ}}{NL}$ for $NL>1$ $$Z O={\frac{360^{\circ}}{N L{\big(}N L-1{\big)}}}\;f o r\;N L>1$$
Eq 9 for the number of Zone Offsets in a zone becomes Eq 20 

$$ZO_{i}=\left\{\frac{\mathit{Dlon}_{i}}{ZO}\right\}=\left\{\frac{\left(\frac{360^{\circ}}{\mathit{NL}-i}\right)}{\left(\frac{360^{\circ}}{\mathit{NL}\left(\mathit{NL}-1\right)}\right)}\right\}\text{for}\mathit{NL}>1$$ Eq 20 $$ZO_{i}=\frac{\mathit{NL}\left(\mathit{NL}-1\right)}{\mathit{NL}-i}=\left\{\frac{\mathit{NL}-1\text{when}i=0\text{(even)}}{\mathit{NL}\text{when}i=1\text{(odd)}}\right.\text{for}\mathit{NL}>1$$
Eq 10 for the number of Zone Offsets to an even bin becomes Eq 21. 

$ZO_{XZ0}=\left(NL-1\right)\!\!\left(\frac{XZ_{0}}{2^{3b}}\right)$ for even zones_ Eq 21
Eq 11 for the number of Zone Offsets to an odd bin becomes Eq 22. 

$ZO_{X21}=\left(NL\right)\left(\frac{XZ_{1}}{2^{\frac{3}{20}}}\right)$ for odd zones_
Subtracting Eq 22 from Eq 21 produces the number of Zone Offsets between the western boundaries of the zones containing P0 and P1. 

$$x=ZO_{XZ0}-ZO_{XZ1}=(NL-1)\Bigg{(}\frac{XZ_{0}}{2^{Nb}}\Bigg{)}-(NL)\Bigg{(}\frac{XZ_{1}}{2^{Nb}}\Bigg{)}$$

Eq 23

$$x=\frac{(NL-1)XZ_{0}-(NL)XZ_{1}}{2^{Nb}}$$
The result of Eq 23 must be rounded to the nearest integer.  Instead of assigning the result to j, as is done for latitude in Eq 13, the result is assigned to m. 

$$m=floor\bigg{(}x+\frac{1}{2}\bigg{)}$$ Eq 24 $$m=floor\bigg{(}\frac{(NL-1)XZ_{0}-(NL)XZ_{1}}{2^{\text{'b'}}}+\frac{1}{2}\bigg{)}$$ (A.1.7.7.f)
As was the case with Eq 13, the rounding performed by Eq 24 will accommodate up to Â½ 
Zone Offset between P0 and P1 including vehicle movement, position errors and CPR 
quantization errors. m will behave the same as j in that the value of m will be negative when the even and odd longitude zones containing P0 and P1 have different Zone Index numbers.  The Zone Index is recovered from m in the same manner that it is from j.  Again, the term 4NZ is replaced with NL and j is replaced with m in Eq 15 to form Eq 25. 

$MOD\big{(}m,NL-i\big{)}=m-\big{(}NL-i\big{)}\bullet floor\Bigg{(}\frac{m}{NL-i}\Bigg{)}\;NL>1$ Eq 25
Eq 16 becomes Eq 26. 

_Zone Index = MOD$\left(m,NL-i\right)$ for $NL>1$_
The recovered longitude *Rlon*i is determined in the same manner as the recovered latitude Rlati
. 

$$Rlon_{i}=Dlon_{i}\bigg{(}MOD\big{(}m,NL-i\big{)}+\frac{XZ_{i}}{2^{3b}}\bigg{)}\text{for}NL>1$$
Rloni will be a value between 0Â° and 360Â°.  It can be placed in the range of -180Â° to 
+180Â° with Eq 28. 

$Rlon_{i}=MOD\big{(}Rlon_{i}+180^{\circ},360^{\circ}\big{)}-180^{\circ}$ Eq 28
Eqs 19, 20, 25, 26 and 27 will be indeterminate when NL=1.  From Eq 2, NL will be 1 at latitudes greater than 87Â°N or less than -87Â°S.  When NL = 1, *Dlon*i, the longitude zone width, equals 360Â° (ref Eq 4) for both even and odd encoding.  With one zone, there is no need to determine the zone index.  Longitude can be recovered by multiplying the zone width (*Dlon*i) by the zone fraction (XZi/2Nb
).  While this is a straightforward approach, the algorithm description in Appendix A does not handle NL=1 this way.  
When NL is 1, Eq 24 (A.1.7.7.f) for m reduces to either 0 or -1 for all values of XZ
i and Nb.  Section Â§A.1.7.7.g defines a variable ni
. 

$n_{i}=$ greater of [NL($Rlat_{i}$) - $i$] and 1
Section Â§A.1.7.7g also defines a formula for *Rlon*i in terms of m and ni
. 

$Rlon_{i}=Dlon_{i}\bigg{(}MOD\big{(}m,n_{i}\big{)}+\frac{XZ_{i}}{2^{17}}\bigg{)}$ Eq 30

[A.1.7.7.g]
When m = 0 and ni = 1, *MOD(m, n*i) equals 0.  When m = -1, *MOD(m, n*i) also evaluates to 0.  In either case, Eq 30 for *Rlon*i reduces to the zone width (*Dlon*i) multiplied by the zone fraction (XZi/217
).  This is the expected result. 

i For values of NL > 1, n will equal *(NL - i)* and Eqs 27 and 30 will be equivalent. 

Section Â§A.1.7.7.e redefines Dlon i in terms of ni
.  Eqs 4 and 31 are equivalent.  The reason for the redefinition is not clear. 

$$\begin{array}{l}{\it Dlon}_{i}=\frac{360^{\circ}}{n_{i}}\\ \end{array}$$

## T.5.2 Surface Global Decoding

Surface global decoding is the same as airborne and TIS-B local decoding except that the latitude and longitude zone widths *Dlat*i and *Dlon*i are reduced by a factor of 4.  Surface position encoding is performed with 19 bits of resolution (reference Table T-2) but only the 17 least significant bits are transmitted in the surface position message (Â§A.1.7.3.f). Dropping the two most significant bits reduces the number of bins per zone by a factor of 4 but the width of the bins must remain the same for both encoding and decoding.  
Therefore, the latitude and longitude zone widths *Dlat*i and *Dlon*i used in decoding must also be smaller by a factor of 4.  Nb for surface decoding is equal to 17 rather than 19 
because the number of bins in each of the reduced size zones is 217 instead of 219. 

The smaller zone width means that the length of the "tailor's tape measure" described in Figure T-3 will be Â¼ of the distance around the globe.  Calculations for recovered latitude and longitude *Rlat*i and Rloni will be in the range of 0Â° to 90Â° (i.e., northern hemisphere and 0Â° to 90Â° east longitude).  Additional solutions will exist at 90Â°, 180Â° and 270Â° from the calculated latitude and longitude.  The receiver must choose the appropriate solution and that solution may be in a different quadrant of the globe than the receiver.  Latitude solutions between 90Â° and 270Â° are discarded.  If there were targets broadcasting surface position messages near either of the poles, longitude ambiguity could be a problem.  This is an unlikely scenario. 

For surface global and local decoding, the latitude zone width is given by Eq 32 
(reference Eq 1). 

$$DIat_{i}=\frac{1}{4}\Bigg{(}\frac{360^{\circ}}{4\,NZ-i}\Bigg{)}=\frac{90^{\circ}}{4\,NZ-i}$$ Eq 32 $$NZ=15$$ (A.1.7.8a) $$i=0$$ for even encoding $$i=1$$ for odd encoding
Latitude Zone Offset defined in Eq 8 will also be smaller by a factor of 4.  Eqs 9 through 18 are valid for surface global decoding as long as the correct values of Dlati
, Nb and ZO 
are used.  
Rlat i from Eq 17 will be between 0Â° and 90Â°.  An additional solution in the southern hemisphere will be located at Rlati
 - 90Â°.  The receiver must choose the closer of the two. 

i NL is calculated using Eq 2 and Rlat but the result is the number of longitude zones in one quadrant of the globe rather than the number of zones around the globe.  
Before proceeding with longitude global decoding, the receiver must verify that NL(Rlat
0) = NL(Rlat1
).  If not, the decode is aborted and the process is restarted with a new pair of even and odd position messages. 

For surface global and local decoding, the longitude zone width is obtained by dividing Eq 4 by 4.  This results in Eq 33: 

$$Dlon_{i}=\begin{cases}\dfrac{90^{\circ}}{NL\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i}\,,&\text{when}NL\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i>0\\ 90^{\circ},&\text{when}NL\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}-i=0\end{cases}$$
Longitude Zone Offset defined in Eq 19 will also be smaller by a factor of 4.  Eqs 20 
through 27 are valid for surface global decoding as long as the correct values of Dloni
 
and ZO are used.  
Rlon i will be between 0Â° and 90Â°.  Additional solutions will exist at longitudes of 90Â°, 
180Â° and 270Â° to the east of *Rlon*i.  The receiver must choose the appropriate longitude which will be, in most cases, the closest longitude. 

## T.5.3 Airborne And Tis-B Locally Unambiguous Decoding

Local decoding uses a "reference position" and the contents of one position message to recover the latitude and longitude of the target.  The difference between the target position and the reference position must be less than Â½ of a zone in both latitude and longitude.  The reference position is usually the last successfully decoded position received from the target.  Since Â½ of a zone is approximately 180 NM for airborne position and 45 NM for surface position, the position change between two successfully decoded position messages is unlikely to exceed the Â½ zone limit. The effect of the local decoding algorithm is to create a sliding region 1 zone wide in latitude and longitude, centered on the reference position.  Because the region is 1 zone wide, each bin number occurs only once in the region, ensuring a unique result for each encoded latitude and longitude.  Figure T-15 illustrates the behavior of the sliding region for latitude.  The number of bins per latitude zone has been reduced to 8 (i.e., Nb = 3) to simplify the figure.  Behavior of the sliding region is the same for longitude except the figure is rotated 90Â° clockwise and references to latitude are replaced with longitude. 

 
s moves from one grey region to another.  
The sliding region position changes when lat In the unlikely event that the target position is more than Â½ zone from the reference position, the target position will appear to "wrap around" the other side of the Â±Â½ zone region.  For example, if the target was in bin 7 (YZ=7) in the upper zone with the reference position between YZ=1 and YZ=2 (see left side of Figure T-15), the recovered latitude would be for YZ=7 in the lower zone.  This wrap around behavior occurs because the algorithm assumes the target is within Â½ zone of the reference position and the only bin number 7 is in the lower zone.  In effect, the recovered position is shifted one zone from the actual position in the direction of the reference position.  Some older implementations used the receiver position as the reference position instead of the last target position.  Surface targets more than Â½ zone away (45 nautical miles) would decode incorrectly as described above. 

The local decoding algorithm may be easier to visualize with a simplified example. Imagine a road with a marker at each kilometer stating the number of kilometers from the beginning of the road.  A person walking along the road toward the end, who is known to be within Â½ km of the 22 km marker, announces they are 0.2 km past the last marker.  
What is their location relative to the beginning of the road?  Since they are within Â½ km of marker 22 and they are 0.2 km past the last marker, they are 22.2 km from the beginning of the road.  Suppose they had announced their position as 0.7 km past the last marker.  Their location would be 21.7 km from the beginning of the road because this is the only location that is both 0.7 km past the last marker and within Â½ km of 22 km marker.  This is the logic embodied in the local decoding algorithm.  

## T.5.3.1 Airborne And Tis-B Latitude Local Decoding

Local decoding determines latitude first in order to compute NL and then determines longitude.  Latitude is calculated from the bin number and CPR format transmitted in the position message, and the zone index, which is computed from the last known target position.  The algorithm sums the Zone Index of the reference position (RP) and the difference between the Zone Indices of the reference position and the encoded position (EP) to obtain the Zone Index of the encoded position.  

$ZI_{EP}=ZI_{RP}+\Delta ZI_{RP\to EP}$
Because the encoded position is assumed to be within Â½ zone of the reference position, the difference in zone indices ÎZIRPâEP
  is limited to -1, 0 or +1. 

RP
The Zone Index of the reference position ZI
 is determined with Eq 35. 

$ZI_{{}_{RF}}=floor\Bigg{(}\frac{lat_{{}_{s}}}{Data_{{}_{i}}}\Bigg{)}$ Eq 35
lats is the reference latitude.  Dlati is the latitude zone width from Eq 1.  The first zone north of the equator has an index number of zero.  Latitude Zone Index numbers south of the equator start at -1 and increase in magnitude toward the South Pole.  Note that southern hemisphere latitude zone indices for local decoding are numbered differently than the zone indices for global decoding. 

The difference between the latitude zone indices of the reference position and of the encoded position (ÎZI
RPâEP) is the difference between the latitude zone fractions of the reference position and the encoded position (fRP - fEP), rounded to the nearest integer.  
This is shown for fRP > Â½ in Figure T-16.   
fRP is given by Eq 36. 

$f_{{}_{BP}}=\frac{MOD(lat_{{}_{s}},Dlat_{{}_{i}})}{Dlat_{{}_{i}}}$ Eq 36
fEP is given by Eq 37. 

$$f_{EP}=\frac{YZ_{i}}{2^{3h}}$$
The RP and EP are assumed to lie within the Â±Â½ zone local decoding region (the shaded area in Figure T-16), but the RP and EP may be in different latitude zones (e.g., RP and EP2).  The difference in zone fractions is used to determine whether the EP is in the same zone as the RP, one zone to the north or one zone to the south. 

The conversion from the difference in zone fractions (fRP - fEP) to the difference in zone indices (ÎZI*RPâEP*) is done by rounding as shown in Eq 38.  

$\Lambda$ZI${}_{RP\to EP}=floor\Bigg{(}f_{RP}-f_{EP}+\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{)}$ Eq 38
If the two positions are in the same zone, the difference in zone fractions will always be between -Â½ and +Â½.  Eq 38 will produce a difference in Zone Indices (ÎZI*RPâEP*) of 0. 

If EP is in the zone to the north of RP (e.g., EP2 in Figure T-16), the difference in zone indices ÎZI*RPâEP* is expected to be +1.  fEP will be less than fRP - Â½ and therefore (fRP - 
fEP) will be greater than +Â½.  Applying Eq 38 for ÎZIRPâEP to (fRP - fEP) will produce the expected value of +1.  This value is added to the zone index of RP to get the zone index of EP (n+1). 

The case where fRP < Â½ is shown in Figure T-17. 

 
If EP is in the zone to the south of RP (e.g., EP1 in Figure T-17), the difference in zone indices ÎZI*RPâEP*  is expected to be -1.  fEP will be greater than fRP + Â½ and therefore (fRP - 
fEP) will be less than -Â½.  Applying Eq 38 for ÎZIRPâEP to (fRP - fEP) will produce the expected value of -1.  This value is added to the zone index of RP to get the zone index of EP (n-1). Eq 38 produces the correct difference in zone indices for any two reference position and encoded position zone fractions.  Substituting Eqs 35 through 38 into Eq 34 and rearranging results in Eq 39. 

$ZI_{EP}=ZI_{RP}+\Delta ZI_{RP\to EP}$

$ZI_{EP}=floor\Bigg{(}\frac{lat_{s}}{\mathit{Dlat}_{i}}\Bigg{)}+floor\Bigg{(}f_{RP}-f_{EP}+\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{)}$ Eq 39

Eq 39 $$ZI_{{}_{EP}}=floor\Bigg{(}\frac{lat_{{}_{s}}}{Dlat_{{}_{i}}}\Bigg{)}+floor\Bigg{(}\frac{MOD(lat_{{}_{s}},Dlat_{{}_{i}})}{Data_{{}_{i}}}-\frac{YZ_{{}_{i}}}{2^{Nb}}+\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{)}$$

$$j=ZI_{{}_{EP}}=floor\Bigg{(}\frac{lat_{{}_{s}}}{Data_{{}_{i}}}\Bigg{)}+floor\Bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{MOD(lat_{{}_{s}},Dlat_{{}_{i}})}{Data_{{}_{i}}}-\frac{YZ_{{}_{i}}}{2^{Nb}}\Bigg{)}$$
The latitude of the encoded position is the latitude zone width, *Dlat*i, multiplied by the sum of the encoded position zone index j and the encoded position zone fraction. 

$$Rlat_{i}=Dlat_{i}\Bigg{(}j+\frac{YZ_{i}}{2^{N_{\rm b}}}\Bigg{)}$$ Eq 40

## T.5.3.2 Airborne And Tis-B Longitude Local Decoding

Local decoding of longitude is similar to local decoding of latitude.  Longitude Zone Width is calculated with Eq 4, which is repeated in [Â§A.1.7.5.d].  Then, the longitude zone index is computed using Eq 41.

Eq 41 is the same as Eq 39 except the following variable substitutions have been made: 

s 
- 
RP latitude lats replaced with RP latitude lon
i replaced with Longitude Zone Width Dlon
i 
- 
Latitude Zone Width Dlat
i replaced with Longitude bin number XZ
- 
Latitude bin number YZ
i 
- 
EP latitude zone index j replaced longitude zone index m 
ZI and f in Eq 41 refer to longitude zone indices and zone fractions whereas the same variables in Eq 39 refer to latitude zone indices and zone fractions. Longitude zone indices start at zero on the east side of the prime meridian and increase with increasing east longitude.  If RP longitude is between 0Â° and 360Â°, the longitude zone indices will range from 0 to 59 and the recovered longitude *Rlon*i will be in the range of 0Â° to 360Â°.  If RP longitude is between -180Â° and +180Â°, the longitude zone indices will range from -30 to +29 and the recovered longitude Rloni will be in the range of -180Â° to +180Â°.  
i The longitude of the encoded position is the longitude zone width, Dlon
, multiplied by the sum of the encoded position zone index m and the encoded position zone fraction.

## T.5.4 Surface Local Decoding

Surface local decoding is the same as airborne and TIS-B local decoding except that the latitude and longitude zone widths *Dlat*i and *Dlon*i are reduced by a factor of 4.  Surface position encoding is performed with 19 bits of resolution (reference Table T-2) but only the 17 least significant bits are transmitted in the surface position message (Â§A.1.7.3.f). Dropping the two most significant bits reduces the number of bins per zone by a factor of 4 but the width of the bins must remain the same for both encoding and decoding. Therefore, the zone widths for decoding must also be smaller by a factor of 4.  Nb for 
. 

surface decoding is equal to 17 rather than 19 because the number of bins in each of the reduced size zones is 217 instead of 219
The Â±Â½ zone sliding region is applicable for surface local decoding, but since the zone width is smaller by a factor of 4, the sliding region width will be smaller by a factor of 4 also.  This means that instead of a surface target needing to be within approximately Â±180 nautical miles of the reference position, the surface target must be within approximately Â±45 nautical miles.  
Eqs 34 through 40 are applicable for surface latitude local decoding as long as the reduced latitude zone width Dlati from Eq 32 and the correct value for Nb are used in the calculations.  
i NL is calculated using Eq 2 and Rlat but the result is the number of longitude zones in one quadrant of the globe rather than the number of zones around the globe. 

i Eqs 41 through 42 are applicable for surface longitude local decoding as long as the reduced longitude zone width Dlon from Eq 33 is used in the calculations.  

## T.6 Additional Information

The preceding sections describe how the CPR algorithms should work.  This section describes specific issues that have arisen in terms of the concepts described above.  

## T.6.1 Nl Transition Latitudes

This section defines the 32 bit Angular Weighted Binary (32bAWB) input latitudes at which the value of NL changes.  In 2006, Airservices Australia reported anomalies in encoded longitude reported by certain aircraft.  The root cause of the longitude jumps was inconsistency between the encoded latitude and the value of NL used to encode the longitude.  RTCA SC-186 WG-3 added the position reasonableness tests in sections 
Â§2.2.10.3.1, Â§2.2.10.3.2 and Â§2.2.10.6 to detect the erroneous longitudes caused by incorrect NL values as well as erroneous positions caused by undetected bit errors and other mechanisms.  During the review of this Appendix, RTCA SC-186 WG-3 requested that a table be added showing the 32bAWB input latitudes at which the value of NL 
changes. The CPR encoding process is described in Section T.4.  The relevant steps leading to the selection of NL are: 

1. Determine the latitude zone width Dlati
 (Eq 1) 
i
2. Determine the bin number YZ
 (Eq 5) 
i
3. Determine the bin centerline latitude Rlat
 (Eq 6) 
i
 (Eq 2 or Eq 3) 
4. Determine NL using Rlat
A crucial and commonly misunderstood point is that the value of NL selected during encoding is NOT based directly on the latitude input to the encoder.  NL is determined from Rlat i and *Rlat*i is dependent on the input latitude.  The reason for this is the decoder can determine only *Rlat*i and must use the value of *Rlat*i to determine NL.  If the value of NL used during encoding is not consistent with the encoded latitude, the decoder would select a different value for NL and produce an incorrect longitude.   
Figure T-18 depicts the relationships between input latitude, bin centerline latitude and the NL transition latitude for even and odd airborne encoding at the 53/52 NL transition 
(approx 27.9Â° south latitude).  Input latitudes at or above the bin boundary will have *Rlat*i values (i.e., bin centerline latitudes) above the NL transition latitude and an NL value of 
53.  Input latitudes below the bin boundary will have *Rlat*i values below the NL transition latitude and an NL value of 52.  Note that latitudes above the bin boundaries but below the NL transition latitude still result in NL=53.  An encoder that based NL directly on the input latitude, instead of *Rlat*i, would incorrectly select NL=52 for these latitudes. 

 
Given the purpose of this section and the behavior described above, the 32bAWB latitudes of interest are the ones that straddle the latitude of the bin boundary closest to each NL transition latitude.  The latitude of the closest bin boundary will depend on the CPR format (i.e., even or odd) and the number of bits used for encoding Nb.  The process to determine the 32bAWB NL transition boundary latitudes is as follows:   

1. Determine the NL transition latitudes using Eq 3. 
2. Determine the bin numbers YZ*north* and YZsouth
 of the bins that straddle each NL 
transition latitude 
$$YZ_{{}_{\it{north}}}=floor\Bigg{(}2^{{}^{\it{3b}}}\bullet\frac{MOD\big{(}lat_{{}_{\it{north}}},{\it{Dlat}}_{{}_{i}}\big{)}}{{\it{Dlat}}_{{}_{i}}}\Bigg{)}+1$$ Eq 43 $$YZ_{{}_{\it{south}}}=floor\Bigg{(}2^{{}^{\it{3b}}}\bullet\frac{MOD\big{(}lat_{{}_{\it{south}}},{\it{Dlat}}_{{}_{i}}\big{)}}{{\it{Dlat}}_{{}_{i}}}\Bigg{)}$$ Eq 44
 

3. Determine the bin centerline latitude Rlati
 of the straddling bins using Eq 6 
4. Average the bin centerline latitudes to get the bin boundary latitude 
5. Find the 32bAWB NL latitudes that straddle the bin boundary latitude

6. Using Eq 7, verify that the encoded longitude changes between the 32bAWB 
latitudes when the input longitude remains constant.  This is an indication that NL changed. 
Eq 44 is the same as Eq 5 except the first bin with a bin centerline at or south of the NL 
transition latitude is selected.  Eq 45 selects the bin just to the north of the bin selected in Eq 44.  Special handling is required for the NL transition latitude at 87Â° south when even CPR format is used.  Eq 43 will select the bin with a bin centerline that coincides with the 2/1 NL transition latitude at 87Â° south and Eq 44 will select the bin just to the north.  
Since NL is defined to be 2 at 87Â° south and 2 at the centerline of the next bin to the north, NL will not change at the bin boundary between these two bins.  Therefore, the northern bin should be at 87Â° south and the southern bin should be the next bin to the south. The ceiling function in Eq 46 produces the number of 32bAWB bins from the equator to the 32bAWB latitude just north of the bin boundary.  The number of bins multiplied by the height of each bin (360Â°/232) is the north 32bAWB latitude.  Eq 46 gives the next 
32bAWB latitude to the south.  The ceiling function is used instead of the floor function to address cases where the 32bAWB latitude coincides with the bin boundary.  An input latitude on the bin boundary should "round up" to the next more northerly bin.  The 
"ceiling/ceiling-1" approach provides a northern latitude on the bin boundary and a southern latitude on 32bAWB bin to the south. 

Verification using Eq 7 is performed with constant input longitudes of 45Â° for surface encoding and 180Â° for airborne and TIS-B encoding.  Any value could be used but these values create encoded longitude values that represent either the edge of a zone or the exact middle of a zone. 

Table T-3 through Table T-8 present the northern and southern 32bAWB boundary latitudes for each transition latitude with even and odd, surface, airborne and TIS-B 
encodings.  The expected outputs in Table T-3 are identical to those in Table 2-140.  The input latitudes in Table 2-140 are the bin centerlines of the even format, surface encoded bins that straddle each NL transition latitude.  The distance between the bin centerlines is approximately 127 cm for even format and 130 cm for odd.  The distance between the 32bAWB boundary latitudes is approximately 0.93 cm.  Even though the separation between the 32bAWB boundary latitudes is much smaller than the test latitudes in Table 2-140, both sets of latitudes are on opposite sides of the bin boundary and both will generate the same values of NL and the same encoded longitudes.  Encoders that determine NL incorrectly from the input latitude rather than from *Rlati* will produce the expected outputs using the inputs from Table 2-140 but will not produce the expected outputs using the 32bAWB boundary latitudes presented in Table T-3.

## T.7 Derivation Of Equations For Nl And Nl Transition Latitudes

This section provides derivations of the equations relating NL to NL Transition Latitudes. The number of longitude zones around the globe decreases as the magnitude of latitude increases as explained in Section Â§T.3.2.  The transition latitudes obtained from Eq 3 result in longitude zones with constant great circle length.  The great circle length of an even longitude zone measured at the upper (i.e., closer to the nearest pole) transition latitude is the same as the height of an even latitude zone.  The height of an even latitude zone obtained from Eq 1 is 6Â° (360Â°/4NZ = 2Ï/4NZ radians).   
 
 
Figure T-19 illustrates the great circle length of 3 longitude zones with NL=2 (arc AB), NL=3 (arc CD) and NL=4 (arc EF). 



Transition latitudes are chosen to ensure constant great circle length for each integer value of NL.  The Spherical Law of Cosines is used to establish the relationship between NL and the transition latitude.  Variables used in the application of the Spherical Law of Cosines to this problem are depicted in Figure T-20. 

Vertices "A," "B" and "C" in Figure T-20 have interior angles "A," "B" and "C."  
Variables "a," "b" and "c" are the great circle arc lengths of the sides opposite vertices 
"A," "B" and "C" in the spherical triangle ABC. The Spherical Law of Cosines, expressed in terms of the variables in Figure T-20, is given in Eq 47. 

) cos( ) sin( ) sin( ) cos( ) cos( ) cos( C b a b a c + =   Eq 47 
The Spherical Law of Cosines is defined to apply on a unit sphere where the distances "a," "b" and "c" are equal to the angle, in radians, of the great circle segment containing each arc.  If the NL transition latitude is defined as Ï, the angle of the circle segments containing arcs CA and CB is (Ï/2 - Ï).  Thus, the lengths "a" and "b" will be (Ï/2 - Ï) on a unit sphere.  The angle of great circle segment AB, and the great circle length of the longitude zone on the unit sphere, was defined earlier to be 2Ï/4NZ = Ï/2NZ.  Spherical angle C is the longitude difference between the ends of one longitude zone.  This value is the number of radians in a full circle divided by the number of longitude zones around the globe.  Thus, C is 2Ï/NL.  Substituting these parameters into Eq 47 results in Eq 48. 

$$\cos\!\left({\frac{\pi}{2N Z}}\right)=\cos\!\left({\frac{\pi}{2}}-\varphi\right)\!\cos\!\left({\frac{\pi}{2}}-\varphi\right)+\sin\!\left({\frac{\pi}{2}}-\varphi\right)\!\sin\!\left({\frac{\pi}{2}}-\varphi\right)\!\cos\!\left({\frac{2\pi}{N L}}\right)\,\mathrm{Eq\,\,48}$$
 
The following trigonometric identities are used to simplify Eq 48. 

$$\cos\Biggl{(}\frac{\pi}{2}-\varphi\Biggr{)}=\sin\bigl{(}\varphi\bigr{)}$$ Eq 49 $$\sin\Biggl{(}\frac{\pi}{2}-\varphi\Biggr{)}=\cos\bigl{(}\varphi\bigr{)}$$ Eq 50
Applying Eq 49 and 50 to Eq 48 and combining factors results in Eq 51. 

$$\cos\Biggl{(}\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\Biggr{)}=\sin^{2}\bigl{(}\varphi\bigr{)}+\cos^{2}\bigl{(}\varphi\bigr{)}\cos\Biggl{(}\frac{2\pi}{NL}\Biggr{)}$$
Rearranging and applying the identity sin2Ï + cos2
Ï = 1 produces Eq 52. 

$$\cos\Biggl{(}\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\Biggr{)}=1-\cos^{2}\bigl{(}\varphi\bigr{)}+\cos^{2}\bigl{(}\varphi\bigr{)}\cos\Biggl{(}\frac{2\pi}{NL}\Biggr{)}$$
Eq 52 can be rearranged to express Ï as a function of NL as in Eq 3 or NL as a function of 
Ï as in Eq 2.  The following derivations solve Eq 52 for Ï first and then for NL.  
Isolating terms with Ï on the left side of the equation gives Eq 53. 

$$\cos^{2}\left(\varphi\right)-\cos^{2}\left(\varphi\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{NL}\right)=1-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\right)$$
Pulling cos2
(Ï) out of the left side and dividing both sides by 1-cos(2Ï/NL) creates Eq 54. 

$$\cos^{2}\left(\varphi\right)=\frac{1-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\right)}{1-\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{NL}\right)}$$
Finally, isolate Ï by taking the square root and the arccosine of both sides. 

$$\varphi=\arccos\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos\!\left(\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\right)}{1-\cos\!\left(\frac{2\pi}{NL}\right)}}$$

Eq 55
The result of Eq 55 will be in radians.  NL Transition latitudes are usually expressed in degrees.  Eq 56 converts Eq 55 into degrees. 

$$lat_{\text{\tiny{NLTransition}}}=\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\bullet\arccos\sqrt{\frac{1-\cos\!\left(\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\right)}{1-\cos\!\left(\frac{2\pi}{NL}\right)}}$$ (A.1.7.2d, $$\text{Note5}$$ )
Eq 56 is identical to Eq 3. Eq 2 for NL as a function of latitude can also be derived from Eq 52.  Start by isolating terms with NL on the left side of the equation. 

$$-\cos^{2}\left(\varphi\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{NL}\right)=1-\cos^{2}\left(\varphi\right)-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\right)$$
Divide both sides by âcos2
(Ï). 

$$\cos\!\left(\frac{2\pi}{NL}\right)\!=\!\frac{1-\cos^{2}\!\left(\varphi\right)\!-\cos\!\left(\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\right)}{-\cos^{2}\!\left(\varphi\right)}$$
Rearrange the right side. 

$$\cos\!\left(\frac{2\pi}{NL}\right)\!=\!\frac{-\cos^{2}\!\left(\varphi\right)}{-\cos^{2}\!\left(\varphi\right)}+\frac{1-\cos\!\left(\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\right)}{-\cos^{2}\!\left(\varphi\right)}$$
Simplify the right side and take the arccosine of both sides. 

$$\frac{2\pi}{NL}=\arccos\left(1-\frac{1-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\right)}{\cos^{2}\left(\varphi\right)}\right)$$
Invert both sides and then multiply the resulting equation by 2Ï. 

$$NL=2\pi\Bigg{[}\arccos\left(1-\frac{1-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2\,NZ}\right)}{\cos^{2}\left(\varphi\right)}\right)\Bigg{]}^{-1}$$
Since the most common application of this equation is to determine NL for recovered latitudes (*Rlat*i) expressed in degrees, Ï is replaced with *Rlat*i multiplied by Ï/180Â° (to convert degrees to radians).  The equation for NL in Section Â§A.1.7.2d takes the absolute value of *Rlat*i.  This seems unnecessary because the cosine function in which *Rlat*i is used is symmetrical about an input angle of 0 and will yield the same outputs for positive and negative inputs.  However, taking the absolute value of Rlati does not appear to change the behavior of the equation, so it will be shown here for consistency with Section Â§A.1.7.2d. 

The number of longitude zones around the globe (i.e., NL) must be an integer because all of the longitude zones at a given latitude have the same width and there are no partial zones.  Eq 61 is continuous and smooth for â(29/60)Ï â¤ Ï â¤ +(29/60)Ï radians (-87Â° â¤ 
Rlat i â¤ +87Â°) and will produce values of NL that are not integers.  Therefore, Eq 61 must be modified to produce the correct integer number of longitude zones.  Figure T-19 and Figure T-20 and the assumptions made to formulate Eq 48 show that the number of longitude zones NL is associated with the NL Transition Latitude that is closer to the nearest pole.  NL decreases as the magnitude of latitude increases so application of the floor function to the right hand side of Eq 61 results in the value of NL that is associated with the more polar of the two transition latitudes bounding each longitude zone. Replacing Ï with Rlati and adding the floor function to Eq 61 results in Eq 62. 

$$NL\big{(}Rlat_{i}\big{)}=floor\left(2\pi\Bigg{[}\arccos\left(1-\frac{1-\cos\!\left(\frac{\pi}{2NZ}\right)}{\cos^{2}\!\left(\frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}}|Rlat_{i}|\right)\right)}\right)\right]^{-1}\Bigg{)}$$ Eq 62 (A.1.7.2.d)
NL values for certain latitudes are specified separately from Eq 62.  The first is at the equator.  Eq 62 gives NL=60 at the equator.  Since NL is 59 immediately north and south of the equator, NL is specified as 59 at 0Â° latitude to preclude having a different value of NL for 1 bin at the equator.  NL is designated as 2 at Â±87Â° even though Eq 62 has a value of 2 at these latitudes.  Some implementations produced NL=1 at Â±87Â° because of errors caused by limited numerical precision.  Since Â±87Â° are the only transition latitudes that correspond exactly to values of *Rlat* (i.e., there are even bin centerlines at exactly Â±87Â°), these MOPS were changed to state the value of NL explicitly at these critical latitudes.  
NL is defined explicitly as 1 for latitudes greater than Â±87Â°, because Eq 62 is undefined. The value of the input to the arccosine function in Eq 62 becomes less than -1 at latitudes with magnitudes greater than 87Â°. 

## T.8 Summary

This Appendix presents an expanded description of the CPR equations given in Appendix A.  Any point on the globe is described by zone numbers, bin numbers and a CPR format in the CPR coordinate system.  The encoding algorithm converts latitude and longitude into bin numbers.  Global decoding is used to find the position of a target when it is first acquired, and recovers latitude and longitude from a pair of even and odd messages.  
Local decoding is used when a previous position is known and recovers latitude and longitude from a single position message and last known position of the target.  Surface decoding is the same as airborne decoding except the surface zone size is Â¼ of the airborne zone size.

## Total And Uncompensated Latency In 1090 Mhz Extended Squitter Ads-B U.1 Introduction

The total latency of position information is the delay between the time of applicability of the position measurement and the time of transmission of that position.  Delay may be compensated for by advancing the position in the direction of travel.  The uncompensated latency of position information is that portion of total latency that is not (or will not be) compensated for.  When the ADS-B transmitting subsystem is synchronized with the position source, uncompensated latency can essentially be eliminated by setting the TIME (T) bit equal to ONE ("1") (see Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.2, Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.2, Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.2 and 
Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.2).  Without synchronization, uncompensated latency is introduced by unknown delays in the data stream.  In this case, the requirements in Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.3,

## U.2 Description Of The Problem

The functional architecture of a transmitting aircraft is depicted in Figure U-1.   
The interfaces are defined as follows: 

- 
A1: Input to the Measuring Equipment  
- 
B1: Output of the Measuring Equipment 
- 
C: Input to the ADS-B Transmitting Equipment 
- 
D: Output of the ADS-B Transmitting Equipment (i.e., the transmission) 

## U.3 Timing Notation

Any absolute time defined below is with respect to a common frame of reference.  For simplicity, the timescale can be assumed to be GNSS time.   
For a piece of data in the stream and an interface X , let X
T  be the time that the data crosses interface X .  Let X
TOA  be the true time of applicability of the data that crosses interface X .  It is emphasized that X
TOA  represents the truthâi.e. it is the ideal time of applicability of the data at interface X .   
In the case of position data, as it moves through the data stream it may be advanced in the direction of travel to compensate for timing.  For interfaces X  and Y  define Y
X
T
â

 to be the total amount of time compensated for by the equipment between interfaces X  and Y .   
Key examples of this notation are listed below:

and this is the ideal time of applicability.

 is the total amount of extrapolation performed by the ADS-B Transmitting 
Equipment.   
The general timing diagram is presented in Figure U-2.   
Lastly, let *TTOA* be the transmit time of applicability.  The value of *TTOA* is the time that is expected to be decoded by the ADS-B Receiving subsystem as being the time to which the position contained in the ADS-B Airborne or Surface Position Message is accurate.  Position extrapolation is performed within the ADS-B Transmitting subsystem so as to minimize the error in *TTOA*.  The transmit time of applicability varies according to the T-bit: 

- 
When the T-bit is set to zero, the receiver takes the time of applicability of the received data to be the time of reception, so 
D
T
TTOA =
.   
- 
When the T-bit is set to one, *TTOA* is the appropriate 200 ms GNSS epoch, 
determined by the CPR (F) bit and the time of transmission as per Â§2.2.3.2.3.6.   

## U.4 Latency Definitions

Total latency (TL ) is the amount of time taken to broadcast a position relative to the time of applicability of the position measurement.  Using the above notation, 

$$T L=T_{D}-T O A_{B1}\,.$$
In order to compensate for this delay, the position data may be advanced in the direction of travel at a rate based on current velocity.  Uncompensated latency (UL ) is the amount of total latency that is not or can not be compensated for by the receiver.  In other words, it is the difference between the time of applicability understood by the receiver and the true time of applicability of the transmitted data: 

$$\begin{array}{c}{{U L=T T O A-T O A_{D}}}\\ {{}}\\ {{=T T O A-(T O A_{B1}+\Delta T_{B1\to D})\,.}}\end{array}$$
As D
TOA  is truth data, uncompensated latency is simply the error in *TTOA*.   

For non-GNSS coupled transmissions, $TTOA=T_{D}$. So,

$$UL=T_{D}-(TOA_{B1}+\Delta T_{B1\to D}\,)=TL-\Delta T_{B1\to D}\,.$$
Intuitively, uncompensated latency is total latency minus the amount of compensation performed.   

- 
For GNSS-coupled transmissions, uncompensated latency is on the order of clock errors and is considered negligible. 

## U.5 Total Latency

Total latency is recommended to be less than 1.5 seconds.  It can be broken down into three components: 

 
$$T_{D}-T O A_{B1}=\left(T_{D}-T_{C}\right)+\left(T_{C}-T_{B1}\right)+\left(T_{B1}-T O A_{B1}\right)\,.$$

the data interface (see Â§2.2.5.1.7, and Â§2.2.5.1.8) should be limited as much as possible.  Limiting this delay to less than 200 milliseconds is recommended, and

Â§2.2.5.2.2 subparagraphs "d" and "e" limit the amount of total latency incurred by the ADS-B transmitting system.  It limits the amount of time that may transpire between a position update and the preparation of data for transmission to 100 milliseconds.   
The worst case for total latency within a transmitted position message occurs when a position update arrives with maximum delay, and arrives just under the 100 millisecond limit outlined in the requirements.  In this case, the next scheduled transmission is permitted to utilize an older position update.   
In Figure U-3, a position measurement arrives at interface C at time 1

Let

Without loss of generality, consider the maximum total latency of the first measurement.

$$TL=T_{D}-TOA_{B1}\leq t_{3}-\left(t_{1}-\delta_{1}\right)=\left(t_{3}-t_{2}\right)+\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right)+\delta_{1}$$ $$=\left(t_{3}-t_{2}\right)+\left(1+\delta_{2}-\delta_{1}\right)+\delta_{1}=\left(t_{3}-t_{2}\right)+\left(1+\delta_{2}\right)$$ $$\leq0.1+1+0.4=1.5\text{seconds},$$
 
where

## U.6 Uncompensated Latency

In the case of GNSS-coupled Airborne and Surface Position messages, uncompensated latency is negligible.  For non-GNSS coupled transmissions, requirements in 
Â§2.2.3.2.3.7.3, Â§2.2.3.2.3.8.3, Â§2.2.3.2.4.7.3 and Â§2.2.3.2.4.8.3 can be stated precisely as

## V Provisioning For Potential Wake Vortex And Arrival Management Ads-B Applications V.1 Introduction

This Appendix discusses the potential 1090 Extended Squitter (ES) broadcast of Meteorological (MET) data and Air-Reference Vector (ARV) data for potential next generation Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) mode applications such as wake vortex based separation procedures and implementation of next generation arrival management systems.  The provisions in this Appendix are not intended to be implemented in systems compliant with this version of these MOPS.   
These applications are anticipated to provide capacity benefits, enhanced safety, and efficiency through future ground-based and airborne solutions.  This section provides justification for introducing such broadcast data into a future 1090ES Minimum Operational Performance Standard (MOPS).  Later sections provide initial estimates of desired data elements, update rates, and signal provisioning for future versions of 1090ES MOPS. This informative Appendix to RTCA DO 260B/EUROCAE ED-102A is intended to facilitate the investigation of a range of applications enabled by the proposed data broadcasts, with the goals of:  

(1) 
advising aircraft operators on how they can provision their aircraft at present to support these potential ADS-B applications, and  
(2) 
laying the groundwork for international agreement on the inclusion of support for these applications in a future revision of these MOPS. 
The Mode S 1090 MHz Extended Squitter capability was designed to provide an efficient framework for message transfer for air-to-ground, air-to-air, and ground-to-air communications (Ref 1, 2).  The use of aircraft conducting routine operations as real-time sources of weather data via data link was among the envisioned uses of the 1090ES.  This appendix describes two specific potential meteorological message formats for 1090ES and the transmission rates desired to enable emerging wake vortex and arrival management applications.  However, the message content and data transmissions rates developed for these specific applications are further envisaged to support a variety of additional Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) applications.  
Moreover, the message content, message transmission rates, and supporting infrastructure described in this Appendix are targeted to support far-term airborne applications to provide real-time onboard wake turbulence avoidance information to flight crews. Wake turbulence constraints have been identified as a major contributing factor to inefficient use of the Nation's airspace capacity, especially when Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations are in effect (Ref 3).  Concept exploration research by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) has indicated that greater utilization of the nation's airspace could be accomplished if the location of wake turbulence from aircraft could be known with sufficient fidelity to allow following aircraft to fly paths that are free of hazardous turbulence.  Significant potential increases in airport capacity, as much as a 40 percent increase at several airports during some periods of Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), are achievable. 

Mid-term wake avoidance solutions will most likely employ ground-based systems to receive and process down-linked meteorological and aircraft data potentially provided by ADS-B.  These data will be integrated with flight plan and National Airspace Systems 
(NAS) data received through ground networks.  Ground-based processors will compute wake safe four dimensional (4D) trajectories for individual aircraft and recommend traffic flow management options for arrival and departure operations.  These data will become inputs to decision support tools (DSTs) for controllers and traffic flow management to optimize NAS operations.  As envisioned by NextGen and Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) concepts of operation, individual 4D wake-safe trajectories will be communicated to appropriate flight crews to provide a high level of shared situational awareness. NextGen and SESAR concepts for arrival management and associated trajectory synthesis functions are also critically dependent on more real-time aircraft data. Specific data elements are needed to enhance reliability of medium term (~ 40 minute) prediction of aircraft trajectories during the descent and arrival phase of flight, for scheduling the arrival of successive aircraft at critical entry points into the terminal area and to the final approach fix of congested runways.  These include real-time winds aloft and aircraft weight data.  The envisioned concepts include both ground based and air-to-air applications of broadcast MET and ARV data.   

## V.1.1 Proposed Wake Turbulence Applications

The FAA Wake Turbulence Program has proposed initial ground-based wake turbulence avoidance applications that require the availability of near real-time meteorological data that is not available from current sensors.  These applications will determine wake-free trajectories for aircraft based on analysis of meteorological data and calculation of the resulting movement of hazardous wakes.  These initial applications will be based on the lateral transport of wakes by crosswind and will not rely on any wake decay mechanisms to ensure safety.  Wake-free trajectory information will be an input to ground-based Air Traffic Management (ATM) automation that allows Air Traffic Control (ATC) to separate aircraft from hazardous wakes while meeting other trajectory constraints. Wake avoidance applications planned for the mid-term and far-term will require near real-time atmospheric profile information in order to accurately determine the spatial extent of a wake hazard.  ADS-B equipped aircraft, with appropriate provisioning, have the potential to measure and report meteorological data at a high resolution, under all weather conditions, and over regions of operational interest. The temporal and spatial scales of hazardous aircraft wake turbulence are dependent on ambient atmospheric conditions.  Highly turbulent atmospheres can result in wakes decaying more quickly, sometimes in as little as 40-60 seconds.  Stable atmospheric conditions promote longer wake lifetimes wherein heavy aircraft may generate hazardous wake turbulence that persists for more than two minutes.  This difference in wake lifetime is correlated with phase of flight and aircraft speed to determine the spatial dimensions of the wake hazard which must be avoided.  If a wake decays in 60 seconds or 120 seconds, a hazardous wake area 2-4 miles long at typical final approach speeds or 
8-16 miles long at en route cruise speeds may exist.  There are two aspects of wake turbulence that are important for wake avoidance, the location and strength of the wake.  
The location and lifetime of a wake is determined by the ambient atmospheric conditions and the characteristics of the generating aircraft.  The wake strength at the time of encounter and the type of trail aircraft encountering the wake are critical factors in determining safety risks.  
Two mid-term applications based on potential ADS-B OUT capabilities are under development: 

1. The wake turbulence mitigation for arrivals system (WTMA-S) provides 
additional capacity at airports with closely spaced parallel runways (CSPR)1
 
when instrument flight rules are being applied.  The WTMA-S predicts 
operationally significant periods of time when stable crosswinds permit reduced separations between pairs of aircraft arriving on the two parallel runways. 
Crosswinds along the arrival flight path transport the wake turbulence generated by a lead aircraft out of the flight path of a following aircraft.  WTMA-S 
complements the recently enacted FAA Order 7110.308 by enabling heavy aircraft and Boeing-757 aircraft to participate in a CSPR arrival procedure as lead aircraft and by enabling reduced wake turbulence separations at additional 
airports.  WTMA-S requires meteorological data that potentially could be 
transmitted from aircraft via ADS-B as inputs to a crosswind prediction 
algorithm and as part of a real-time monitoring function to ensure safety. 
2. Crosswind-based reductions in en route separations are envisioned for more 
efficient flight operations.  This application would utilize meteorological data 
transmitted from aircraft to enable safe reductions in en route separations controllers must apply for wake turbulence when aircraft climb or descend through the altitude of a proximate aircraft and when faster aircraft overtake a slower aircraft.  Currently, controllers must maintain a minimum separation of 
5 nautical miles (NM) between co-altitude aircraft or 1000 foot/feet (ft) vertical 
separations to protect against potential collisions and wake turbulence encounters.  However, much smaller lateral separations can potentially provide 
avoidance of wake turbulence when the flight path of the maneuvering aircraft is offset.  The en route wake avoidance application will use meteorological data transmitted from aircraft potentially via ADS-B to generate wake-free trajectories for maneuvering aircraft.  It will be integrated with emerging ADS-B 
surveillance capabilities to enable an overall reduction in en route separations. 
Smaller deviations to preferred flight paths will be required, resulting in savings in time, fuel burned, and emissions. 
A high level system diagram of these applications is shown in Figure V-1, assuming that the proposed use of ADS-B becomes a reality.  A processor in the aircraft will obtain required meteorological data from on-board sensors and computer systems and format this data for transmission via ADS-B.  These data will be broadcast by ADS-B IN the formats and at the frequencies described in Section V.3.  Ground receivers will provide these data to an ADS-B ground processor, which will parse the data messages and provide required data elements to a ground-based wake processor.  The meteorological data algorithm in this processor will construct atmospheric profiles based on data provided by aircraft via ADS-B and other meteorological data available via ground data networks.  A 4-D wake-free trajectory will be determined for each aircraft and provided to a trajectory processor.  These trajectories will be processed and provided to ATC 
ground automation for use in ATC separation functions. 

 
Aircraft Comm/Data Link Aircraft ADS-B Processor Wake Processor Ground ADS-B Processor Wake data output This is a first step in the development of a series of potential ADS-B supported wake avoidance applications that will enable transition to far-term NextGen and SESAR operational concepts.  Subsequent enhancements to the initial applications may also include the consideration of wake decay and sink in computing wake-free trajectories. Follow-on ground-based applications can use the same data elements recommended in this proposal to enable additional wake avoidance capabilities. The initial applications being proposed have a high potential to produce early benefits for users.  There are, however, multiple wake capabilities planned for the mid and far-term that can leverage better knowledge of winds.  The Wake Turbulence Mitigation for Departures (WTMD) is one such capability.  It is currently being developed for implementation in the 2012-2014 timeframe. WTMD is a crosswind-based departure capability that relies on the accurate forecast of periods when winds will not allow wakes to drift between the departure path of Heavy aircraft and that of another aircraft departing from an upwind closely spaced parallel runway.  During these periods, departures off the upwind parallel runway do not require the current 2-3 minute wake delay resulting in a safe increase in departure capacity.  Wind data is required from the surface up to 1000 ft for this application.  WTMD currently utilizes the hourly Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) wind product provided by the National Weather Service.  The WTMD wind forecast algorithm is necessarily very conservative due to the fact that the RUC winds are only available on an hourly basis.  Even with this limitation, benefits for WTMD are estimated at approximately $158 million.  If information on winds above the airport surface were available from ADS-B, the available periods would likely increase by at least 30%, resulting in an additional benefit of $47 million, based on deployment of WTMD at ten major airports. 

## V.1.2 Additional Capabilities

In addition to supporting future applications that enable wake avoidance and potential reductions in aircraft separation, a number of other important capabilities will also be enabled should airborne derived meteorological data and air-reference data becomes readily available through ADS-B.  These include: 

- 
Improved arrival management scheduling and more accurate aircraft trajectory synthesis 
- 
Increased wind field prediction accuracy, and 
- 
Better situational awareness of current weather 

## V.1.2.1 Improved Arrival Management Scheduling And Aircraft Trajectory Synthesis

A key component in NextGen and SESAR concepts is the use of arrival management scheduling and path synthesis, such as provided by current and next generation NASA Center TRACON Automation System (CTAS), Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) and En Route Descent Advisor (EDA) controller decision support tools.  These tools are built on an aircraft trajectory synthesis function that uses path routings, descent profile, and winds aloft to strategically schedule aircraft in an arrival sequence and provide required arrival times at critical TMA arrival fixes.  Broadcast of ARV and MET data is recommended to support such applications, since this capability provides (1) A means to estimate airspeed for constant Indicated Air Speed (IAS)/Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) 
descents from cruise, and (2) Wind vector updates for enhanced estimation of the ground vector along the selected arrival path to scheduled arrival fixes.  Current NASA trajectory synthesis algorithms use nominal descent speeds based on aircraft type rather than planned airspeed descent profiles, which are typically only available on the Flight Management System (FMS) flight plan, and are not available to current ground automation systems.  Similarly, the use of hours-old forecast winds can lead to unreliable sequencing and scheduling of in-bound aircraft.  Aircraft derived winds and meteorological data broadcast can be used to update winds-aloft in near real-time, resulting in enhanced reliability of arrival management systems under development for NextGen and SESAR implementation. There are several different concepts for implementing next generation arrival management systems, each with somewhat different functional requirements.  Generally, such systems can be classified as Open Loop arrival management systems if the controller provides explicit descent path and profile instructions which are flown by the pilot or airplane FMS system to the specified arrival fix, or as Closed Loop systems if the airplane avionics provides dynamic inputs such as airspeed guidance to the FMS to achieve desired in-trail sequencing and merging of inbound aircraft prior to reaching the specified arrival fix.  Based on simulations and limited flight trials, Open Loop systems typically require more accuracy in the trajectory synthesis function, and controller monitoring of intended path and airspeed compliance, to assure that the aircraft is able to implement the desired arrival trajectory and time schedule.  By contrast, Closed Loop systems typically are more tolerant to trajectory synthesis and path following errors, but may require greater pilot situation awareness to assure that in-trail separation with nearby aircraft is achieved. One means of implementing Closed Loop arrival management is based on ADS-B IN surveillance of nearby aircraft.  Pilots and potential users of ADS-B In-Trail arrival applications such as Visual Spacing on Approach (VSA) and Flight Deck Merging and Spacing (FDMS) have consistently recommended the broadcast and display of lead aircraft airspeed for enhanced situation awareness when maintaining desired in-trail spacing.  In the event that the lead aircraft slows down for merging or as needed for an arrival procedure, the trail aircraft can easily see the difference in airspeed with the lead aircraft, and verify the consistency of speed guidance provided by the ADS-B application.  Broadcast of airspeed in this arrival application, allows a pilot to verify, modify, or reject the ADS-B derived speed guidance based on enhanced situation awareness of lead aircraft airspeed. 

V.1.2.2 
Increased Wind Field Prediction Accuracy 
Although use of arriving/departing and nearby aircraft as sensors for measuring wind vector and other MET parameters is an idea that has been around for some time, it is often not economically feasible to use existing data links for this purpose.  ADS-B is better structured for regular broadcast of such data. For wind data, it has been shown (Ref 
4) that regular wind updates on the order of minutes rather than hours is essential for reliable arrival management, and for consistency in implementing arrival procedures such as Continuous Descent Arrivals (CDA's).  Moreover, earlier studies (Ref 5) have shown that mixed equipage with 10 percent or more aircraft broadcasting along path wind data may be sufficient to provide substantial enhancement in local wind field estimation. 

## V.1.2.3 Better Situational Awareness Of Current Weather

One proposed application of the meteorological data in the new squitter messages (i.e., winds, temperature, air pressure, humidity) is to improve the current generation of atmospheric models for aviation.  This application is envisioned as a form of automated Pilot Report (PIREP) that provides a large volume of timely data to users of meteorological data for weather forecasting.  
A second proposed application of the meteorological data in the new squitter messages (i.e., winds, aircraft weight, aircraft configuration) is to improve the prediction of aircraft flight trajectories in spacing and queuing tools.  Having real time data available (rather than the inferred values currently used) could improve the performance and benefits of these tools. A third proposed application of the meteorological data in the new squitter messages (i.e., turbulence, icing, wake vortex, windshear/microburst) would be to provide proximate aircraft up-to-date information about hazardous weather conditions in their vicinity.  This is envisioned primarily as an air-to-air application, although air-to-ground transmission could also provide alerting of hazardous atmospheric conditions and turbulence to ground users. An airborne user in turbulent air could use the data provided via the new squitter messages to determine where a smoother ride might be found.   

## V.1.3 Broadcast System Architecture

The applications described in this Appendix are targeted for first implementation in the NextGen mid-term (2018) timeframe.  This Appendix assumes utilization of the National Airspace Systems (NAS) infrastructure, operational procedures, and capabilities likely to be available in 2018 during the transition to full NextGen implementation.  As such, it is assumed that transition to non-ground-based navigation and surveillance, and planning for the phase out of ground-based surveillance radar systems reaching the end of their service lifetimes would be underway.  It is recognized that some existing ground-based radar installations could be modified to interrogate transponders for the data elements described in Section V.2.  However, there are several reasons why this is not a preferred mid-term system architecture:  

1. A one-time investment in the proposed broadcast data link, in conjunction with the 
ADS-B ground-based infrastructure being deployed, simultaneously enables the proposed applications at all major airports and most areas of the NAS.  
2. The broadcast solution scales directly with demand for additional capacity since 
aircraft themselves provide the required data.   
3. Relatively easy to deploy ADS-B ground receiver stations could enable benefits 
wherever needed worldwide.   
4. A national infrastructure is required to provide benefits throughout the NAS 
(modified surveillance radars could only provide benefits within their service 
volumes.)   
5. Hybrid system architectures employing both a national data link infrastructure and 
local surveillance radar-based data links at selected sites would create additional cost and complexity and be more difficult to certify, operate, and maintain.  This hybrid system would only be desirable if needed to meet performance requirements for high density terminal areas.   
6. A significant investment of resources to add new long-term functionality to NAS 
systems slated to be decommissioned would be difficult to justify.  

## V.2 Data Requirements For Wake And Arrival Management Applications

This section describes the data that are needed to support the proposed wake turbulence applications, including initial and envisioned long-term wake avoidance applications.  
There is general scientific agreement that real-time predictions of the movement and decay of aircraft wake vortices can be developed if the following data elements can be obtained from the wake-generating aircraft: 

- 
Wind speed 
- 
Wind direction 
- 
Static temperature 
- 
Static barometric pressure2
 
- 
Aircraft emitter category 
- 
Aircraft position 
- 
Pressure altitude 
- 
Aircraft speed and heading 
- 
Aircraft weight 
- 
Atmospheric turbulence (normally eddy dissipation rate, but total kinetic energy can also be used) 
- 
Aircraft configuration data, e.g., flap setting, for potential future applications 
For the mid-term and long-term ground based wake avoidance concepts, these data elements are required to be received such that there is a 95 percent probability of a successful update at the appropriate rate specified in Table V-1. These same data elements provided at the higher air-to-air reception rates shown in Table V-1 will also enable farther-term flight deck-based applications.  Aircraft emitter category3
 and position are available from existing ADS-B Messages.  Aircraft heading and speed can be obtained from existing ADS-B Messages, but current rules require it to be sent only in the absence of ground velocity data.  These data elements can potentially be obtained from interleaved broadcast of ARV data, or alternately, reconstructed by the user from ground velocity data and wind vector data as discussed in Section V.3.2. 

Data parameters to be used in wake vortex applications (the first four application columns in Table V-1) will need to be provided to the transmitting ADS-B equipment by avionics with a design assurance level appropriate to spacing/separation applications 
(hazard level of MAJOR or higher).  Arrival management applications (fifth column of Table V-1), however, are envisaged as being advisory in nature (hazard level of MINOR) 
and can accept data inputs with less stringent certification.  The data elements of Table V-1 will further need to be supplied with appropriate resolution and accuracy for the applications.  Requirements in this area will be specified as part of the Safety and Performance Requirements for future ADS-B applications.

## Notes:

1. 
Assume moderate to high density traffic environment. Received rate is for a single 
aircraft.  Resolution of approximately 500 ft along altitude profile is achieved 
through receiving transmissions from multiple aircraft. 10000 ft and below requires higher sampling rate to capture wind field for downwind, base, and final. 
2. 
Received rate is for individual aircraft. Assume climb and descent rates of 2000-
3000 fpm. (updates received at least once every 2000 ft at desired update rate), at 
least every 5 NM laterally. 40 NM range (lower limit) between aircraft to be assisted 
by ground system needs to be supported (limit due to opposite direction climb/descend thru).  Assume 1 in 6 receive rate in terminal maneuvering airspace. 
3. 
Closely spaced parallel approaches, in-trail spacing on final to single runway. Assuming 1 in 4 received at 10 NM.  Measurement, every 1000 ft nominally.  
4. 
Cruise, assume 1 in 8 air-to-air receive rate in 2035 in highest density airspace at 
20 NM  
5. 
Need weight within 2%. Assume, as a limiting factor, 1 in 10 air-to-ground 
reporting rate from ADS-B ground infrastructure for aircraft in en route airspace. 
6. 
Logic to detect temperature inversions would increase the transmission rate. 
7. 
For a maximum of 24 seconds. 
8. 
Values in this column apply to in-trail geometries only.  Update requirements for 
crossing and head-on geometries need to be considered further and those values added. 
9. 
In high density airspace, these update rates may not be supported by the nominal transmission rates presented in Section V.3.13.  Further refinement and more 
frequent, event-driven, transmission of the meteorological squitter under specific detected conditions may be needed. 
10. Potentially could be estimated from ARV, if such use of ARV data is appropriately 
certified. 
11. It will be known whether true airspeed and true heading are broadcast or whether 
the airspeed and heading values are calibrated airspeed and magnetic heading. Section V.6 contains conversion equations to derive the desired speed and heading. 
 The update rates in Table V-1 are driven by the need to support various wake vortex and arrival management applications.  Flight data is required every 1000 ft vertically or less during departure and arrival phases of flight and every 500 ft or less on takeoff and final approach, where wake turbulence encounters can be the most hazardous. It should be noted that the current wake categories for aircraft in the 1090ES message set will need to be updated to account for changes that have occurred or will occur over the next few years in the aircraft fleet mix.  A new weight category, Super, has been established to accommodate the Airbus A380 aircraft. Additional changes to the current wake categories are under development. Section 3 describes two modifications to the current 1090 ES message formats to enable the broadcast of data elements required for the initial wake and traffic flow management applications. 

## V.3 Message Formats And Rates

Two complementary means of deriving wind information from ADS-B Messages are proposed.  One is through the use of Mode S transponder meteorological data Registers.  
This means is described in Section V.3.1 and provides the identified data elements in Table V-1.  The second means is through the existing air-reference vector data format originally defined in the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A), and in these MOPS (RTCA 
DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A), but with a revised transmission schedule.  A full description of this method is provided in Section V.3.2.  It can potentially provide some of the aircraft heading and speed data elements identified in Table V-1.   

## V.3.1 Design For Aircraft-Derived Meteorological Data Dissemination Via Mode S 1090 Mhz Extended Squitter (1090Es) V.3.1.1 Introduction

This section will define a proposed mechanism for the dissemination (both air-to-ground and air-to-air) of aircraft-derived meteorological data by means of the Mode S 1090ES broadcast data link.  The proposed mechanism defined in this paper is intended to work in conjunction with the current definition of the Mode S transponder meteorological data Registers (4416 and 4516
) in the transponder.  The current definition of the Mode S 
transponder meteorological Registers is intended to support the extraction of aircraftderived meteorological data by means of addressed interrogations from Mode S surveillance sensors.  However, these two Mode S transponder meteorological Register definitions are not suitable for applications where ground Mode S surveillance sensors are not available (e.g., over the ocean) and they do not provide for air-to-air cross-link of meteorological data (in particular, cross-link of potentially hazardous, short-lived phenomena such as turbulence or icing).  In the future ATC environment supported more and more by "automatic dependent surveillance via broadcast" (ADS-B), the proposed Mode S squitter data link mechanism will provide a compatible means to disseminate aircraft-derived meteorological data along with the ADS-B surveillance information employing Mode S.  This proposal defines two new Mode S meteorological Registers in a format suitable for the Mode S squitter protocol. 

It will be demonstrated that the proposed mechanism for meteorological data squitter fits neatly into the existing design for Mode S.  There will be minimal impact on the use of the 1090 MHz spectrum and the proposed design entails minimal extra software processing in the avionics.  Expansion space has been reserved for further meteorological data applications as yet undefined. 

 
Note: There is an existing Mode S protocol intended to be employed by Aircraft Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) units that allows for addressed cross-link between ACAS-equipped aircraft.  This protocol could be employed to directly extract the currently defined aircraft-derived meteorological data Registers (4416 
and 4516) from another aircraft.  However, the use of this protocol requires the system to obtain the Mode S addresses of the aircraft from which data is desired, as well as requiring separate interrogations of each target aircraft to obtain the Register contents.  Adding this functionality to existing ACAS units is technically possible, but would probably be too costly to support the meteorological data cross-link application envisaged.  It appears that the use of the Mode S 1090ES 
broadcast link might be simpler to implement.   

## V.3.1.2 Proposed Meteorological Squitter Register Formats

The data fields in the proposed meteorological squitter Registers defined in this section parallel those already defined in the Mode S transponder meteorological Registers 4416 
(routine data) and 4516
 (hazard data).  The meteorological squitter Register formats defined here differ from those used for "ground-initiated Comm-B" (GICB) extraction via an addressed interrogation in that the first 5 bits of the Mode S squitter Register contents must contain a "format type code" value which identifies the particular squitter message at the receiver.  This proposal for the application of Mode S squitter to the dissemination of aircraft-derived meteorological data assumes that one of the currently reserved Mode S squitter type code values will be assigned to this application.  The next two bits of each meteorological squitter Register format will be used as a "weather type code" to further identify the particular Mode S squitter message.  Two of the four possible meteorological squitter formats will be defined in this section - the remaining two formats are reserved for future expansion of the Mode S meteorological data dissemination application. 

Table V-2 defines the first of the proposed Mode S meteorological squitter Register formats. Its content closely parallels that of the Mode S routine meteorological data Register (44
 and meteorological squitter format 1 are: 
16) already defined for GICB extraction.  Other than the incorporation of a 5-
bit format type code and a 2-bit weather type code, the differences between Mode S 
Register 4416

1. The 4-bit navigational "figure of merit" field from Register 44
16
 is not included 
here.  The Mode S position squitters already provide this sort of information ("navigational uncertainty category" [NUC] in Version 0 or "navigational 
accuracy category" [NAC] in Version 1) encoded as part of their format type code values. 
2. A wind "quality" flag bit has been incorporated into the squitter definition.  This 
is done because the aircraft roll angle normally extracted via Mode S Register 50
16
 (an element of "enhanced surveillance" [EHS] as part of the 
EUROCONTROL Mode S mandate) is not available via Mode S squitter.  The 
wind quality flag is used to indicate cases of aircraft acceleration where the derived wind measurements would be degraded.  The current International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 3 specification requires that the wind quality flag be set if the aircraft roll angle exceeds 5 degrees.  
3. The resolution of the static air temperature field from Mode S Register 44
16
 is 
reduced from 1/8 degree C to 1/2 degree C.  It is felt that this is a morereasonable level of precision to expect from airborne sensors and is sufficient for the expected meteorological applications of this data. 
4. The average turbulence value from Register 45
16 has been moved to the 
meteorological squitter format 1 so that it will be updated more frequently.  It is 
assumed that the avionics generate a turbulence "eddy dissipation rate" (EDR)1/3 
metric sample at least once per minute.  The average EDR1/3
 value reported is the 
average of all the values currently contained in the most-recent 10-second sliding 
window.

 and meteorological squitter format 2 are:   
Table V-3 defines the second of the proposed Mode S meteorological squitter Register formats.  Its content closely parallels that of the Mode S hazard meteorological data Register (4516) already defined for GICB extraction.  Other than the incorporation of a 5-
bit format type code and a 2-bit weather type code, the differences between Mode S 
Register 4516

1. The windshear and microburst metrics from Mode S Register 45
16
 have been 
combined into a single data field in squitter format 2.  Instead of simply providing a 2-bit metric (none, light, moderate, severe) for each hazard, meteorological squitter format 2 incorporates a signed value for the gain or loss in airspeed involved with the particular hazard.  This provides more-useful 
information about the hazard. 
2. Wake vortex generation by an aircraft is impacted by the current configuration of 
the aircraft.  In particular, the configuration of the aircraft's landing gear and its flap setting would be useful in determining when aircraft are configured for final approach and producing wakes with maximum strength.  Data on the aircraft's configuration has been added to squitter format 2.  
3. The current definition of the squitter "aircraft identification and category" 
message is able to subdivide aircraft into a set of weight and performance classes as follows: 
a. Light (< 15000 pounds) 
b. Medium 1 (15000 to 75000 pounds) 
c. Medium 2 (75000 to 300000 pounds) d. High Vortex (e.g., B767) e. Heavy (> 300000 pounds) 
f. High Performance (> 5 g acceleration or > 400 knots airspeed) 
g. Rotorcraft 
However, more detailed information about the aircraft's weight would be useful in a number of applications including wake vortex mitigation and determination of an aircraft's trajectory.  ARINC Label 075 in the avionics conveys the aircraft's weight as a 16-bit field employing 40-pound increments.  A subset of this weight data has been added to squitter format 2.  The proposed weight encoding makes use of the weight classes defined above to provide for a refined weight encoding - the choice of weight LSB is a function of the aircraft weight class (i.e., the encoding Least Significant Bit [LSB] used is smaller for lighter aircraft).  
It is assumed that the avionics generate a turbulence "eddy dissipation rate" EDR1/3 
metric sample at least once per 20 seconds.  The peak EDR1/3 value reported is the largest currently contained in the most-recent 10-second sliding window.  The EDR metric is an aircraft-independent measure of atmospheric turbulence (i.e., the EDR reported by a light aircraft would be the same as that reported by a heavy aircraft in the same air-mass).  It is typically derived from aircraft inputs including vertical acceleration and changes in true airspeed.  The average EDR value indicates the overall turbulence of the atmosphere, while the peak EDR indicates the worst-case turbulence found.  The turbulence and wake vortex "hazard metrics" are a function of the current values of the average and peak EDR values (with other yet to be defined inputs).

## Notes:

1. Configuration data is primarily to indicate aircraft acceleration or deceleration 
status rather than wake characteristics. 
2. If the format type code value encoded in bits 1-5 of the "aircraft identification 
and category" squitter (Comm-B Data Selector [BDS] Register 0816) for this 
aircraft is not 4 (indicating that the aircraft/vehicle category encoding is not 
using category set A), then the weight encoding uses a default LSB of 2000 
pounds up to a maximum of 510000 pounds.  If the format type code value is 4 
for this aircraft, then the weight encoding is a function of the aircraft/vehicle category value (bits 6-8 of the "aircraft identification and category" squitter 
[BDS Register 0816
]) as defined in Table V-4.  If the actual weight to be encoded 
exceeds the encoding weight maximum from Table V-4, the maximum encodeable weight should be used.

## V.3.1.3 Proposed Meteorological Squitter Update Rates

There is always a trade-off between the desire to achieve a certain data update rate and the need to minimize the impact of each application employing the Mode S spectrum.  
Mode S is primarily intended as an aircraft surveillance system - so, any other use of the Mode S frequencies (such as this proposed meteorological application) must carefully bound its transmission rate.  Fortunately, the update requirements for the meteorological data described in this paper are rather modest, and should not have significant impact on the overall Mode S 1090 MHz spectrum utilization. 

The update rates defined here for the meteorological data messages are designed to meet the meteorological data element update frequency requirements as stated in Table V-1.  It is proposed that one routine meteorological squitter message of format 1 (see Table V-2) 
be generated every 10 seconds.  Each additional active meteorological squitter Register 
(where "active" is defined as having at least one current data item in the Register - i.e., at least one status bit is set in the particular meteorological squitter Register) will share one additional meteorological squitter 20-second "time slot" in a round-robin fashion.  Since there is currently only one additional meteorological Register defined in this proposal (format 2 in Table V-3), the result could be up to 3 additional squitters of meteorological data each minute (when such new data is available).  
Note:
 The aircraft identification (a much less dynamic data item than the meteorological data elements defined in Table V-1) is currently broadcast while airborne every 5 seconds.   
Since much of the data in meteorological squitter Register format 2 (see Table V-3) 
indicates various types of aeronautical hazard conditions, its transmission should increase in the event of a change indicating an increased hazard (see Table V-2).  It is proposed that if any of the hazard data fields in meteorological squitter Register format 2 (e.g., turbulence, icing, wake vortex, windshear, microburst) have current data (i.e., its status bit is set) and are indicating a moderate or severe level of their respective hazard, then meteorological squitter Register format 2 will be transmitted at a higher rate for 24 seconds.  The standard transmission is once every 20 seconds.  The precise definition of hazard levels is still under development by ICAO METLINK.  The current thinking on this area suggests that the following values would be cause to have meteorological squitter Register format 2 increase its transmission rate to once every 10 seconds: 

- 
A peak turbulence EDR1/3
 value of greater than 0.3 for low level turbulence or 
0.4 for en route turbulence, or  
- 
A headwind change of greater than 15 knots (windshear), or 
- 
A headwind change of greater than 30 knots (microburst).   
A change in the aircraft configuration or the aircraft weight data fields in format 2 is not sufficient to cause an increase in the transmission rate of format 2. Since it is highly desirable to reduce the number of squitters generated in order to minimize congestion and interference on the 1090 MHz spectrum, some straightforward rules could be developed to lower the transmission rate of the routine meteorological squitters (format 1) under certain conditions.  For example, if the aircraft is cruising 
(level altitude) above 18000 ft (where the atmosphere tends to be uniform and stable), then the broadcast rate of format 1 could be reduced to every 30 seconds. Just because a particular squitter is broadcast does not imply that each squitter will be successfully received by a ground (or airborne) receiver.  The probability of a successful squitter reception is a function of: 

1. The range between the squitter transmitter and receiver 
2. The local interference environment  
3. The antenna patterns of the transmitter and receiver 4. The transmitter's power 

## 5. The Receiver'S Sensitivity

Using standard assumptions for (c)-(e) and a low-density interference model for (b) (as derived in Appendix P of these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A), the 
1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B MOPS), the probability of reception for a single squitter is computed to be about 0.68 at 70 NM range, 0.50 at 80 NM, and 0.46 at 90 NM (from Table P-5).  Using a worst-case high-density model for 1090 MHz interference 
(Los Angeles Basin in 2020 with 24K fruit/second as shown in Table P-2) the probability of reception for a single squitter computes to be about 0.68 at 10 NM range, 0.43 at 20 
NM, and 0.27 at 30 NM.  
The time period in which one can expect to get a successful transmission of squitter data may be computed using the formulas derived in Appendix P of these MOPS (RTCA DO- 260B/EUROCAE ED-102A).  Assuming a 10-second repetition rate for the meteorological squitter, a 0.5 single-squitter update probability yields a 95 percent probability of a successful update in 44 seconds or less.  A 0.4 single-squitter update probability yields a 95 percent probability of a successful update in 60 seconds or less, and a 0.3 single-squitter probability yields a 95 percent update in 84 seconds or less. These results indicate that one could expect highly reliable transfer of meteorological information within a minute from an aircraft at ranges of about 80 NM in low-density environments and about 10-15 NM in extremely high-density environments.  It should be noted that these values are computed for single aircraft. In a dense environment there will be multiple aircraft in a given area of airspace and a successful reception of a meteorological squitter from any one of them is sufficient to characterize the airspace - the multiple aircraft add redundancy and ensure high squitter reception probabilities. 

## V.3.1.4 Mode S Transponder Configuration Bits

It could be desirable for ground applications (and cross-link applications) to be able to determine which aircraft have avionics configured to support the new meteorological squitter Register formats.  It is proposed that a bit in the Mode S "common usage" 
configuration Register 1716 be assigned to indicate whether the given aircraft's avionics are filling at least some data fields in at least one of the proposed meteorological squitter Registers. 

. 

Note: A bit is already present in Register 1716 for each of the current meteorological 
Registers 4416 and 4516
V.3.1.5 
Summary 
This section has proposed a design for the use of the Mode S 1090ES broadcast data link to support air-to-air as well as air-to-ground dissemination of aircraft-derived meteorological data.  The proposed design is a modest extension of the Mode S 
transponder Register set (4416 and 4516) already defined to support extraction of aircraftderived meteorological data via addressed interrogations by a ground Mode S surveillance sensor. 

Note:
 As mentioned at the beginning of this section, these currently defined 
transponder meteorological Registers could also be extracted via the ACAS cross-link protocol. 
The use of the Mode S squitter broadcast data link provides a means to disseminate aircraft-derived meteorological data in areas lacking Mode S ground support or where ATC will be done using ADS-B. Mode S 1090ES receivers could be used to obtain the meteorological data.  Aircraft could obtain desirable meteorological "situational awareness" (local winds, turbulence hazards, regions of current icing, etc.) directly from the other aircraft around them. 

It has been shown that the proposed design for meteorological squitters entails a low impact on the Mode S 1090 MHz spectrum.  The requirements for avionics support would also be low.  Given that an aircraft is equipped with the appropriate sensors to derive meteorological data (e.g., it would only require a Global Positioning System [GPS] navigation system and an Air Data Computer [ADC] system to be able to make wind measurements - and such equipment would likely already be onboard an aircraft equipped to support Mode S Extended Squitter), then only reformatting software in the avionics would be required to fill the necessary Mode S transponder Registers and a modest change to the transponder software to squitter the new meteorological Registers at the required rate. 

## V.3.2 Broadcast Of Air-Reference Vector For Future Airborne And Air-Ground Applications

In these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A), air-reference velocity information such as airspeed and magnetic heading data are input to extended squitter systems, but are not broadcast in ADS-B Messages except in the very rare event that no ground velocity data such as GPS velocity vector is available from airborne avionics.  
This section proposes the broadcast of ARV data interleaved with ground vector data at a low rate, i.e., one out of 'N' velocity broadcasts would contain ARV data rather than standard ground vector outputs when ground vector and ARV data outputs are both available.  This proposal would use the existing ARV inputs and data formats defined in earlier RTCA DO-260/EUROCAE ED-102 MOPS, but would transmit ARV data periodically and enable wind vector derivation by ADS-B user applications. 

In this section we show the feasibility of deriving wind vector (on the receive side) given joint broadcast of ground vector and ARV data.  This capability will be particularly valuable for aircraft that do not have the capability to output wind and MET data.  
Finally, this section outlines the concept of ARV "coasting" whereby current ARV outputs can be estimated using current ground vector and wind vector data, which leads to a more efficient protocol for ARV broadcasting; minimizing the needed rate of ARV 
broadcasts for reliable reception in 1090 MHz frequency congested airspace. 

It should be noted that interleaved ARV broadcasts would not increase aircraft squitter rate, i.e., data content in state vector messages is enhanced with no increase in spectrum congestion or need for increased squitter rate.   

V.3.2.1 
Wind Triangle and Derivation of Wind Vector from Ground Vector and ARV Data 
In order to fly an aircraft on a desired track or course over the earth, it is necessary to point an aircraft slightly into the wind so that the aircraft follows the desired track, i.e., the pilot or autopilot adjusts the heading of the aircraft to achieve a desired mean track for the current flight segment.  The assumed relationship between the air-reference velocity vector (True airspeed [TAS], and True heading angle), the mean wind vector, and the ground velocity vector is a two-dimension vector shown in Figure V-2, and known simply as the wind triangle.  (The analysis in this Appendix assumes a simplified, flat-earth coordinate system.)  In this figure, the aircraft is positioned at the origin and the wind triangle gives the ground referenced velocity of the aircraft, given aircraft air-mass velocity and the current wind vector.  The wind triangle assumes that the ground vector is the vector sum of the air-reference vector and the mean wind, i.e., that the mean wind at a given altitude is primarily a horizontal velocity that adds to the aircraft propulsive velocity vector to achieve a specified course over the earth.  (In this terminology, ARV is defined to be TAS and True heading, whereas the more typical broadcast quantities of IAS/CAS and magnetic heading need to be converted to True airspeed and True heading prior to any analysis using the wind triangle relationship.)   
In Figure V-2, (Ï , V) denotes earth reference track angle and ground speed, (Ïa , Va) 
denotes air-mass true heading and airspeed, and (Ïw , Vw) denotes current wind direction and wind speed.  The along-track and cross-track wind components are denoted as vs and vc in Figure V-2.  The air and earth referenced quantities satisfy the following relationships which are easily derived from Figure V-2. 

$\sin\,(\varphi\,-\,\varphi$a) = vc / Va (V.3-1) $\rm{Va}^{2}\,=\,vc^{2}+(V-vs)^{2}$ (V.3-2)
The above equations may be used to coast true airspeed and true heading, given ground vector from ADS-B broadcasts, and derived wind vector. (See Section V.3.2.4) 
The important point to be emphasized with the wind triangle is that given any two legs of the triangle, the third leg can be estimated.  In the next section we show how the wind vector can be estimated given current estimates of the ground vector and air-reference vector obtained from ADS-B broadcasts.  It is also possible to use ground vector and the wind vector to estimate the air-reference vector, or alternately, to use air-reference vector and the wind vector to estimate the ground vector.  This is the basis of ARV coasting and ground velocity coasting, respectively, when current estimates of those quantities are not available from recent ADS-B broadcasts. It should be noted that the wind triangle relationships are based on the following modeling assumptions: 

- 
The wind vector is primarily horizontal, with generally small contributions 
in the vertical axis. - This assumption is generally valid, but may not hold in 
certain circumstances, e.g., due to downdrafts when nearby and below high 
mountain ranges, and due to local weather disturbances which can give rise to phenomena such as clear-air turbulence and vertical micro-bursts.  Generally, the 
wind triangle is valid as a horizontal axis projection of the full three dimensional wind triangle, provided that the aircraft flight path angle is small.  This 
assumption is valid for most civil aircraft, at least during descent and climb-out after the aircraft has a clean configuration with flaps and landing gear retracted. 
- 
The effect of wind gusts and local wind disturbances on aircraft motion is 
primarily to increase process noise on the aircraft trajectory. - This assumption means that the aircraft guidance system is able to maintain the 
desired flight course and speed with only minor variations in trajectory path due to wind gusts and higher frequency wind dynamics.  
- 
The lag between reception of current ground vector and ARV data is small, 
i.e., the difference between the ground vector and the air-reference vector primarily reflects the wind vector with minimal error due to aircraft acceleration dynamics. (See further assumptions on latency in Section V.4.)  
Note:
 Assuming that the wind vector is small in the vertical plane, resolving the forces 
in the vertical plane and assuming small flight path angles yields  
 
dh/dt  =  Va*Î³a = V*Î³ 
where h is the geometric altitude relative to earth fixed axes, Î³a is the flight path angle relative to the wind (assuming small flight path angle), and Î³ is the flight path angle of the aircraft relative to fixed inertial axes.  These equations enable the flight path angle relative to the wind and in inertial axes to be calculated given GPS measurements of geometric vertical rate.  The rate of change in vertical pressure is related to geometric vertical rate by the relationship (Ref 6). 

 
dhp/dt  =  ( Tsd(hp) / Tk (hp) ) * dh/dt 
where Tsd (hp) is the static temperature for the standard atmosphere at pressure altitude hp, and Tk denotes the actual or measured temperature at pressure altitude hp derived from radiosonde measurements or MET broadcasts from one or more aircraft in flight. The last equation can be used by an ADS-B user to convert from geometric to pressure altitude rate, or vice versa.  If the user is another ADS-B aircraft, then Tk can also be estimated based on ownship measurements of Delta_ISA, i.e.,  
Tk(hp) ~ Tstd(hp) + Delta_ISA,  
where Delta_ISA ~ Tk(ownship) - Tsd(hp(ownship)). 

## V.3.2.2 Derivation Of Wind Vector From Ground Vector And Low Rate Arv Broadcasts

Given a received broadcast of position state and ARV data, typically in the form of IAS/CAS airspeed and magnetic heading, and the most recently received ground vector, it is feasible to use the wind triangle relationship above to derive current estimates of wind vector.  The derivation process is described using the flow diagram shown in Figure V-3. In Figure V-3, the input parameters from ADS-B broadcasts are shown in the upper left corner, using bold input arrows, and the main functional blocks leading to estimates of wind speed and wind direction are illustrated.  (The detailed calculation procedure is not specified here, since this Appendix focuses on the ADS-B OUT 
parameters, rather than on receive side functions.  For details, see Ref (7, 8) and Section V.6.  The first functional block in the process converts CAS to Mach number and Magnetic Heading to True Heading, assuming a standard atmosphere.  It is recommended that Mach number be input to the transponder rather than CAS 
airspeed, in the event that the aircraft is flying a constant Mach number.  (This simplifies the calculation process and is consistent with aircraft guidance laws that switch from CAS to Mach guidance above a fixed transition altitude.)  Pressure altitude is needed in the conversion from CAS to Mach to estimate pressure ratio (delta).  In addition, pressure altitude is used to estimate temperature ratio (theta) for Mach to TAS 
conversion.  (Somewhat better accuracy can be obtained in this process if the measured theta or delta temperature (Delta ISA) between the measured atmosphere and a standard atmosphere is known on the receive side, and used to compensate for a hotter or colder than standard day.)  Similarly, the magnetic deviation between magnetic and true North can be estimated using the aircraft horizontal position to convert from magnetic to true heading.  Once true heading and TAS are obtained, the wind vector can be computed by subtracting the air-reference vector from the ground vector in North and East components, and then converting the result to desired wind speed and direction outputs. 

 

## V.3.2.3 Proposed Update Rates For Wind Vector And Arv Broadcasts

With the wind vector derivation described above, nominal broadcast of ARV data may be compatible with that needed for air-ground MET broadcasts.  The recommended broadcast of MET data in RTCA DO-252, for example, varies from 3 minutes nominal update rate at cruise altitude to between 20 and 60 seconds for climbs and descents from the TMA to cruise altitude.  In descents to TMA airspace, 40 second updates at 95% 
probability are recommended for general MET applications.  However, at lower altitudes, within about 2000 meters above ground level (AGL), weather conditions can change more rapidly with altitude as an aircraft transitions the planetary boundary layer of the atmosphere.  Consequently, a compromise value of 30 seconds is proposed for 95% update interval of received ARV data for computing wind vector for arrival management, (5th column of Table V-1).   
For critical air-to-air wake vortex applications, the received update rates for wind speed and direction broadcasts are indicated by the 3rd and 4th columns of Table V-1, i.e., 15 
seconds 95% update interval for lead-trail aircraft distances less than 10 NM, and 30 
seconds 95% update interval for nearby aircraft less than 20 NM.  In the first case, a 4 to 1 ratio is assumed for transmit rate to receive rate resulting in a minimum transmit interval of 15 / 4 = 3.75 seconds.  The 30 second requirement for distances less than 20 NM yields the same 3.75 second minimum transmit interval for ADS-B IN wake vortex applications, since the transmit rate to receive rate is assumed to be 8 to 1 for air-to-air ranges less than 20 NM.  The proposed interleaving of ARV and ground vector broadcasts described herein could potentially meet these data requirements. 

An analysis for the arrival management applications based on ADS-B IN reception of ARV data in congested airspace yields similar results.  Wind speed and direction data is required every 30 seconds with a 95% reception probability for aircraft within 30 NM.  
Suppose that ARV data is broadcast 1 out of N velocity squitters, i.e., ground vector is broadcast for N-1 consecutive velocity squitters followed by an ARV velocity squitter.  
In a high-density interference environment, a single squitter needs a probability of reception p1>= 0.25 to assure reliable reception of position data out to 30 NM, i.e., 95% 
probability of reception within 5 seconds, assuming 2 squitter / sec broadcast rate.  It is assumed that a single squitter reception probability p1= 0.25 or better is also required for broadcast of ARV data.  Then to achieve an assured 95% probability of reception within 30 seconds yields the following single squitter probability levels: 

- 
N=4:  p1>= 0.17 
- 
N=6:  p1>= 0.25 
- 
N=8:  p1>=0.33. 
From this analysis we conclude that for 95% reception probability of at least one ARV broadcast within 30 seconds in a high-density interference environment, N=6 is the largest allowable interleaving ratio for velocity squitters, i.e., ARV data needs to be broadcast at least once every 3 seconds to assure reliable ADS-B IN reception of ARV data within 30 seconds in a high interference environment. On the basis of this analysis, N=6 is recommended for interleaving ARV broadcasts and ground vector broadcasts as a means for estimating wind vector.  

Note:
 If an 8 to 1 ratio can be assumed due to ground infrastructure enhancements in 
dense Terminal and En route airspace, then the requirement for ARV broadcast updates can be relaxed slightly to 30 / 8 = 3.75 seconds or N=7 for interleaving ARV and ground vector broadcasts.   

## V.3.2.4 Data Coasting For Continuity Of Arv Data During Gaps In Arv Reception

In traditional surveillance applications, data coasting is used to preserve continuity of surveillance on user displays in the event of large gaps in received position data.  For velocity data, data coasting is the use of the last received velocity report to update aircraft tracks until a specified coasting time limit is reached.  For example, a three scan or 15 
second limit is usually imposed on received position or velocity data in TMA applications, based on limiting the potential errors due to aircraft acceleration transients during the coasting period.  However, with large time gaps on the order of 30 seconds or more between receipt of ARV data in congested airspace, traditional coasting methods could result in frequent loss of ARV data continuity on user displays, particularly for ADS-B IN applications such as In-Trail path following where airspeed data is useful for maintaining desired separation with a lead aircraft.  This section introduces a means for velocity coasting that could enable some ADS-B operations with larger data gaps, based on continuity of wind vector and ground vector data prior to receipt of updated ARV 
data.  This means of data coasting is intended only for tactical ADS-B applications that need continuity of airspeed and heading data, and is not intended for applications where ARV and ground vector are only used to derive wind vector, i.e., for cross-wind based wake avoidance operations. 

As mentioned above, broadcasting ARV data at a low rate, there may be long gaps in ARV reception, whereas applications such as In-Trail following may need to refresh ARV data for airspeed display at a faster nominal rate, say on the order of 5 seconds, for consistency with refresh and display of other state vector data.  Although the wind vector may only need updating at longer intervals, air-reference vector should be updated more frequently due to the presence of aircraft turn maneuvers and other acceleration dynamics.  Fortunately, there is a lot of redundancy between the ground vector and the air-reference vector that potentially allows the use of ground vector and the wind triangle as a means of filling in the gaps in ARV reception, i.e., using the high refresh rate ground vector and the slowly changing wind vector to solve for air-reference vector, and reversing the flow in Figure V-3
 to solve for IAS/CAS airspeed and magnetic or true heading as needed.  
It is not necessary to use measured ground vector directly in this process, i.e., continuity of state data is typically best served using a state vector tracker that updates the aircraft position and ground velocity whenever new position or velocity messages are received.  
Suppose that (Ï*, V*) denotes the current track and ground speed estimates for ADS-B 
IN or ground based surveillance, and (Ïw , Vw) denotes the current wind direction and wind speed, respectively.  Then, from equation V.3-2, TAS is given by  

$$\mathrm{TAS}=\left(\mathrm{vc}^{2}+\left(\mathrm{V}^{*}-\mathrm{vs}\right)^{2}\right)^{\nu_{2}}$$
where from Figure V-2, the cross-track and along-track wind components are given by  
 
vc = Vw*sin (Ïw - Ï*) 
 
vs = Vw*cos (Ïw - Ï*) . 

(If needed, true heading can also be computed from equation V.3-1 by back-solving for 
Ïa.) 
Given TAS, the pressure ratio (delta) and the temperature ratio (theta), CAS can be computed directly, i.e.,  
 
CAS =  f (delta, theta, TAS), where the function f is given explicitly in Ref (8), and by the relationships derived in Section V.6.  The temperature ratio can be computed directly using pressure altitude and standard atmosphere assumptions, or more accurately using measured data such as MET broadcasts of temperature.  The pressure ratio can be computed directly as a function of pressure altitude, depending on whether pressure altitude is above or below the tropopause (~36000 ft).  The resulting CAS value is proposed as a means of coasting airspeed during gaps in received ARV data.  
Note: The same concept applies for coasting ground velocity in the event that GPS 
velocity is lost for some time period. In this case, ARV data is broadcast at a high rate and ground vector can be estimated using the wind triangle and calculations similar to that shown in Figure V-2, except that air-reference and wind vector are added together to estimate ground vector.  
 

## V.4 Provisioning Of Met And Arv Data

In this section the output variables identified for potential future MET and ARV ADS-B 
Message broadcasts described in Sections V.3.1 and V.3.2, respectively, are examined for feasibility and potential for provisioning, i.e., the extent to which these output variables have been defined and are available on standard avionics buses for input to a RTCA DO-
260B/EUROCAE ED-102A, or later version, Extended Squitter transponder.  In addition, related guidance material on data signal update rates and minimum provisioning data sets for mid-term wake vortex and arrival management applications are specified, as currently envisioned.  Further development and standardization work is needed for provisioning and output of the full set of MET and ARV messages identified in Section V.2 for midterm and long-term wake and arrival management applications. Section V.2 identified eleven data elements required for envisioned wake vortex and arrival management applications.  The provisioning status of these data elements (circa 2009) is summarized below: 

- 
Wind speed - feasible for provisioning on standard data buses 
- 
Wind direction - feasible for provisioning on standard data buses 
- 
Static temperature - feasible for provisioning on standard data buses 
- 
Static pressure - feasible for provisioning on standard data buses 
- 
Aircraft emitter category - current ADS-B output element 
- 
Aircraft position - current ADS-B output vector 
- 
Pressure altitude - current ADS-B output element 
- 
Aircraft speed and heading - currently provisioned ADS-B output elements 
- 
Aircraft gross weight - needs further development 
- 
Atmospheric turbulence - needs further development  
- 
Aircraft configuration - needs further development. 
Eight of the eleven data elements identified for envisioned high-value applications are available or provisioned currently.  The last three data elements need further work to enable long-term wake and traffic flow management applications. 

The following Table V-5 identifies ARINC labels and data buses that are potential sources of MET and ARV data outputs. In some cases multiple data sources are potentially available for a specific data output and the preferred data source(s) are highlighted in yellow.  For MET format 1 broadcasts, a minimum useful data set for data provisioning for FMS aircraft with Inertial Reference System (IRS) and Air Data Computer (ADC) capability consists of four of the first eight labels shown below, i.e., 

- 
Wind Speed (ARINC label 315) 
- 
Wind Direction (ARINC label 316) 
- 
Static Air Temperature (ARINC label 213) 
- 
Roll Angle (ARINC label 325). 
 
In the event that static air temperature is not available or convenient for input to the transponder, then Total Air Temperature (ARINC label 211) can be substituted for static air temperature above.  n addition, Static Air Pressure (ARINC label 217) is an optional parameter for MET broadcasts, or can be derived from Pressure Altitude using standard atmosphere equations (Ref 8).  Total Air Pressure (ARINC label 242) may be available as an output from the aircraft avionics, but is not required for MET provisioning, since it can be derived from other MET and ARV outputs if needed, e.g., from static air pressure and Mach number.  The reason for Roll Angle in the above minimum data set is to compute wind data quality, i.e., wind data is generally not reliable at roll angles exceeding 5 degrees.  One minute averaged Atmospheric Turbulence is also specified for MET format 1 messages, but will require further development work such as specification of a standard ARINC label and data bus characteristics.  Seven out of eight ARINC labels needed for MET format 1 provisioning are available today (circa 2009), and an atmospheric turbulence metric could be made available on standard data buses for next generation (presumably RTCA DO-260C/EUROCAE ED-102B) extended squitter systems. For aircraft that do not have an IRS or FMS avionics, it may only be feasible to provision outputs from an onboard ADC system, or from avionics buses used for pilot displays. For these aircraft, a minimum useful data set for ARV provisioning consists of airspeed and heading angle outputs, i.e., 

- 
IAS/CAS Airspeed (ARINC label 206) 
- 
Magnetic Heading Angle (ARINC label 320). 
Alternative output variables, if available for ARV provisioning, are True Airspeed 
(ARINC label 210) rather than CAS Airspeed, and True Heading (ARINC label 314) rather than Magnetic Heading.  The CAS Airspeed and Magnetic Heading outputs are preferred, however as they are directly used for controller-to-pilot coordination such as vectoring and speed instructions.  Mach number (ARINC label 205) could also be substituted for CAS airspeed in future versions of RTCA DO-260()/EUROCAE ED- 102() avionics.  Other desirable, but optional data outputs for MET provisioning for such aircraft include static air temperature and roll angle as specified above.  Static air temperature is desirable for computing true airspeed, and roll angle to compute wind quality, when deriving wind vector from ARV outputs and ground vector as indicated in Figure V-3. As indicated in Table V-5, standardized ARINC labels are needed to provision for MET 
format 2 broadcasts.  Currently only Gross Weight and Humidity have a standardized ARINC label.  Fortunately, these outputs are not essential for initial wake vortex and arrival management applications anticipated for mid-term implementation.  However, variables such as gross weight and true airspeed may be essential outputs for longer-term wake vortex applications, where wake intensity could potentially be used as the basis for advanced wake avoidance procedures.  Further standardization of MET outputs and avionics buses such as ARINC 702A are needed to provision for future MET format 2 
broadcasts. In Table V-5, the maximum transmit interval for any data outputs is 500 msec (0.5 
second).  We here argue that up to 0.5 second latency is compatible with the desired accuracy of wind components for initial wake and arrival management applications assuming: 
 >=2), 

1. Desired Wind Vector accuracy <= 6 knots (95%) (roughly equivalent to ground 
vector NACV
2. Climb and Descent vertical rates <= 3000 ft/min = 50 ft/sec, and 
3. Vertical Wind Shear <= 10 knots per 100 ft vertical change. 
With the above assumptions, a Â½ second latency in reporting wind vector (or estimating wind via ARV and ground vector differencing) can result in a 25 ft vertical error due to transponder input latency, which could result in a 2.5 knot wind error in the assumed vertical shear condition.  Given the need to accommodate both sensor measurement error and ADS-B latency to achieve a 6 knot accuracy (95%) overall, a latency error budget on the order of 3 knots is likely acceptable for the intended mid-term ADS-B applications.

## Notes:

1. **Wind Speed:**  
Preferred sources are highlighted in "Yellow." FMS will need to comply with ARINC 702A, Supplement 3 to provide the data. 
2. **Wind Angle**: Preferred sources are highlighted in "Yellow." FMS will need to comply with ARINC 702A, Supplement 3 to provide the data. 
3. **Total Air Temperature:** Preferred sources are highlighted in "Yellow." Currently, ARINC 702A, Supplement 3, does not include Total Air Temperature output. Therefore, Supplement 3 would 
need to be updated in order to use the FMS as an input to the ADS-B Transmit Subsystem 
4. **Static Air Temperature:** Preferred sources are highlighted in "Yellow." Currently, ARINC 702A, Supplement 3, does not include Static Air Temperature output. Therefore, Supplement 3 would 
need to be updated in order to use the FMS as an input to the ADS-B Transmit Subsystem 
5. **Roll Angle:** 
Preferred sources are highlighted in "Yellow." Roll Angle is needed to determine Wind Quality. 
6. **Humidity**, Label "113," information shown above is taken from ARINC 718A-2, Attachment 3A, where it is shown as being used in BDS Register 4416
. Note that to date, there are no known 
available sources on the aircraft that would be able to provide humidity data. Therefore, the sensor and method of providing the data to the ADS-B Transmit Subsystem remains to be developed as of July 1, 2009. 
7. **Landing Gear Configuration** is provided on some aircraft but there is no uniform standard label assigned for all aircraft. Activity with ARINC would be needed to establish a standardized 
method. 
8. **Flap Setting** information is provided on some aircraft but there is no uniform standard label assigned for all aircraft. Activity with ARINC would be needed to establish a standardized method. 
9. **Gross Weight** information is provided but there is no uniform standard label assigned for all aircraft. Activity with ARINC would be needed to establish a standardized method. Also, ARINC 429 
indicates that the FMC (ARINC 702) should be providing Gross Weight data. To date, there are no known FMS systems that do so. ARINC 702A, Supplement 3, does not include Gross Weight 
information output. Therefore, ARINC 702A Supplement 3 would need to be updated. 
10. **Weather Data:** *Appropriate methods of providing the data to the ADS-B Transmit Subsystem would need to be developed and standardized.*

The primary purpose of this Addendum is to provide equations that relate CAS to Mach and TAS that are appropriate to use for ADS-B receive side derivation of air-reference velocities, consistent with the generating equations used in a standard ADC for subsonic aircraft.  The reason that this appears to be necessary is that most, but not all of the standard atmosphere equations such as those in Ref (8) are valid when using measured static temperature data or non-standard temperature approximations such as use of delta_ISA to compute intermediate variables such as pressure ratio (delta) and temperature ratio (theta) for converting CAS to Mach to TAS, and vice-versa.  The appropriate equations for non-standard atmosphere calculations are easily derived from standardized equations used in current ADC equipment.  This assures that equations consistent with the generating aircraft ADC are used to convert from CAS to TAS and vice-versa for data coasting of air-reference velocities as proposed in Section V.3.2.  A 
secondary purpose of this Addendum is to specify computational units that are consistent with the signals transmitted via ADS-B, e.g., knots for CAS, TAS and wind speed, degrees Kelvin for static temperature, mbar for static pressure, and feet for pressure altitude.  The physical constants cited here were checked against those specified in Ref 
(8) and found to be consistent, to the five significant digits cited here.   
In a conventional Air Data System, there are three fundamental sensor inputs: 

* Static Pressure (Ps) - the pressure of the still air surrounding the airplane, 
* Total (pitot) Pressure (Pt) - the pressure of the moving airstream surrounding the 
airplane, and 
* Total Air Temperature (Tt) - the temperature of the airstream surrounding the 
airplane, including airflow frictional heating and compression. 
 These inputs are transformed by the ADC into CAS and computed Mach (Mc) airspeed outputs, and subsequently into static temperature (Ts) and true airspeed (TAS) outputs for use by various avionics functions.  Also, pressure altitude (hp) is computed, based on the measured static pressure, Ps.  The standardized equations for computing CAS, Mach, TAS and hp can be recast to convert from hp to Ps, and from CAS to TAS or vice-versa by an ADS-B user.  Although the results of this process are well known in the avionics literature, they are re-derived here, in a form convenient for ARV and MET broadcast usage. The fundamental equations in the ADC for Mc and CAS, given Total Pressure Pt and Static Pressure Ps are given by: 
 

Pt / Ps = ( 1 + 0.2(Mc)${}^{2}$ )${}^{7/2}$ (V.6-1)

1 + (Pt - Ps) / Po = ( 1 + 0.2(CAS / Sco)${}^{2}$ )${}^{7/2}$ , CAS $<$ Cso (V.6-2)
 
where Po denotes standard day sea level static pressure =  1013.25 mbar, and  
 
 
Cso denotes standard day sea level speed of sound  =  661.47 knots.   
 
Note:
 These equations assume that the indicated static pressure from the pressure sensor are first corrected for static source error.  In older systems where the indicated static pressure is not corrected, the Mach number is denoted indicated Mach and the airspeed is denoted indicated air speed (IAS).   
 
From equation V.6-1 we obtain: 

(Pt - Ps) / Po = [( 1 + 0.2(Mc)${}^{2}$ )${}^{7/2}$ - 1] * (Ps / Po) (V.6-3)
 
Substituting equaton V.6-3 into V.6-2 and solving for Mach yields  

Mc = { 5 [ (Po/Ps) { ( 1 + 0.2(CAS / Sco)${}^{2}$ )${}^{7/2}$ -1 } +1 ]${}^{27}$ -1 }${}^{1/2}$ (V.6-4)
Equation V.6-4 yields Mach as a function of CAS and pressure ratio Î´ = Ps / Po. This is the detailed equation corresponding to the first block in Figure V-3 for computing wind vector from ARV data. Once Mc is computed in the ADC, then static temperature Ts and TAS are given by 

Ts = Tt / ( 1 + 0.2(Mc)${}^{2}$ ) (V.6-5)
 

TAS = Cs * Mc = ( 38.967 (Ts)${}^{1/2}$ )* Mc (V.6-6)
 
Where Cs denotes the computed speed of sound in knots, as a function of static temperature.  The equation for TAS can be recast in terms of the temperature ratio  Î¸ =  
Ts / To, where  To denotes the standard atmosphere sea level temperature, i.e., To =  288.15 K. Solving for TAS in terms of the temperature ratio Î¸ yields 

TAS = Cos${}^{\star}$ $\theta^{1/2}$ * Mc.

 
This equation corresponds to the second block in Figure V-3 for computing TAS from CAS, delta and theta. We note that equations V.6-2 and V.6-3 can also be back-solved for CAS given Mach and delta, i.e., 

$$\begin{array}{l}\mbox{CAS}=\mbox{Cso}^{*}\left\{\ 5\ [\ (1+(\mbox{Pt}\ -\ \mbox{Ps/Po})^{27}\ -1]\ ]^{1/2}\right.\\ \left.=1479.1\ ^{*}\ \{\ (1+(\mbox{Ps/Po})^{*}[(\ 1+0.2(\mbox{Mc})^{2}\ )^{7/2}\ -1]\ ]^{377}\ -1\ \}^{1/2}\.\right.\end{array}$$ (V.6-8)
 
Given TAS and Î¸, equation V.6-7 can be back-solved for Mach and then converted to CAS using V.6-8.   
Finally, from Ref (8), Ps and Î´ can be computed directly from pressure altitude using the standard atmosphere equations: For hp < htrop = 36, 089 ft, Ps and Î´ are given by  

Ps = Po*( (To - L*hp)/To)${}^{C}$ = Po*( 1 - hp / Ao)${}^{C}$,

$\delta$ = Ps / Po = ( 1 - hp / Ao)${}^{C}$ (V.6-9a)
 where L  =  Standard temperature lapse rate = .0019812 K/ ft Ao =  To/ L =  288.15 / .0019812  =  145, 442 ft, 
 
 
C  =  5.2559. Similarly for hp >= htrop = 36, 089 ft, Î´ is given by 

$\delta=$ Ps / P${}_{0}=\delta_{\rm trop}$ * exp ( - (hp - htrop) / ko ) (V.6-9b)
 

 =  Ptrop / Po  =  226.32 mbar / 1013.25 mbar  =  0.22336,  
where Î´trop
 
 
ko  =  20, 806  ft. The above equations are also valid in non-standard atmosphere conditions since the ADC 
computes pressure altitude directly from delta using standard atmosphere assumptions.

## Executive Summary

The corrigenda related to the Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for the 1090 
MHz Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) and Traffic Information Services - 
Broadcast (TIS-B) systems, published by RTCA on December 2, 2009 as RTCA DO-260B, and published by EUROCAE in December 2009 as EUROCAE ED-102A, are contained herein as a Corrigendum-1 **for RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A**, and has been produced to reflect errata, corrections and clarifications to requirements and test procedures for 1090ES ADS-B 
and TIS-B transmitting and receiving systems, as a result of comments received from industry during their implementation of products conforming to the referenced standard since the publication of the standards in December 2009.   
With the publication of this document as "Corrigendum-1 for RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE 
ED-102A," errata are being reviewed for RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A that have been identified since the time of the publication of DO-260B/ED-102A.  These errata do not alter any requirements within the original DO-260B/ED-102A documents published in December 2009.   
Errata in this Corrigendum-1 include, but are not limited to:    

1. Correcting typographical and paragraph reference errors; 2. Correcting various test procedure data input, or expected results; and 3. Additions of clarifying text where issues have been raised, or where clarification has been 
found to be required.   

## Corrigendum-1 For Rtca Do-260B And Eurocae Ed-102A

 
Extended Squitter Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) and Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B) Equipment Operating on the Radio Frequency of 1090 Megahertz (MHz) The applicable standards for the corrigenda described in this document is RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, "Minimum Operational Performance Standards for 1090 MHz Extended Squitter Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) and Traffic Information Services 
- Broadcast (TIS-B)," issued December, 2009. Corrigenda that are being specified in this Corrigendum-1 for RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE 
ED-102A will use numbers such as (1.1) through (**1.xx**). 

In the following list of corrigenda, for those items where existing text is proposed to be changed, the new text is presented in blue font color and underlined, and deleted text is presented in strikethrough and red font color text.  In those corrigenda where a totally new section or new text is proposed to be inserted, all the text is presented in blue font color and underlined.  In some cases, a yellow highlighting of text may be used to emphasize a specific issue. (1.1) 
In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§1.1, in order to correctly describe the addition of an Appendix "W" for the purpose of inserting this entire "Corrigendum-1 for DO-260B/ED-102A," at the end of Â§1.1, insert the following description: 

 
Appendix W includes the content of "Corrigendum-1 for DO-260B/ED-102A" which serves to itemize errata that was discovered in the document after the publication of RTCA DO- 260B and EUROCAE ED-102A in December 2009.  The Appendix also includes the addition of notes in some areas in an effort to clarify issues that have been points of discussion during the implementation of ADS-B Version 2 transmitting subsystems, as defined by RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A.  These errata do not alter any requirements within the original DO-260B/ED-102A documents published in December 2009.   

 (1.2) 
In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in order to correct a bad reference to 
Advisory Circular 23.1309-1D, in sections Â§1.2.3, Â§2.1.9, Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.4.6 and Â§A.1.4.10.14: 
 
Change "AC 23.1309-1C"  to  "AC 23.1309-1D"   

 (1.3) 
In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§1.2.4.3, in order to correctly 
point to places where the transmission rates are defined and to correct references to TIS-B, 
edit the second and third paragraphs as follows:   
 
For ADS-B Messages, ICAO Doc 9871 provides the Mode S Transponder Register definitions as well as the 56-bit data formats required for the ADS-B Messages.  Appendix A to this document specifies the formats contained in ICAO Doc 9871, plus those eventdriven messages that are now defined.  The transmission rate for each of the defined broadcast messages is defined in the subparagraphs of Â§2.2.3.3 and in Appendix A and in the MOPS for Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System/Mode Select (ATCRBS/Mode-S) Airborne Equipment (RTCA DO-181D) (EUROCAE ED-73C). 

TIS-B Messages have not yet been incorporated into the ICAO Annex 10 SARPs, nor into the Mode S Transponder MOPS (RTCA/DO-181D, EUROCAE ED-73C).  TIS-B Messages are defined in Â§2.2.17 and Â§A.2 of this document and in ICAO Doc 9871.    

 (1.4) 
In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§1.4.2.1, the first paragraph is the initial occurrence of the reference to RTCA DO-181D and EUROCAE ED-73C.  Both of 
these Transponder MOPS documents were updated to reflect changes that were made to the ADS-B MOPS with the publication of RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A.  For all 
references to the Transponder MOPS in RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A:   
 
Change DO-181D to DO-181E   and   **Change** ED-73C to ED-73E (1.5) 
In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.1.12.1, after Table 2-4 in the Notes for Table 2-3 and 2-4, the information in *Note* #4 was not updated with the revisions 
to the Target State and Status Message for DO-260B/ED-102A.  Make the following updates to *Note* #4:   
 
4. 
On-Condition reports is a category that includes multiple report types.  Each specific 
On-Condition report type includes the following elements: - 
Target State Report (see Table 2-97) o Time of Applicability o Horiztonal Short Term Intent Selected Heading o Vertical Short Term Intent MCP/FCU or FMS Selected Altitude o Barometric Pressure Setting (Minus 800 millibars) 
- 
Air Referenced Velocity Report (see Table 2-100) 
o Address (the ICAO 24-bit Address) 
o Time of Applicability o Airspeed o Heading 
- 
Reserved for Trajectory Change Reports 
(1.6) 
In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.1.2.b, since it is recognized that Extended Squitter-capable Transponders are defined as being required to 
have Level 2 or above capabilities, the value of CA=0 is not authorized for use in these Transponders.  Therefore, a clarifying *Note* should be added under subparagraph "b" as 
follows:    
 
Note: Since a Transponder supporting Extended Squitter is required to be at a minimum of Level 2 or greater, the CA field can only support values equal to 4, 5, 6 or 7.   

 (1.7) 
In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.3.1, inside Table 2-14, 
the value for RC less than 0.5 NM is expressed incorrectly.  Make the following change:   
 
The phrase "RC < 0.5 NM (925 m)" **should be** "RC < 0.5 NM (926 m)"   

 (1.8) 
In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.3.1.1, in order to account for the fact that some regulators have already made clarifying statements on HPL limiting, please add the following as Note #2, just after the existing *Note* under the section heading:   
 
Notes: 1. If the position information comes from a GNSS receiver that conforms to the ARINC 
743A characteristic, a suitable source of information for the radius of containment (RC), 
is ARINC 429 label 130 from that GNSS receiver.   
2. Although these requirements do not require HPL limiting, it is expected that some 
regulators will only accept installations that limit HPL.  This may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS. (1.9) 
In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.1, in order to account 
for the fact that some regulators have already made clarifying statements on HPL limiting, 
please add the following as *Note* #2, just after the existing *Note*:   
 
Notes: 
1. If the position information comes from a GNSS receiver that conforms to the ARINC 
743A characteristic, a suitable source of information for the radius of containment (RC), 
is ARINC 429 label 130 from that GNSS receiver.   
2. Although these requirements do not require HPL limiting, it is expected that some 
regulators will only accept installations that limit HPL.  This may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS. 
(**1.10**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.4.3, in order to account 
for the fact that some regulators have already made restrictions on the usage of the Ground 
Speed when it is below 7 knots, please add the following additional clarification inside the 
parenthetical at the end of the *Note* following Table 2-17: 
 
Note: If a source of A/V Heading is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, but a source of Ground Track angle is available, then Ground Track angle may be used instead of Heading, provided that the "Status Bit for Heading/Ground Track" 
subfield is set to ZERO whenever the Ground Track angle is not a reliable indication of the A/V's heading.  (The Ground Track angle is not a reliable indication of the A/V's heading when the A/V's ground speed is close to ZERO.  Some regulators have already established such limits.  These limits may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.)   

 (**1.11**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.14, the values in 
Table 2-30 need to account for the situation where the barometric and Geometric (GNSS or 
INS) altitude source data are exactly equal.  Edit the "Meaning" in Table 2-30 for the value 
of ZERO (0) as follows:   
 

Table 2-30: "Difference From Barometric Altitude Sign Bit" Encoding 
Coding 
Meaning 
0 
Geometric (GNSS or INS) Altitude Source data 
is greater than (above) or equal to Barometric 
1 
Geometric (GNSS or INS) Altitude Source data 
is less than (below) Barometric 

 (**1.12**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.15, in order to 
account for the fact that some regulators have already made clarifying statements on the usage of MSL, please add the following *Note* #2:   
 
2. Although the above requirements allows this subfield to be based on MSL in certain 
cases, it is expected that some regulators will only accept installations that report based on WGS-84 HAE.  HAE will be required for some State mandates and the manufacturer must ensure that when converting from HAG (e.g., MSL) to HAE, the same model used by the position source is used.  This may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS. 
(**1.13**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.3.7, in order to clarify 
the dependency of the Selected Heading on a reference direction flag, please add the following new *Note #2* just after sub-bullet "c:"   
 
2. The Selected Heading parameter does not have a source bit in this version of these 
MOPS to indicate its reference orientation (True North or Magnetic North). Implementers of the Target State and Status Message are encouraged whenever possible to use input parameters to populate this field that utilize Magnetic North orientation, as that is the de facto standard utilized by most users of this data.  However since many aircraft have flight decks that can operate in either True North or Magnetic North orientation, this field should be encoded with the current active value in the flight deck, regardless of orientation.  Users of the Selected Heading data should be aware that there is no method defined in this version of these MOPS to indicate its reference orientation. (**1.14**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.3.11 references to the 
LNAV Mode Engaged were left out in the final edit.  Add references to "ME" bit 54, and Message bit 86 into the proper places as follows for this section:   
 
The "Status of MCP / FCU Mode Bits" subfield is a 1-bit ("ME" bit 47, Message bit 79) 
field that shall be used to indicate whether the mode bits ("ME" bits 48, 49, 50, and 52, and 
54, Message bits 80, 81, 82, and 84 and 86) are actively being populated (e.g., set) in the Target State and Status Message in accordance with Table 2-48.

No Mode Information is being provided  in "ME" bits 48, 49, 50, or 52 or 54 (Message bits 80, 81, 82, or 84 or 86
) 
1 
Mode Information is deliberately being provided  in "ME" bits 48, 49, 50, or 52 or 54 (Message bits 80, 81, 82, or 84 or 86
) 

 
If information is provided to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to set either "ME" bit 48, 49, 50, or 52 or 54 (Message bit 80, 81, 82, or 84 or 86) to either "0" or "1," then bit 47 shall be set to ONE (1).  Otherwise, bit 47 shall be set to ZERO (0).   

 (**1.15**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.7.1.3.18, inside Table 2-
54, the definition of the LNAV Mode Engaged subfield was not totally defined.  The "or Unknown" case must be added to the encoding of ZERO (0), as follows:

 (**1.16**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.4.8, in order to 
correct a cut-and-paste error, make the following correction to this paragraph: 
 
"Reserved" bits, ("ME" bits 33 - 40, Message bits 65 - 72) in the OM Code Subfield of Surface Airborne format Aircraft Operational Status Messages are reserved for future assignment.  Until such future assignment, these bits shall be set to "ZERO" (0).   

 (**1.17**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.8, in order to clarify 
the usage of the Geometric Vertical Accuracy (GVA) metric with respect to the Baro-Geo 
Difference data field in the Airborne Velocity Message, make a change in the existing initial paragraph, and add a new *Note* below the paragraph as follows:   
 
The "Geometric Vertical Accuracy (GVA)" subfield of Subtype=0 Aircraft Operational Status Message is a 2-bit field ("ME" bits 49-50, Message bits 81-82) defined in Table 2-71. The GVA field shall be set by using the Vertical Figure of Merit (VFOM) (95%) from the GNSS position source used to encode the geometric altitude field in the Airborne Position Message report the geometric altitude.   

 
Note: The geometric altitude may be reported directly in the altitude field in the Airborne Position Message or indirectly using the Difference From Barometric Altitude subfield (Â§2.2.3.2.6.1.15) in the Airborne Velocity Message (Â§2.2.3.2.6) when barometric altitude is reported in the altitude field in the Airborne Position Message 
(Â§2.2.3.2.3.4).   

 (**1.18**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.8, in order to clarify 
the usage of the Geometric Vertical Accuracy (GVA) metric encoding values for previous and potential future ADS-B Versions, revise the *Note* below Table 2-71 as follows:   
 
Note: For the purposes of these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A) values for 
0, 1 and 2 are encoded.  Decoding values for 3 should be treated as < 45 meters until future versions of these MOPS redefine the value.  It is expected that ADS-B transmitting subsystems with ADS-B Version Numbers greater than 2 will define the GVA encoding of "3" as a value less than 45 meters at some point in the future. Therefore, ADS-B Version 2 receiving subsystems should treat the GVA encoding of "3" as less than 45 meters for data received from ADS-B Version Numbers 2 or greater. 

(**1.19**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.13, in order to clarify 
what the Horizontal Reference Direction (HRD) flag applies to, please add the following new *Note* just after the paragraph and prior to Table 2-76:    
 
Note: The HRD flag only applies to the Heading/Ground Track subfield in the Surface 
Position Message, or the Heading subfield in the Airborne Velocity Message (Subtypes 3 & 4).   

 (**1.20**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.3.1.2, Table 2-79 
summarizes the broadcast rates of the 1090ES ADS-B Messages.  There was one case that 
was not included in the original summary of broadcast rates, wherein there would be no 
transmission of the Aircraft Status Message.  Replace Table 2-79 with the following:

(**1.21**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.1.a, in order to clarify 
the target state information that is required to be "available and valid" in order to start transmission of the Target State and Status (Subtype=1) Message, insert the following *Note* 
after subparagraph "a:"   
 
Note: Target state information includes both Selected Altitude and Selected Heading data.  
Because only one of these may actually be available in any given installation, then in order to initiate broadcast of the Target State and Status (Subtype=1) Message, either the Selected Altitude or the Selected Heading data must be available and valid as a minimum.  Future versions of these MOPS may include the Barometric Pressure Setting (BPS) as a required parameter in order to initiate the Target State and Status Message.   

 
(**1.22**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.2.a, add a clarifying 
expression on to the end of subparagraph "a" as follows:   
 
a. Airborne Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, Subtype=0) **shall** be 
broadcast  at the rates given in the following subparagraphs when aircraft operational status information is valid and when in the airborne state (i.e., when airborne message formats are being broadcast); (**1.23**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.2.b, add a clarifying 
expression on to the end of subparagraph "b" as follows:   
 
b. Surface Aircraft Operational Status Messages (TYPE=31, Subtype=1) **shall** be broadcast 
at the rates given in the following subparagraphs when aircraft operational status information is valid and when in the ON-Ground state (i.e., when surface message 
formats are being broadcast); (**1.24**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.2.b.(3) to correct a 
cut-and-paste error and to indicate that the high broadcast rate that occurs when an aircraft is 
on the surface and moving with a change in NICSUPP/NAC/SIL, replace subparagraph 
Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.2.b.(3) with:  
 
(3). 
Aircraft/Vehicle Is Moving With Change in NICSUPP/NAC/SIL Data: 
 
If the Aircraft/Vehicle IS Moving and there has been a change in the NICSUPP, NAC, or SIL data provided in the Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message (TYPE=31, Subtype=1), then the messages shall be broadcast at random intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds relative to the previous Surface Aircraft Operational Status Message for a period of 24 Â±1 seconds as long as data is available to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph "b." above.   

 (**1.25**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.3.2.11, in order to clarify 
the intended purpose of this subsection, revise *Note #1* and add the following *Note #3*: 
 
1. These messages data subfields are cleared to prevent the reporting of outdated position 
and velocity information.   
 
3. All references in this subsection relate to the treatment of data subfields in specific ADS-
B Messages after the data in that subfield has not been refreshed for some specified period of time, known as a "timeout."  The requirements for terminating the actual transmission of ADS-B Messages are specified separately in the subparagraphs of 
Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.   
 
 
(**1.26**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.3.2.12, in order to clarify 
the intended purpose of this subsection, add a *Note* immediately after the section heading and prior to sub-bullet "a" as follows:   
 
Note: The subsections below contain requirements for terminating transmission of ADS-B 
Messages.  These requirements are in response to data timeout conditions or in response to terminating transmission of other ADS-B Messages.  Requirements in the subparagraphs of Â§2.2.3.3.2.11 relate to the treatment of data subfields in specific ADS-B Messages after the data in that subfield has not been refreshed for some specified period of time, known as a "timeout."   

 (**1.27**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.b, in the *Note* 
following the text of subparagraph "b" it has been discovered that there are several places in DO-260B/ED-102A that reference the "Ground Track" or "Heading" field in the Surface 
Position Message without referencing both data items.  In this specific *Note*, in order to 
correctly reference the data item, make the following edit:   
 
Note: For the Surface Position Message, the receipt of new Movement, or Heading/Ground 
Track data is not sufficient to maintain broadcast of the message once the message 
has been initiated. 
(**1.28**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.e, in order to clarify 
the fact that there are actually two defined requirements for terminating the broadcast of Target State and Status Messages, replace the existing *Note* below sub-bullet "e" with the 
following:   
 
Note: The broadcast of Target State and Status (Subtype=1) Messages may be terminated either: (1) as a result of the requirements of Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.1.b if the target state information is no longer available or valid, or (2) if the broadcast of the Airborne Position Message has been terminated (see Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.a), since the Target State and Status Messages contain various integrity, mode, or status information that is applicable to the Airborne Position Messages, data which becomes irrelevant if the broadcast of the Airborne Position Message has been terminated.   

 
(**1.29**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.f, in order to clarify 
the requirements for terminating the broadcast of Aircraft Operational Status Messages, 
replace the existing *Note* below sub-bullet "f" with the following:   
 
Note: The broadcast of the Aircraft Operational Status Messages (either Subtype 0 or 1) 
may be terminated only after the termination of the respective Airborne (see Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.a) or Surface (see Â§2.2.3.3.2.12.b) Position Messages, since the Operational Status Messages contain various integrity, mode, version number, or status information that is applicable to the respective Position Messages, data which becomes irrelevant if the broadcast of that Position Message has been terminated.   

 (**1.30**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.4.3.4.1.a, there is a 
typographical error in specifying the threshold were the value "A" should be -6 dB Â±1 dB 
instead of "-6 dB + 1 dB."  Make the following correction in the last three lines of subparagraph "a:" 
 
â¦â¦â¦â¦... is received (Â§2.2.3.1.1), in which case the threshold shall be held at A -6 dB Â±1 dB for a period of not less than 115 microseconds and shall be recovered in not more than 120 microseconds. 

 
(**1.31**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.5.1.10, in order to account 
for the fact that some regulators have already made restrictions on the usage of the Ground Speed when it is below 7 knots, please add the following additional clarification inside the parenthetical at the end of *Note #2*, just prior to Â§2.2.5.1.11:   
 
2. If a source of A/V Heading is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, but a 
source of Ground Track angle is available, then Ground Track angle may be used 
instead of Heading, provided that the "Status Bit for Heading/Ground Track" subfield is 
set to ZERO whenever the Ground Track angle is not a reliable indication of the A/V's heading.  (The Ground Track angle is not a reliable indication of the A/V's heading when the A/V's ground speed is close to ZERO.  Some regulators have already 
established such limits.  These limits may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.) (**1.32**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.5.1.22, there is an incorrect 
reference to the UAT IN subfield.  Make the following change: 
 
The ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem **shall** be capable of accepting "UAT IN" information via an appropriate variable data input interface and use such data to establish subfields in transmitted ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Messages as specified in Â§2.2.3.2.7.2.3.2 
2.2.3.2.7.2.3.9.   

 (**1.33**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.5.2.2.c, in the text of 
subparagraph "c" it has been discovered that there are several places in DO-260B/ED-102A 
that reference the "Ground Track" or "Heading" field in the Surface Position Message without referencing both data items.  In this specific subparagraph, in order to correctly reference the data items, make the following edits:     
 
c. Any change in Heading/Ground Track identified in Â§2.2.3.2.4.3 and Â§2.2.3.2.4.4 **shall** be 
reflected in the appropriate Heading/Ground Track subfields of the next scheduled 
Surface Position Message transmission provided that the change occurs at least 100 milliseconds prior to the next scheduled Surface Position Message transmission. 
(**1.34**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.8.1.4.3, in the text of the 
second paragraph it has been discovered that there are several places in DO-260B/ED-102A that reference the "Ground Track" or "Heading" field in the Surface Position Message 
without referencing both data items.  In this specific paragraph, in order to correctly reference the data items, make the following edit:   
 
Each time that a Surface Position Message is received with valid Movement AND Heading/Ground Track data, the Report Assembly Function **shall** update the Velocity Time 
of Applicability data in the State Vector Report with either the GPS/GNSS UTC Measure Time data (see Â§2.2.8.5.1) or the Established Receiver Unit Time (see Â§2.2.8.5.2), whichever is applicable to the Receiving device Report Assembly Function installation requirements. (**1.35**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.8.1.16, in order to clarify the 
reporting of the correct Type Code by an ADS-B Receiving Subsystem when using one or 
more of the NIC-Supplement parameters to interpret the correct radius of Containment (RC), 
make corrections to the existing *Note*, and add an additional *Note* under the section as 
follows:   
 
Notes: 
1. For backward compatibility, applications designed to interface to the State Vector 
Report structure of RTCA DO-260A will decode RC < 0.3 NM as NIC=6 with a NIC Supplement=0, and interpret it as RC < 0.65 NM.  Applications designed to comply with 
these MOPS will properly decode the NIC as RC < 0.3 NM.   
2. NIC is derived by the combination of Airborne or Surface Position Message Type Codes 
and NIC Supplement bits broadcast in Airborne Position Messages (NIC Supplement-B), and Operational Status Messages (NIC Supplement-A and C).  Because of the different rates of broadcast between either Airborne or Surface Position Messages, and the Operational Status Messages, during a NIC change or airborne/surface format reporting transitions, the receipt of a new Type Code can no longer be associated with the NIC Supplement bits previously received and processed by the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem.  These transitions may yield an incorrect NIC value or a value not specified in Table 2-69 (also see Table 2-14).  In order to prevent improper reporting of NIC to ADS-B applications during these NIC transitions, the reporting of NIC needs to consider the following cases:   
a. For reporting of NIC during Type Code changes between position messages of the 
same format (either airborne-to-airborne or surface-to-surface), the largest RC for 
that Type Code (Type Code and NIC Supplement-B for Airborne Position Messages) should be reported in accordance with Table 2-69 (see also Table 2-14), until a subsequent update of NIC Supplement bits occurs from receipt of an Operational Status Message.   
b. When aircraft transition from transmitting Airborne Position Messages to Surface 
Position Messages, a Surface Operational Status Message (Subtype=1) is required to be received to correctly determine NIC.  In this case, until the reception of a 
Surface Operational Status Message, the reported NIC should correspond to the RC 
of the last received airborne RC if the Type Code of the received Surface Position Message can represent this, or the next larger RC value defined for that Type Code. Otherwise, report the NIC corresponding to the largest RC for that received Surface 
Position Type Code until an Operational Status Message is received.   
c. When aircraft transition from transmitting Surface Position Messages to Airborne 
Position Messages, an Airborne Operational Status Message (Subtype=0) is required to be received to correctly determine NIC if Type Code=13, and the NIC 
Supplement-B is equal to ONE (1) (in order to distinguish between RC < 0.3 NM and RC < 0.6 NM).  In this case, until the reception of a new Airborne Operational Status Message, if the last reported surface RC was either RC < 0.3 NM or RC < 0.6 NM, then report the corresponding NIC value.  Otherwise, report RC < 0.6 NM. (**1.36**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.13.6.1, the last sentence 
contains a reference to the paragraph previously holding the description of the Single Antenna Flag (SAF), which was moved in DO-260B/ED-102A, but the reference in the last sentence was not correctly updated.  In order to clarify the usage of the SAF while an aircraft is on the surface, and to correct the bad paragraph reference, please add *Note* #2 and 
modify the last sentence as follows: 

## 

Notes: 
1. For example, successive Airborne Position Messages would be transmitted on different 
antennas.  Again, successive messages loaded into a transponder's event-driven register 
would be transmitted alternately from the top and bottom antennas.   
2. On systems implementing transmitting diversity, the use of the top antenna only is the 
default condition for broadcasting the surface type messages.  The selection of the antenna when transmitting surface type messages may be under the control of other 
systems (see RTCA DO-181E / EUROCAE ED-73E).   
 
If transmission diversity is used, the bit The Single Antenna Flag is set as described in 
Â§2.2.3.2.3.3 2.2.3.2.7.2.4.5 **shall** be set valid.     

 (**1.37**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.2.17.3.5.1, modify the initial 
paragraph as follows:    
 
The format of the TIS-B Coarse Position Message is not specifically related to any other ADS-B format.  The Surveillance Status and CPR Format (F) fields **shall** be decoded as specified for the ADS-B Airborne Position Message defined in Â§2.2.3.2.3.  The formats for the other elements of the TIS-B Coarse Position Message are is specified in the following subparagraphs.     

 
(**1.38**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.3, in the third paragraph is the 
initial reference to RTCA DO-160F and EUROCAE ED-14F, Environmental Conditions 
and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment.  This document is updated approximately every two years by RTCA and EUROCAE, and all references to these Environmental documents should be considered to be the latest published version.  Currently, for all references to DO-160F and ED-14F inside RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, edit 
as follows:    
 
Change DO-160F to DO-160G   and   **Change** ED-14F to ED-14G 

 
(**1.39**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.3.1, in Table 2-112 the 
references to specific tests that should be conducted only "when required" were not entered into this version of these MOPS as described in the second paragraph under Â§2.3.  
Therefore, edit Table 2-112 as follows:

(**1.40**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, section Â§2.3.2.3.1 contains the initial 
occurrence of a test condition in which DF=17 is specified along with CA=0.  Since it is 
recognized that Extended Squitter-capable Transponders are defined as being required to 
have Level 2 or above capabilities, the value of CA=0 is not authorized for use in these 
Transponders.  Therefore, it is not appropriate for CA=0 to be specified in a test case where DF=17.  Since the actual value of CA used in each test is not significant, in all of the following test procedure sections, for clarification, please strike reference to the test condition for CA=0:

 (**1.41**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.3.2.4.3, in order to correct a 
value in Step 3 of the test procedure, make the following change:  
 
Step 3: Re-Trigger Capability - Part 3 
 
Repeat Step 1 with **Input** level at -24 32 dBm for the first ADS-B Message and  
-16 dBm for the second ADS-B Message.   

 (**1.42**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.2.2.12, in order to correct a 
bad reference, make the following change: 
 
Test procedures to validate the broadcast rate capability requirements for the ADS-B transmitted message are provided in Â§2.4.3.2.7.9 2.4.3.3 through Â§2.4.3.3.2.12 of this document. 

 (**1.43**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.1.2.1, Step 3 at the end of 
the 2nd paragraph, there is a reference to Table 2-19, which is hyperlinked.  Unfortunately, 
when the hyperlink was initiated, it was pointed to Figure 2-19 instead of Table 2-19.  This unfortunate error cannot be corrected until the document is re-published. 
(**1.44**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, section Â§2.4.3.2.1.7 contains a test condition 
in which DF=17 is specified along with CA=0.  Since it is recognized that Extended Squitter-capable Transponders are defined as being required to have Level 2 or above capabilities, the value of CA=0 is not authorized for use in these Transponders.  Therefore, it 
is not appropriate for CA=0 to be specified in a test case where DF=17.  In the 
"Measurement Procedure:" section, in order to clarify this, strike through sub-bullet "a" and 
change the reference for test set up in sub-bullet "h" to only reference sub-bullets "b" through "f" as follows:   
 
a. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 17 and "CA" = 0, use Set 1. b. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 17 and "CA" = 4, use Set 2. c. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 17 and "CA" = 5, use Set 3. d. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 17 and "CA" = 6, use Set 4. 
e. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 17 and "CA" = 7, use Set 5. 
f. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 18 with "CF" = 0, use Set 6.  Note that this is 
the case where the equipment is non-Transponder device. 
g. For equipment that can transmit "DF" = 19 with "AF" = 0, use Set 7.  Note that this case 
is where the equipment is for Military Applications. 
h. Where an equipment is capable of transmitting several of the cases described in 
paragraphs "a b." through "f.," above, it should suffice that the equipment be testing to only one of the cases since the parity encoding should work the same for all. 
(**1.45**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.1.7, in order to correct 
several typographical errors, replace Table 2-136 with the following.  The modified data are 
highlighted in yellow:

(**1.49**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.4.2, Step 2 there is a need 
to correct the test procedure parameters.  Make the following minor corrections: 
 

## Step 2: "Movement" Verification - Part 2

 
Set up the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem as above and set the "Movement" input to represent a "Movement" of greater than or equal to Zero knots, but less than or equal to 0.125 knots.  Verify that the "Movement" subfield is set to TWO (binary 
000 0010).  Increase the "Movement" input to a value greater than 0.126 0.125 
knots and less than 0.270 knots, and verify that the "Movement" subfield is set to THREE (binary 000 0011).   

 (**1.50**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.4.2, Step 3 there is a need 
to correct the test procedure parameters.  Make the following minor corrections: 
 

## Step 3: "Movement" Verification - Part 3

 
Continue to increase the "Movement" input in increments equal to those identified in Table 2-16 for values greater than or equal to ONE knot and less than 175 knots.  
Verify that for each such increment, the encoding of the "Movement" subfield is equal to that specified in Table 2-16.  Increase the Ground Speed input data to exactly 175 knots and verify that the "Movement" subfield is set to 124 123.  
Continue increasing the Ground Speed data input for values greater than 175 knots and verify that the "Movement" subfield continues to be set at 124. 

(**1.51**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.4.2, Step 4, in the 2nd 
paragraph there is a need to correct the test procedure parameters.  Make the following 
minor correction:   
 
Input new ADS-B Surface Position data with the position data changing at a rate of 9.9 meters in any 30 second interval.  At least 61 36 seconds after the input of the new data, verify that the "Movement" subfield is set to decimal ONE (1) "Aircraft Stopped."   

 
Note: The 36 seconds is derived from the initial 30 second interval plus the 5 second broadcast rate, plus one second.   

 (**1.52**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.5.3, in order to be 
consistent with changes that were made in RTCA DO-181E and EUROCAE ED-73E and 
ICAO Doc 9871, Edition 2 to clarify the zeroing and termination of Registers 0816 and 2016, 
revise Step 4 of this test procedure as shown below:   
 
Step 4 
No Aircraft Identification or Aircraft Registration Data 
 
Discontinue the input of Aircraft Identification or Aircraft Registration Marking Data.  Reinitialize the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem and ensure that Aircraft Identification or Flight Number Data, and Aircraft Registration Data is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem.  Verify that each of the characters in the ADS-B Aircraft Identification and Category Message is transmitted properly with all bits of each character set to a binary ZERO (0).  The encoding for each character should be ALL ZEROs (binary 000000). 

Note: 
The message will continue to be transmitted as long as Category data continues to be updated. 

 (**1.53**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.6.1.9, the specification of 
the location of the Message and "ME" bits inside the Airborne Velocity Message as 
specified in the "Purpose/Introduction:" section are incorrect.  Please make the following 
corrections:   
 

## Purpose/Introduction:

 
The "North/South Velocity" subfield is contained in Message bits 55 58 - 65 67 ("ME" bits 
23 26 - 33 35) of Airborne Velocity Messages - Subtypes "1" and "2."  This test procedure verifies that the "North/South Velocity" subfield in Airborne Velocity Messages is correctly set.   

 
(**1.54**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.7.1.3.3, inside Table 2-
151 there is an error in the specification of a Data Value for existing Item #3.  There are also problems with the numbering in the "Item #" column in both Table 2-151 and 2-152.  
Therefore, replace: (a) Table 2-151, (b) Step 2 of the Test Procedure, and (c) Table 2-152 with the following:

 (**1.56**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.7.1.3.9, Step 2, 1st 
paragraph, there is an incorrect reference to a bit location for the "ALTITUDE TYPE.  Make the following minor correction:   
 
Step 2: Verification of NICBARO Transmission 
 
Provide the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem with valid Barometric Pressure Altitude data via the appropriate input interface.  Operationally select Barometric Pressure Altitude as the Primary Altitude information and verify that the 
"ALTITUDE TYPE" field in "ME" bit 10 9 is set to ZERO (0). 

 (**1.57**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.7.2.4.5, for test procedure 
Steps 1 and 2, an unfortunate cut-and-past error has left references to the Airborne Position 
Message, where the Single Antenna Flag (SAF) existed in DO-260/ED-102 and in RTCA 
DO-260A.  With the development of DO-260B/ED-102A, the SAF was moved to the Aircraft Operational Status Message.  Therefore, Steps 1 and 2 should be edited as follows:   
 
Step 1: Non-Diversity Configuration For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems that operate with a single antenna, configure 
the system to broadcast Airborne Position Aircraft Operational Status Messages. Verify that the Single Antenna subfield ("ME" bit 30) is set to "ONE" (1) at all times in the Airborne Position Aircraft Operational Status Message. 
 

## Step 2: Diversity Configuration

For ADS-B Transmitting Subsystems that operate in the diversity mode, configure the system to broadcast Airborne Position Aircraft Operational Status Messages. Verify that the Single Antenna subfield ("ME" bit 30) is set to "ZERO" (0) at all times in the Airborne Position Aircraft Operational Status Message. 

 
Disable one antenna channel by whatever means that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem utilizes to detect a non-functioning antenna channel.  Verify that the Single Antenna subfield ("ME" bit 30) is set to "ONE" (1) in the Airborne Position Aircraft Operational Status Message.  Repeat, except disable the alternate channel and verify that the Single Antenna subfield is set to ONE (1) in the Airborne Position Aircraft Operational Status Message. 

 (**1.58**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.7.2.4.8, in order to 
correct a cut-and-paste error, make the following correction to the text in the 
Purpose/Introduction paragraph: 
 
"Reserved" bits, ("ME" bits 33 - 40, Message bits 65 - 72) in the OM Code Subfield of surface airborne format Aircraft Operational Status Messages are reserved for future assignment.  Until such future assignment, these bits will be set to "ZERO" (0). 

 (**1.59**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.7.2.8, in order to clarify 
the usage of the Geometric Vertical Accuracy (GVA) metric with respect to the Baro-Geo Difference data field in the Airborne Velocity Message, make a change as follows in the 
existing paragraph of the "Purpose/Introduction" section:   
 
The "Geometric Vertical Accuracy (GVA)" subfield of Subtype=0 Aircraft Operational Status Message is a 2-bit field ("ME" bits 49-50, Message bits 81-82) defined in Table 2-71. The GVA field shall be set by using the Vertical Figure of Merit (VFOM) (95%) from the 
GNSS position source used to encode the geometric altitude field in the Airborne Position 
Message report the geometric altitude. (**1.60**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.2.7.2.10, Step 1 in the 2nd 
paragraph, there is an incorrect reference to a bit location for the "ALTITUDE TYPE.  Make the following minor correction:   
 
Operationally select Barometric Pressure Altitude as the Primary Altitude information and verify that the "ALTITUDE TYPE" field in "ME" bit 10 9 of the Target State and Status Message is set to ZERO (0).   

 
(**1.61**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.3.1.4.1, in order to clarify 
the target state information that is required to be "available and valid" in order to start transmission of the Target State and Status (Subtype=1) Message, and to be consistent with the clarification made in Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.1.a, insert the following *Note* after the 
"Purpose/Introduction" paragraph:   
 
Note: Target state information includes both Selected Altitude and Selected Heading data.  
Because only one of these may actually be available in any given installation, then in order to initiate broadcast of the Target State and Status (Subtype=1) Message, either the Selected Altitude or the Selected Heading data must be available and valid as a minimum.  Future versions of these MOPS may include the Barometric Pressure Setting (BPS) as a required parameter in order to initiate the Target State and Status Message. 

 (**1.62**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.3.1.4.2 to correctly test that 
the high broadcast rate that occurs when an aircraft is on the surface and moving with a 
change in NICSUPP/NAC/SIL data, replace the second paragraph of test procedure Step 6 
with:   
 
Verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem is broadcasting ADS-B Surface Aircraft Operational Status Messages at a spacing uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 
seconds for a period of 24 Â±1 seconds.   

 (**1.63**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.3.1.4.3.1, Step 2, 
subsection "a.(1)," at the end of the test procedure paragraph, there needs to be an additional test to ensure that the broadcast continues at the specified rate for at least 30 seconds.  Please make the following corrections:   
 
Step 2: Emergency/Priority Message Rate started with Mode A Code Off and Emergency 
(Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1.1.a and b) 
 
a. Via the appropriate data input interface, provide the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem with Mode A (4096) Code of "7500". 
 
After setting the Mode A (4096) Code to "7500": (1). Verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem randomly transmits 
Emergency/Priority Status (TYPE=28, Subtype=1) messages at intervals that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds, and that it continues at that rate for at least 30 seconds. 
(**1.64**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.3.1.4.3.1, Step 3, 
subsection "b.(3)," the binary value for the Mode A Code input as "0330" is incorrect and 
should be replaced with the following:   
 
(3). Verify that the broadcast messages contain a Mode A Code Subfield ("ME" bits 12 - 
24, Message bits 44 - 56) that is set to "1010100101010 1010000101000" binary. (**1.65**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.3.1.4.3.1, Step 4, 
subsection "a.(1)," at the end of the test procedure paragraph, there needs to be an additional test to ensure that the broadcast continues at the specified rate for at least 30 seconds.  Please make the following corrections:   
 

## Step 4: Emergency/Priority Message Rate With Mode A Code On And Emergency

(Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3.1.2.a .(1)) a. Via the appropriate data input interface, provide the ADS-B Transmitting 
Subsystem with Mode A (4096) Code of "7500". After setting the Mode A (4096) Code to "7500": 
(1). Verify that the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem randomly transmits 
Emergency/Priority Status (TYPE=28, Subtype=1) messages at intervals 
that are uniformly distributed over the range of 0.7 to 0.9 seconds, and 
that it continues at that rate for at least 30 seconds. (**1.66**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.3.3.1.4.3.1, Step 5, 
subsection "b.(2)" in order to correct a cut-and-paste error, revise the setting of the 
Emergency/Priority Status Subfield to ZERO (0), as follows:  
 
(2). Verify that the broadcast messages contain an Emergency/Priority Status Subfield 
("ME" bits 9 - 11, Message bits 41 - 43) that is set to "101" binary ("5" decimal) 
"000" binary ("0" decimal). (**1.67**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.4.3.1.2, in order to correct a

 (**1.69**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.5.2.2, in the text of Step 3 of 
the test procedure it has been discovered that there are several places in DO-260B/ED-102A 
that reference the "Ground Track" or "Heading" field in the Surface Position Message without referencing both data items.  In this specific test procedure Step, in order to correctly reference the data items, make the following edits:   
 
Step 3: Surface Position Message - "Heading/Ground Track" Subfield (Â§2.2.3.2.4.3,

shall be reflected in the appropriate Heading/Ground Track subfields of the next scheduled Surface Position Message transmission provided that the change occurs at least 100 milliseconds prior to the next scheduled Surface Position Message transmission. 

 
 
Configure the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to transmit Surface Position Messages by providing position information at the nominal update rate.  Provide the data externally at the interface to the ADS-B system.  Set the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem to Surface status.  Continue transmitting Surface Position Messages at the nominal rate with all parameters unchanged.  Verify that the Heading/Ground Track subfields in the Surface Position Message correctly matches the Heading/Ground Track subfield values from the Table 2-17 and Table 2-18 (Â§2.2.3.2.4.3 and Â§2.2.3.2.4.4). 

 
 
Change input to the ADS-B System so as to affect the Heading/Ground Track subfield values so that the change occurs at least 100 milliseconds prior to the next scheduled Surface Position Message transmission.  Verify that the Heading/Ground Track subfield values have changed in the next transmitted Surface Position Message and that they contain the correct values.

 (**1.80**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.8.2.17, in the text of Step 6, 
first paragraph of the test procedure it has been discovered that there are several places in DO-260B/ED-102A that reference the "Ground Track" or "Heading" field in the Surface 
Position Message without referencing both data items.  In this specific test procedure Step, in order to correctly reference the data items, make the following edit:    
 
Provide valid Version One (1) ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Messages (Subtype=1) 
with "Track Angle/Heading Bit" set to ZERO (0) and Surface Position Messages with 
"Heading/Ground Track Status Bit" set to ONE (1) to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem.  
Verify that bits 0 and 1 of byte 32 of the True/Magnetic Heading field in the output Mode Status Report are set to ONE (binary 01). 

 (**1.81**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.8.2.17, in the text of Step 9, 
first paragraph of the test procedure it has been discovered that there are several places in DO-260B/ED-102A that reference the "Ground Track" or "Heading" field in the Surface 
Position Message without referencing both data items.  In this specific test procedure Step, 
in order to correctly reference the data items, make the following edit: 
 
Provide valid Version Two (2) ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Messages (Subtype=1) with "Track Angle/Heading Bit" set to ZERO (0) and Surface Position Messages with "Heading/Ground Track Status Bit" set to ZERO (0) to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem.  
Verify that bits 0 and 1 of byte 32 of the True/Magnetic Heading field in the output Mode Status Report are set to ZERO (binary 00). 

 
(**1.82**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.8.2.17, in the text of Step 10, 
first paragraph of the test procedure it has been discovered that there are several places in DO-260B/ED-102A that reference the "Ground Track" or "Heading" field in the Surface 
Position Message without referencing both data items.  In this specific test procedure Step, in order to correctly reference the data items, make the following edit: 
 
Provide valid Version Two (2) ADS-B Aircraft Operational Status Messages (Subtype=1) with "Track Angle/Heading Bit" set to ZERO (0) and Surface Position Messages with "Heading/Ground Track Status Bit" set to ONE (1) to the ADS-B Receiving Subsystem. Verify that bits 0 and 1 of byte 32 of the True/Magnetic Heading field in the output Mode Status Report are set to ONE (binary 01).   

 (**1.83**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§2.4.11.2.1, in order to clarify that 
requirements are not established in the test procedures, and to also correct actual typographical errors in Table 2-218, please make the following corrections in the first sentence of the second paragraph, and in Table 2-218: 
 
In order to not induce unnecessary intermittent Fail/Warn declarations, the squitter monitor shall implement appropriate "debounce" and recovery techniques provided for in Table 2- 218.  In the squitter monitor, it is necessary to implement appropriate "debounce" and recovery techniques, such as those provided for in Table 2-218, in order to not induce unnecessary intermittent Fail/Warn declarations.  In these regards, "debounce" refers to the number of successive maximum transmit intervals that a particular squitter message can be missed (e.g., not transmitted) plus an additional time of 100 milliseconds to process and activate the Fail/Warn mechanism.  Likewise, "recovery" refers to the number of successive maximum transmit intervals within which a particular squitter message must be transmitted plus 100 milliseconds to process and de-activate the Fail/Warn mechanism.

 (**1.84**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§A.1.4.1, inside Table A-2, the 
value for RC less than 0.5 NM is expressed incorrectly.  Make the following change:   
 
The phrase "RC < 0.5 NM (925 m)" **should be** "RC < 0.5 NM (926 m)"   

 (**1.85**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.4.1.1.1, in 
order to account for the fact that some regulators have already made clarifying statements on HPL limiting, please add the following as *Note* #2, just after the existing *Note* under the 
section heading:   
 
Notes: 
1. If the position information comes from a GNSS receiver that conforms to the ARINC 
743A characteristic, a suitable source of information for the radius of containment (RC), 
is ARINC 429 label 130 from that GNSS receiver.   
2. Although these requirements do not require HPL limiting, it is expected that some 
regulators will only accept installations that limit HPL.  This may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS. (**1.86**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.4.1.2.1, in 
order to account for the fact that some regulators have already made clarifying statements on HPL limiting, please add the following as *Note* #2, just after the existing *Note*:   
 
Notes:

2. Although these requirements do not require HPL limiting, it is expected that some

(**1.87**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.4.3.2.1, in 
order to account for the fact that some regulators have already made restrictions on the usage of the Ground Speed when it is below 7 knots, please add the following additional 
clarification inside the parenthetical at the end of the *Note*:   
 
Note: If a source of A/V Heading is not available to the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem, but a source of Ground Track angle is available, then Ground Track angle may be used instead of Heading, provided that the "Status Bit for Heading/Ground Track" 
subfield is set to ZERO whenever the Ground Track angle is not a reliable indication of the A/V's heading.  (The Ground Track angle is not a reliable indication of the A/V's heading when the A/V's ground speed is close to ZERO.  Some regulators have already established such limits.  These limits may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.)   

 (**1.88**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.4.5.4, in the 
third paragraph, make the following deletion of the reference to "vertical velocity" to account for the change that was made during the creation of DO-260B/ED-102A when 
references to vertical velocity were removed from NACV, NIC and SIL definitions and the 
Geometric Vertical Accuracy (GVA) parameter was created.   
 
If the external data source provides 95% accuracy figures of merit for horizontal and vertical velocity, then the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem will determine the value of the NACV 
field in the Airborne Velocity Messages, Subtypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 according to Table A-5. 

 (**1.89**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.4.5.6, in order 
to account for the fact that some regulators have already made clarifying statements on the usage of MSL, please replace the existing *Note* with the following:   
 
Note: Although the above requirements allows this subfield to be based on MSL in certain 
cases, it is expected that some regulators will only accept installations that report based on WGS-84 HAE.  HAE will be required for some State mandates and the manufacturer must ensure that when converting from HAG (e.g., MSL) to HAE, the same model used by the position source is used.  This may be standardized accordingly in future versions of these MOPS.  The difference between Baro Altitude and GNSS height above ellipsoid (HAE) is preferred.  However, GNSS altitude (MSL) may be used when Airborne Position is being reported using Format TYPE Codes 11 through 18.   

 (**1.90**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.4.7, first 
paragraph:  
 
Replace "Registers 6116 to 6F16" **with** "Register 6116" 

 (**1.91**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.4.7.3.1, second 
paragraph: 
 
Change "Â§A.1.4.8.1.1" to "Â§A.1.4.7.3.1.1" 
Change "Â§A.1.4.8.1.2" to "Â§A.1.4.7.3.1.2" 

 (**1.92**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.4.7.3.1.1, first 
paragraph: 
 
Change "Â§A.1.4.8.1" to "Â§A.1.4.7.3.1" 

 
 
(**1.93**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.4.7.3.1.2, first 
paragraph: 
 
Change "Â§A.1.4.8.1" to "Â§A.1.4.7.3.1" 

 (**1.94**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.4.9.8, in order 
to clarify the dependency of the Selected Heading on a reference direction flag, please add the following *Note* just after sub-bullet "c" and prior to Table A-12:   
 
Note: The Selected Heading parameter does not have a source bit in this version of these MOPS to indicate its reference orientation (True North or Magnetic North). Implementers of the Target State and Status Message are encouraged whenever possible to use input parameters to populate this field that utilize Magnetic North orientation, as that is the de facto standard utilized by most users of this data. However since many aircraft have flight decks that can operate in either True North or Magnetic North orientation, this field should be encoded with the current active value in the flight deck, regardless of orientation.  Users of the Selected Heading data should be aware that there is no method defined in this version of these MOPS to indicate its reference orientation.    

 (**1.95**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.4.10.8, in order 
to clarify the usage of the Geometric Vertical Accuracy (GVA) metric with respect to the Baro-Geo Difference data field in the Airborne Velocity Message, and to clarify the usage of the GVA metric encoding values for previous and potential future ADS-B Versions, replace the entire section, including Table A-29 with the following: 
 
This 2-bit ("ME" bits 49 - 50, Message bits 81 - 82) subfield in the Airborne Operational Status Message (Subtype=0) will be encoded as shown in Table A-29, and set by using the Vertical Figure of Merit (VFOM) (95%) from the GNSS position source used to encode the geometric altitude in the Airborne Position Message report the geometric altitude.    

 
Note: The geometric altitude may be reported directly in the altitude field in the Airborne 
Position Message (Â§A.1.4.2.4) or indirectly using the Difference From Barometric Altitude subfield (Â§A.1.4.5.6) in the Airborne Velocity Message (Â§A.1.4.5) when barometric altitude is reported in the altitude field in the Airborne Position Message (Â§A.1.4.2.4).

Note: For the purposes of these MOPS (RTCA DO-260B/EUROCAE ED-102A) values for 
0, 1 and 2 are encoded.  It is expected that ADS-B transmitting subsystems with ADS-B Version Numbers greater than 2 will define the GVA encoding of "3" as a value less than 45 meters at some point in the future.  Therefore, ADS-B Version 2 receiving subsystems should treat the GVA encoding of "3" as less than 45 meters for data received from ADS-B Version Numbers 2 or greater. (**1.96**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in section Â§A.1.4.10.13, in order to clarify 
what the Horizontal Reference Direction (HRD) flag applies to, please add the following new *Note* just after the paragraph and prior to Table A-31:    
 
Note: The HRD flag only applies to the Heading/Ground Track subfield in the Surface 
Position Message or the Heading subfield in the Airborne Velocity Message (Subtypes 3 & 4). (**1.97**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.5.1, in order to 
clarify the requirements for the initiation of broadcasting Extended Squitter Messages, make the following addition in the middle of the paragraph:   
 
At power up initialization, the transponder will commence operation in a mode in which it broadcasts only acquisition squitters.  The transponder will initiate the broadcast of Extended Squitters for Airborne Position, Surface Position, Aircraft Identification and Category, Airborne Velocity, Target State and Status and Operational Status when data are inserted into Registers 0516, 0616, 0816, 0916, 6216 and 6516 respectively.  This determination will be made individually for each squitter type, as specified in Â§2.2.3.3.  The insertion of just altitude or surveillance status data into Register 0516 by the transponder will not satisfy the minimum requirement for broadcast of the airborne position squitter.    

(**1.98**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.5.2, in the *Note* 
under bullet "a:"  
 
Replace the reference "Â§2.2.3.2.3.1.3.1" **with** "Â§2.2.3.2.3.1.3.2" (**1.99**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.5.2, in *Note #1* 
under bullet "b:" 
 
Replace the reference "Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.3.1" **with** "Â§2.2.3.2.4.1.3.2" (**1.100**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.5.2.d, in 
order to be consistent with changes made in RTCA DO-181E, EUROCAE ED-73E and 
ICAO Doc 9871, Edition 2, regarding clarifications for the zeroing and termination of 
Registers 0816 and 2016, replace the *Note* after subparagraph "d" with the following:   
 
Note: The Aircraft Identification and Category Message is not cleared since it contains data that rarely changes in flight and is not frequently updated.  With Extended Squitter installed, the Aircraft Identification and Category Message is not cleared or ZEROed once either Flight Identification or Aircraft Registration data has been loaded into Register 0816 during the current ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem power-on cycle.  The Aircraft Identification and Category Message is not cleared since it provides information that is fundamental to track file management in the ADS-B environment (see Â§2.2.5.1.11.c).  Implementation of Register 0816 should also consider the following:    

 
a.  If valid Flight Identification data is available, then the data should be used to 
populate the character subfields in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message.   
 
b.    After using Flight Identification data to populate the character subfields in the 
Aircraft Identification and Category Message in a given power-on cycle, if Flight Identification data becomes invalid or not available, then the last known valid Flight Identification data should be retained and used to continue population of the character subfields in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message for the duration of the power-on cycle.   
 
c.    If valid Flight Identification data is not available, but valid Aircraft 
Registration data is available in a given power-on cycle, then the valid Aircraft Registration data should be used to populate the character subfields in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message for the duration of the power-on cycle.   
 
d.  If the Aircraft Identification and Category Message has been populated using 
Aircraft Registration data in a given power-on cycle, and valid Flight Identification data becomes available, then the Flight Identification data should be used to populate the character subfields in the Aircraft Identification and Category Message for the remainder of the power-on cycle.   
 
e.  Once valid Flight Identification data has been used to populate the Aircraft 
Identification and Category Message in a given power-on cycle, Aircraft Registration data should not be used to populate the character subfields of the Aircraft Identification and Category Message, even if Flight Identification data becomes invalid or not available during the power-on cycle. (**1.101**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.6.4.2, last 
paragraph before Â§A.1.6.4.3, fourth line: 
 
Replace the reference "Â§A.1.4.6.3" **with** "Â§A.1.6.4.3" (**1.102**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.8, in Figure 
A-2, in the text of the descriptions of Bits 13 and 16 it has been discovered that there are 
several places in DO-260B/ED-102A that reference the "Ground Track" or "Heading" 
field in the Surface Position Message without referencing both data items.  In this specific Figure on these specific Bit definition lines, in order to correctly reference the data items, make the following edits:   
 
13 
STATUS for Heading/Ground Track (1 = valid, 0 = not valid) 
14 
MSB 
15 
 
16 
HEADING/GROUND TRACK (7 bits) (**1.103**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.8, in Figure 
A-8a in order to conform to changes that have been made in the Transponder MOPS (RTCA DO-181E and EUROCAE ED-73E) and in Edition 2 of ICAO Doc 9871, in the 
Notes inside the Register format for the Aircraft Status Message for Subtype 1, the Emergency/Priority Status and Mode A Code, make the following changes: 
 
(a)  **Revise** *Note 1* as follows: 
1)  Message delivery is accomplished once per 0.8 seconds using the Event-Driven 
Protocol as specified in Â§2.2.3.3.1.4.3. 
 
(b)  Add *Note 7* as follows: 
7)  The Mode A Code shall be coded as defined in ICAO Annex 10 Volume IV, 
Â§3.1.2.6.7.1. 

## 

 (**1.104**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.1.8, in Figure 
A-10, correct a bad paragraph reference for the SIL Supplement in bit position #55 by making the following change: 
 

55 
SIL Supplement (Â§A.1.4.10.14 15) 

 (**1.105**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix A, section Â§A.3.4.6, in the 
Note: 
 
Replace the reference "Â§A.1.4.8" **with** "Â§A.1.4.9" 

 
(**1.106**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix J, section Â§J.3.1.2, add the 
following *Note* just after the section Title:   
 
Note: Since this Appendix was developed, the vertical rate accuracy requirement has been decoupled from the NACV  parameter.  The test for vertical rate is not necessary to establish the NACV =1 but remains here in the event that manufacturers want to additionally establish the vertical rate performance of their system at the 50ft/sec 95% level.   

 (**1.107**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix J, section Â§J.4 at the end of 
the last sentence of the second paragraph, change the incorrect Table Q-3 reference to 
Table J-3. 
 
Change the reference "Table Q-3" to "Table J-3" 

 (**1.108**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix N, section Â§N.2.2.2, inside 
Table N-4, the value for RC at 0.5 NM is expressed incorrectly.  Make the following 
change:   
 
The phrase "26 m (0.5 NM) < HPL" **should be** "926 m (0.5 NM) < HPL"   

 (**1.109**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix T, section Â§T.4, in the first 
sentence of the paragraph just after Equation #5, we propose the following changes to the sentence in order to clarify the intention of the sentence: 
 
The modulus function returns the number of degrees between lat and the southern edge of the zone containing lat and lat.  â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦ 

 
(**1.110**) In RTCA DO-260B and EUROCAE ED-102A, in Appendix T, section Â§T.5.1.2 the 
description of Equation #22 contains a cut-and-paste error, and should refer to "odd" zones instead of "even" zones.   
 
$ZO_{X21}=\left(\text{NL}\right)\left(\frac{XZ_{1}}{2^{\text{\tiny{3b}}}}\right)$ for every odd zones_
