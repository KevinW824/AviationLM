## Executive Summary

 
This document has been structured with guidelines according to the RTCA MOPS Drafting Guide dated September 21, 2001. The material in this document highlights the minimum procedures for the physical link and network layer of the VDL Mode 2 subnetwork. The test procedures used in this document have been coordinated with EUROCAE Working Group 92 during the preparation of EUROCAE Document ED92B. This document includes four appendices.  Appendix B should be considered a normative appendix. 

 

## 1. Purpose And Scope 1.1 Introduction

This document contains the Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) and test procedures for aircraft Very High Frequency (VHF) Digital Link (VDL) Mode 2 physical, link and network layer protocol components which comprise an avionics transmitter/receiver (transceiver) function intended to be used for air-ground (A/G) data communications.  This document is designed so that equipment certified to it will be compatible with the relevant Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) in RTCA DO-224C and with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Doc 9776, *Manual on VHF Digital Link (VDL) Mode 2*, which is also known as the VDL Mode 2 Technical Manual.  Additional information on VDL Mode 2 is contained in ARINC Specification 631 and ARINC Characteristics 750 and 758. Compliance with this MOPS is one means of assuring that the VDL Mode 2 equipment will function satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in air traffic services communications and that data formats will be compatible with the Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN).  These standards specify characteristics useful to designers, manufacturers, installers, and users of the VDL Mode 2 A/G communications system equipment.  This document is organized with the following order and format: 

 
Section 1 describes the purpose and scope. 
 
Section 2 describes the minimum operational performance standards for: - general design requirements - standard conditions - environmental conditions - equipment test procedures 
 
Section 3 describes the installed equipment tests. 
 
Section 4 describes the operational tests. 
Appendix A contains a list of acronyms used in this document. Appendix B provides a correlation matrix between the test procedures of Section 2.4 and the VDL Mode 2 system level requirements given in RTCA DO-224C, and the equipment architecture classes defined in Section 1.3.  This appendix is normative in the sense that it specifically identifies which requirements make up the minimum set for the standard classes of equipment. Appendix C provides the analysis that establishes the equivalency between the Frame Error Rate and the bit error rate.  This appendix provides the basis for the use of either bit error rate or frame error rate in the verification procedures of Section 2.4. Appendix D defines the minimum functionality of the Data/Management Interface for Class Y and Class Z architectures.  This functionality is described at a high level.  No protocol details (i.e., bit definition, data rate, physical layer details, etc.) for the Data/Management Interface are given in this document.  Such a standardized interface is the AVLC Simple Interface Protocol (ASIP) described in Attachment 10 to ARINC Characteristic 750.   

## 1.2 System Overview

The VDL Mode 2 system provides interconnectivity for data communications between aircraft and ground-based users.  The VDL Mode 2 A/G communications system architecture is defined to provide coverage similar to today's analog-based data communication system.  VDL Mode 2 is a digital packet data system using phase-shift modulation.  VDL Mode 2 provides a significant increase in capacity over the existing Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) currently in use by many aircraft. VDL Mode 2 is designed to be a subnetwork of the ATN and is organized according to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model of the International Standards Organization (ISO).  Point-to-point data communications between the aircraft router and the ground ATN router are provided through the VDL Mode 2 system via the ISO 8208 network interface.  In addition to ISO 8208 communications, point-to-multi-point data communication is also provided as one-way data broadcast from the ground station to the aircraft stations. The VDL Mode 2 system is related to the three lower layers of the OSI model (illustrated in Figure 1-1) providing services described as follows: 

 
Layer 1 (Physical layer): provides transceiver frequency control, bit exchanges over the radio media, and notification functions. These functions are more often known as "radio" and "modulation" functions. 
RTCA DO-224C defines the VDL Mode 2 modulation as being a differentially encoded eight phase shift keying (D8PSK) modulation scheme providing a 31.5 kb/s bit rate (at layer 1). 

 
Layer 2 (Link Layer) is split into two sublayers and a management entity: 
The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer provides access to the Physical layer by a Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) algorithm. The Data Link Services (DLS) sublayer is composed of the Aviation VHF Link Control (AVLC) protocol derived from the High Level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol (ISO 3309).  The main functions of the AVLC protocol are frame exchanges, frame processing and error detection. The Link Management Entity (LME) manages link establishment between DLS peers. 

 
Layer 3: DO-224C defines only the Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAcP) sublayer, the lowest network sublayer of OSI layer 3. It is compliant with the Subnetwork sublayer requirements defined in the ATN SARPs and conforms to ISO 8208.  ISO 8208 is the network layer of the international X.25 standard published by International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T).  It provides packet exchanges over a virtual circuit, error recovery, connection flow control, packet fragmentation and reassembly, and subnetwork connection management functions. 
This document focuses on the use of VDL Mode 2 as an ATN-compliant subnetwork using ISO 8208 as the SNAcP.  The specifics of the ISO 8208 protocol used for VDL Mode 2 are defined in DO-224C and the ICAO VDL Mode 2 Technical Manual.  Some implementations may provide non-ATN communications using some or all of the ATN protocol stack illustrated in Figure 1-1.  For example, the MAC sublayer can support either the ISO 8208 SNAcP defined in DO-224C or the commonly-used non-8208 protocol known as ACARS over AVLC (AOA).  The specific SNAcP sublayer within this document does not exist in an AOA implementation.  This document does not include standards used for AOA. 

## 1.3 Possible Configuration Of Aircraft Equipment

This section describes two possible architectures that can provide VDL Mode 2 functionality to user aircraft.  Although not the only possible architectures, they are representative of the most common configurations expected in the marketplace.   

## 1.3.1 Separated Equipment

This section describes the case of the VDL functionalities disseminated in separated equipment as shown in Figure 1-2.  In this example, the VDL functionalities are distributed into the VHF Data Radio (VDR) and the Communication Management Unit (CMU). Requirements for equipment complying with either the VDR or CMU portions of the VDL Mode 2 functionality are specified within this document as being Class Y (VDR) and Class Z (CMU, ISO 8208), respectively.  Alternative non-ISO 8208 implementations are identified as Class Y (VDR) and Class W (CMU, non-ISO 8208), respectively.  Detailed requirements for non-ISO 8208 SNAcP sublayers are not included in this document.  Throughout this document, Class Y and Class Z equipment are assumed to have the following configurations:  

 
Class Y equipment (VDR) includes the Physical layer, the MAC sublayer, and a function providing the data and management information transfer between the VDR and the CMU, including a small subset of the DLS functionality; 
 
Class Z equipment (CMU, ISO 8208) includes the SNAcP sublayer, the majority of the DLS sublayer, the LME entity and a function providing the data and management information transfer between the VDR and the CMU. 
Other equipment required for operation of a Class Y/Class Z configuration includes a VHF antenna, as illustrated in Figure 1-2.  A Class Y/Class Z architecture assumes that VDR control is performed through the CMU management functions. 

## 1.3.2 Integrated Equipment

In the case of integrated equipment (shown in Figure 1-3), all VDL functions are integrated into a common physical unit of equipment dedicated to VDL services. Throughout this document this integrated architecture is referred to as either Class X (ISO 8208) or Class V (non-ISO 8208) equipment. Other equipment required for operation of a Class X configuration includes a VHF antenna, as illustrated in Figure 1-3.  A Class X architecture assumes that VDR control is performed through a dedicated VDL Mode 2 control head and management function, but does not dictate how these functions are implemented. 

## Figure 1-3: Integrated Class X Vdl Mode 2 Architecture 1.4 Operational Applications

While operational applications will evolve with time, this document defines minimum standards to support implementation of anticipated applications.  The specific applications to be served can be classified under the following general categories: 

 
Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications; 
 
Flight Information Services (FIS) communications; 
 
Aeronautical Operational Communications (AOC). 

## 1.5 Operational Goals

The operational goal of the VDL Mode 2 system is to provide enhanced data capabilities, including greater throughput and more efficient use of the available spectrum resources.   

## 1.6 Equipment Performance Verification

To test the equipment for compliance with the performance requirements, four types of tests are specified.  These include: 

 
Bench Tests 
 
Environmental Tests 
 
Installed Equipment Tests 
 
Operational Tests 
The performance requirements for each type of test and the corresponding test procedures are specified in this document.  The order of tests suggests that the avionics transceiver be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design into design validation, equipment qualification, and operation.  The objectives of these tests are described in the following subsections. 

## 1.6.1 Bench Tests

The equipment will be subjected to bench tests to verify compliance with the performance requirements under controlled environment.  The test results may be used as the basis for approval of equipment design, equipment qualification, and acceptance.  The bench test procedures are specified in Section 2.4.  Wherever possible, common procedures are used for Class X and Class Z or Class X and Class Y equipment.  Where necessary, specific modifications of the tests are called out for each class of equipment. A cross-reference of tests to equipment classes is included in Appendix B. 

## 1.6.2 Environmental Tests

Upon successful completion of bench tests the equipment will be subject to environmental tests to verify compliance to the performance requirements under extreme environmental conditions expected in actual operations and abnormal conditions.  The test results may be applied to equipment qualification and acceptance.  The environmental tests are specified in Section 2.3. 

## 1.6.3 Installed Equipment Tests

After successful completion of the environmental tests, the equipment will be installed in the aircraft for further testing to verify compliance with the performance specifications of Section 3 in the aircraft environment.  The installed equipment tests will be conducted primarily with the aircraft on the ground using simulated or operational system inputs and may be supplemented with flight tests.  The test results may be used to isolate design faults that are traceable to the general aircraft environment, e.g., radio frequency interference (RFI) and the aircraft power supply system.  As in the case of bench and environmental tests, installed equipment tests are critical to equipment qualification and acceptance.  The installed equipment tests are specified in Section 3. 

## 1.6.4 Operational Tests

After successful completion of the installed equipment tests, the equipment will be subject to operational tests conducted by operating personnel to ensure that the equipment, as a part of the overall A/G communications system, operates satisfactorily end-to-end in real operational environments.  The operational tests are specified in Section 4. 

## 1.7 Definitions Of Terms 1.7.1 Adjacent Channel

In VDL Mode 2, an adjacent channel is a channel that has a bandwidth of 25 kHz and whose frequency assignment is adjacent to that of a desired reference channel.  A first adjacent channel is a channel whose center frequency is 25 kHz above or below that of the desired VDL Mode 2 channel.  The nth adjacent channel is a channel whose center frequency is 25n kHz above or below that of the desired VDL Mode 2 channel.   

## 1.7.2 Adjacent Channel Power

Adjacent channel power is the amount of radio frequency (RF) signal power that falls within a given adjacent channel.  Contributors to adjacent channel power include discrete spurious signals, signal sidebands, and noise density (including phase noise) at the transmitter output. 

## 1.7.3 Adjacent Channel Rejection (Acr)

ACR corresponds to the receiver's ability to demodulate the desired signal and meet the BER requirement in the presence of an adjacent channel interfering signal which has a power level higher than the desired signal power level. The ACR ratio, expressed in decibels (dB), is the maximum power difference between the adjacent channel interfering signal and the desired signal that allows the specified BER performance to be met. 

## 1.7.4 Bit Error Rate (Ber)

BER is expressed as the ratio of the number of erroneous bits received to the total number of bits received.  The uncorrected BER represents the BER without the benefit of Forward Error Correction (FEC).   

## 1.7.5 Co-Channel Interference (Cci)

CCI protection is the overall capability of a receiver to demodulate the desired signal and achieve the specified BER performance in the presence of an unwanted signal at the same assigned frequency. 

The CCI ratio is the power ratio between the desired signal and the unwanted signal and is expressed in decibels.  

## 1.7.6 Error Vector Magnitude (Evm)

Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is defined as the root mean square (rms) error in the in phase-quadrature phase (I-Q) vector magnitude measured at the ideal sampling points, expressed as a percentage.  Mathematically, this can be written as  

$E\!M=100\cdot\sqrt{\left(\Delta I^{2}+\Delta Q^{2}\right)/\left(I^{2}+Q^{2}\right)}$.

At the ideal sampling points, the I-Q values are on the unit circle so that 
1
2
2

Q
I
, and  

$$E V M=100\cdot{\sqrt{E y p e c t a t i o\,n\!\left(\Delta I^{2}+\Delta Q^{2}\right)}}.$$
Methods that use more than one sample per symbol to determine EVM are acceptable, provided the measurements can be related to the definition above. 

## 1.7.7 Reference Signal Level

The reference signal level is the desired signal level used in the receiver performance specifications unless otherwise stated. 

## 1.7.8 Undesired Vdl Mode 2 Test Signal

An undesired signal is a simulated VDL Mode 2 signal generated on a valid VDL Mode 2 frequency channel by means of a continuous wave signal frequency modulated by a 400 Hz tone at a peak frequency deviation of 5.25 kHz.   
Note: This test signal represents an idealized VDL Mode 2 signal, with adjacent channel spectral characteristics that are significantly better than those permitted for a VDL Mode 2 transmitter that marginally meets the requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.7 of this MOPS. 

## 1.7.9 Reference Bit Sequence

The maximum "transmit" period is determined by the maximum "burst" length permitted for VDL Mode 2 operation.  The maximum burst length is 4.16 seconds at the nominal symbol rate of 10,500 symbols/s. The minimum "off" period is determined by the transmitter "power down" time plus the 
"channel idle" detection time. According to ICAO SARPS, the minimum "off" period is 
3.1 ms.  
The maximum duty cycle is therefore 4.16 seconds in "transmit" mode followed by 3.1 
ms "off". The reference bit sequence will not exceed 15 cycles.

## 1.9 Assumptions

This MOPS assumes an antenna that meets the requirements of DO-186B and DO-224C

## 2. Minimum Performance Standards 2.1 General Design Requirements 2.1.1 Airworthiness

The equipment shall not, under either normal or faulty conditions, impair the airworthiness of the aircraft in which it is installed. 

## 2.1.2 Intended Function

The equipment shall perform its intended function, as defined by the manufacturer, and its proper use shall not create a hazard to users of the airspace. 

## 2.1.3 Itu And Fcc Rules And Regulations

The equipment should comply with the relevant International Telecommunications Union (ITU-R) Radio Regulations and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Rules and Regulations and applicable electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards or such other requirements as are applicable. 

## 2.1.4 Fire Protection

All materials used shall be self-extinguishing except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire.  Furthermore, plenum cable shall be used, where appropriate, to prevent toxic fumes in case of a fire.  
Note:  One means of showing compliance is contained in Federal Aviation Regulations 
(FAR), Part 25, Appendix F.   

## 2.1.5 Operation Of Controls

The operation of controls intended for use during flight, in all possible positions, combinations and sequences, shall not result in a condition whose presence or continuation would be detrimental to the continued performance of the equipment. Controls shall be designed to maximize operational suitability and minimize pilot workload.  Reliance on pilot memory for operational procedures shall be minimized. 

## 2.1.6 Accessibility Of Controls

Controls, which are not intended for adjustment by the flight crew, shall not be readily accessible.  Controls that are normally adjusted in flight shall be readily accessible and properly labeled as to their intended function.  The controls shall be operable with the use of only one hand. 

## 2.1.7 Effects Of Test

Unless otherwise provided, the design of the equipment shall be such that, subsequent to the application of the specified tests, no condition exists which would be detrimental to the continued performance of the equipment.   

## 2.1.8 Equipment Classes 2.1.8.1 Receivers

One class of receiver is defined as follows: 
Class F: Receivers which are to be used in a 25 kHz channel separation environment and intended for VDL Mode 2 operations. 

## 2.1.8.2 Transmitters

Two classes of VDL Mode 2 transmitters, which are to be used in a 25 kHz channel separation environment, are defined as follows: Class 7: Transmitters designed to operate with a range of 200 nautical miles, which are to be used in a 25 kHz channel separation environment and are intended for VDL Mode 2 operations. Class 8: Transmitters designed to operate with a range of 100 nautical miles, which are to be used in a 25 kHz channel separation environment and are intended for VDL Mode 2 operations. 

## 2.1.9 Vdl Mode 2 Avionics Architecture Classes

This MOPS identifies five architecture classes, corresponding to various options of Figure 1-2 and Figure 1-3.  These architecture classes are compliant with DO-224C. 

Note:  The choice of architecture class is independent of the choice of transmitter 
and/or receiver class.  Thus, for example, a Class Y VDL Mode 2 transceiver may have a Class F receiver and Class 8 transmitter. A combination nomenclature such as Class YF8 may be used. 

## 2.1.9.1 Iso 8208-Compliant Equipment Classes

Note: The following equipment architectures utilize the ATN-compliant and SARPs 
VDL Mode 2 compliant ISO 8208 interface.   ISO 8208 compliance is required to assure proper communications with peer entities on the ground.  This document recognizes that many implementations will choose to hide the ISO 8208 
functionality within the complete protocol stack.  Nevertheless, requirements and 
tests are identified at the ISO 8208 level as the minimum SARPs and MASPS requirement.  

## 2.1.9.1.1 Class X

Class X VDL Mode 2 equipment shall include the entire VDL Mode 2 protocol stack illustrated in Figure 1-3. 

## 2.1.9.1.2 Class Y

Class Y VDL Mode 2 equipment shall include a partial VDL Mode 2 protocol stack including at least the physical layer and the MAC sublayer.  When Class Y equipment is operated in conjunction with Class Z equipment, combination will include the entire VDL Mode 2 protocol stack. Class Y equipment shall contain portions of the DLS sublayer that are closely associated with the physical layer, e.g., bit-stuffing and CRC computation.  Class Y equipment shall include a Data/Management Interface at the highest level of VDL Mode 2 capabilities that it provides.  An example of an architecture using Class Y equipment is shown in Figure 1-2. 

Note:  A widely accepted means for complying with the Data/Management interface 
requirements for Class Y equipment is ASIP, defined in Attachment 10 to ARINC 
Characteristic 750.  This interface protocol assumes that the low level Data Link Services mentioned in the requirement are implemented in the Class Y equipment, as permitted by the requirement. 

## 2.1.9.1.3 Class Z

Class Z VDL Mode 2 equipment shall include a partial VDL Mode 2 protocol stack beginning above the MAC sublayer and extending through the subnetwork access protocol sublayer.  When Class Z equipment is operated in conjunction with Class Y equipment, combination will include the entire VDL Mode 2 protocol stack. Class Z equipment shall include a Data/Management interface at the lowest level of VDL Mode 2 capabilities that it provides. An example of an architecture using Class Z equipment is shown in Figure 1-2. 

Note:  A widely accepted means for complying with the Data/Management interface 
requirements for Class Z equipment is ASIP, defined in Attachment 10 to ARINC Characteristic 750.  This interface protocol assumes that some low level Data Link Services mentioned in the requirement, including flag generation and bitstuffing, are implemented in the Class Y equipment, as permitted by the requirement. 

## 2.1.9.2 Non-Iso 8208 Equipment Classes 2.1.9.2.1 Class V

Class V VDL Mode 2 equipment shall include the entire non-ISO-8208 protocol stack beginning with the VDL Mode 2 physical layer defined in Section 2.2.1, the Link Layer defined in Section 2.2.2, and the non-ISO 8208 subnetwork access protocol mentioned in Section 2.2.5.  

## 2.1.9.2.2 Class W

Class W VDL Mode 2 equipment shall include the LME and DLS functions of VDL Mode 2, without including the ISO 8208 SNAcP sublayer.  Class W equipment shall meet the VDL Mode 2 Link Layer requirements as specified in Section 2.2.2.  Class W equipment shall include a Data/Management interface that permits access to the lowest level capabilities that it provides.  

 Notes: 1. A widely accepted means for complying with the Data/Management interface 
requirements for Class W equipment is ASIP defined in Attachment 10 to ARINC Characteristic 750. 
2. Class W equipment should be designed to interface with external Class Y 
equipment. 

## 2.1.10 Software Management

If the equipment design is implemented using digital computer techniques, the computer software package shall follow guidelines contained in RTCA document DO-178B 
"Software Considerations in Aircraft Systems and Equipment Certification."  The equivalent or later editions of DO-178B may be used with the agreement of the authority.   

## 2.2 Minimum Performance Requirements - Standard Conditions 2.2.1 Vdl Mode 2 Physical Layer Requirements

All Class X, Class Y, and Class V VDL Mode 2 transceiver equipment shall meet the VDL Mode 2 physical layer requirements contained in the following subparagraphs.   

## 2.2.1.1 Transceiver Requirements

Unless otherwise stated, all transceiver requirements shall be applicable under room temperature (25o C) condition and with the transceiver tuned to any 25 kHz channel from 
118.000 megahertz (MHz) to 136.975 MHz. 

## 2.2.1.1.1 Tuning Range And Channel Increments

The transceiver shall be tunable to any 25 kilohertz (kHz) channel, from 118.000 MHz to 136.975 MHz (760 channels) as defined in RTCA DO-224C. 

Note:  Manufacturers should note that in the future, part or all of the frequency band 
108.000 to 117.975 MHz may become available for air-ground communications. 

## 2.2.1.1.2 Modulation

The VDL Mode 2 transceiver shall use D8PSK modulation as defined in RTCA DO- 224C. 

## 2.2.1.1.3 Tuning Time

The transceiver shall be capable of tuning to and operating on any of the 25-kHz channels, from 118.000 to 136.975 MHz (760 channels), within 100 ms of the receipt of the "frequency change" command from the (remote) transceiver tuning control [when the transceiver is not transmitting]. 

## 2.2.1.1.4 Receive To Transmit Switching Time

When the MAC persistence parameter is set to p=1, the midpoint of the first symbol of the synchronization sequence shall occur no more than 2.75 ms after the received signal falls below –100+2 dBm. The receive-to-transmit switching or turn-around time is measured starting from the time the RF input signal level into the receiver drops below the channel busy-to-idle detection threshold (see paragraph 2.2.1.1.6) to the time the middle of the first D8PSK symbol of the 16-symbol Synchronization Sequence of the preamble is transmitted. Figure 2-1 demonstrates a general receive to transmit turnaround time diagram. 

## 2.2.1.1.5 Transmit To Receive Switching Time

The transceiver shall be capable of receiving and demodulating an incoming signal within 1.5 ms after the center of the final information symbol. 

 Note: This requirement should include all decisions made at the MAC (CSMA) 
sublayer. 

## 2.2.1.1.6 Channel Sensing

The transceiver shall implement the physical layer channel sensing requirements of DO- 224C, Section 3.2.1.7 and all subsections. 

## 2.2.1.2 Receiver Requirements

Unless otherwise stated, all receiver requirements shall be applicable to Class F receivers under room temperature (25o C) condition, at the stated nominal data rate, and with the receiver tuned to any 25 kHz channel over the entire frequency range of 118.000 to 136.975 MHz. The receiver performance shall be based on an uncorrected BER of 0.001, or, equivalently, on a FER of 0.16, for a 240 octet VDL Mode 2 frame.  In the detailed requirements that follow, the term "error rate" applies to either the BER or equivalent FER. 

Note:  The FER of 0.16 is equivalent to an uncorrected bit error rate of no more than 
0.001, assuming that forward error correction is applied using the Reed-Solomon decoder specified in DO-224C. 

 
For Class X equipment, the error rate shall be measured at the ISO 8208 interface.  
For Class Y equipment, the error rate shall be measured at the Data/Management interface. If a non-ISO 8208 interface is defined in accordance with Section 2.2.5, the error rate for Class V equipment shall be measured at the Data/Management Interface. Unless stated otherwise, the reference signal level defined in Section 1.7.7 shall be minus 87 dBm. 

## 2.2.1.2.1 Sensitivity

A signal level of minus 98 dBm at the input of the receiver from a VDL Mode 2 signal source shall produce an error rate that meets the requirements specified in Section 2.2.1.2. 

## 2.2.1.2.2 Adjacent Channel Rejection

The receiver shall achieve the error rate requirement (Section 2.2.1.2) when a single undesired VDL Mode 2 signal (Section 1.7.8) operating on the upper or lower adjacent channel at a level 44 dB above the reference signal level (Section 2.2.1.2) is applied in addition to a desired signal at the reference signal level (Section 2.2.1.2). 

## 2.2.1.2.3 Receiver Performance In The Presence Of Strong Signals Within The Vhf Aeronautical Band

The receiver shall achieve the error rate requirement (Section 2.2.1.2) when a continuous wave (CW) interfering signal is combined with the desired signal at the reference signal level (Section 2.2.1.2) at the receiver input, in the following conditions: 



 
Level of the interfering signal set at minus 27 dBm, at frequencies corresponding to fourth and higher order adjacent channels center.   
The frequency range of the interfering signal shall be 118.000 to 136.975 MHz, including the in-band frequencies of the second upper and second lower adjacent channels to which the receiver is tuned but excluding the frequency range between these two adjacent channels.

|-------------|-----------------|
| Modulation: | None            |

Frequency range:  108 to 156 MHz (excluding 117.950 to 137.025 MHz). 

Unwanted signal B: 

| Level:                                                                | Minus 7 dBm, except at the receiver IF frequencies,    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| where the level shall be minus 33 dBm.                                |                                                        |
| Modulation:                                                           | None                                                   |
| Frequency range:  50 kHz to 1215 MHz (excluding the range 87.5 to 156 |                                                        |
| MHz).                                                                 |                                                        |

Unwanted signal C: 

| Level:                              | Minus 5 dBm    |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Modulation:                         | None           |
| Frequency range:  87.5 to 107.9 MHz |                |

## 2.2.1.2.5 Desired Signal Dynamic Range

The receiver shall continue to achieve the BER or equivalent FER requirement (Section 2.2.1.2) when the desired signal level is increased from the sensitivity level (Section 2.2.1.2.1) to minus 7 dBm. 

## 2.2.1.2.6 Symbol Rate Capture Range

The receiver shall achieve the error rate requirement (Section 2.2.1.2) when the desired signal at the reference signal level (Section 2.2.1.2) is subject to a symbol rate offset of  50 parts per million (ppm). 

## 2.2.1.2.7 Frequency Capture Range

The receiver shall be capable of acquiring and maintaining a lock to the desired signal tuned to any selected channel at or above the sensitivity level (Section 2.2.1.2.1) with the maximum permitted signal frequency offset defined below. The receiver shall achieve the required BER or equivalent FER (Section 2.2.1.2) when the desired signal at the sensitivity level (Section 2.2.1.2.1) is subject to a frequency offset of  967 Hz at the room temperature. 

Note:  This value is composed of the maximum transmitter frequency error at 136.975 
MHz ( 685 Hz) and the maximum Doppler shift ( *282 Hz).* When tested over the range of environmental conditions specified in Section 2.3, frequency capture range performance shall be measured with a signal level 6 dB above the sensitivity level (Section 2.2.1.2.1) 

## 2.2.1.2.8 Phase Acceleration

Receivers shall be able to demodulate signals exhibiting peak phase accelerations of 1000 Hz/s while the maximum frequency deviation falls within  685 Hz of the desired channel frequency, without degrading the specified BER or FER requirement of Section 
2.2.1.2. 

Note: Phase Acceleration is related to frequency modulation processes, in both Doppler scenarios and VDL transmitter residual frequency modulation.  The frequency modulation produced in Doppler scenarios is characterized by low modulation rates and low peak frequency deviations.  DO-224C specifies maximum phase accelerations permissible in VDL transmitters that swamp those produced in Doppler scenarios.  The rate in the test has been set to reflect both Doppler and VDL transmitter phase acceleration specifications to ensure VDL receivers will correctly demodulate signals modulated by Doppler and residual FM mechanisms. 

## 2.2.1.2.9 Co-Channel Interference (Cci)

The receiver shall achieve the error rate requirement (Section 2.2.1.2) when an undesired VDL Mode 2 signal (Section 1.7.8) on the same VDL Mode 2 channel at a level 20 dB below the reference signal level (Section 2.2.1.2) is applied in addition to a desired signal at the reference signal level (Section 2.2.1.2).  

## 2.2.1.2.10 Conducted Spurious Emission

When the receiver input is terminated in a resistive load that is equal to the nominal receiver input impedance, the level of any spurious emission appearing across the load shall not exceed minus 57 dBm over the frequency range of 50 kHz to 1215 MHz, with the exception of the range of 108 to 137 MHz, where it shall not exceed minus 64 dBm. 

Note: If other receiving systems are installed, receiver emissions that comply with this minimum standard may interfere with those systems.  See the notes in Section 3.2.2 for additional information. 

## 2.2.1.2.11 Fm Broadcast Intermodulation

The receiver shall achieve the error rate requirement (Section 2.2.1.2) in the presence of two unmodulated interfering signals within the frequency range of 87.5 to 107.9 MHz. Each interfering signal shall separately present a level of minus 5 dBm at the receiver input.  The combined interfering signals shall be simultaneously applied to the receiver input in the presence of the desired signal at the reference signal level (Section 2.2.1.2).   

## 2.2.1.2.12 In-Band Intermodulation

The receiver shall achieve the error rate requirement (Section 2.2.1.2) in the presence of two undesired signals displaced in frequency from the desired signal as defined below: Desired Signal: 

| Level:           | Minus 75 dBm    |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Modulation:      | VDL Mode 2      |
| Frequency range: | test frequency. |

Unwanted signal A: 

Level:  
minus 32 dBm 
| Modulation:     |
|-----------------|
| Frequency :     |
| test frequency  |
|                |
| 1 MHz.          |

Unwanted signal B: 

| Level:         | minus 32 dBm                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Modulation:    | undesired VDL Mode 2 Test Signal (Section 1.7.8) |
| Frequency :    |                                                  |
| test frequency |                                                  |
|               |                                                  |
| 2 MHz          |                                                  |

Note: The objective of this requirement is to specify the receiver linearity in order to 
guarantee that the third order intercept point (IP3) is at least 0 dBm.  This is the minimum acceptable value and manufacturers are encouraged to design their receiver to withstand an unwanted level of minus 29 dBm.  (This corresponds to an IP3 value of plus 5 dBm) 

## 2.2.1.3 Transmitter Requirements

Unless otherwise stated, all transmitter requirements shall be applicable to both Class 7 
and Class 8 transmitters under room temperature (25o C) conditions and with the transmitter tuned to any 25 kHz channel over the frequency range of 118.000 to 136.975 MHz.  Furthermore, unless otherwise stated all requirements shall be met with the transmitter output terminated in a resistive load matching the output impedance of the transmitter. 

## 2.2.1.3.1 Channel Bit Rate

The channel bit rate shall be 31,500 bits per second  50 ppm. 

## 2.2.1.3.2 Rf Output Power

The RF output power of the transmitter shall be measured during signal transmission. Class 7: The RF output power, measured at the transmitter antenna port, on all frequencies for which the transmitter is designed, shall not be less than 15 watts. Class 8: The output power, measured at the transmitter antenna port, on all frequencies for which the transmitter is designed, shall not be less than 4 watts. 

Note: To achieve the requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.6 and Section 2.2.1.3.7, it is recommended that the maximum output power be limited to 25 watts.   

## 2.2.1.3.3 Rf Power Rise Time

The transmitter ramp-up and power stabilization component of the training sequence shall be defined over time interval t = –5.5  to t = –0.5, where t = 0 is the middle of the first symbol of the synchronization sequence (refer to Figure 2-20).  The RF power shall be less than minus 40 dB relative to carrier (dBc) prior to time t = –5.5 and equal to greater than 90% of manufacturer-stated nominal output power between t = –3.0 and - 0.5.  Time (t) is measured in symbol periods (approximately 95.24 µsec each.   
--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Notes: 
1. It is recommended that the symbols transmitted during the ramp-up and power 
stabilization segment represent the information 000.  
2. In order to minimize the effect of power in an adjacent channel, careful attention 
must be paid to the profile of the RF signal during the ramp-up period. 
 
3. The relative timing associated with the RF rise time is shown in Figure 2-20 in 
Section 2.4.4.2.3. 
 
4. Minus 40 dB relative to the carrier (dBc) is 40 dB below the manufacturer-stated 
output power. 
 

## 2.2.1.3.4 Rf Power Release Time

The transmitter output power shall decay at least 20 dB below the rated RF output power level (Section 2.2.1.3.2) within 2.5 symbol periods (approximately 238.1 µsec) after the middle of the final information symbol. The transmitter power leakage when the transmitter is in the "off" state shall be less than –83 dBm. 

Note: In order to minimize the effect of power in an adjacent channel during power ramp-down, careful attention must be paid to the profile of the RF signal during the ramp-down period. 

## 2.2.1.3.5 Symbol Constellation Error

The EVM (Section 1.7.6), when measured over the first 100 symbols of the reference bit sequence (Section 1.7.9) shall be less than 6%. 

## 2.2.1.3.6 Spurious Emissions

When the transmitter is "active" (i.e., transmitter is in transmit mode) and terminated in a resistive load equal to the nominal output impedance, the power of any spurious emission at the output of the transmitter shall not exceed:  

(a)  0.25 microwatts (minus 36 dBm) within a bandwidth of 1 kHz, on any frequency in 
the range 9 kHz to 150 kHz.  
(b)  0.25 microwatts (minus 36 dBm) within a bandwidth of 10 kHz, on any frequency in 
the range 150 kHz to 30 MHz.

in the range 108 MHz to 117.5 MHz. 
(e)  0.25 microwatts (minus 36 dBm) within a bandwidth of 10 kHz, on any frequency in 
the range 117.5 MHz to 117.8 MHz.

the range 137.175 MHz to 137.475 MHz. 
(g)  0.25 microwatts (minus 36 dBm) within a bandwidth of 100 kHz, on any frequency 
in the range 137.475 MHz to 1.7 gigahertz (GHz).   
Additionally, the level of spurious emissions at discrete frequencies (excluding harmonics) in the following bands shall not exceed 4 nanowatts (nW) (minus 54 dBm). 

(h) 47 to 68 MHz (i)  88 to 108 MHz 
(j) 162 to 244 MHz 
(k) 328 to 336 MHz (l) 470 to 862 MHz 
Harmonic emission products shall be at least 60 dB below the rated RF output power, i.e., minus 60 dBc. Harmonic emission products in the ICAO Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) band extending from 1559 to 1610 MHz shall be no greater than minus 60 dBm.  The level of the N-th harmonic emission product shall be measured in a bandwidth that is N times 25 kHz. 

When the transmitter is "idle" (i.e., transceiver in receive mode) and terminated in a resistive load equal to the nominal output impedance, the power of any spurious emission at the output of the transmitter shall not exceed: 

(m) 2 nW (minus 57 dBm) within a bandwidth of 1 kHz, on any frequency in the range 9 
kHz to 150 kHz.  
(n) 2 nW (minus 57 dBm) within a bandwidth of 10 kHz, on any frequency in the range 
150 kHz to 30 MHz. 
(o) 2 nW (minus 57 dBm) within a bandwidth of 100 kHz, on any frequency in the range 
30 MHz to 1 GHz. 
Notes: 
1. 
Spurious emissions are power emissions which are outside the desired bandwidth and the level of which may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of information.  Spurious emissions include parasitic emissions, intermodulation products, and frequency conversion products. 
 
2. 
In order to provide adequate protection of a GNSS receiver when a VDL transceiver is operated on the same aircraft, the manufacturers should ensure that the transmitter harmonic filter remains effective at frequencies in the band 1559-1610 MHz. 3. 
If other receiving systems are installed, transmitter harmonics may interfere with those systems. See Section 3.2.2, Note 2. 

## 2.2.1.3.7 Adjacent Channel Power First Adjacent Channel Power:

Beyond the fourth adjacent channel power: Beyond the fourth adjacent channel, the RF power measured over a 25 kHz channel bandwidth shall decrease at a rate of no less than 5 dB per octave of channel offset (for example, minus 43 dBm at the eighth adjacent channel, minus 48 dBm at the sixteenth adjacent channel, and minus 53 dBm at the thirty-second adjacent channel) to minus 53 dBm or less under all operating conditions (including transmitter attack and delay).  
Note: The adjacent channel power requirements apply over the entire 117.8 MHz to 
137.175 MHz band.

Class Y equipment shall meet the MAC sublayer requirements for VDL Mode 2, as specified in Section 3.2.2.3 of RTCA DO-224C including all applicable sub-sections, referenced tables, figures, appendices. Class Z and Class W equipment shall meet the requirements of Section 3.2.2 of RTCA DO-224C including all applicable sub-sections, referenced tables, figures, appendices, except for the requirements of Section 3.2.2.3 The manufacturer shall declare if the equipment supports the output of information transferred by means of Unnumbered Information (UI) frames.  If the equipment supports the output of UI information, the manufacturer shall declare the format and characteristics of the UI output. 

Note: It is strongly recommended that VDL Mode 2 avionics support the Ground Requested Broadcast Handoff capability of DO-224C, Section 3.2.2.5.4.10. 

## 2.2.3 Vdl Mode 2 Network Layer 8208 Requirements

For Class V and Class W architectures (Section 2.1.9.2), which support a non-ISO 8208 interface for ATN applications, the documentation of Network layer and Subnetwork Access Protocol requirements are outside the scope of this document and subject to verification outside of this MOPS.  
Note: As indicated in Section 1.1, this MOPS applies to VDL Mode 2 as an ATN 
subnetwork.  Although much of this document may be applied to non-ATN capabilities using portions of the VDL Mode 2 protocol stack, such as AOA, this document does not intend to establish comprehensive standards for non-ATN, non-8208 use of VDL Mode 2.  See ARINC Specification 631 implementation characteristics for information. 

## 2.2.6 Data/Management Interface

Class Y, Class Z, and Class W equipment provides a Data/Management interface for the purpose of exchanging data and control information between the lower VDL Mode 2 protocol stack and the upper VDL Mode 2 protocol stack.  The Data/Management interface is described in Appendix D. 

## 2.3 Minimum Performance Requirements - Environmental Conditions 2.3.1 Introduction

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in Table 2-1 and Table 2-2 provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under conditions representative of those which may be encountered in actual operations. Some of the environmental tests do not have to be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition.  These tests are identified by the phrase "if required."  If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional environmental conditions, then these "If required" tests shall be performed. It is the purview of the equipment manufacturer to determine the environment against which it is certifying the EUT.  Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in documents RTCA DO-160/EUROCAE ED-14 "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment".  This document illustrates the pass/fail criteria for the environmental conditions associated with the latest version G, dated December 2010 for reference.  The use of later editions of these documents must be agreed with the appropriate approval authority. The tests in Table 2-1 and Table 2-2 shall, in general, be conducted only at the mid-band frequency, 127.500 MHz.  However, tests conducted to ascertain equipment performance at extreme temperatures shall also be conducted at the lowest and highest channel assignments of the AM(R)S band. 

## 2.3.2 Receiver

Note: Some of the performance requirements in Section 2.2.1.2 are not required to be tested to all of the conditions contained in RTCA DO-160/ED-14.  Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Section 2.2.1.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these conditions. 

## 2.3.3 Transmitter

Note: Some of the performance requirements in Section 2.2.1.3 are not required to be tested to all of the conditions contained in RTCA DO-160/Eurocae ED-14. Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Section 2.2.1.3 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these conditions.

 Tailor the conducted and radiated RF susceptibility tests in RTCA/DO-160G Section 20 as follows.  From 112 MHz to 143 MHz excluding the 
tuned frequency plus and minus 200 kHz, perform the radiated RF susceptibility tests using a calibrated field strength of 25 millivolts per meter, and perform the conducted RF susceptibility using a calibrated cable bundle current of 40 microamperes.  The frequency band of the tuned frequency plus and minus 200 kHz is excluded from this test.  Use the calibration and test procedures in DO-160G Section 20.4, 20.5 and 20.6 that apply to Category T.  For frequencies below 112 MHz and above 143 MHz use a category from RTCA/DO-160G Section 20 appropriate for the intended application of this radio.  The tests should be performed with the antenna coaxial cable terminated in a matched load.  This exclusion supersedes the exclusion frequencies specified in RTCA/DO-160G Section 20.3.d. 
(5) 
All mechanical devices shall perform their intended functions. 
(6) 
Equipment performance requirements are applicable only to equipment qualified to Category A or B.

## 2.4 Equipment Test Procedures

The following procedures provide guidelines for tests to ensure compliance with the VDL Mode 2 MOPS performance requirements.  Alternative procedures or analyses providing equivalent performance documentation may be used, and if so they shall be accompanied with detailed documentation of the method used.  Therefore, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating acceptability of the alternate procedures. 

## 2.4.1 Definition Of Terms And Conditions Of Tests 2.4.1.1 Warm-Up And Stabilization Of Test Equipment/Equipment Under Test

The equipment under test and the associated test equipment shall be powered up for a period of not less than one hour prior to the start of each test session to ensure that the unit under test and the test equipment are sufficiently stabilized under the test environment. 

## 2.4.1.2 Alignment, Adjustment And Calibration For Equipment Under Test

All alignment, adjustment and calibration of the test equipment and equipment under test shall be performed prior to commencement of the test.  Once the test starts, no further external alignment, adjustment and calibration of test equipment and the equipment under test shall be allowed, throughout the duration of the test.  Automatic internal recalibration shall be permitted. 

## 2.4.1.3 Equipment Termination

Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed with the equipment RF terminal(s) terminated with a load matching the nominal characteristic impedance of the equipment. 

## 2.4.1.4 Test Equipment Calibration And Replacement

All test equipment calibration shall use standards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or equivalent.  Furthermore, all test equipment calibration shall remain valid throughout the entire duration of the test.  In the case that test equipment needs to be replaced due to equipment failure, the replacement equipment shall be of the same make and model as the equipment it replaces. 

## 2.4.1.5 Failure Of The Equipment Under Test

In the event that the equipment under test fails during the course of the test, a report shall be generated by the manufacturer of the failed equipment to detail the cause of the failure and the fixes proposed.  Test shall not be continued if engineering judgment indicates that the changes made to correct the failure would impact the previously run tests.   

## 2.4.1.6 Measurement Error Due To Test Equipment And Test Setup

Good engineering practices should be exercised to minimize measurement error contributed by the test equipment and test setup.  Precautions shall be taken to minimize measurement errors due to contributions from noise sidebands of signal generators and impedance mismatches.  In particular, special consideration should be given to the noise floor of the VHF signal generator used for adjacent channel and in-band interference tests to ensure that the minimum signal-to-noise ratio for the desired channel is maintained at the equipment under test.  External filtering may be required to achieve this performance. Whenever practical, measurement error due to the test setup, including cable contributions, shall be compensated for. 

## 2.4.1.7 Default Rf Signal Level For Avionics High Level Protocol Testing

Unless otherwise stated, the desired RF signal level presented to the RF input of the avionics unit under test and the Ground System Emulator shall be adjusted to a level sufficient to ensure that noise-induced bit errors and frame errors do not affect the protocol test results.   
Note:  A signal level of -50 dBm 5 dB at the antenna port on a VDL Mode 2 receiver 

should be sufficient to satisfy this requirement. 
 
For Class Z and Class W equipment, which do not require an RF signal level from the LT, the default shall be an SQP value of 11 on the Data/Management Interface. 

## 2.4.2 Special Test Mode And Test Equipment For Physical Layer Tests

Many of the tests of receiver performance require measurement of the VDL Mode 2 "error rate", which is defined to be either the bit error rate (BER) or the equivalent frame error rate (FER).   

## 2.4.2.1 Frame Error Rate Testing 2.4.2.1.1 Fer Test

When FER is used as the basis for performance verification it shall be measured by the following procedure: For the purpose of the FER test, a series of up to 65,536 test frames shall be generated. Each FER test frame shall consist of a total of 240 octets.  The first 238 octets shall contain the binary values corresponding to the integers 0 to 237, respectively, transmitted least significant bit first.  The last two octets shall contain a binary representation of a FER test sequence number ranging from 0 to 65,535, transmitted least significant bit first. The FER test sequence number shall be incremented on each successive frame, with the count wrapping to zero on the frame following the maximum count. Step 1 
Set the appropriate transmitter signal level to the specified level required by the test. 

Step 2 
Using a Desired VDL Mode 2 Signal Source, as defined in Section 2.4.2.3, generate a series of FER test frames at the appropriate transmitter, beginning with a FER test sequence value of 0. 
Step 3 
Using an ATT, as defined in Section 2.4.3.1.1, or a UDMITT, as defined in Section 2.4.3.1.2, compare the received frames to the transmitted test frames. Any missing or duplicated FER sequence number shall be considered a frame error.   
--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Step 4 
Using the count of the successful frame transmissions, perform a sequential 
estimation test with a probability of missed detection  and verify 
compliance with the requirements of Section 2.2.1.2.  No decision should be made for at least 115 frames.   
Note: A probability of missed detection 
1
means that there is no more than a 
1% chance that an implementation that fails the requirement will pass the test.  
Test designs based on a smaller value for are acceptable.  An example of the acceptance regions for such a test is shown in Figure 2-2.  The test of Figure 2-2 has been designed for a false alarm rate, 
5
. 

## 2.4.2.1.2 Fer Test Setup

The test setup illustrated in Figure 2-3 shall be used when the physical layer test procedures require measurement of frame error rate. 


## 2.4.2.2 Bit Error Rate Testing

When BER is used as the basis for performance verification, the VDL Mode 2 transceiver may include a BER mode, which is distinct from the operating mode, for measuring the uncorrected BER of the Physical layer using an external BER test fixture, as specified below.  Such a BER mode provides means of isolating the Physical layer from the upper layers to allow performance measurement of the Physical layer alone.  The test method used for verification shall be traceable back to the operational mode of the transceiver. In the BER mode, the receiver shall forward each burst payload to the external BER test fixture prior to error detection or correction procedures.  

## 2.4.2.2.1 External Ber Test Fixture

The external BER Test Fixture shall include a message generator/processor to generate test payloads for the desired signal in both burst and non-burst (continuous) forms.  An appropriate ramp up sequence shall be added to the test payload and mapped directly into the Mode 2 frame structure.  The formatting shall include cyclic redundancy check (CRC), scrambling and header. The external BER test fixture generating the transmitted burst payload and receiving and processing the received burst payload must be synchronized with the transceiver under test either explicitly (via some direct connection) or implicitly (via the known sequencing of the pseudorandom test payload). Calculation of cumulative BER statistics shall begin once synchronization of the external BER test fixture between the transmitting and receiving burst payload has been accomplished.  The external BER test fixture shall detect the loss of an entire burst implicitly by lack of a burst payload message in the given burst period.  Each test shall also include a running count of synchronization failures in addition to the cumulative BER. 

## 2.4.2.2.2 Test Payload

Test payload used in all BER tests shall be pseudorandom number (PN) sequences.  For burst mode tests, the transmission shall consist of 20 bytes of pseudorandom data. For BER tests the minimum length of the PN test sequence used shall be 100,000 bits in order to provide statistically meaningful BER measurement at an uncorrected BER of 0.001. The PN test sequence used for the undesired signal shall be uncorrelated in content and burst timing with the PN test sequence used for the desired signal. 

## 2.4.2.2.3 Ber Test Setup

The test setup illustrated in Figure 2-4 shall be used when the physical layer test procedures require measurement of bit error rate. 

## 2.4.2.3 Desired Vdl Mode 2 Signal Source 2.4.2.3.1 Vdl Mode 2 Data Generator

Physical and protocol layer tests require the use of a VDL Mode 2 Data Generator that can generate either deterministic or pseudorandom contents for payload, as well as all framing, formatting, coding, and bit-stuffing required for proper assembly of a valid VDL Mode 2 transmission burst, as specified in DO-224C. 

## 2.4.2.3.2 Vhf Signal Generator

Physical layer test procedures require the use of a high performance VHF signal generator, which shall be capable of generating the specified D8PSK modulation simultaneously with other phase and/or frequency modulation. If an external BER test fixture is used to measure error rate, the VHF signal generator shall support an appropriate interface for input and output of test payload data. The VHF Signal Generator should be capable of tuning 115.975 MHz to 137.000 MHz. Note: The recommendation to tune below the VDL Mode 2 band of operation is only for the purpose of the Phase Acceleration test of 2.4.4.1.8.   

## 2.4.2.4 Undesired Vdl Mode 2 Signal Source

VHF signal generators are required to generate the undesired signals for verifying performance under various interference conditions.  Tests for CCI and ACR require the generation of an undesired VDL Mode 2 signal, as defined in Section 1.7.8.  A VHF signal generator capable of generating CW and externally modulating FM is also required. 

## 2.4.3 Vdl Mode 2 Test Set Definitions

In order to standardize testing of the various protocol layers above the Physical Layer across the range of VDL Mode 2 avionics architectures described in Section 1.3, this document adopts the nomenclature of ISO-9646, as illustrated in Figure 2-5.  This section 
--``,,,,,,,,,``````,`,,``,,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
and its subsections give an overview of the major components involved in the test procedure descriptions. 

The **Equipment Under Test** (EUT) is that part of the avionics equipment to be tested. 

For Class X equipment, the EUT includes SNAcP (ISO 8208), VME/LME, DLS (AVLC), MAC (CSMA) and Physical (D8PSK) protocol layers.  For Class Y equipment, the implementation under test includes the MAC (CSMA) and Physical (D8PSK) protocol layers, and may include some functionality described under the DLS requirements.  For Class Z equipment, the implementation under test includes SNAcP (ISO 8208), VME/LME, and most DLS (AVLC) functions. 

The **Upper Tester** (UT) is the means of providing control and observation of the upper service boundary of the EUT and of any relevant abstract local primitive during test execution. For Class X and Class Z equipment, the upper service boundary is the ISO 8208 SNAcP interface.  For Class Y equipment, the upper service boundary is the Data/Management Interface required by Section 2.2.6. 

The **Lower Tester** (LT) is the means of providing control and observation at the appropriate Point of Control and Observation (PCO) either below the EUT or remote from the EUT, as defined by the chosen test method.  For Class X and Class Y equipment, the lower service boundary between the EUT and the LT is the VHF Physical Layer.  For Class Z equipment, the lower service boundary between the EUT and the LT is the Data/Management Interface required by Section 2.2.6. 

## 2.4.3.1 Upper Tester (Ut)

The UT is not necessarily a single definable piece of test instrumentation, but will likely be comprised of an assemblage of test equipment appropriate for a given test procedure capable of providing the functions necessary for that test.  Based on the architecture class being tested, two UT configurations are anticipated.  For Class X and Class Z equipment, the UT configuration will include the major functions illustrated in Figure 2-6.  The Aircraft Test Tool is defined in Section 2.4.3.1.1. 

Note:  Other points of access for UT to EUT than direct ISO 8208 I/O are acceptable 
providing that Link and subnetwork layers test procedures defined in this document can be implemented or acceptable alternate test procedures can be negotiated. 

## 

For Class Y equipment, the UT shall include additional functionality to emulate the upper layers of the VDL Mode 2 protocol stack between the ISO 8208 interface and the Data/Management Interface, as illustrated in Figure 2-7.  The functionality of the Upper Data/Management Interface Test Tool (UDMITT) is described in Section 2.4.3.1.2.   
 

## 

Note:  An acceptable implementation of a Data/Management Interface Test tool could 
be a combination of an ATT, as defined in Section 2.4.3.1.1, and certified Class Z equipment (e.g. a CMU implementing VDL Mode 2 functionality). 
The UT should have the following minimal capabilities: 
 
Ability to trace, save and translate information transfers at the appropriate interfaces 
 
Ability to load data fields within the constraints of the appropriate protocol, as required for the various test scenarios  
 
Ability to trigger events at the appropriate interface as required by the various test scenarios. 

## 2.4.3.1.1 Aircraft Test Tool / Protocol Analyzer (Att)

An Aircraft Test Tool (ATT) function includes a means of bi-directional communications with the VDL Mode 2 EUT by way of ISO 8208 packets.  The ATT shall permit user control of data content and message timing for transmitted messages.  The ATT shall permit user storage, retrieval and examination of incoming and outgoing messages on both octet and packet levels, in accordance with ISO 8208 and DO-224C.  Data fields within packets will also be capable of being loaded with either live data scenarios or test data.  The ATT will provide a means of validating and documenting the information content of any message transmitted or received from the EUT.  

## 2.4.3.1.2 Upper Data/Management Interface Test Tool (Udmitt)

The Upper Data/Management Interface Test Tool (UDMITT) function includes a means of bi-directional communications with the VDL Mode 2 EUT by way of the Data/Management Interface required by Section 2.2.6.  The UDMITT shall contain the functionality of the ATT with respect to storage, retrieval, examination, validation, documentation and analysis of transmitted and received data packets, plus the ability to interface with Class Y equipment over the defined Data/Management Interface.  The UDMITT shall perform any timing-related tasks associated with VDL Mode 2 protocol layers above the Data/Management Interface within the default times specified in DO- 224C.

## 2.4.3.2 Lower Tester (Lt)

The LT is not necessarily a single definable piece of test instrumentation, but will likely be comprised of an assemblage of test equipment appropriate for a given test procedure capable of providing the functions necessary for that test.  Based on the architecture class being tested, two LT configurations are anticipated.  For Class X and Class Y equipment, the LT configuration will include the major functions illustrated in Figure 2-8.  The Ground Station Emulator (GSE) is defined in Section 2.4.3.2.1.

(see 2.4.3.2.3)

For Class Z equipment, the LT shall include additional functionality to emulate the lower layers (MAC, Physical) of the VDL Mode 2 protocol stack, as illustrated in Figure 2-9. The VDL Mode 2 Lower Layer Emulator is described in Section 2.4.3.1.2. Figure 2-9 should be taken as illustrative only.  There is no requirement to implement a GSE separately, but the GSE functionality specified in Section 2.4.3.1.1 should be present. The LT should have the following capabilities: 

 
Ability to trace, save and translate information transfers at the appropriate ISO-8208 and AVLC levels 
 
Ability to load data fields within the constraints of the ISO-8208 and AVLC protocols, as required for the various test scenarios  
 
Ability to trigger events at the appropriate interface as required by the various test scenarios  
 
Means of validating and documenting the information content of any message transmitted to or received from the EUT  
 
Ability to emulate two VDL Mode 2 ground stations configured as one or two Ground Systems 
 
Ability to timestamp information transfers to and from the EUT. 

## 2.4.3.2.1 Ground Station Emulator (Gse)

The GSE function emulates all the ground station functions in a typical VDL Mode 2 network.  Some VDL Mode 2 functions and characteristics can be verified only when a VDL Mode 2 EUT is coupled through an RF link with its VDL Mode 2 Ground Station (GS) counterpart, each controlling or reacting to various states (or changes of state) of each other. The GSE is not necessarily a single definable piece of test instrumentation, but will likely comprise an assemblage of test equipment appropriate for a given test procedure capable of providing the functions necessary for that test. The following is a minimal list that should be incorporated as part of the GS emulator tool: The GSE must be compliant with the minimum requirements applying to ground stations established by RTCA DO-224C. The GSE should be configurable to emulate the services that may be encountered in the field and the varied vendors that will provide these network services. The GSE shall include a Desired VDL Mode 2 Signal Source, as defined in Section 2.4.2.3. 

The GSE must be able to establish an ISO 8208 link with its peer entity in the ATT, and to emulate air-ground subnetwork operations via this link. The GSE must have the ability to control the signaling and communications protocols embodied as part of the VDL Mode 2 and ATN technical manual standards, and to verify correct operation of those protocols. The GSE must have the ability to operate in the configurations specified in Section 2.4.3.2.4.1 through Section 2.4.3.2.4.3 

## 2.4.3.2.2 Vdl Mode 2 Lower Data/Management Interface Test Tool (Ldmitt)

The Lower Data/Management Interface Test Tool (LDMITT) function includes a means of bi-direction communications with the VDL Mode 2 EUT by means of the Data/Management Interface required by Section 2.2.6.  The LDMITT shall contain the functionality of the ATT and the GSE with respect to storage, retrieval, examination, validation, documentation and analysis of transmitted and received data packets, plus the ability to interface with Class Z equipment over the defined Data/Management Interface. The LDMITT shall perform any timing-related tasks associated with VDL Mode 2 protocol layers below the Data/Management Interface within the default times specified in DO-224C. 

Note:  An acceptable implementation of an LDMITT could be a combination of one or more GSEs, as specified in 2.4.3.2.1, and certified Class Y equipment (e.g. Class Y equipment complying with this MOPS). 

## 2.4.3.2.3 Air/Ground Router

The Lower Tester should have the ability to emulate one or more Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN) Air/Ground router(s).  The ATN ground router provides the peer communications services to the Upper Tester, allowing overall air/ground communications through the EUT. 

## 2.4.3.2.4 Standard Lt Configurations

The following five standard Lower Level Test configurations are defined to facilitate description of the testing to be performed on the advanced features in the VDL Mode 2 protocol (e.g., handoff between ground stations and routers).  For simplicity, these configurations are shown as modifications of Figure 2-8.  Equivalent configurations may be expressed as modifications of Figure 2-9 by replacing the VDL Mode 2 LDMITT with Class Y equipment having the interfaces shown as in the following figures.  That is, for testing of Class Z equipment, the GSEs and all lower level VDL Mode 2 protocol layers are  contained in the Lower Tester.

## 2.4.4 Physical Layer Test Procedures

The following test procedures verify compliance with the physical layer requirements of Section 2.2.1 of this document.  However, alternative procedures that provide equivalent information may be used.  To reduce the number of test cases, the number of frequency channels at which the VDL transmitter and receiver are to be tested shall include a low channel (for example, 118.000 MHz), a mid channel (for example 128 MHz), and a high channel (for example 136.975 MHz). These test procedures apply to Class X, Class V, and Class Y equipment.  Class Z and Class W equipment are excluded from these procedures. 

## 2.4.4.1 Receiver Test Procedures

For receiver error rate testing, the receiver will be placed in either of the equivalent error rate test modes.   Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4 show the basic test setups for measuring the appropriate error rate.  In all of the detailed test procedure, it is acceptable to measure either the BER by means of the procedure given in Section Error!

These analyzers offer complex signal analysis such as digital modulation (i.e. D8PSK for VDL Mode 2) plus AM/FM/PM demodulation, vector spectrum analysis and time-gated spectrum analysis.   

## 2.4.4.2.1 Bit Rate

Reference: Section 2.2.1.3.1 This requirement may be satisfied by written evidence. In this case, the manufacturer must declare crystal stability, aging and temperature coefficients. 

Note: The evidence must demonstrate that consideration has been given to the temperature variation to which the equipment will be subjected (See Chapter 4, "Environmental Test Conditions") and the frequency range for which the equipment is designed to operate. 

## 2.4.4.2.2 Rf Output Power

Reference: Section 2.2.1.3.2 Equipment Required Transmission Generator (PC with suitable software) Attenuator (30 dB/30 W) Power Meter (with pulse power measurement capability) or Vector Signal Analyzer. Measurement Procedure 

Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-18.  
Step 2 
Tune the transmitter to one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 3 
Key the transmitter under test "on" and modulate the carrier with an appropriate test payload in burst form from the transmission generator. 
Step 4 
Set the power meter (or vector signal analyzer) to capture the VDL Mode 2 transmitted signal and determine the average transmitter output power during the message period.   
Step 5 
Repeat Steps 2 to 4 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 6 
Check that the measured output power is not less than the requirement for the appropriate class of transmitter under test (Section 2.2.1.3.2) for all three test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Note:  The output power must not be averaged over the time intervals between signal transmissions, i.e., output power delivered into 50 ohm load should be measured during signal transmission. 

## 2.4.4.2.3 Rf Power Rise Time

Reference: Section 2.2.1.3.3 Equipment Required Transmission Generator (PC with suitable software) Attenuator (30 dB/30 W) Vector Signal Analyzer Measurement Procedure 

Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-19.  
Step 2 
Configure the vector signal analyzer to display both constellation diagram and power versus time charts. 
Step 3 
Tune the transmitter and the vector signal analyzer to one of the test frequencies 
(Section 2.4.4). 
Step 4 
Use the transmission generator to generate a single test-burst.  
Step 5 
Capture the start of the test-burst using both constellation and power versus time display and identify the first symbol of the synchronization sequence. 
Step 6 
Check that the power level at 5.5 symbol periods before the middle of the first synchronization symbol is as defined in Section 2.2.1.3.3. 
Step 7 
Check that the RF power level for the 3 symbol periods before the middle of the first synchronization symbol is as defined in Section 2.2.1.3.3 
Step 8 
Check that the RF power rise time (defined in Section 2.2.1.3.3) is achieved.  
Step 9 
Repeat Steps 3 to 8 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 

## Figure 2-19: Rf Power Rise And Release Time Measurement

Note: The training sequence has a characteristic amplitude profile.  For the synchronization sequence, the profile appears as shown in Figure 2-20.  The point labeled T=0 is the middle (ideal sampling point) of the first symbol of the synchronization sequence.  There is a pronounced notch in the profile at T=0.5, which provides a convenient marker.  This makes it easy to check the power level at the appropriate time, which is 3.5 symbol periods prior to the notch, i.e., at T=-3.  This could constitute an alternative method using a standard spectrum analyzer or fast storage oscilloscope.  

 

## 2.4.4.2.4 Rf Power Release Time

Step 2 
Configure the vector signal analyzer in digital demodulation mode to display log magnitude of I & Q vectors, with normalization disabled. Set the Y-axis to read 
"dBm".  The symbol times are displayed on the resultant profile of power versus 
time. Use of the trigger hold off function will aid signal acquisition. 
Step 3

Step 7 
Check that the RF power release time (defined in Section 2.2.1.3.4) is achieved for all three test frequencies (Section 2.4.4).

Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-21. 
Step 2 
Use the filter to reject the on-channel signal in order to increase the dynamic range of the measurement without overloading the spectrum analyzer. Measure the frequency response of the filter and take this into account when calculating spurious measurement results. 
Step 3 
Tune the transmitter to one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 4 
Set the transmission generator to produce an appropriate test payload in burst form and key the transmitter under test "on".  
Step 5 
Adjust the spectrum analyzer reference level to provide the maximum dynamic range for display and set the input attenuator to the minimum required to ensure that no signal at the analyzer input exceeds the maximum allowable level. 
Step 6 
Measure the power level of each visible spurious signal using power band 
markers appropriate to the bandwidths specified in Section 2.2.1.3.6. Use the filter to reject the carrier in order to increase the dynamic range of the measurement without overloading the spectrum analyzer.  
Step7 
Measure the frequency response of the filter and take this into account when presenting spurious measurement results. If a bandpass filter is used, it will need to be tuned to several measurement frequencies, covering the overall measured frequency range. 
Step 8

## Method Of Measurement For The First Adjacent Channel Equipment Required

Transmission Generator (PC with suitable software) Attenuator (30 dB/30 W) Spectrum Analyzer (with power band marker function) 

## Measurement Procedure

Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-22. 
Step 2 
Tune the transmitter to one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 3 
Key the transmitter under test "on" and modulate it with the transmission 
generator to produce an appropriate test payload in burst form.   
Step 4 
Adjust the attenuator in the analyzer to the minimum value, which does not overload the input stage of the unit.  
Step 5 
Using 100 kHz span, display the Mode 2 signal envelope. Use the analyzer IF signal as the trigger source for the display and set averaging to 10.  
Step 6 
Using the power band marker function of the analyzer, measure the power in a 16 kHz bandwidth of the first upper adjacent channel.  
Step 7 
Repeat Step 6, except measure the power in a 25 kHz bandwidth of the first upper adjacent channel. 
Step 8 
Repeat Steps 3 to 7 for the first lower adjacent channel. 
Step 9 
Record the higher of the two measured values for the 16 kHz-bandwidth and 25 kHz-bandwidth measurements. Check that the first adjacent channel powers in 
the 16 kHz bandwidth and 25 kHz bandwidth are lower than the first adjacent channel power requirements for 16 kHz and 25 kHz bandwidths respectively (defined in Section 2.2.1.3.7).   

Step 10  Repeat Steps 2 to 9 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 11  Repeat Steps 2 through 10 with the spectrum analyzer set to peak hold and 
verify that the adjacent channel power measurements satisfy the requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.7 when compensating for the increased power measurement due to peak measurement versus average measurement.  
Note 1:  
As an example, Agilent Application Note 1303, page 18, shows that the peak measurement can be 10 dB greater than the average value under some circumstances. Manufacturers are cautioned to verify the appropriate peak to average ratio for their test setup.

Spectrum Analyzer (with power band marker function) 

## Measurement Procedure

CAUTION: To protect the analyzer, ensure that the transmitter is not keyed "on" at the 
frequency of the bandpass filter used for this test. 
Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-23. 
Step 2 
Tune the transmitter to one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 3 
Offset the tuned frequency of the transmitter under test to 50 kHz above the 
VHF bandpass filter center frequency. Key the transmitter under test "on". Use 
the transmission generator to produce an appropriate test payload in burst form.  
Step 4 
Set the analyzer span to 50 kHz and tune the analyzer to the center frequency of

Step 5 
Set the analyzer's power band marker function to 40 kHz.  Notice that the 
measurement bandwidth (25 kHz) is defined by the VHF bandpass filter; setting the power band marker to the same bandwidth will give erroneous results.  
Step 6 
Determine the second lower adjacent channel power. 
Step 7 
Repeat Steps 3 to 6 with the transmitter under test tuned to 50 kHz below the center frequency of the bandpass filter.  Determine the upper second adjacent channel power.

## Method Of Measurement For The Fourth Adjacent Channel Equipment Required

Transmission Generator (PC with suitable software) Attenuator (30 dB/30 W) VF Bandpass Filters each with a 3 dB bandwidth of 25 kHz and attenuation in excess of 50 dB at ±50 kHz with center frequencies as follows:  
Low-channel filter center frequency:  Low channel test frequency (Section 2.4.3.2.4.4) plus 100 kHz Mid-channel filter center frequency:  Mid channel test frequency (Section 2.4.3.2.4.4) High-channel filter center frequency:  High channel test frequency (Section 2.4.3.2.4.4) minus 100 kHz 

Note 3: The bandpass filter center frequency insertion loss and passband frequency 
response must be taken into account in all measurements. 

## Spectrum Analyzer (With Power Band Marker Function) Measurement Procedure

Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-23. 
Step 2 
Tune the transmitter to one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 3 
Offset the tuned frequency of the transmitter under test to 100 kHz above the VHF bandpass filter center frequency. Key the transmitter under test "on". Use the transmission generator to produce a test payload in burst form.  
Step 4 
Set the analyzer span to 50 kHz and the center frequency to the center frequency of the VHF bandpass filter. Decrease the analyzer input attenuator to the minimum level at which the attenuated RF signal from the transmitter under test does not overload the analyzer. Use the analyzer IF signal as the trigger source for the display and set averaging to 10. 
Step 5 
Set the analyzer's power band marker function to 40 kHz. Notice that the measurement bandwidth (25 kHz) is defined by the VHF bandpass filter; setting the power band marker to the same bandwidth will give erroneous results.  
Step 6 
Determine the fourth lower adjacent channel power. 
Step 7 
Repeat Steps 3 to 6 with the transmitter under test tuned to 100 kHz below the bandpass filter. Determine the fourth upper adjacent channel power. 
Step 8 
Record the higher of the two measured values as the fourth adjacent channel power.  
Step 9 
Check that the fourth adjacent channel power is less than the fourth adjacent channel power requirement (defined in Section 2.2.1.3.7). 
Step 10  Repeat Steps 2 to 9 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 11  Repeat Steps 2 through 10 with the spectrum analyzer set to peak hold and 
verify that the adjacent channel power measurements satisfy the requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.7 when compensating for the increased power measurement due to peak measurement versus average measurement.  See Note 1. 

## Alternative Measurement Procedure For Adjacent Channel Power

Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-24. 
Step 2 
Tune the transmitter to one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 3 
Start the transmission generator that produces test payload in burst form.  
Step 4 
Use an attenuator to protect the measurement equipment and a notch filter centered on the carrier frequency, if the dynamic range of the spectrum analyzer is not sufficient. Set the spectrum analyzer resolution bandwidth (Br) much narrower than the channel bandwidth and the video bandwidth (Bv) equal to ten times Br in order to avoid errors due to video averaging of noise. 
Step 5 
Measure and store the RF signal spectrum centered on the carrier frequency with a frequency span wide enough to display the entire modulation spectrum between the -80 dB points, referred to the peak value. 
Step 6 
Convert the logarithmic trace values from the spectrum analyzer to linear 
spectral power densities by the relation: 
$$P_{i}={\frac{10^{\frac{P i d B m}{10}}}{B_{n}}}$$
where PidBm = Trace values (dBm) Bn = Effective noise bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer (Hz) Pi = Spectral power densities (mW/Hz) 
Note 4: Bn = k * Br, where k is a constant specified for each spectrum analyzer. 

Step 7 
Perform integration of the linear spectral power densities. For computation of the linear spectral power values in the first, second and fourth adjacent channels, use the formula: 
$$P_{c h}=B_{c h}\times{\frac{1}{N}}\times\sum_{i=1}^{N}P_{i}$$
where Pch = power in the considered channel Bch = assigned bandwidth of the first, second or forth adjacent channel. 

N = Number of power samples within the limits of the considered channel (assigned bandwidth Bch ). 

Step 8 
Perform the adjacent channel measurement for the first, second, third, and fourth adjacent channels on both sides of the carrier frequency (lower and upper adjacent channels). 
Step 9 
Check that the adjacent channel power on either side of the carrier for the first, second, third, and fourth adjacent channels are lower than the respective adjacent channel power requirements. 
Step 10  Repeat Steps 2 to 9 for the other two test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). Step 11  Repeat Steps 2 through 10 with the spectrum analyzer set to peak hold and 
verify that the adjacent channel power measurements satisfy the requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.7 when compensating for the increased power measurement due to peak measurement versus average measurement.  See Note 1. 

## Measurement Procedure For Beyond Fourth Adjacent Channel

Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-24. 
Step 2 
Use the notch filter to attenuate the carrier in order to increase the dynamic range of the measurement without overloading the spectrum analyzer. Measure the frequency response of the filter and take this into account when presenting noise measurement results.  
Step 3 
Use the transmission generator and key the transmitter under test with repetitive test payload in burst form. 
Step 4 
Tune the transmitter to one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 5 
Adjust the spectrum analyzer reference level to provide the maximum dynamic range for display and set the input attenuator to minimum. Ensure that no signal at the analyzer input exceeds the maximum allowable level. 
Step 6 
Record the transmitter noise level measured in each 25 kHz channel bandwidth 
in the 5th adjacent channel through the 32nd adjacent channel using the power 
band marker function of the analyzer. 
Step 7  Plot each measured adjacent channel power in dBm versus its adjacent channel 
number in linear/linear scale.  Also plot the maximum level spectrum mask on the same graph by interconnecting the points (4, -38 dBm) and (32, -53 dBm) with a straight line. 
Note 5: The two points (4, -38) and (32, -53) in Step 7 define the 5 dB per octave slope 
that limits the wideband noise between the 4th and 32nd adjacent channels as 
defined in Section 2.2.1.3.7. 
 
Step 8 
Verify that the measured adjacent channel powers between the 4th and 32nd 
adjacent channel are below the maximum level spectrum mask plotted in Step 7. 
Step 9 
Mark on the spectrum analyzer the spectrum level at the 32nd adjacent channel 
corresponding to a power level of –53 dBm in a 25 kHz band.   
Step 10 Observe the power spectrum on the scope to verify that the RF spectrum beyond 
the 32nd adjacent channel is no more than the level established in Step 9 above.  
Step 11 Repeat Steps 4 to 10 for the other test frequencies (Section 2.4.4).  See Note 1. Step 12 Verify that the wide-band noise does not exceed the limit specified in Section 
2.2.1.3.7 for all three test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 13  Repeat Steps 2 through 12 with the spectrum analyzer set to peak hold and 
verify that the adjacent channel power measurements satisfy the requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.7 when compensating for the increased power measurement due to peak measurement versus average measurement.

Using the LT generating GSIF frames or by other means, configure the EUT such that the MAC layer parameters are set to: TM1 = 10ms, TM2 = 30 sec, p = 256/256, M1 = 1. 
Step 24 
From the LT send a maximum length VDL Mode 2 frame.  At the conclusion of the transmission of the message header from the LT, and using the Controller, trigger the attenuator to produce at least 10 dB of attenuation and trigger the UT to send the data message to the EUT for transmission. 
Step 25 
Trigger the scope on the edge of the PIN diode control line.  Verify that no transmitter action occurs until the conclusion of the transmission of the VDL frame from the LT. 
Idle-to-Busy 
Step 26 
Set the PIN attenuator to the minimum attenuation and the LT to produce a signal of -98 +/- 2 dBm at the EUT. 
Step 27 
Configure the Programmable Pulse Generator to generate the waveform shown in Figure 2-29c when commanded by the Controller. 
Step 28 
Using the LT generating GSIF frames or by other means, configure the EUT such that the MAC layer parameters are set to: TM1 = 10ms, TM2 = 30 sec, p = 1/256, M1 = 2. 
Step 29 
Configure the PIN Attenuator to provide 5 dB of attenuation during the low period of the pulse waveform and switch the LT to CW mode. 
Step 30 
Configure the storage scope to trigger on the falling edge of the pulse waveform. 
Step 31 
Using the UT command the EUT to transmit data of any form. 
Step 32 
Using the Controller, trigger the Programmable Pulse Generator. 
Step 33 
After recording whether a transmission occurred, and at least 10 ms after the rising edge of the pulse waveform purge the EUT of any pending data and reset the scope. 
 
Note: The pending data can be purged either using a command from the UT or by 
momentarily making the channel idle prior to the beginning of another trial. 
 
Step 34 
Repeat Steps 31 through 33 an additional 999 times. 
Step 35 
Verify that the EUT transmitted a message for fewer than 10% of the trials. 
 

## 2.4.4.3.4 Tuning Time

Reference: Section 2.2.1.1.3 The manufacturer shall submit written evidence to demonstrate compliance with this requirement. 

## 2.4.5 Vdl Mode 2 Link Layer Test Procedures

The following test procedures are considered to be a satisfactory means of establishing compliance with the Link layer requirements of Section 2.2.2 of this document. 

## 2.4.5.1 Test Procedure Structure

ISO 9646 "Information Technology - Open Systems Interconnection - Conformance Testing Methodology and Framework" has been consulted for guidance in constructing the test procedures for verification of protocol layers above the Physical (D8PSK) level of the VDL Mode 2 protocol stack.

## 2.4.5.1.1 Overview Of Test Cases

These tests are based on the Upper Tester and Lower Tester functionality described in Sections 2.4.3.1 and Section 2.4.3.2.  The concepts of ISO 9646 were applied to provide additional structure in the test description. The following sections provide an overview of key elements of the ISO 9646 methodology. The tests have been designed to maximize the interaction and observation within the Lower Tester. 

## 2.4.5.1.2 Declarations Part

The Declaration Part outlines the test environment. Here the test equipment is defined. It also introduces the Points of Control and Observation (PCOs). These points are defined in the test setup where stimuli are injected and where the test results are observed. Wherever possible, the tests are arranged so that the PCO falls within the Lower Tester, thereby eliminating any dependence on the avionics architecture. 

## 2.4.5.1.3 Constraints Part

The Constraints Part contains the definitions of the (AVLC) frames and (ISO 8208) packets, together with parameters which are used in the test Steps; the individual fields are all defined there. 

## 2.4.5.1.4 Detailed Test Cases

Each test case is designed for the verification of a distinct function of the EUT. In order to allow the performance of individual test cases in any sequence, the test cases are designed to be independent from the previous tests; i.e., they contain all necessary Steps required to reach the test objective. Each test case therefore starts at a well-defined idle state of the EUT. In order to avoid effects on successive test cases execution, each test case must leave the EUT in the defined idle state after execution. Unless otherwise noted, the test procedures assume that both link and network assumptions use default parameters as identified in DO-224C or as identified for the equipment under test. 

## 2.4.5.1.5 Test Case Description 2.4.5.1.5.1 Procedure Description

Each test case is related to a specific requirement established in Section 2.2.  Each test will be described in tables similar to Table 2-3. 

## 2.4.5.1.5.2 Message Sequence Charts

A message sequence chart stating the events (in terms of message exchange) that shall occur between the UT and LT will be added to the procedure description in most test cases. One message is represented by a directed arrow between source and destination. Each arrow is named with the AVLC frame and further described using parameters of that AVLC frame, whenever specific parameter values are necessary for control of test operation. 

## 2.4.5.1.6 Test Cases Macros

The following named macros are defined to facilitate the test descriptions.  These macros consist of specific test actions that are done many times.  They are always referred to by name.

## 2.4.5.3.2.1 Timer Tm1 (Inter-Access Delay Timer)

Purpose: Verify that the MAC sub-layer waits TM1 between consecutive access attempts Test procedure: 

Equipment Required 
 
Desired VDL Mode 2 Source 
 
PIN diode attenuator, with 0, 5, >10 dB settings 
 
Attenuator, 30 dB/30 W 
 
Attenuator, 20 dB 
 
2 VHF circulators 
 
Storage scope 
 
50 ohm load 
 
Control unit or PC. 

 

## Measurement Procedure

Step 1 
Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-28. 
Step 2 
Configure the PIN Attenuator to provide at least 10 dB of attenuation during the low period of the pulse waveform. Configure the storage scope to trigger on the falling edge of the pulse waveform. 
Step 3 
Using the LT generating GSIF frames or by other means, configure the EUT such that the MAC layer parameters are set to: 
TM1 (Inter-access delay) = 50 ms. 

TM2 (Channel busy) = 60 seconds. p (Persistence) = 1 
M1 (Maximum no. of attempts) = 1 

Step 4 
Set the PIN attenuator to the minimum attenuation and the LT to produce a CW signal of -95 +/- 2 dBm at the EUT (Channel busy). 
Step 5 
Use the UT to load the EUT with a minimum length Mode-2 message and request transmission of the message. 
Step 6 
Use the Controller to trigger the attenuator to produce at least 10 dB of attenuation (Channel idle). 
Step 7 
Use the oscilloscope to measure the delay,    , between the trigger reference 
and the beginning of transmission of the message 
Step 8 
Repeat steps 4-7 50 times and calculate the system delay 
 
   
   
Step 9 
Using the LT generating GSIF frames or by other means, configure the EUT such that the MAC layer parameters are set to: 
TM1 (Inter-access delay) = 50 ms. TM2 (Channel busy) = 60 seconds. p (Persistence) = 1/256 M1 (Maximum no. of attempts) = 10 

Step 10 
Set the PIN attenuator to the minimum attenuation and the LT to produce a CW signal of -95 +/- 2 dBm at the EUT (Channel busy). 
Step 11 
Use the UT to load the EUT with a minimum length Mode-2 message and request transmission of the message. 
Step 12 
Use the Controller to trigger the attenuator to produce at least 10 dB of attenuation (Channel idle). 
Step 13 
Use the oscilloscope to measure the delay,    , between the trigger reference 
and the beginning of transmission of the message and calculate the message 
delay         
    
Step 14 
Repeat steps 10-13 100 times 
Step 15 
Verify that the maximal message delay is less than (M1-0.5)*TM1 and more than 95% message delays are between (M1-1.5)*TM1 and  (M1-0.5)*TM1 (Note 1) 
Note: 
For p=1/256 and M1=10, the probability that the messages are transmitted at the 
 
 
last, i.e., the 10-th, attempt is    
      . 
    
Step 16 
Using the LT generating GSIF frames or by other means, configure the EUT such that the MAC layer parameters are set to: TM1 (Inter-access delay) = 100 ms. 
Step 17 
Repeat step 10 to 15 
 
Timer TM2 (channel busy timer) 
Purpose: Verify that the link layer is notified after the expiration of the Timer TM2 (channel busy timer).

Comments:   
1. 
This test requires that the LT have direct access to the AVLC protocol.  
2. 
The verification limits of step 16 are based on the fact that the actual delay time of a p-persistance algorithm is a random variable with a geometric distribution and parameter p.  The mean value of this random variable is       
(1-p)/p times the TM1 timer, and the variance is (1-p)/p2 times the square of the TM1 timer value.  Summing and 
scaling 200 such samples, as in step 15, results in a Gaussian distribution with mean (1-p)/p times TM1 and 
variance (1-p)/(Np2) times TM12.  The acceptance criteria in step 16 assures that 99% of the tests will be 
successful.

## Measurement Procedure

Step 1 Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-28. Step 2 Using the LT generating GSIF frames or by other means, configure the EUT such 
that the MAC layer parameters are set to: TM1 (Inter-access delay) = 50 ms. TM2 (Channel busy) = 6 seconds. p (Persistence) = 256/256 M1 (Maximum no. of attempts) = 65535 
Step 3 Set the PIN attenuator to the minimum attenuation and the LT to produce a CW 
signal of -95 +/- 2 dBm at the EUT (Channel busy). 
Step 4 Use the UT to load the equipment under test with a minimum length Mode-2 
message and request transmission of the message. 
Step 5 Use the oscilloscope to verify that no message is transmitted. Step 6 Prior to the expiration of the Timer TM2, release the RF channel. 
Step 7 Use the oscilloscope to verify that the message is being transmitted.  

## 2.4.5.3.3.3 Signal Quality Parameter 2.4.5.3.3.3.1 Original Sqp

Requirement: The original SQP value shall be determined from the signal strength, *PdBm*, using the following formula: 
If ( PdBm <= -98 ), then SQP = 0. If ( -98 < PdBm < -27 ), then SQP = INT(((100+PdBm)/5)+0.5) If ( Pdm>=-27 ), then SQP = 15 
The signal strength measurement shall be accurate to ± 7 dB and be monotonic. Test Procedure: Equipment Required 

 
VHF Signal Generator 
 
External BER test fixture 
Measurement Procedure 

Step 1 Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-3 but notice that the RF combiner is 
not required for this test. Set the receiver under test into the operational mode. 
Step 2  Set the Desired VDL Source, (a VHF signal generator) to generate an input 
signal to the receiver at one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 3 Adjust the level of the signal generator to –98 dBm at the receiver input 
terminals. 
Step 4 Modulate the Desired signal with the test payload (maximum burst length of 
symbols) provided by the external BER test fixture.  
Step 5 Verify that the original SQP value is in the limits defined. Step 6 Repeat steps 3, 4 & 5 for signal power at -80dBm, -70dBm, -60dBm, -50dBm, -
40dBm, -30dBm, and -27dBm, respectively. 
Step 7 Repeat Steps 2 to 6 at the two remaining test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 

## 2.4.5.3.3.3.2 Supplement 4 Sqp (Optional)

 Requirement: When the VDR supports ARINC Characteristic 750 VHF Data Radio supplement 4, in addition to the original SQP, a second SQP value, i.e., supplement 4 SQP, shall be calculated using the following table: 

|   Supplement 4 SQP Value  | Power Range (dBm)    |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
|                        0  | <-98                 |

The signal strength measurement shall be accurate to + 7 dB and be monotonic. Test procedure: Equipment Required 
 
VHF Signal Generator 
 
External BER test fixture 
Measurement Procedure Step 1 Connect the equipment as shown in Figure 2-3 but notice that the RF combiner is 
not required for this test. Set the receiver under test into the operational mode. 
Step 2  Set the Desired VDL Source, (a VHF signal generator) to generate an input 
signal to the receiver at one of the test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 
Step 3 Adjust the level of the signal generator to –99 dBm at the receiver input 
terminals. 
Step 4 Modulate the Desired signal with the test payload (maximum burst length of 
symbols) provided by the external BER test fixture.  
Step 5 Verify that the supplement 4 SQP value is in the limits defined. 
Step 6 Repeat steps 3, 4 & 5 for signal power at -97.5dBm, -96.5dBm, -95.5dBm, -
94.5dBm, -93.5dBm, -92.5dBm, -91dBm, -89dBm, -87dBm, -85dBm, -83dBm, - 81dBm, -77dBm, -71dBm, and -67dBm, respectively. 
Step 7 Repeat Steps 2 to 6 at the two remaining test frequencies (Section 2.4.4). 

## 2.4.5.4 Data Link Service Sublayer

The DLS sublayer requirements of DO-224B consist of a series of data structures and a series of processing actions or services.  The data structures are not, in general, observable in a "black box" test of Class X equipment.  For Class Y and Class Z equipment, the structures are observable via a Data/Management interface satisfying the functional requirements of Appendix D. For Class X equipment, the service capabilities of the DLS sublayer are indirectly demonstrated during the Network Layer testing of Section 2.4.6.  For Class Y and Class Z equipment, the following test procedures are stated in terms of the AVLC data frames and contents to facilitate verification via the Data/Management Interface. For all classes of equipment, specific AVLC frame formats are assumed to be developed and maintained as part of the embedded software.  Results from Software Verification activities in accordance with DO-178B demonstrating the proper implementation of these structures provide sufficient verification that some requirements have been satisfied, as detailed below.  If the AVLC structures are implemented and maintained in hardware, the equivalent information from verification in accordance with DO-254 is acceptable. This document assumes that most DLS sublayer functionality exists in Class X or Class Z equipment. 

Unless otherwise stated, all DLS Sublayer tests are to be performed with the LT providing the default test signal level defined in Section 2.4.1.7.

Comments:  
1. 
The Timer T1 formula should be verified during the DO-178B design review process. 
2. 
This test requires the UT and LT to directly access the AVLC protocol. 
3. 
For Class Y equipment, UT control and observation point may be at the Data/Management Interface.   
4. 
For Class Z equipment, LT control and observation point may be at the Data/Management Interface. 
 
Note 2: Channel Utilization due to GSIFs and INFO frames is supposed to be very low.  
Minimum values are calculated with a utilization of 0%, maximum value with a utilization of 10%. Default values for T1 min, T1 max, T1 mult, T1 exp, M1 and TM1 have been used for the determination of the values in the Table 2-4. 

| Parameter    |   Value per SARPS  |
|--------------|--------------------|
| T1 min       |               1    |
| T1 max       |              15    |

| TM1          |               4.5  |

 
Note 3:  
Nevertheless because the transmission delay between MAC layer and the AVLC (e.g. over the link between ATSU/CMU and VDR) has not been taken into account, one second should be added to the values in the Table 2-5 below based on the estimation provided in ARINC Specification 631.

## Message Sequence Chart 2.4.5.4.8 Broadcast

Note: VDL Mode 2 avionics do not generate broadcast messages.  The Broadcast requirement of DO-224C, Section 3.2.2.4.9 specifies limitations on the valid types of broadcast messages that are allowable in the VDL Mode 2 system.   

## 2.4.5.4.9 Information Transfer Procedure

## 2.4.5.4.9.1 Transmit Queue Management 2.4.5.4.9.1.1 Eliminate Redundant Frames Procedure

Test Case Name: Eliminate Redundant Frames Purpose: Verify that at most one RR, SREJ, DM, or retransmitted INFO frame is queued. Reference: DO-224C, 3.2.2.4.10.1.1 Comments: This requirement deals with internal queue management, which is difficult to directly observe from external PCO. Therefore, this requirement may be verified as part of DO-178B software verification process. 

## 2.4.5.4.9.1.2 Procedures For Transmission Procedure

Note: The structure of this test is as follows.  A large amount of data is created at both the ground and air interfaces.  At the ground interface, an erroneous frame is inserted in the data stream.  Neither ground nor airborne data can be sent, because the channel is occupied by CW.  When the channel is released, data exchange begins.  When the EUT detects the erroneous frame, it responds with a FRMR, which is a supervisory frame.  This supervisory frame is given priority, and inserted in the stream of downlink INFO frames. 

 

Test Case Name: Procedures for Transmission Purpose: Verify supervisory frames have higher priority than the information frames. Configuration: 1 Reference: DO-224C, 3.2.2.4.10.1.2 Context

Comments:  
1. 
This test assumes that the LT has direct access to the AVLC protocol. 
2. 
This test should be performed after the tests of Section 2.4.5.4.3.  The combination of 2.4.5.4.3 and Steps 1 and 2 show that the EUT can support modification of the link parameters. 
3. 
If the EUT supports only a limited range of values for any parameter, Steps 1 and 4 may be modified with the appropriate lower and upper limits of that range.

Comment:  
1. 
This test requires the UT and LT to directly access the AVLC protocol. 
 
Test Case Name: Aircraft Initiated Hand-off Procedure (h) Purpose: Verify that when the aircraft LME receives an Autotune parameter on the CSC, and all subsequent downlink XID_CMD_HO frames on the autotuned frequency are lost, the aircraft LME continues to attempt to send the XID_CMD_HO frames using normal re-transmission procedures, and eventually reverts to the CSC and performs a successful link establishment.

This test requires the UT and LT to directly access the AVLC protocol. 
 

Test Case Name: Aircraft Initiated Hand-off Procedure (i) Purpose: Verify that following loss of communications on the current frequency while the aircraft is airborne, and no 
FSL is present, the aircraft reverts to the CSC and selects a station to which to perform a link establishment.

Comments 1. This test requires the LT to directly access its AVLC protocol.. 2. For Class Z equipment, the AVLC frames and content may be generated at the Data/Management Interface. 3. This test does not imply any relationship between an SQP of 10 and a signal level 20 dB above sensitivity or an SQP of 8 and a signal level of 15 dB above sensitivity.  The only intent is to have representative signal levels throughout the test.

## Procedure (B) For Avionics That Supports Air Initiated Handoff, But Not Ground Requested Broadcast Handoff.

Note: This combination of capabilities is less desirable than support for Ground Requested Broadcast Handoff because it requires additional channel loading to explicitly support the handoff.

Comments 1. This test requires the LT to directly access its AVLC protocol.. 2. For Class Z equipment, the AVLC frames and content may be generated at the Data/Management Interface. 3. This test does not imply any relationship between an SQP of 10 and a signal level 20 dB above sensitivity or an SQP of 8 and a signal level of 15 dB above sensitivity.  The only intent is to have representative signal levels throughout the test.

x can be either 2 or 3 in the test case. After repeating this test for 20 times, the frequencies in FSL should be selected with approximately equal number of times. The detailed randomness of frequency selection should be verified as part of the DO-178(B) software verification process.   
 

Test Case Name: Ground-Based Frequency Support List (q) Purpose: Verify that following a transition from air to ground, after performing a handoff to a Frequency/GS from a 
Ground FSL parameter, which is received in a GSIF from a non-CSC frequency, and then receiving an uplink DISC 
frame while TG5 is still running, if no further Frequency/GS pair is available in the Ground FSL, the aircraft LME reverts to the CSC and performs a successful link establishment. Configuration: 4 Reference : DO-224C, 3.2.2.5.4.12 through 3.2.2.5.4.12.2 Context

Test Case Name: Ground-Based Frequency Support List (r) Purpose: Verify that following a transition from ground to air, after performing a handoff to a Frequency/GS from an Air-FSL, and then receiving an uplink DISC frame while TG5 is still running, if no further Frequency/GS pair is available in the Air-FSL, the aircraft LME reverts to the CSC and performs a successful link establishment.

Comments 
1. 
This test requires the UT and LT to directly access the AVLC protocol. 
2. 
For Class Z equipment, LT control and observation point may be at the Data/Management Interface. 
3. 
x can be either 3 or 4 in the test case. After repeating this test for 20 times, the ground stations in FSL should be selected with approximately equal number of times. The detailed randomness of frequency selection should be verified as part of the DO-178(B) software verification process.   
 

Test Case Name: Ground-Based Frequency Support List (s) Purpose: : Verify that when the aircraft LME fails to handoff to a Frequency/GS pair selected from an Air-FSL, it will 
select another Frequency/GS pair from the FSL and perform a successful handoff to the selected GS.

Comments: 
1) 
If X.121 addressing is used in the air ground router configuration, at the UT, verify that the Called Line Address Notification Facility was used to inform the aircraft of X.121 ground DTE address (this is in the exchange of the CALL REQUEST and CALL ACCEPTED packets). 
2) 
If VSDA addressing is used in the air ground router configuration, at the UT, verify that the Called Address Extention Facility was used to inform the aircraft of the VSDA ground DTE address (this is in the exchange of the CALL REQUEST and CALL ACCEPTED packets).

| If X.121 addressing is used in the air ground router configuration, at the UT, verify that the Called Line |           |         |                                 |
| Address Notification Facility was used to inform the aircraft of X.121 ground DTE address (this is in the  |           |         |                                 |
| exchange of the CALL REQUEST and CALL ACCEPTED packets).                                                   |           |         |                                 |

3) 
If VSDA addressing is used in the air ground router configuration, at the UT, verify that the Called Address Extention Facility was used to inform the aircraft of the VSDA ground DTE address (this is in the exchange of the CALL REQUEST and CALL ACCEPTED packets). 
 
 
Equipment under test shall comply with either procedure (c) or (d). 

 
Note: Subnetwork connection maintenance should also be verified after a handoff across frequencies, as depicted in test procedures in Sections 2.4.5.5.4.1, 2.4.5.5.4.9, 2.4.5.5.4.11, and 2.4.5.5.4.13.

Comments: 
1) 
The Fast Select facility allows the CALL REQUEST and CALL ACCEPTED user data fields to be expanded to 128 octets as opposed to their respective default values of 16 octets. 

2) 
If X.121 addressing is used in the air ground router configuration, at the UT, verify that the Called Line Address Notification Facility was used to inform the aircraft of X.121 ground DTE address (this is in the exchange of the CALL REQUEST and CALL ACCEPTED packets). 
3) 
If VSDA addressing is used in the air ground router configuration, at the UT, verify that the Called Address Extention Facility was used to inform the aircraft of the VSDA ground DTE address (this is in the exchange of the CALL REQUEST and CALL ACCEPTED packets).

## 3.2.1 Dynamic Response

Operation of the equipment shall not be adversely affected by aircraft ground operations, maneuvering, or changes in attitude encountered in normal flight operations. 

## 3.2.2 Interference Effects

The equipment shall not be the source of harmful conducted or radiated interference and shall not be adversely affected by conducted or radiated interference from other equipment or systems installed in the aircraft. 

Notes:   
 
1. 
Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) problems noted after installation of this equipment may result from such factors as design characteristics of previously installed systems or equipment and the physical installation itself.  It is not intended that the equipment manufacturer necessarily design for all installation environments.  The installing facility will be responsible for resolving any incompatibility between this equipment and previously installed equipment in the aircraft.  The various factors contributing to the incompatibility must be considered. 
 
2. 
The FCC requirement in CFR 47, of –40 dBc for aircraft spurious emissions, may not protect GNSS (including GPS) navigation receivers nor Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service (AMSS) communication receivers from harmful interference because additional attenuation is required.  Of particular concern to 
GNSS are VHF 12th and 13th harmonics (especially at 121.150, 121.175, 121.2, 
131.2, 131.25, and 131.3 MHz).  Of particular concern to AMS(R)S are the VHF 
12th and 13th harmonics (for AMS(R)S systems operating in the band 1525 - 1559 
MHz, especially at 118.0 - 119.9 MHz and at 127.1 - 129.9 MHz; and for AMS(R)S systems operating in the band 1610 - 1626.5 MHz, especially at 121.1 - 
123.85 MHz and 134.15 - 135.55 MHz).   
 
3.    
Spurious emissions from the VHF antenna or a VHF box can be a problem. Additional filtering and shielding may be required to protect navigation receivers on an aircraft.  Intersystem EMC issues are beyond the scope of this document. However, if simultaneous operation is required, the methodology stated in the following equation, if applicable, may be used to determine the harmonic levels that would be acceptable for a given set of conditions.  The conditions that 
correlate with a particular manufacturer's transmitter design should be specified 
in the installation information for the transmitter if the manufacturer intends for the transmitter to be used on aircraft that would include such receiving systems. 
Transmitter Harmonic Level  =  Sensitivity of Receiving System  
+ Receiver Interference to Desired Signal Level  

  
- Safety Margin - Aggregate Effect Margin + Antenna Isolation + Harmonic Filter Attenuation (if used)  
 

Examples for GNSS and AMSS: The levels listed in Table 3-1 are not specifications but are 
simply the result of the listed receiver and installation parameters, which vary with specific 
receivers and installations. 
 

## 3.3 Conditions Of Test

Conditions stated in the following subparagraphs are applicable to the equipment tests specified in paragraph 3.4. 

## 3.3.1 Power Input

Unless otherwise specified, tests shall be conducted with the equipment powered by the aircraft's electrical power generating system. 

## 3.3.2 Associated Equipment Or Systems

Unless otherwise specified, all electrically operated equipment and systems on the aircraft shall be operational before conducting interference tests. 

## 3.3.3 Environment

During the tests, the equipment shall not be subject to environmental conditions that exceed those specified by the manufacturer.

Item Notes: Items 2, 6, 9, 10, 14 and 15 are installation dependent. 

1. GNSS (1559-1610 MHz); AMSS (1525-1559 MHz). 2. Susceptibility = Sensitivity (dBm) + Interference to Signal ratio (I/S) (dB).  As of 2001, most GA GPS 

receivers permit I/S of +20 dB.  GPS Sensitivity from RTCA DO-208, Section 2.2.3.1; GPS I/S from RTCA DO-208, Section 2.2.3.2, Continuous Wave.  SATCOM susceptibility from RTCA DO-210D, Change 1, Section 2.1.9. 

3. Safety Margin per RTCA DO-235. 4. Calculated as Item 2 (dBm) - Item 3 (dB). 5. Item maintained for compatibility with other analyses, no effect on VDL. 6. Assume that there are multiple systems contributing to GPS interference.  This value may be 0 or 3 to 10 
dB depending on installation and is computed as 10 * Log(Number of Interferers). 
7. Item maintained for compatibility with other analyses, assume only single VDR transmitting on the 
same aircraft. 
8. Calculated as Item 4 (dBm) + Item 5 (dB) - Item 6 (dB) + Item 7 (dB) 9. Item maintained for compatibility with other analyses.  For this analysis, the antenna gain is assumed to 
be included in Item 10. 
10. Isolation from TX antenna port to RX antenna port, taken as free-space loss at a distance of 1 meter, 
with no consideration of antenna gain, antenna pattern or cable loss. 
11. Calculated as Item 8 (dBm) + Item 10 (dB). 12. Assume 15 W (41.8 dBm) VDL transmitter with no cable loss. 13. VDL harmonic output level per Section 2.2.1.3.6.  For AMSS, it is assumed that the steps taken to 
reduce 12th and 13th order harmonic levels for GNSS result in the same reduction for adjacent AMSS 
frequencies.   
14. Better VDL Harmonic performance will result in lower necessary filter rejection.  Calculated as Item 13 
(dBm) - Item 11 (dBm). 
15. Total Harmonic Level allowed at input to transmit antenna, relative to carrier power.  Calculated as Item 
11 (dBm) - Item 12 (dBm).

## 3.4 Test Procedures For Installed Equipment Performance

The following test procedures are considered satisfactory for determining required equipment performance when the equipment is installed in an aircraft.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the installing activity.  These alternate procedures may be used if the installing activity can show that they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures.  The equipment shall be tested to demonstrate compliance with the minimum requirements stated in Section 2.2..  In order to meet this requirement, test results provided by the equipment manufacturer as proof of conformity may be accepted in lieu of bench tests performed by the installing activity. 

## 3.4.1 Conformity Inspection

Visually inspect the installed equipment to determine the use of acceptable workmanship and engineering practices.  Verify that all mechanical and electrical connections have been made properly and the equipment has been located and installed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. 

## 3.4.2 Equipment Function

Vary all controls of the equipment through each function to determine that the equipment is operating according to the manufacturer's instructions and that each control performs its intended function. 

## 3.4.3 Equipment Accessibility

Determine that all equipment controls are readily accessible and that displayed data is easily interpreted. 

## 3.4.4 Interference Effects

With the equipment energized, individually operate each other electrically operated equipment and systems on the aircraft to determine that no significant conducted or radiated interference exists.  Evaluate all reasonable combinations of control settings and operating modes.  Operate communications and navigation equipment on at least the low, high, and one mid-band frequencies.  Make note of systems or modes of operation that should also be evaluated during flight.  If appropriate, repeat tests using emergency power with the aircraft's batteries alone and the inverters operating. 

Note:  The procedure may be adequate in consideration of the note in Paragraph 3.2.2. 

## 3.4.5 Power Supply Fluctuations

Under normal aircraft conditions, cycle the aircraft engine(s) through all normal power settings and verify proper operation of the equipment as specified by the equipment manufacturer. 

## 3.4.6 Reception

## 4.1.5 System Operational Indication

Communication failure of degradation below minimum acceptable performance shall be readily discernible. 

## 4.1.6 Equipment Operating Limitations

Equipment operating limitations of the aircraft station should be contained in the aircraft flight manual. 

## 4.2 Test Procedures For Operational Performance Requirements

Operation equipment tests may be conducted as part of normal pre-flight tests.  For those tests that can be run only in flight, procedures should be developed to perform these tests as early during the flight as possible to verify that the equipment is performing its intended function(s). 

## 4.2.1 Power Input

With the aircraft's electrical power generating system operating, energize the equipment and verify that electrical power is available to the equipment. 

## 4.2.2 Communications Displays

With the equipment operating, verify that the required display(s) are operational. 

## 4.2.3 Communications Controls

The communications control(s) shall be operated, as required, to verify satisfactory equipment response. 

## 4.2.4 Functional Operating Tests

Verify that the equipment performs its intended function(s) for each of the operating modes available to the operator and from available ground facilities. 

Using the associated data link message entry and retrieval equipment, send a test message that will elicit a response.  Check for the timeliness of the reply message, that the reply message is appropriate to the transmitted test message, and that the reply message has no apparent errors.

## Appendix B: Requirements Cross Reference Matrices - Verification Testing And Equipment Architecture Class (Normative)



Table B-1 contains the MOPS environmental condition requirements cross reference to verification testing and equipment architecture classes. Table B-2 contains the MOPS standard condition requirements cross reference to verification testing and equipment architecture classes.  For the purpose of this partitioning, this table assumes that the division of requirements between Class Y, Class W and Class Z equipment is as defined in this document.  In the Tables, X indicates that this paragraph should be considered or the specified test(s) should be performed to qualify the indicated class of equipment as MOPS-compliant.  An O indicates that the requirement and test case is Optional.  A blank entry indicates that, for the assumed division of requirements, the tests of the indicated paragraph need not be performed to qualify the indicated class of equipment as MOPS-compliant.  A C, used for Class V and Class W, indicates that a manufacturer desiring to qualify equipment as MOPS-compliant must customize the tests for the non-ISO-8208 subnetwork protocols specified in Section 2.2.5.  Class V and Class W equipment does not include the ISO 8208 SNAcP sublayer requirements defined in section 2.2.3 and 2.2.4.  Hence, a manufacturer of Class V and Class W equipment that desires to qualify equipment as MOPS compliant must provide equivalent documentation of SNAcP sublayer requirements and verification tests to that of RTCA DO-224C and this MOPS. Manufacturers desiring to implement a division of requirements different than that assumed in this Appendix will adjust a small number of requirements in the DLS functionality between Class Y and Class Z (or W) equipment. This appendix is deemed to be a normative appendix as it identifies the partitioning of requirements among the basic equipment classes. The details of such requirements are contained in Section 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 of the MOPS.

## Appendix C: Analysis Of Ber Vs. Block Failure Rate C.1 Overview

The VDL Mode 2 compliant transceivers are required to perform VDL Mode 2 data modulation and demodulation as described in the VDL MASPS DO-224C [1]. The VDL MASPS shows the message encoding process. As shown in that document, a transmission consists of from one to several concatenated AVLC frames, each with its own CRC. Zero-bit insertion is performed on the concatenated frames. Reed-Solomon encoding is performed on the data and it is interleaved and bit scrambled prior to I/Q modulation and transmission. When the data is received the reverse of this process is performed. The demodulated data is unscrambled and de-interleaved. Reed-Solomon error correction is performed and zero-bit removal is performed on the resultant data. The data is then searched for flag characters indicating the AVLC frame boundaries. An ARINC 750 [2] compliant radio will then perform CRC validation on each frame prior to sending that frame to the attached Communications Management Unit (CMU) through which air-ground communications take place. There are several locations in the above demodulation and decoding process at which errors can prevent the eventual transfer of the frame to the CMU. If the CRC fails, then a frame will be prevented from being sent to the CMU. If the Reed-Solomon error correction fails then it may introduce uncorrected errors and the CRC will fail. If the length is determined incorrectly (during demodulation), then errors may be introduced and the CRC will fail. If bit errors result in flag characters being erroneously inserted in the data then the frame search for one or more frames will occur incorrectly and the CRC(s) will fail. The MOPS offers the equipment manufacturer the option of testing the receiver performance by means of BER or Frame Error Rate (FER).    The BER is tested by means of a BER test mode.  Since the BER test mode is not an operational mode, there may be residual questions concerning software verification activity based on this mode and its applicability to the operational Mode 2 software. The following section will show how an upper bound on the uncorrected BER can be determined by measuring the AVLC message transfer failure rate. An AVLC message transfer will fail whenever one of the above failures causes a CRC failure or otherwise prevents a message containing one AVLC frame from being delivered to the CMU. The message will consist of exactly one Reed-Solomon block. An upper bound on the uncorrected BER can be determined without enabling a special mode in the transceiver that disables error correction or detection. Reference [3] shows the performance of the RS(255,249) code as it relates to BER in VDL Mode 2. This is summarized below. 

## C.2 Analysis C.2.1 Bit Error Rate

An approximate relationship between uncorrected BER and Eb/N0 for D8PSK is expressed as follows: 

$$B E R=\mathrm{erfc}\left(\sin\!\left({\frac{\pi}{8}}\right)\!\times\!{\sqrt{\frac{3E_{b}}{2N_{0}}}}\right),$$

information bit to the noise power spectral density. 

## C.2.2 Frame Error Rate

Given an uncorrected BER, the probability of decoding and correcting a RS(255,249) 
block can be determined. Let pb equal the probability of a single bit error. The probability that a bit is received correctly then is *1 - p*b and the probability that a RS code word is received correctly is the probability that all eight bits in the code word are received without error, 

$$p_{\mathit{c o r r e c t_{-}w o r d}}=(1-p_{b})^{8}$$
and the probability that a RS code word is received in error is 1 minus the probability it was received correctly: 

$$P_{e r r o r_{-}w o r d}=1-p_{c o r r e c t_{-}w o r d}=1-\left(1-p_{b}\right)^{8}$$
The Block Failure Rate (BFR) can be defined in terms of the block success rate.  Success is defined as receiving a block with three or fewer code word errors (since the RS(255,249) code can correct three code words). The probability of receiving a block successfully then is the summation of the probabilities of receiving a block with 0, 1, 2, or 3, code word errors. With n = 255 and m = 0, 1, 2, or 3 errors and a three error correction capability, the probability of a block success then is 

$$P_{s u c c e s_{-}b l o c k}=\sum_{m=0}^{3}\;\binom{n}{m}\Big(P_{e r o r_{-}w o r d}\Big)^{m}\Big(P_{c o r r e c t_{-}w o r d}\Big)^{n-m}$$
and the probability of a block failure is 1 minus the probability of success: 

$$B F R=1-p_{s u c c e s x_{-}b l o c k}\,.$$
In computing the BFR, that is, the probability that an accepted block of VDL Mode 2 data will contain undetected errors, this analysis ignores the effects of acquiring and decoding the block header.  That is, this analysis assumes that there the decoding of the header information is error-free.  But in real operation, some number of header errors will occur, thereby causing the block processing to terminate.  This will have the effect of eliminating some percentage of the block errors that would otherwise be accepted. Because the frame includes both the header and the payload block, the Frame Error Rate (FER), therefore, is upper bounded by the BFR.  That is, FER
BFR

in all cases. 

## C.2.3 Ber Vs Fer

A plot and tabulated listing of BFR versus FER are shown in Figure C-1 and Table C-1. This evidence indicates, it is possible to indirectly determine the BER performance by determining the FER performance. 

## C.2.4 Testing Fer In An Arinc 750 Compliant Vdr

An ARINC 750 compliant VDR will pass demodulated and decoded Mode 2 AVLC frames to the CMU only if the CRC calculation for that frame indicates that the frame was received without error. Each frame is then sent over an ARINC 429 high-speed communication interface to the CMU in a single UNITDATA.request message as part of the CMU to VDR ASIP (ARINC 750 Attachment 10). Since a single received transmission can contain multiple frames, one received transmission can result in many AVLC frames (in UNITDATA.request messages) being sent to the CMU by the VDR. There are several causes that will prevent an AVLC frame from being sent to the CMU.

## 

The demodulator fails to achieve synchronization with the unique word portion of the incoming reception. This will cause all AVLC frames contained in that message to not be sent to the CMU. The demodulator detects an error in the header portion of the incoming reception, indicating an incorrectly decoded message length component. This will result in all AVLC frames contained in that message to not be sent to the CMU. The demodulator *fails* to detect an error in the header portion of the incoming reception. Depending on the decoded length, this may result in none, some, or all of the AVLC frames contained in that message to not be sent to the CMU. The Reed-Solomon error correction fails because the number of code words in error in a block exceeds the correction capability of the code. This will result in one or more AVLC frames contained in that message to not be sent to the CMU due to CRC failure. 

Due to the multiple reasons that some or all of the AVLC frames may not be sent to the CMU as the result of bit errors, FER can not be determined generally by comparing the number of AVLC frames sent by the VDR to the CMU with the number uplinked in the transmission received by the VDR. It is possible however to measure the FER by restricting the data sent in a transmission to a particular format: The transmission must contain one AVLC frame. The transmission length must be such that in fills one Reed-Solomon block, that is 255 bytes including check symbols. If the transmitted data meets these restrictions then AVLC frames that fail the CRC check will fail due to either Reed-Solomon block failure, header failure, or unique word failure. All of these errors will combine to prevent the AVLC frame from being sent to the CMU. However, the combined error rate so determined will be an upper bound on the FER. An upper bound on the BER can then be determined by comparing the FER to the data in Figure C-1 and Table C-1 shown above. 

## C.3 Testing Considerations C.3.1 Example Block Failure Message

The primary constraint for a message used for FER testing is that its length as encoded in the header be exactly 1992 bits in length. This value indicates the total number of data bits following the header FEC and excludes bits included for addition of Reed-Solomon check symbols. In order that this message will be passed to the CMU it must also conform to a standard AVLC frame format shown in DO-224C [1].  A partial representation of this format is shown below. 


| Octet Number    | Content                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| 1               | Flag                         |

| 5               | Destination address octet 4  |
| 6               | Source address octet 1       |
| 7               | Source address octet 2       |
| 8               | Source address octet 3       |
| 9               | Source address octet 4       |
| 10              | Link control field           |
| 11              | Information field octet 1    |
| 12              | Information field octet 2    |
| .               | .                            |
| .               | .                            |
| N-3             | Information field octet N-13 |
| N-2             | CRC MSB                      |
| N-1             | CRC LSB                      |
| N               | Flag                         |

 Prior to transmission, the message formatted as above will have zero-bit insertion performed on the data located between the flags (octets 2 through N-1). Depending on the data, this *may* make the file larger and cause the data length to be an non-integer number of octets. Reed-Solomon check symbols are added after zero-bit insertion which will increase the size of the message by 48 bits (for a full row of 249 octets of data). The CRC value is calculated on the data in the Table C-2 that extends from octets 2 through N-3 and is appended in octets N-2 and N-1. Zero-bit insertion is performed on octets 2 through N-1 and the resultant data is bounded by flag characters (0x7E) prior to Reed-Solomon encoding. Even though the data prior to CRC calculation contains no consecutive strings of "ones" that would cause zero-bit insertion to increase the data length, the CRC itself may have such a string of ones. Therefore the creation of the message is an iterative process: 

1. 
Create the address, link control and information data to be 245 octets in length. 
2. 
Calculate and append the CRC (adds 2 octets). 
3. 
Zero-bit insert and bound the data with flag characters (adds 2 octets). 
4. 
If length is greater than 249 then modify data and go to step 2. 
5. 
Append Reed-Solomon Check symbols (adds 6 octets).

The message starts with the flag character (0x7E), is followed by the address and link control fields (9 octets, ASCII "UUUUUUUUU"). These are followed by the information field, the ASCII sequence:

012345678901234567890123<CR><LF> 

This is followed by the two CRC bytes (0x43, 0x73) the flag character (0x7E), and the 
six Reed-Solomon check symbols (0x1F, 0x29, 0xA4, 0x7A, 0x34, 0xDB). This message 
will be scrambled and will have the sync and header sequences prepended prior to 
transmission. 

## C.3.2 Crc Failure Probability

The method shown here for evaluating the FER relies upon a CRC calculation upon the content of each AVLC frame to successfully determine whether a block failure has occurred. Consequently, the probability of  successfully determining a block failure is dependent upon the probability of success inherent in the16-bit CRC. The 16-bit polynomial specified for the AVLC frame check sequence can detect [4]: 

 
all single and double errors, 
 
all errors with an odd number of bits, 
 
all burst errors of length 16 or less, 
 
99.997% of 17-bit error bursts, 
 
and 99.998% of 18-bit and longer bursts. 
Out of all the above listed, the worse case probability of success for the CRC is 0.99997. The CRC then will successfully reject 0.99997 of all frames whose errors could not be corrected by the Reed-Solomon error correction. That is, the FER determined by allowing the CRC to detect bad blocks will be 0.99997 of the actual FER. For example, if the actual FER is 0.157 then the FER determined by using the CRC to detect bad frames will be

. It makes the radio appear to be marginally better than it actually is. 

There are reasons this can be considered an inconsequential error: The CRC success rate used was a pathological case and the CRC probability of success on random data is better than this. The difference between the actual and the CRC determined FER, at a FER corresponding to the system BER, is small enough to be considered within the margin of measurement error. In any event, If this is considered too large a value then frames passed by the CRC routine can be compared to a priori known frame content to determine the true FER.

## Appendix D: Assumed Functional Capabilities Of The Data/Management Interface D.1 Data/Management Interface

Class Y and Class Z equipment provides a Data/Management interface for the purpose of exchanging data and control information between the lower VDL Mode 2 protocol stack and the upper VDL Mode 2 protocol stack.  The Data/Management interface has the functionality specified in the following subsections.  When a non-ISO-8208 interface is defined in accordance with Section 2.2.5, Class W VDL Mode 2 transceiver equipment includes a Data/Management interface meeting the same functional requirements as Class Z equipment. For the purpose of establishing requirements, the Data/Management interface is viewed as supporting either Class Y functions or Class Z functions.  For non-ATN implementations, the Class W is equivalent to Class Z. 

Note: A widely accepted means for complying with the Data/Management interface 
requirements for Class Y, Class Z, and Class W equipment is ASIP, defined in Attachment 10 to ARINC Characteristic 750.
