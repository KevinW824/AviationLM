With the instrument on a north heading and the magnetic compensator adjusted for minimum effect, the scale error with the compensator shall not differ from the scale error without the compensator by more than 2 degrees. The test shall be repeated with the instrument on an east heading.

4.4
Turn Error:
Two minutes after resumption of straight and level flight the scale error resulting from a coordinated turn of 180 degrees in 1 minute at a true airspeed of 180 miles per hour (289 km/h) shall be within 2 degrees. The error shall have been obtained from a turn which was begun from an easterly heading.

Set the magnetic heading sensor to an east heading and allow the system to operate for 2 minutes. The resultant heading shall duplicate the initial synchronized reading within 2 degrees.

4.5
Heeling:
When the gyroscope is tilted 10 degrees about the roll or pitch axis and rotated 360 degrees in azimuth in 30-degree increments, the indicated headings shall not differ from the indicated headings with the gyroscope in its normal level position by more than 4 degrees. The instrument shall remain at each heading for 5 minutes before reading.
