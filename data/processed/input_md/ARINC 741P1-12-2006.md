## Foreword Aeronautical Radio, Inc., The Aeec, And Arinc Standards

Aeronautical Radio, Inc. (ARINC) was incorporated in 1929 by four fledgling airlines in the United States as a privately-owned company dedicated to serving the communications needs of the air transport industry.  Today, the major U.S. airlines remain the Company's principal shareholders.  Other shareholders include a number of non-U.S. airlines and other aircraft operators. ARINC sponsors aviation industry committees and participates in related industry activities that benefit aviation at large by providing technical leadership and guidance and frequency management. These activities directly support airline goals: promote safety, efficiency, regularity, and cost-effectiveness in aircraft operations. The Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) is an international body of airline technical professionals that leads the development of technical standards for airborne electronic equipment-including avionics and in-flight entertainment equipment-used in commercial, military, and business aviation. The AEEC establishes consensus-based, voluntary form, fit, function, and interface standards that are published by ARINC and are known as ARINC Standards. The use of ARINC Standards results in substantial benefits to airlines by allowing avionics interchangeability and commonality and reducing avionics cost by promoting competition. There are three classes of ARINC Standards: 

a) ARINC Characteristics - Define the form, fit, function, and interfaces of avionics and 
other airline electronic equipment. ARINC Characteristics indicate to prospective manufacturers of airline electronic equipment the considered and coordinated 
opinion of the airline technical community concerning the requisites of new equipment including standardized physical and electrical characteristics to foster interchangeability and competition.   
b) ARINC Specifications - Are principally used to define either the physical packaging 
or mounting of avionics equipment, data communication standards, or a high-level computer language.  
c) ARINC Reports - Provide guidelines or general information found by the airlines to 
be good practices, often related to avionics maintenance and support.  
The release of an ARINC Standard does not obligate any airline or ARINC to purchase equipment so described, nor does it establish or indicate recognition or the existence of an operational requirement for such equipment, nor does it constitute endorsement of any manufacturer's product designed or built to meet the ARINC Standard. In order to facilitate the continuous product improvement of this ARINC Standard, two items are included in the back of this volume: An Errata Report solicits any corrections to the text or diagrams in this ARINC Standard. An ARINC IA Project Initiation/Modification (APIM) form solicits any recommendations for addition of substantive material to this volume which would be the subject of a new Supplement. 

## 1.0 Introduction And Description 1.1 Purpose Of This Characteristic

This document, Part 1, sets forth the desired characteristics of the Aviation Satellite Communications (SATCOM) System avionics intended for installation in all types of commercial transport and business aircraft. The intent of this document is to provide general and specific guidance on the form factor and pin assignments for the installation of the avionics primarily for airline use.  Part 2 describes the desired operational capability of the equipment as configured with the Satellite Data Unit (SDU) to provide data and voice communications, as well as additional standards necessary to ensure interchangeability.   

## 1.2 Relationship Of This Document To Arinc Characteristics 597, 724, 724B, And 758

The Aviation Satellite Communications (SATCOM) System will present standard interfaces to a number of other aircraft systems.  These include ACARS, multi-purpose control and display units (MCDU), Communication Management Units (CMU) (ultimately to be shared with Mode S and VHF Data Links) and passenger telephone coder/encoder and CCS units. Details of the interfaces may be found in Part 2 of this Characteristic, and in **ARINC Characteristic 746**:  Cabin Communications System (CCS). 

ARINC Characteristic 597: Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), describes ARINC 404A-packaged airborne ACARS equipment against the background of a fairly detailed system description.  ARINC Characteristics 724 and 724B describe ARINC 600-packaged equipment intended to perform essentially the same functions as the ARINC 597 equipment in the same framework.  ARINC 724/724B equipment will more readily interface with other ARINC "700-Series" equipment on those aircraft on which such equipment is employed.  ARINC Characteristic 758 defines the third generation of datalink management unit.  Its initial implementation will perform the same functions as the ARINC 724B ACARS MU.  The ARINC 758 CMU Mark 2 contains provisions to evolve into an ATN compatible router. However, all versions of ACARS avionics should interface with the Aviation Satellite Communications system avionics by means of ARINC 429 data buses. 

## Commentary

The ARINC 741 Aviation Satellite Communications System avionics design envisages the availability of ACARS avionics on the aircraft to effect certain data collection and distribution functions.  Those operators who do not utilize ACARS may employ an appropriately equipped MCDU to perform these functions or a specially designed substitute unit.  In practical terms, their most economical solution to the problem may be the use of a "stripped down" ACARS unit. 

## 1.3 Function Of Equipment

The function of this equipment is the transmission, reception and processing of signals via a satellite providing aeronautical services in the L-band (1525-1660.5 MHz).  The system should provide a capability for all aeronautical satellite communications requirements external to the aircraft including passenger telephone and data services depending on aircraft equipage.

## 1.0 Introduction And Description 1.4 Airborne Avionics Configurations

The general configuration of the satellite avionics and related systems is shown in Attachment 1-1.  A more detailed block diagram (including alternate configurations) 
is shown in Attachment 1-2. The Satellite Data Unit (SDU) is capable of sending and receiving various data rates. The rate will be dynamically selected by pragmatic assessment of current operating conditions.  The signal is transmitted via geostationary satellite transponders to designated supporting earth stations.  A detailed functional description of this system configuration is provided in Part 2 of this document. The airborne system may be capable of transmitting higher data rates and voice communications, but this may necessitate the provisioning of a high gain (i.e., 12 dBic) antenna.  
The airborne system may also include support of higher speed data services designated by Inmarsat as "Swift64" or "SwiftBroadband."  Initial implementations may add this capability as an additional LRU (refer to Section 1.5.11) or by integrating this capability into the existing form factors of the SDU, RFU, or HPA.  
Provisions to accommodate incorporation of these higher speed services within the existing SDU, RFU, or HPA are defined in Attachment 4. Also refer to ARINC Characteristic 781 for pertinent additional information regarding SwiftBroadband (e.g., the Ethernet interface control document (ICD) attachment, aircraft position data requirements from the inertial/GNSS interface to support RF transmit signal timing requirements, Type D diplexer details, etc.). 

## 1.5 Unit Description 1.5.1 Satellite Data Unit (Sdu)

The signal-in-space parameters are determined by the SDU in relation to modulation/demodulation, error correction, coding, interleaving, and data rates associated with the communication channel(s).  This unit contains circuits for conversion of digital/audio inputs to a baseband or intermediate frequency (IF), if required, and interfaces with the radio frequency unit (RFU).  The SDU also interfaces with the ACARS Management Unit (MU) based on ARINC Characteristics 724 and 724B. 

## 1.5.2 Radio Frequency Unit (Rfu)

The RF unit consists of low power amplifiers, filters, frequency conversion and related components.  The RFU operates in a full duplex mode (i.e., simultaneous, transmission and reception of satellite signals).  The transmit side uses a power amplifier which accepts a signal from the SDU at either baseband or IF and translates it to the appropriate RF.  The receive side uses the output from a low noise amplifier (LNA) and translates signals to baseband or IF for use by the SDU. The RFU should be able to accept the wide range of signal levels from the LNA 
depending on configuration and losses.  
 
--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 1.0 Introduction And Description 1.5.3 Rf Distribution Units 1.5.3.1 Splitter

The splitter receives medium level RF signals from the RFU and divides the power for distribution to the high power amplifiers (HPA). 

## 1.5.3.2 Combiner

The combiner receives medium level RF signals from the low noise amplifiers (LNAs).  Note that only one LNA is turned on at a time.  The combiner then provides a matching network for distribution of the RF signal from each LNA to the RFU. 

## 1.5.3.3 High Power Relay (Hpr)

The HPR is a coax switch for switching output RF power from the HPA to a particular antenna subsystem.  The use of the HPR is optional depending on the aircraft configuration. 

--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 1.5.4 Diplexer/Low Noise Amplifier (Lna)

The diplexer and LNA are combined into one unit for installation.  The Diplexer Unit (DU) couples transmit signals from the HPA to the respective antenna (and couples receive signals from the respective antenna to the LNA unit) while preventing transmit-frequency power from degrading the receiver system. The LNA amplifies the very low level L-band signal from its respective antenna.  The LNA also compensates for transmission line losses to the RFU. 

## 1.5.5 High Power Amplifier (Hpa)

The high power amplifier provides an adequate RF power level, by automatic control, to the antenna in order to maintain the aircraft EIRP within limits.  The HPA unit may be located near the respective antenna to assure minimum loss of energy at the RF operating frequency and to avoid excessive thermal dissipation in the HPA unit, or it may be located in the radio equipment rack in certain aircraft. 

## 1.5.6 Low Gain Antenna (Lga)

A low gain (i.e., 0 dBic) antenna may be used to provide communications in case of failure of a main antenna or to provide a means for additional service.  Service will be restricted to low data rates when this antenna is employed. 

## 1.5.7 High Gain Antenna (Hga)

High gain antennas provide at least 12 dBic gain and are essential for both high data rates and voice services. 

## 1.5.7.1 Dual Side Mounted Hga

A dual side-mounted HGA antenna should be mounted on each side of the aircraft at about 45 degrees from the horizon.  The coverage of the main antennas is shown in Attachment 1-8. 

## 1.0 Introduction And Description 1.5.7.2 Single Top Mounted Hga

A single top mounted HGA antenna may be used instead of the dual side mounted configuration.  Drag may be increased in this application.  Either mechanically or electronically steerable antennas may be used. 

## 1.5.8 Keyhole Antennas

A typical installation makes no provision for keyhole antennas to provide coverage in the "Blind Areas" (keyholes) shown in Attachment 1-8.  Pins are not presently reserved on the SDU for any such antennas. 

## 1.5.9 Antenna Control Unit (Acu)

The antenna control unit (ACU) is used with a mechanically steered antenna to translate antenna beam positioning data and beam position change commands received from the SDU in a standard digital format into the form needed to position the antenna beam correctly. 

## 1.5.10 Beam Steering Unit (Bsu)

The beam steering unit (BSU) is used with electronically steered antennas to translate antenna position data and beam change commands received from the SDU in a standard digital format into the signals needed to select antenna elements in combinations that result in the beam pointing at the desired satellite. 

## 1.5.11 High Speed Data Unit (Hsdu)

This characteristic also reserves certain SDU pins for interfacing to one or more optional external High Speed Data Units (HSDUs).  The HSDU is an optional LRU that may be used to support SwiftBroadband and other possible future High Speed Data (HSD) services from Inmarsat.  The functionality and interconnect wiring to these external LRUs varies by manufacturer, and is outside the scope of this characteristic.  However, several SDU rear connector pins are reserved to accommodate the necessary interfaces to the HSDUs.  (Provisions are also included in Appendix 1 for bit-oriented fault reporting for such external HSDUs.)  Installers should contact their HSDU manufacturer for the specific interwiring modifications necessary. A Type D diplexer/LNA (Section 2.2.4.3) is required if the HSDU is capable of providing SwiftBroadband services. 

## 1.6 System Performance 1.6.1 Transmitter Equipment Performance

The following table provides an indication of the level of service that should be expected from a typical aircraft satellite system, assuming that equipment of nominal performance is utilized.

Notes: 

1. These values assume an INMARSAT-II Satellite (satellite  
G/T = -12.5 dB/K, satellite gain = 158.4 dB) and operation at a 
satellite elevation angle of 20° or above.  Values will differ for 
other satellites and elevation angles.  For example, with spotbeam satellites these figures are expected to be reduced by at 
least 7 dB. 
2. A 12 dBic aircraft antenna driven from a 40 watt linear HPA 
per ARINC Characteristic 741, through 2.5 dB of loss, will radiate an EIRP of up to 25.5 dBW, which can support four of these channels. 
The transmit system is equipped to adjust the EIRP according to commands from the GES.  For a single channel system using a Class "C" HPA, the back-off is accomplished entirely in the HPA, while the RFU maintains a constant power level to assure adequate drive to the non-linear HPA.  For a multi-channel system using a linear HPA, the back-off is a combination of HPA back-off (collective control of all channel carriers) and RFU output carrier level control on an individual channel basis (to accommodate channels operating at different data rates). The transmit gain of a High Gain Antenna (HGA) may vary as its beam position is changed while tracking a satellite from an aircraft in motion.  To maintain a more constant EIRP as the antenna's beam position is changed, the ACU/BSU outputs the antennas transmit again for the current beam position on its ARINC 429 bus (in the ACU/BSU status word) to the SDU.  The SDU in turn incorporates this gain information into the commanded back-off values it sends via its ARINC 429 bus to the HPA, thereby increasing or decreasing the HPA output (within the maximum and minimum limits of HPA output) to compensate for changes in antenna gain.  In a system with a linear HPA this information may be used in setting both the HPA backoff values and the individual channel carrier levels output from the RFU.  The antenna shall report its gain in the direction of the satellite with a resolution of 1 dB. The SDU shall make an appropriate HPA adjustment to maintain a given EIRP within ±1 dB when an antenna gain change is reported.  The SDU shall also monitor HPA output power when one data channel is active or under other determined signal conditions and make appropriate HPA adjustments to maintain the EIRP within ±1 dB to compensate for drifts in the HPA output power. The steering control signals should be provided through an ARINC 429 bus from the SDU and should be derived from a signal representing the received signal strength. This is commonly called "closed loop" steering. The antenna beam steering function should be capable of maintaining the transmitted beam performance with aircraft attitude rates of at least 7.5 degrees per second.

## 1.0 Introduction And Description 1.6.2 Receiver Equipment Performance

The receiver system performance is determined by the characteristics of the antenna sub-system, the LNA/Diplexer, the RFU, the SDU, and the interconnecting RF 
cables.  This includes all of the SATCOM equipment's RF systems and circuits from the antenna to the demodulated baseband output.  The design parameters of each of these system elements have been described to achieve the following receiver Figure-of-Merit (G/T) values.  These are minimum values with a sky temperature of 100K.  For the switched beam (HGA) this example corresponds to the main beam for any pointing angle. 

 
LGA 
HGA 
G/T 
-26 dB/K 
-13 dB/K 

Note: In the above examples the LGA G/T is degraded by 1 dB to allow for installation variations. 

The above values for G/T should be achieved under the following conditions: 

1. Clear sky climatic conditions. 2. Satellite elevation angles greater than or equal to 5 degrees within the 
coverage volume of the aircraft antenna. 
3. With residual antenna pointing errors (including the effects of errors 
introduced by the antenna beam steering system). 
4. Including the noise contribution of the complete RF subsystem including 
antenna and low noise amplifier at a temperature of 290K. 
5. With the transmitter power amplifier at maximum output level. 6. Including the loss and noise temperature contribution of a radome where a 
radome is fitted. 
7. Under the operational RF environment; e.g., when the receive antenna is 
illuminated in its operating bandwidth (29 MHz) by a total RF flux density of   
-100 dBW/m2. 
For the high data rate system using the high-gain antenna, the thermal contribution of finite losses within the HGA may cause the G/T to be degraded below -13 dB/K even when the HGA gain, LNA noise figure and diplexer plus cable losses are within tolerance. Antenna performance is expressed in terms of gain.  The system noise temperature is achieved in consideration of the RF cable loss factors and the noise figure contributions from the RFU and the LNA/Diplexer. 

The receiver system performance provides a bit error rate (BER) of 1x10-5 for packet mode data, 1x10-3 for circuit mode voice, and 1x10-5 for circuit mode data. 

The steering control signals should be provided through an ARINC 429 bus from the SDU and should be derived from a signal representing the received signal strength. This is commonly called "closed loop" steering. The antenna beam steering function should be capable of maintaining the received beam performance with aircraft attitude rates of at least 7.5 degrees per second.

## 1.0 Introduction And Description 1.7 Interchangeability

The ARINC Characteristic 741 Aviation Satellite Communications System comprises two major sub-systems and a number of individual units.  System interchangeability, as defined in Section 2.0 of **ARINC Report 403**:  Guidance for Designers of Airborne Electronic Equipment, is desired by the users for each of the major sub-systems and unit interchangeability, also defined in the above-referenced ARINC Report, is desired for the individual units.  The first major sub-system comprises the SDU and the RFU.  The second is the antenna sub-system, comprising the antenna itself, the beam steering unit (when used) and the antenna control unit (when used). Interchangeability is also desired for the HPA and the diplexer/LNA Units. Additional interchangeability standards may be found in Part 2 of this Characteristic. Cabin/cockpit voice and data interfaces to the Cabin Communications System (CCS) and its functional description are given in ARINC Characteristic 746. 

## Commentary

Even though the overall satellite system avionics suite comprises sub-systems made up of multiple line replaceable units (LRUs), each LRU must be designed to be autonomous for installation purposes. The airlines will not accept "matched pairs" of units or similar "unbreakable bonds" which necessitate changing more than the LRU whose failure actually causes a sub-system malfunction. 

## 1.8 Regulatory Approval

The equipment should meet all applicable aviation and telecommunication regulatory requirements.  This document does not and cannot set forth the specific requirements that such equipment must meet to be assured of approval.  Such information must be obtained from the regulatory agencies themselves.  Reference RTCA MOPS, RTCA MASPS, and ICAO SARPS.   

## Commentary

Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) are prepared by Special Committees of RTCA Inc.  MOPS cover the performance required of equipment certified by the FAA. Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) are also prepared by Special Committees of RTCA Inc.  MASPS document end-to-end performance requirements, including terrestrial elements where required.   
--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) are prepared by the ICAO Aeronautical Mobile Communications Panel (AMCP). SARPs cover interoperability requirements for safety services (ATS and AOC).   

## Commentary

This document does not define service levels provided (i.e. Safety vs. Non-safety) by any particular system or avionics implementation.   

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards 2.1 Introduction

This Chapter sets forth the specific form factors, mounting provisions, interwiring, input and output interfaces, and power supply characteristics desired for the satellite avionics equipment.  These standards should permit the parallel, but independent design of compatible equipment and airframe installations.  Refer to ARINC 
Specification 600:  *Air Transport Avionics Equipment Interfaces* for detailed information on selected form factors, connectors, etc.  ARINC 600 standards with respect to weight, racking attachments, front and rear projections and cooling apply. Manufacturers should note that although this Characteristic does not preclude the use of standards different from those set forth herein, the practical problems of redesigning a standard airframe installation to accommodate a special equipment could very well make the use of that equipment prohibitively expensive for the customer.  They should recognize, therefore, the practical advantages of developing equipment in accordance with the standards set forth in this document. 

## 2.2 Form Factors, Connectors, And Index Pin Coding 2.2.1 Satellite Data Unit (Sdu) 2.2.1.1 Sdu Size

The SDU should comply with the dimensional standards in ARINC Specification 600 for the 6 MCU size. 

## Commentary

An alternative approach is to combine the 4 MCU RFU and 6 MCU SDU into a single 10 MCU or 6 MCU unit.  Either configuration can be implemented with standard ARINC Characteristic 741 interwiring provisions by introducing 2 coax jumpers at the RFU connector (and stowing the connector for the 10 MCU approach).  The 10 MCU approach requires replacement of the 4 MCU and 6 MCU trays with a 10 MCU tray. 

## 2.2.1.2 Connectors

The SDU should be provided with a low insertion force, size 2 shell ARINC 600 service connector (see Attachment 1-5).  This connector should accommodate auxiliary interconnections in the top plug (TP) insert, signal interconnections in the middle plug (MP) insert, and coaxial and power interconnections in the bottom plug (BP) insert. The contact arrangements should be 02 for the top insert, 2 for the middle insert, and 04 for the bottom insert. Index pin code 04 should be used on both the SDU and the aircraft rack connectors. 

## 2.2.1.3 Form Factor

See Attachment 1-5.

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards 2.2.2 Radio Frequency Unit (Rfu) 2.2.2.1 Rfu Size

The RFU should comply with the dimensional standards in ARINC Specification 600 for the 4 MCU size. 

## 2.2.2.2 Connectors

The RFU should be provided with a low insertion force, size 2 shell ARINC 600 service connector (See Attachment 1-6).  The contact arrangements should be 08 for the top insert, 05 for the middle insert and 04 for the bottom insert.  Index pin code 03 should be used on both the RFU and the aircraft rack connectors. 

## 2.2.2.3 Form Factor

See Attachment 1-6. 

## 2.2.2.4 Rfu Power Output

When delivering a full output single carrier, the RFU output power should be 15 ±2 dBm as measured at the RFU RF output service connector, MPC1.  When delivering multiple carriers, the total RMS output capability should not be less than 15 dBm, and the actual RMS output should not exceed 17 dBm. 

## 2.2.2.5 Harmonics, Discrete, Spurious And Noise

While transmitting an unmodulated, continuous carrier at maximum output power per Section 2.2.2.4 the composite harmonics, discrete, spurious and noise output (including phase noise) at the output of the RFU should fall below the following: 

| Frequency (MHz)     | Power/Density     | Notes    |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 0.0  to   1150.0    | -30 dBc/4 kHz     |          |
| 1150.0  to   1525.0 | -55 dBc/4 kHz     |          |
| 1525.0  to   1559.0 | -83 dBc/4 kHz     |          |
| 1559.0  to   1614.0 | -55 dBc/1 kHz     |          |
| 1614.0  to   1660.0 | -55 dBc/4 kHz     | 1        |

Notes: 

1. Excluding the carrier frequency ±35 kHz. 2. This level is not applicable for Intermodulation products. 
The power of any harmonic measured at the RFU output port should be no greater than -30 dBc. 

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards Commentary

The levels are expressed in dB below single carrier level (dBc).  For example, -83 dBc is equivalent to a -68 dBm output level with  
+15 dBm (i.e., 31.6 mW) output power and -55 dBc is equivalent to -40 dBm. The recommended levels of -30 dBc assume that the HPA gain is reduced by 25 dB in the specified frequency bands when compared to the transmit band gain in the frequency range of 1626.5 to 1660.5 MHz.  This will result in a level of -55 dBc at the output of the HPA when driven by the RFU. 

## 2.2.2.6 Rfu Linearity

When transmitting two carriers each at +12 dBm, third order intermodulation products should be at least 43 dB below each carrier, and all other intermodulation products should be at least 45 dB below each carrier. 

## Commentary

This level of performance implies up to 1 dB degradation in the HPA intermodulation output when driven by the RFU. 

## 2.2.2.7 Noise Figure

The receive path noise figure for the RFU should not exceed 10 dB under conditions equivalent to a wide-band input signal level of -50 dBm at the RFU input.  For conditions equivalent to larger input levels, the noise figure (in dB) may increase in proportion to the signal level (in dBm). 

## Commentary

This RFU noise figure should allow the system installer a maximum loss as specified in Section 2.2.6.4 between the RFU and the LNA.  
This noise figure and a maximum loss of 25 dB between the RFU and the LNA adds 0.05 dB to the SATCOM receiver noise figure. Interfering RF energy can exist in frequency bands adjacent to the AES receive band, such as radiation from a mobile system used in Japan operating in the 1513-1525 MHz band.  The diplexer rejection specified in Section 2.2.4.3 does not provide specific protection against interference from RF energy in such a closely spaced frequency band. Noise figure which is increased by an Automatic Gain Control (AGC) reacting to interfering RF energy can degrade a desired channel's C/No, thereby causing an apparent degradation of the receiver system performance.   

## 2.2.3 Radio Frequency Distribution Units (Rfdu)

RF distribution units (e.g., splitters, combiners and high power relays) suitable for airborne satellite system applications are available in the marketplace at prices considerably lower than would be charged for units if they were built to specific

standards in this Characteristic.  For this reason, dimensional standards are not set forth in this Characteristic. The connector types described for these units are those preferred.  Their use is assumed in the standard interwiring shown in Attachment 1-3 of this Characteristic. 

## 2.2.3.1 Splitter Connectors

The splitter should use TNC type female connectors for both input and output.  The connector types described for this unit are those preferred and are called out in the standard interwiring shown in Attachment 1-3 of this Characteristic. 

## 2.2.3.2 Combiner Connectors

The combiner should use TNC type female connectors for both input and output.  
The connector types described for this unit are those preferred and are called out in the standard interwiring shown in Attachment 1-3 of this Characteristic. 

## 2.2.3.3 High Power Relay (Hpr)

The HPR is normally controlled by the Top/Port BSU (see Attachment 1-2).  Should this unit fail, the HPR should assume the state in which the HPA is connected to the Starboard BSU and antenna. 

## 2.2.3.3.1 Hpr Preferred Connectors

The HPR should use a TNC female connector on the input, a Type N male connector on the starboard (normally closed) output and a Type N female connector on the port (normally open) output. The connector types described for this unit are those preferred and are called out in the standard interwiring shown in Attachment 1-3 of this Characteristic. 

## 2.2.4 Diplexer/Lna 2.2.4.1 Diplexer/Lna Vswr

The Diplexer/LNA Antenna and Transmit (TX) ports' VSWR should be 1.3:1 maximum.  The LNA output port (RX) VSWR should be 1.5:1 maximum. 

Note: In all diplexer performance measurements, any unused port should be terminated with its characteristic impedance. 

## 2.2.4.2 Noise Figure/Gain

The Diplexer/LNA noise figure should be less than 1.8 dB at temperatures below 
25°C.  The noise figure may increase with temperature to a maximum of 2.1 dB at the maximum operating temperature (70°C).  The gain should be between 53 and 
60 dB under all operating conditions.

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards 2.2.4.3 Diplexer/Lna Types Commentary

The rejection values below do not consider the presence of other L-band systems on board the aircraft.  Equipment designers should be aware of the possibility of interference signals from DME, ATC Transponder, and Collision Avoidance systems and provide adequate protection. Use of the Type A diplexer/LNA (Section 2.2.4.3.1) provides interference protection for GPS, but may not provide sufficient interference protection for GLONASS receivers on the same or nearby aircraft.  Some GLONASS interference protection for nearby aircraft using GLONASS should be provided as GLONASS moves to frequencies below 1610 MHz after 1998. Use of the Modified Type A diplexer/LNA (Section 2.2.4.3.3) provides interference protection for GPS and GLONASS in its final configuration (after 2005).  It may not provide sufficient interference protection for GLONASS receivers on the same aircraft for GLONASS operations before 2006. More GLONASS interference protection for nearby aircraft using GLONASS is provided than by Type A diplexer. In the above cases, frequency management techniques are required to prevent 3rd and 5th order intermodulation products in the GPS and GLONASS bands (reference ARINC Characteristic 741, Part 2, Section 3.5.4.1.1). The ICAO SARPs and RTCA MOPS are expected to require the use of the Modified Type A (or better) diplexer/LNA for those AESs that are installed in aircraft that will operate in environments requiring GPS/GLONASS navigational positioning data. 

Installations supporting SwiftBroadband high-speed data services (Section 1.5.11 and Attachment 4) require a Type D diplexer/LNA (Section 2.2.4.3.4).  Type D diplexers provide additional levels of rejection of 3rd and 5th order intermodulation products for the GPS, GLONASS, and Iridium bands.  Reference ARINC Characteristic 741, Part 2, Section 3.5.4.1.1, for related frequency management and interference check algorithm considerations for the ground stations and the SDU.

## 2.2.4.3.4 Type D - For Use With Swiftbroadband High-Speed Data

Reference ARINC Characteristic 781, Section 2.2.4.3, and its subsections for details of the Type D diplexer. 

## 2.2.4.4 Reserved 2.2.4.5 Lna Output Power

The output power capability of the LNA should be 10 dBm minimum at the 1 dB gain compression point.  This set of parameters establishes the linearity for the receive system and is directly related to its two-tone intermodulation performance. 

## Commentary

This LNA output should allow the system installer a maximum loss between the LNA and the RFU as described in Section 2.2.6.4. Interfering RF energy can exist in frequency bands adjacent to the AES receive band, such as radiation from a mobile system used in Japan operating in the 1513 to 1525 MHz band.  The diplexer rejection specified in Section 2.2.4.3 does not provide specific protection against interference from RF energy in such a closely spaced frequency band. Interfering signals exceeding the output capability of the LNA may cause suppression of desired weak signals and, thereby, cause an apparent degradation of the receiver system performance.   

## 2.2.4.6 Diplexer/Lna Connectors

The Diplexer/LNA should use the following connectors for its RF ports: 

| Port                | Connector Type    |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Transmit Port (HPA) | N Jack (Female)   |
| Receive Port (RFU)  | TNC Jack (Female) |
| Antenna Port        | TNC Jack (Female) |

The Diplexer/LNA should use a MIL-C-26482 series 2 type connector for control and power interconnections. It should be identified by the part number MS3470L1210P, or equivalent, which mates with MS3476L1210S on the cable.

3. The heat to be dissipated includes any heat produced in the 
HPA power output control, power supplies and interface electronics.  The dissipation should be measured when operated at the maximum duty cycle of operation as specified by the manufacturer. 
4. This performance applies when the HPA is driven by two 
carriers, with a spacing from 5 kHz to 17 MHz, (e.g., 10 kHz, 100 kHz, 1 MHz, and 14 MHz) so as to produce two carriers each at a power level of half the rated output power measured at the HPA output connector.  This permits a 10 dB degradation in third order intermodulation products for the HPA compared to the RFU.   
5. The performance should meet the goal of introducing 
sufficiently small phase differentials during gain adjustments to avoid bit transitions in ABPSK or AQPSK. 
6. 40 watts is the desired minimum power output when the HPA 
is commanded to deliver maximum RF power output. All power levels are measured under unmodulated single carrier conditions. For an unmodulated single carrier condition of -12 dBm input drive level and operating into a load impedance of 

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards

50 + j0 ohms, 40 W is the expected minimum, with 80 W the maximum power out. 

7. "Stability" includes the effects of temperature, and input 
frequency. 
8. The HPA may optionally provide an extended back-off range.  
The step size and overall accuracy requirements are relaxed to ±1 dB for the extended range.  SDU command of the extended range shall be as specified in the 'nominal HPA Back-off' field of the HPA Command Word in Attachment 2. 
9. This performance applies when the HPA is driven by two 
carriers, with a spacing less than 13.5 MHz (e.g., 10 kHz, 100 kHz, 1 MHz and 13 MHz), so as to produce two carriers each 
at a power level of half the rated output power measured at the HPA output connector. 
10. This performance applies when the HPA is driven by two 
carriers, with a spacing equal or greater than 13.5 MHz to 14.5 MHz (e.g., 14 MHz), so as to produce two carriers each at a power level of half the rated output power measured at the HPA output connector. 
11. This performance applies when the HPA is driven by two 
carriers, with a spacing less than 13.5 MHz (e.g., 10 kHz, 100 kHz, 1 MHz and 13 MHz), so as to produce two carriers each at a power level of half the rated output power measured at the HPA output connector. 
12. An alternate method to demonstrate Intermodulation 
compliance is to transmit 6 equal, unmodulated carriers each 
at a power level of one sixth the rated output power at f, f+Δf, 
f+2Δf, f+4Δf, f+5Δf, f+6Δf, with Δf ranging from 10 kHz to 1 
MHz (e.g., 10 kHz, 100 kHz and 1 MHz).  The intermodulation 
product produced at f+3Δf shall be less than -19 dBc.  This 
test should be performed six times in total, with f placed at the high and low ends of the transmit band. 

## Additional Notes:

For a Class C HPA, the HPA values define the output level relative to the maximum capability of the HPA, for an input level of -12 dBm or higher. For a Linear HPA, the gain range should be at least 42 to 58 dB in the transmit band, with a gain reduction of 25 dB or greater for frequencies above 2000 MHz and below 1150 MHz.  The range of input levels shall at least cover -32 to -2 dBm. 

 
As indicated in Note 31 to the Standard Interwiring in 
Attachment 1-4 of this Characteristic, it must be possible to mute the HPA and turn it back on when necessary, for 

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards

example during antenna beam repositioning.  Pins are assigned on the HPA service connector for the input of a muting signal. 

## 2.2.5.1 Harmonics, Discrete, Spurious And Noise

While transmitting an unmodulated, continuous carrier at rated  output power, the composite harmonics, discrete, spurious and noise output from the HPA should fall below the following: 

| Frequency (MHz)    |
|--------------------|
| 0.0  to   1525.0   |
| -70                |
| dBc/ 4 kHz         |
|                    |

--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

| 1525.0  to   1559.0    |
|------------------------|
| 1559.0  to   1614.0    |
| -70                    |
| dBc/1 MHz              |
|                        |
| 1614.0  to   1660.0    |
| -70                    |
| dBc/4 kHz              |
| 1                      |
| 1660.0  to   1670.0    |
| -70                    |
| dBc/ 20 kHz            |
| 2                      |
| 1670.0  to   1675.0    |
| -70                    |
| dBc/                   |
| 4kHz                   |
|                        |
|                        |
| 1675.0  to 18000.0     |
| -70                    |
| dBc/ 4 kHz             |
|                        |

Note: These levels apply when the HPA is driven by an RFU. 

1. Excluding the carrier frequency ±35 kHz. 2. This level is not applicable for Intermodulation 
products. 

## Commentary

These levels are expressed in dB below single carrier level (dBc). For example, -83 dBc is equivalent to a -67 dBW output level with 40 W 
(i.e., 16 dBW) output power; and -70 dBc is equivalent to -54 dBW.  
The noise and spurious levels specified in Sections 2.2.2.5 and 2.2.5.1 do not appear to allow for additional degradation caused by the HPA. The HPA noise figure specification in Section 2.2.5.2 is an overriding requirement which restricts the HPA's noise contribution to such a low level that the resulting degradation to the overall noise level is negligible. Hence, the same levels can appear in both Sections. Likewise, discrete spurious signals which originate prior to the HPA input port are not further accentuated by the HPA in terms of dBc.  
To limit the HPA output to -70 dBc/4kHz in the frequency ranges 0 to 
1150 MHz and 12000 to 18000 MHz, in conjunction with an RFU output of -30 dBc/4kHz, requires a minimum frequency response rejection of 40 dB in the HPA over those specific frequency ranges. 

Reference Section 2.2.2.5.  

## 2.2.5.2 Noise Figure

The noise figure of the transmitter HPA should not exceed (20 + X) dB, where X dB is the commanded HPA Back-off Adjustment as defined in Section 2.2.5. 

## 2.2.5.3 Vswr

The VSWR of the HPA input should be 2.0:1 maximum. The HPA output port VSWR (i.e., the VSWR measured looking into the HPA output port) should not exceed 
1.25:1. The HPA should be capable of operating into a load VSWR of 2.0:1 maximum at any phase angle. 

Note: Under these conditions, the HPA should deliver not less than 
32 watts to the load and meet all other performance characteristics.  Safety circuitry should be provided to protect the transmitter HPA in the event of an accidental short or an open circuit at its output. 

## 2.2.5.4 Hpa Connectors

The HPA should be provided with a low insertion force, size 2 shell ARINC 600 service connector (see Attachment 1-10).  This connector should accommodate signal interconnections and a size 1 coaxial connector in the top plug (TP) insert, signal interconnections and size 1 coaxial connector in the middle plug (MP) insert, and power/coaxial interconnections in the bottom plug (BP) insert.  The contact arrangements should be 08 for the top insert, 05 for the middle insert, and 04 for the bottom insert. Index pin code 08 should be used on both Type 1 and Type 2 and the aircraft rack connectors. 

## 2.2.5.5 Form Factor

See Attachment 1-10. 

## 2.2.5.6 Hpa Muting And Carriers Off Level

When the HPA is muted, from maximum rated output power, the HPA RF output level should be at or less than -10 dBW within 1 ms after receiving the mute command (see Attachment 1-4A). 

When the HPA is commanded to the "Carrier(s) Off" state (via the HPA Command word, see Attachment 2), from maximum rated output power, the HPA RF output level should be at or less than -40 dBW. 

## 2.2.6 Coaxial Cable Losses 2.2.6.1 Loss Between Rfu And Hpa

The loss between the RFU and the HPA should fall within the range 19 to 25 dB. This measurement should be taken from the output of the RFU and include the connectors and splitter assembly. 

## 2.2.6.2 Total Loss Between Hpa And Antenna

The total loss between the HPA and the antenna connector should not exceed 2.5 dB, including the diplexer and any other loss.

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards Commentary

The intent of this Characteristic is to define units which, when installed on an aircraft, should provide SATCOM services in accordance with systems specifications presently being formulated. However, there may be instances where not all of the desired performance can be met in all conditions. It is recognized that imposing more stringent unit characteristics than those described herein may not be cost-effective with the current state of the  art. For example, when the effect of the overall voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) is taken into account between the HPA output port and the antenna, this can decrease the effective HPA output power from the specified 40 W to 32 W (assuming a maximum HPA output port VSWR of 1.25:1 driving an equivalent RF load VSWR of 2.0:1). 

## 2.2.6.3 Cable Loss Between Antenna And Diplexer/Lna

The coaxial cable loss between the antenna system and the Diplexer/LNA should not exceed 0.3 dB. 

## 2.2.6.4 Loss Between Lna And Rfu

The total loss between the LNA output and the RFU input should fall within the range 6 to 25 dB, including the cable, combiner, and connectors. 

## Commentary

Interfering RF energy can exist in frequency bands adjacent to the AES receive band, such as radiation from a mobile system used in Japan operating in the 1513 to 1525 MHz band.  The diplexer rejection specified in Section 2.2.4.3 does not provide specific protection against interference from RF energy in such a closely spaced frequency band. Use of a low loss cable may increase the likelihood that strong interfering RF signals may have a degrading effect on the apparent receiver system performance.   

## 2.2.6.5 Loss Between Sdu And Rfu

The loss of the two SDU/RFU coaxial cables shall each be less than or equal to that of 48 inches of RG 58/U. 

## Commentary

Cable loss is specified in this fashion (rather than in dB) because the frequency of operation on these cables is manufacturer dependent, whereas all other cables operate at a specified, known frequency. 

## 2.3 Antenna System Specification 2.3.1 Antenna Coverage Volumes

Two different types of high gain antenna configurations can be utilized; they are defined as follows: 

a. Two high gain antennas (HGA) looking abeam and mounted about 45° from 
the horizon on the side of the aircraft. 
b. A single or dual high gain antenna mounted on top of the fuselage or tail that 
is electrically or mechanically steerable. 

## Commentary

A single low gain hemispherical coverage antenna (LGA) may be used as a back up to the HGA with reduced performance capability. 

## 2.3.1.1 Ideal Antenna Coverage Volume

The antennas should achieve a desired performance over an ideal coverage volume 
(relative to the aircraft's horizontal line of flight) defined by an elevation range of 5° 
to 90° and an azimuth range of 360°.  The ideal coverage volume should permit communications to be maintained for all normal flight attitudes (e.g., +20°/-5° of pitch, +25°/-25° of roll) except with satellites at low elevation angles to the aircraft. 

## 2.3.1.2 Achieved Antenna Coverage Volume

--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The achieved coverage volume over which all the performance characteristics are satisfied may be less than the ideal antenna coverage volume.  See Attachment 1-8 for illustrative information on HGA coverage volumes. As a minimum, a low gain antenna sub-system should achieve the required performance over at least 85% and a high gain antenna over at least 75%, of the nominal coverage volume, where the nominal coverage volume is defined as the hemisphere above an aircraft in horizontal flight minus the lowest 5° of elevation. 

## Commentary

The foregoing recognizes that with current technology it is very difficult, if not impossible, to design an antenna offering the desired constant gain over a complete hemisphere.  In addition, antenna manufacturers should specify the achieved antenna coverage volume for their antennas. 

## 2.3.2 High Gain Antenna (Hga) Receive System 2.3.2.1 Frequency Of Operation

The receive antenna systems should operate on any frequency within the band 1525 to 1559 MHz. 

## 2.3.2.2 Polarization

The polarization should be right-handed circular.  The definition of CCIR Recommendation 573 applies. 

## 2.3.2.3 Axial Ratio

The axial ratio should be less than 6.0 dB for all steering angles and frequencies of operation. 

## 2.3.2.4 Receive System Figure Of Merit (G/T)

The receive antenna and diplexer/LNA should perform such that, with a receiver having a noise figure as described in Section 2.2.2.7 connected at the interface at the RFU, overall receive system figure of merit of at least -13 dB/K is achieved under all conditions (including pointing angle over the receive frequency band) with transmit power up to 60 watts (i.e., 17.8 dBW). 

## Commentary

For analysis purposes a sky noise temperature of 100K should be used.  In practice, sky temperature varies over a wide range depending on many factors. 

## Additional Commentary

The -13 dB/K G/T figure of merit should be met at room temperature (i.e., 290K), for a coverage volume as specified by the antenna manufacturers. At elevated temperatures the G/T may decrease, reducing the coverage volume over which the -13 dB/K figure is met. The converse may be true at low temperatures.  For the high data rate system using the high-gain antenna, the thermal contribution of finite losses within the HGA may cause the G/T to be degraded below -13 dB/K even when the HGA gain, LNA noise figure and diplexer plus cable losses are within tolerance. 

## 2.3.2.5 Steering Angle

The main beam of the antenna should be steerable in accordance with the coverage requirements. 

## 2.3.2.6 Steering Control

The antenna receive beam performance requirements should be maintained on a wanted satellite that is within the antenna coverage volume described in Section 2.3.1.1 for aircraft motions that do not cause the aircraft itself to obstruct the beam.  The antenna shall point to the commanded direction to within 0.5 dB of its final gain value within [6] seconds from any initial condition. "Open loop" steering, that is beam positioning based on the use of aircraft position data derived from an on-board navigation system, is also permissible but system operation should not be predicated upon it. 

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards

A current beam is one assigned to optimally point to the chosen satellite for a given aircraft attitude/heading. When the azimuth and/or elevation angles to the satellite change to the extent that the BSU causes one or more phase shifters to change state, the new beam is defined as an adjacent beam. 

## Commentary

While the airlines recognize that the functioning of certain antenna types can be enhanced by the use of "open loop" steering, they do not want to have to operate the INS, for example, to conduct a satellite system test.  System designers planning to use "open loop" steering, therefore, should ensure that sufficient "closed loop" capability is available to point the beam at the desired satellite for system test purposes and in the absence of failure of the open loop steering information. 

## 2.3.2.7 Overload Capability

The receive antenna system should be able to survive in-band power of 0 dBm at the antenna port. 

## 2.3.2.8 Receive Antenna Vswr

The antenna VSWR measured at the single antenna input/output port should be less than 1.5:1 (with respect to a 50 ohm characteristic impedance) for all antenna beam positioning angles over the receive frequency band, see Section 2.3.2.1. 

## 2.3.2.9 Discrimination

The antenna receive subsystem should be able to discriminate in gain against satellites spaced 45° or more in longitude from the wanted satellite (for all aircraft orientations) by at least 13 dB relative to the gain toward the wanted satellite.  If practical antenna design considerations prevent this discrimination from being achieved for all flight direction, aircraft orientations, or aircraft positions relative to the satellite, these limitations need to be clearly stated by the antenna manufacturer. 

Note: Although adequate discrimination is vital to satellite L-band spectrum reuse, testing of this requirement is not intended to be accomplished on the airframe.  Testing on a model or by simulation is acceptable. 

## 2.3.2.10 Phase Discontinuity

The signal phase increments resulting from the minimum achievable beam-steering increments should not exceed: 

- 
8 degrees for a minimum of 90% of all combinations of minimum beamsteering increments. 
- 
12 degrees for a minimum of 99% of all combinations of minimum beamsteering increments. 
This requirement should apply over the entire receive band and minimum antenna coverage volume specified in Section 2.3.1.2.

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards 2.3.3 High Gain Antenna (Hga) Transmit System

The HGA transmit antenna should have a minimum gain of 12 dBic within the achieved antenna coverage volume. 

## 2.3.3.1 Frequency Of Operation

The antenna transmit subsystem should operate on any frequency within the band 1626.5 to 1660.5 MHz. 

## 2.3.3.2 Polarization

The polarization should be right hand circular. The definition of CCIR Recommendation 573 applies. 

## 2.3.3.3 Axial Ratio

The axial ratio should be less than 6.0 dB for all steering angles and frequencies of operation. 

## 2.3.3.4 Steering Angle

The main beam of the antenna transmit subsystem should be steerable as necessary to fulfill coverage requirements. 

## 2.3.3.5 Steering Control

See Section 2.3.2.6. 

## 2.3.3.6 Transmit Antenna Vswr

The antenna VSWR measured at the single antenna input/output port should be less than 1.5:1 (with respect to a 50 ohm characteristic impedance) for all antenna beam pointing angles over the transmit frequency band. 

## 2.3.3.7 Output Power Capability

The antenna system should be able to transmit a continuous single carrier of up to 60 W (i.e., 17.8 dBW).  Peak Envelope Power (PEP) may exceed 150 watts due to the presence of multiple carriers. 

## 2.3.3.8 Discrimination

For all antenna steering angles, the antenna should discriminate in antenna gain against satellites spaced 45 degrees or more in longitude from the wanted satellite by at least 13 dB relative to the gain toward the wanted satellite.  This should be achieved during all aircraft motions and attitudes encountered under normal operating conditions, as specified in Section 2.3.1.  If practical antenna design considerations prevent this discrimination from being achieved for all flight directions, aircraft orientations or aircraft positions relative to the satellite, these limitations need to be clearly stated by the antenna manufacturer.

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards

Note: Testing of this performance is not intended to be 
accomplished on the airframe.  Testing on a model or simulation documentation is acceptable. 

## 2.3.3.9 Hga Connectors And Form Factor

Antennas designed for direct connection to the Diplexer/LNA (as opposed to the BSU) should utilize an N-type female connector.  See Attachment 1-11 for connector arrangements and form factors, and Attachments 1-3, 1-4 for interwiring details for the HGA. 

## 2.3.3.10 Beam Steering Unit (Bsu)

The beam steering unit (BSU) configuration varies depending on the antenna subsystem design.  In some implementations the BSU is included in the RF signal path and should therefore be mounted in close proximity to the antenna (see Attachment 1-12A).  In other designs, the BSU is not included in the RF signal path and may be mounted remotely from the antenna (see Attachment 1-12B). 

## 2.3.3.10.1 Beam Steering Unit Connectors

Beam Steering Units intended for installation in the RF signal path should use a TNC type female RF connector for the connection to the Diplexer/LNA (see Attachments 1-7A, 1-7B and 1-7C).  The number of matched coaxial cables connecting the beam steering unit to the antenna depends on the number of antenna array elements. These types of beam steering units should employ a MIL- C- 26482 series 2 type connector (part number MS3470L1626P or equivalent) for the control/power interconnections.  This mates with MS3476L16265 on the cable. 

Beam steering units whose design does not require installation in the direct RF 
signal path, should be provided with a low insertion force, size 1 shell ARINC 600 service connector for a 2 MCU BSU (see Attachment 1-7D).  This connector should accommodate auxiliary interconnections in the Top Plug (TP) insert, signal interconnections in the Middle Plug (MP) insert, and coaxial and power connections in the Bottom Plug (BP) insert.  Pin assignments should be as shown in Attachment 1-3A.  Configuration Index pin code 12 should be used on both the BSU and on the aircraft rack connectors. 

## 2.3.3.10.2 Bsu Size And Form Factor

See Attachments 1-7A, 1-7B, 1-7C, and 1-12B for BSU sizes; the form factor for the 2 MCU BSU is given in Attachment 1-7D. 

## 2.3.3.11 Antenna Control Unit (Acu)

The ACU, which is used with mechanically steered antennas, should comply with the dimensional standards in ARINC Specification 404A for the 1 ATR form factor. It should be provided with a connector type DPX2MA26MP40MP34B-00 or equivalent. This mates with a connector type DPX2MA26MS40MS33B-00, or equivalent, on the aircraft rack. 

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards Commentary

Typical ARINC practice is to describe MIL-C-81659 connectors for ARINC 404A LRUs. In this case however, the insert combination 
(26/40) is not covered by the MIL spec.  We have therefore reverted to a previous practice of quoting one manufacturer's part number "or equivalent". 

## 2.3.3.12 Phase Discontinuity

The signal phase increments resulting from the minimum achievable beam-steering increments should not exceed: 

- 
8 degrees for a minimum of 90% of all combinations of minimum beamsteering increments. 
- 
12 degrees for a minimum of 99% of all combinations of minimum beamsteering increments. 
This requirement should apply over the entire transmit band and minimum antenna coverage volume specified in Section 2.3.1.2. 

## 2.3.3.13 L-Band System Physical Isolation

The installation designer should be aware of the need for physical isolation between L-band antennas.  Separation resulting in 40 dB or greater of isolation should be provided between the SATCOM antenna and other L-Band antennas at the following frequencies: 

| 1572.0 to 1616.0 MHz    | GPS/GLONASS band    |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| 1626.5 to 1660.5 MHz    | SATCOM band         |

In addition, separation resulting in 70 dB or greater of isolation should be provided between the SATCOM antenna and the TFTS bottom mounted antenna at the following frequencies: 

| 1626.5 to 1660.5 MHz    | SATCOM band    |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| 1670.0 to 1675.0 MHz    | TFTS band      |

## 2.3.3.14 Antenna Intermodulation Commentary

The inherent non-linearities associated with RF coaxial connectors play a significant role in the generation of intermodulation products.  If the end user is not using coaxial cables and connectors which are specifically made or recommended by the equipment system supplier, the choice of coaxial cables and connectors should be made carefully. Studies have concluded that there are significant differences in the levels of non-linear properties depending on the connector conductor materials used.  More specifically, connectors which employ the use of ferromagnetic materials such as stainless steel and nickel plated metal should be avoided. Instead, the use of non-ferromagnetic materials should be used (e.g., silver plated brass, etc.). 

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards

In addition, insulating layers from oxidation and dissimilar material migration at the connector interface further degrade linearity and increase with time.  Therefore, connectors should be tightened to the connector manufacturer's recommended value and checked periodically. 

## 2.3.3.14.1 Antenna Intermodulation In Satcom Receive Band

For multicarrier operation, when operating with two unmodulated carriers 4 MHz apart anywhere between 1638.5 and 1660.5 MHz and each one having half the maximum multicarrier average RF power rating of the antenna, the antenna should not generate intermodulation products in the receive band greater than -162 dBW. 

Note: For carriers 10 MHz apart, the antenna should not generate intermodulation products in the receive band greater than  
-164 dBW. 

## 2.3.3.14.2 Antenna Intermodulation Products Which Fall In The Gnss Band

For multicarrier operation, when operating two unmodulated carriers anywhere between 1638.5 and 1660.5 MHz, each having half the multicarrier average RF power rating of the SATCOM antenna, the SATCOM antenna should not generate intermodulation products of the 7th order or higher in the GNSS band greater than -115 dBm referenced to the output port of an external 1/4-wave monopole GNSS antenna mounted on a common ground plane with the SATCOM antenna under test. The distance between the antennas should produce isolation of 40 ± 2 dB in the GNSS band (representative of the worst case condition in Section 2.3.5.7). 

## 2.3.4 Low Gain Antenna (Lga) Receive System 2.3.4.1 Frequency Of Operation

The receive antenna system should operate on any frequency within the band 1525 to 1559 MHz.

The polarization should be right hand circular.  The definition of CCIR Recommendation 573 applies. 

## 2.3.4.3 Axial Ratio

The axial ratio should be less than 6.0 dB for all frequencies of operation at elevation angles for 45° to 90° and less than 20 dB at elevation angles from  
5° to 45°. 

## 2.3.4.4 Receive System Figure Of Merit (G/T)

The antenna system (considering the LNA specification) should be such that, with a receiver having noise figure as described in Section 2.2.2.7 connected at the interface at the RFU, an overall receive system figure of merit of at least -26 dB/K is achieved under all conditions (except within 20 [degrees] from  the zenith, where it may degrade to -28 dB/K with power up to 60 watts (i.e., 17.8 dBW); 

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards

note that the PEP may exceed 150 watts. See COMMENTARY concerning this subject following Section 2.3.1.2. 

## Commentary

For analysis purposes the sky noise temperature may be assumed to be 100K.  In practice sky noise temperature varies over a wide range depending on many factors. Receive System Figure of Merit (G/T) for the 12 dBic antenna (HGA) and the 0 dBic antenna differ by 13 dB (more than the expected 12 dB).  This G/T may be obtained with a receive antenna having less than 0 dBic gain. 

## 2.3.4.5 Overload Capability

The receive antenna system should be able to survive in-band power of 0 dBm at the antenna port. 

## 2.3.4.6 Receive Antenna Vswr

## 2.3.5 Low Gain Antenna (Lga) Transmit System

A single LGA should provide at least 0 (but not more than +5) dBic gain over 360° of azimuth and above 5° elevation except within 20° from the zenith, where the gain may be as low as -2 dBic.  See Section 2.3.1.2 for additional information relating to the LGA achieved antenna coverage volume.

The antenna transmit subsystem should operate on any frequency within the band 
1626.5 to 1660.5 MHz.

5° to 45°. 

## 2.3.5.4 Transmit Antenna Vswr

## 2.3.6 Antenna Positioning Data

The SDU should first attempt to receive antenna positioning data on the Primary IRS Input.  If the data is invalid or missing, the SDU should next listen to the Secondary IRS Input.  If the data are invalid or missing, the SDU will declare in the open loop steering word "NO COMPUTED DATA".  The SDU should periodically, at least once every 10 seconds, test the inputs for valid data.  When valid data are detected, the search should stop and that data be used, see Attachment 1-4, note 36. 

## 2.4 Standard Interwiring

The standard interwiring to be installed for the aeronautical satellite system avionics is set forth in Attachment 1-3 with the applicable notes in Attachment 1-4.  This interwiring is designed to provide the degree of interchangeability specified for the system in Section 1.6 of this document.  Manufacturers are cautioned not to rely on special wires, cabling, or shielding for use with particular units because they may not exist in a standard installation. 

## Commentary Why Standardize Interwiring?

The standardized interwiring is perhaps the heart of all ARINC Characteristics.  It is this feature which allows the airline customer to complete his negotiation with the airframe manufacturer so that the latter can proceed with installation engineering and initial fabrication prior to airline commitment on a specific source of equipment.  This 

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards

provides the equipment manufacturer with many valuable months in which to put final "polish" on his equipment in development. 

## 2.5 Power Circuitry 2.5.1 Primary Power Input

The aeronautical satellite system should be designed to use 115V 400 Hz single phase ac power.  Aircraft power supply characteristics, utilization, equipment design limitations and general guidance material are set forth in **ARINC Report 413A:** 
Guidance for Aircraft Electrical Power Utilization and Transient Protection.  The primary power input should be protected by circuit breakers of the size described in Attachment 1-4. 

## 2.5.2 Power Control Circuitry

There should be no master on/off power switching within the avionics.  Any user desiring on/off control should provide, through the medium of a switching function installed in the airframe, means of interrupting the primary power to the system.  It is probable, however, that on/off switching will not be needed in most installations and that power will be wired to the system from the circuit breaker panel. 

## Commentary

Installation designers should note that a dc supply may be required to parts of the avionics in flight to prevent possible data loss during transient interruptions to the ac supply.  The designers of these units are encouraged to use non-volatile memory, however, so that this external dc power is not required. 

## 2.6 System Functions And Signal Characteristics

A list of the system functions and signal characteristics required to ensure the desired level of interchangeability for the subsystems comprising the aeronautical satellite system (excluding the SDU-RFU) is set forth in Part 2 of this document. 

## 2.7 Environmental Conditions

The avionics should be specified environmentally in terms of the requirements of EUROCAE ED-14 and RTCA Document DO-160C:  Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment.  Attachment 3 to this document tabulates the relevant environmental categories. 

## 2.8 Cooling Commentary

Equipment failures in aircraft due to inadequate thermal management have plagued the airlines for many years.  Section 3.5 of ARINC Specification 600 contains everything airframe and equipment manufacturers need to know to prevent such problems in the future. They regard this material as "required reading" for all potential 
--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards

suppliers of satellite communication equipment and aircraft installations. 

--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Equipment manufacturers should note that airlines may retrofit satellite equipment into aircraft in which forced air cooling is not available.  They should therefore design their equipment such that the thermal interface limits set forth in Section 3.5 of ARINC Specification 600 can be met without such forced cooling air being provided, or persuade their customers to accept the presence of a cooling fan inside the component. 

## 2.8.1 Sdu

The SDU should be designed to accept, and airframe manufacturers should configure the installation to provide, forced air cooling as defined in Section 3.5 of ARINC Specification 600.  The airflow rate provided to the modem in the aircraft installation should be 33 kg/hr. of 40°C (max.) air, and the pressure drop through the modem should be 5 ±3 mm of water at this rate. The SDU should be designed to dissipate less than 150 W and to expend this pressure drop to maximize the cooling effect.  Adherence to the pressure drop standard is necessary to allow interchangeability of the equipment. 

## 2.8.2 Radio Frequency Unit (Rfu)

The RFU should be designed to accept, and airframe manufacturers should configure the installation to provide, forced air cooling as defined in Section 3.5 of ARINC Specification 600.  The airflow rate provided to the RFU in the aircraft installation should be 22 kg/hr. of 40°C (max.) air, and the pressure drop through the RFU should be 5 ±3 mm of water at this rate.  The RFU should be designed to dissipate less than 100 W and to expend this pressure drop to maximize the cooling effect.  Adherence to the pressure drop standard is necessary to allow interchangeability of the equipment. 

## 2.8.3 High Power Amplifier (Hpa)

The HPA may require special consideration for cooling. One HPA configuration employs a 4 MCU unit for which a maximum heat dissipation of 125 W is defined. 

The airflow rate provided to this HPA should be 27.5 kg/hr of 40°C (max.) air and the pressure drop through the HPA should be 5 ±3 mm of water at this rate. Another HPA configuration uses an 8 MCU unit which will need cooling for a maximum of 
250 W heat dissipation.  The airflow rate for this unit should be 55 kg/hr of 40°C 
(max.) air and the pressure drop through the unit should be once again, 5 ±3 mm of water.  In both cases, the pressure drop should be expended to maximize the cooling effect. 

## 2.8.4 Antenna Control Unit (Acu)

The mechanically steered antenna ACU should be designed to accept, and airframe manufacturers should configure the installation to provide, forced air cooling as defined in Section 3.5 of ARINC Characteristic 600. The airflow rate provided to the unit in the aircraft installation should be 44 kg/hr of 40°C (max.) air and the pressure drop through it should be 5 ±3 mm of water at this rate.  The ACU should be designed to dissipate less than 200 W of heat and to expend the pressure drop to 

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards

maximize the cooling effect.  Adherence to the pressure drop standard is necessary to allow the desired interchangeability of the equipment. 

## 2.8.5 Beam Steering Unit (Bsu)

The 2 MCU BSU that is rack mounted should be designed to accept and airframe manufacturers should configure the installation to provide, forced air cooling as defined in Section 3.5 of ARINC Characteristic 600. The airflow rate provided to the 
2 MCU BSU should be 11 kg/hr at 40°C (max.) air and the pressure drop through it should be 5 ±3 mm of water at this rate.  The 2 MCU BSU should be designed to dissipate less than 50 W of heat and to expend the pressure drop to maximize the cooling effect.  Adherence to the pressure drop standard is necessary to allow the desired interchangeability of the equipment. All non-2 MCU BSUs, because they may be mounted in close proximity to the antenna, should be designed to function without forced air cooling. 

## Commentary

The non-2 MCU BSU should be able to withstand the high temperatures experienced near the aircraft skin as well as its own heat generation. 

## 2.9 Grounding And Bonding

The attention of equipment and airframe manufacturers is drawn to the guidance material in Section 6 and Appendix 2 of ARINC Specification 404A on the subject of equipment and radio rack grounding and bonding. Particular attention should be given to bonding and grounding requirements of the antenna system especially components mounted outside the airframe. 

## 2.10 System Ate Design 2.10.1 General

--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
To enable automatic test equipment (ATE) to be used in the bench maintenance of the SDU, those internal circuit functions not available at active interconnection pins and considered by the equipment manufacturer to be needed for automatic test purposes, should be brought to ATE Reserved pins on the upper insert (TP) of the connector (see Attachment 1-3). 

## 2.10.2 Unit Identification

The SDU should report its equipment identification code as defined in ARINC Specification 429.  The SDU should also provide its software and hardware revision level when requested by a centralized fault display unit on the aircraft or when queried by ATE in the shop. 

## 2.10.3 Built-In Test Equipment (Bite)

The SDU described in this Characteristic should contain Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) capable of detecting and annunciating a minimum of 95% of the faults or 

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards

failures which can occur within the SDU and as many faults as possible associated with the RFU, ACU/BSU, HPA, HPR, and the LNA/diplexer. BITE should operate continuously during flight. Monitoring of the results should be automatic.  The BITE should automatically test, detect, isolate and record intermittent and steady state failures.  The BITE should display system condition and indicate any faulty LRUs upon activation of the self-test routine.  In addition, BITE should display faults which have been detected during in-flight monitoring. No failure occurring within the BITE subsystem should interfere with the normal operation of the SDU. 

## Commentary

Sufficient margins should be used in choosing BITE parameters to preclude nuisance warnings. Discrepancies in SDU operation caused by power bus transients, EMI ground handling, servicing interference, abnormal accelerations or turbulence should not be recorded as faults. The SDU should be designed to be compatible with a centralized fault display system as described in **ARINC Report 604:** Guidance for Design and Use of Built-In Test Equipment (BITE).  The philosophy expressed in ARINC Report 604 is that on-board avionic systems such as SATCOM should provide an interactive, "user friendly", aid to maintenance.  The SDU should provide a listing of BITE options in menu format for operator selection.  By menu selection, the operator should be capable of requesting fault status (current and previous), initiating self tests and requesting detailed failure information for diagnostics. 

## 2.10.3.1 Bite Display

BITE information should be made available on all applicable data buses for use in the centralized fault display as described in ARINC Report 604.  This data will be presented to the maintenance technician on the display contained within that system.  As an option, the SDU could also have a System/LRU fault status display on the front panel.  This option could be beneficial for local troubleshooting in the electronics equipment bay. 

## Commentary

Most users desire an alpha-numeric display to present fault information to line maintenance personnel.  The desire includes presentation of the information in the form of easily understandable text - not coded!  The airlines do not want the maintenance personnel to be burdened with carrying a library of code translations.  The airlines would like to have the fault analysis capability of BITE using the alpha-numeric display equal to or surpassing the capability currently realized with shop Automatic Test Equipment. 

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards 2.10.3.2 Fault Monitor

The results of in-flight or ground operations of BITE should be stored in a nonvolatile monitor memory.  The size of the memory should be sufficient to retain detected faults during the previous ten flight legs.  The data in the monitor memory should include flight leg identification, fault description, and faulty LRU identification The contents of the monitor memory should be retrievable by BITE operation or by shop maintenance equipment.  Refer to ARINC Report 604 for further guidance on fault recording. ARINC Report 604 also specifies that fault data should be sent to the centralized fault display interface unit on an ARINC 429 data bus at regular intervals.  The SDU should output BITE fault data on all applicable Data Buses. 

## Commentary

The airlines have expressed an interest in having BITE data from as many as 64 previous flight legs available in memory. A question which must be considered by the equipment designer is, "What is the scope/purpose of BITE?"  It appears from the unconfirmed failure data that is available from repair shop operations, that there is merit in considering storage of data which will identify the Shop Replaceable Unit (SRU).  BITE should be used to detect and isolate faults to the LRU level. 

## 2.10.3.3 Self-Test Initiation

At the time of equipment turn-on, a power-up self-test should be initiated automatically as described in ARINC Report 604.  In addition, the SDU should, where practical, provide self-test capability for troubleshooting and installation verification.  The initiation of all test sequences should be possible from the control portion of the centralized fault display system. 

As an aid to shop maintenance and local trouble-shooting on the line, a self-test mechanism should be provided on the SDU front panel.  The momentary depression of the push button on the front panel of the LRU should initiate a unit/system selftest.  The self-test routine should start with an indicator test in which all indicator elements are activated simultaneously.  If the self-test routine detects a fault, the "all on" indication should be deactivated leaving the appropriate "fault" indication activated.  If no fault is found, the contents of the intermittent fault memory should be reviewed.  Only the four most recent flight legs should be considered.  If no fault is recorded, the "all on" indication should be deactivated leaving the "normal" indication visible.  If an occurrence of a fault on one of the four earlier flight legs is detected, the appropriate "fault" indication should be activated.  The activated indications should remain visible until the line maintenance mechanic presses the self-test button a second time or a "time-out" period of approximately ten minutes expires.  Selection of four as the number of flight legs, for which intermittent fault memory should be examined for the line maintenance BITE function, was made in the belief that it could be reduced as confidence in the BITE was built up. Manufacturers are urged to make this number easily alterable in their BITE implementation.

## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards 2.10.3.4 Monitor Memory Output

The BITE Monitor Memory output should consist of the following: 

- 
An output on all low speed ARINC 429 Data Buses to the centralized fault 
display interface unit, when so requested, as described in ARINC Report 604 using the format described therein. 
- 
An output to the display (if provided) located on the SDU, indicating system 
and LRU status.  An English language alpha-numeric display is preferred over LEDs of coded messages. 
- 
An output of undefined format which should be made available at the ATE 
reserved pins of the upper connector located on the SDU. 
The monitor memory should be capable of being reset in order that stored faults will not be carried over once an LRU replacement or repair has been affected.  The reset should be initiated only by shop maintenance. 

## 2.10.3.5 Use Of Automatic Test Equipment

Equipment manufacturers should note that the airlines desire to have maintenance procedures shop verified on automatic test equipment which conforms to ARINC 
Specification 608: *Standard Modular Avionics Repair and Test System*.  The automatic test equipment is expected to execute software with maintenance procedures written in accordance with **ARINC Specification 626:** Standard ATLAS 
Subset for Modular Test and **ARINC Specification 627:** Programmers Guide for SMART® *Systems using ARINC 626 ATLAS*.

## Attachment 1-4 Notes Applicable To Standard Interwiring

1. 
This option to the Standard Interwiring is dependent on the aircraft structure and 
configuration.  Its use will be determined by the installation designer. 
2. 
The splitter connectors are called out in Section 2.2.3.1.  The combiner connectors are called 
out in Section 2.2.3.2. The HPR connectors are called out in Section 2.2.3.3.1. 
3. 
The 24-bit ICAO SSR Mode S Address (used as the AES ID) should be read from the Data 
Bus from CMU #1 (SDU pins MP1G and MP1H) or the Data Bus from CMU #2 (SDU pins MP3G and MP3H) or the AES ID input (SDU pins MP4A and MP4B) if available.  System configuration pin TP10A identifies whether or not ARINC 429 data is available.  Data from the CMUs is available on Labels 214 and 216 (as specified in ARINC Specification 429, Attachment 6), or on the AES ID input bus on Labels 275 and 276 (at 5 to 10 words per second) as specified in ARINC Specification 429 for Mode-S Transponder to TCAS.  If the address is not available on any 429 input (as defined by TP10A), it should be read from the Address Bit discretes (SDU pins MP13C - K and MP14D - MP15J).  Hexadecimal codes 
000000 and FFFFFF are not valid; the presence of either of these codes on either a 429 input or the discrete interface is an indication of an unprogrammed address. 

## Commentary

Installers wishing to use a single Mode-S transponder as the source of the ICAO address should ensure that the transponder will continue to transmit a valid ICAO address when in standby mode.  The SATCOM system may be rendered inoperative if a valid ICAO address cannot be obtained due to deselection or failure of the single transponder. 

4. 
The diplexer/LNA uses a female (F) TNC connector (jack) at one end to interface with the 
antenna.  A female (F) N jack is used at the other end to interface with the input from the HPA along with a female (F) TNC for interface with the RFU receive path. 
5. 
The number of matched coaxial cables used depends on the number of antenna array 
elements. 
6. 
The Communications Management Unit (CMU) or equivalent is responsible for integrating data 
communications via the satellite communications system with data communications via other 
data links on the aircraft.  It exchanges data with the SDU at the physical layer on an ARINC 429 data bus, and at the link layer using the bit-oriented file transfer protocol.  It utilizes the ISO 8208 subnetwork layer (packet level) protocol, as described in that international standard and Part 2 of this document. 
7. 
ARINC 429 low speed data bus. 
8. 
ARINC 429 high speed data bus. 
9. 
Units functioning normally should annunciate this fact by placing a voltage between +15 Vdc 
and +36 Vdc relative to airframe dc ground on the connector pins assigned to the BITE discrete output.  Absence of this voltage will be interpreted as a fault annunciation.  BITE annunciation is not required when the unit has been commanded "off." 
10. The SDU and BSU (LNA on/off control only) should provide an internal switch closure to 
ground.  The switch "contact" should be open for (i) LNA off, (ii) no cockpit voice call annunciation, and closed for (i) LNA on, (ii) cockpit voice call annunciation active.  The "open" voltage hold off should be 36 Vdc max., the potential across the "closed" switch should be 1 Vdc or less and the current handling capacity should be 500 mA max.  System Configuration pins TP13C and TP13D (ref. Attachment 1-4C) specify whether the cockpit voice call 
--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## Attachment 1-4 Notes Applicable To Standard Interwiring

annunciation is to be steady or flashing.  If flashing, the duty cycle should be 50%, and the period should be 0.5 to 1 second. 

11. The SDU should sense the closure of an external switch to dc ground.  The resistance to 
airframe dc ground presented to the SDU connector pins should be 100,000 ohms or more when the external switch is open and 10 ohms or less when the switch is closed.  The closed state of the external switches will indicate that (i) a cockpit microphone is in use with SATCOM, (ii) the Voice Go-Ahead (Chime) output should be reset.  In the case of (i), this input can be wired to either the SATCOM-selected PTT switch, or to an ACP SATCOM mic transmit key switch suitably latched for the duration of the call as specified by system configuration pin TP13K (see Attachment 1-4C). 

## Latched Mic-On Operation (Tp13K = 0)

If the Call Light is ON, the Mic-steady ground is interpreted as off-hook, which answers an incoming call when the signal goes low and ends the call when the signal goes high. 

If the ORT (item o) is set for ACP initiated ATC Calls and, if the Call Light is OFF, the Mic-On discrete going to ground is interpreted as Place ATC Call.  Reference Section 4.13. 

12. These pins are wired to permit ARINC 429 high speed data buses to be used.  Where the 
functions are unspecified, manufacturers may utilize the interconnect capability as they choose, recognizing the limitations of the twisted shielded pair medium. 
13. When enabled by ORT item n (reference Part 2 Section 4.5.2.3), the SDU should close a 
circuit between pins MP14B and MP14C when the voice go-ahead (chime) output is to be activated such that a current of 1 amp may flow through an external device fed from a 28 Vdc source.  The maximum hold off voltage in the open circuit condition should be 36 Vdc.  The minimum hold time (for both the on and off states) should be 250 ms.  System Configuration pins TP13C and TP13D (ref. Attachment 1-4C) specify whether the chime is to be single or multi-stroke.  If multi-stroke, the period should be 0.5 to 1 second. 
14. These pins are used to encode the ICAO 24-bit address of the aircraft in which the SDU is 
installed.  Pins assigned to bits required to take on the binary "one" state in a given code should be left open circuit. Pins assigned to take on the binary "zero" state in the code should be jumpered to pin MP15K (Address Common) on the airframe side of the connector. 
15. The shields of twisted and shielded pairs of wires used for audio signal transfer should be 
grounded at the transmitter end only.  ARINC Report 412 provides more information on audio system installation and shield grounding.  Although interwiring is desired for two cockpit audio channels, the SDU need provide the electronics for only one. 
16. When the installation uses a mechanically steered antenna, an Antenna Control Unit (ACU) 
will be used instead of the Beam Steering Unit (BSU).  In this case the ARINC 429 high speed multi-control bus should be connected to pins BP37 (wire A) and BP38 (wire B) of the ACU service connector. 
17. In an installation using a mechanically steered antenna and its associated ACU, the ACU BITE 
output to the SDU will originate from ACU connector pins BP39 (wire A) and BP40 (wire B).  A low speed ARINC 429 bus will be used. 

## 18. Not Used

19. Source/Destination Identification should be provided for the BSU and the HPA as shown 
below.  Pins required to take on the binary "zero" state in a code should be left open circuit. Pins required to take on the binary "one" state should be jumpered on the airframe side of the connector to the pin assigned as "SDI Common."

## Notes Applicable To Standard Interwiring Commentary

BSU Pins E and F were previously assigned to the optional Steering Inhibit function.  The Steering Inhibit function has not yet been incorporated in production SDUs or BSUs.  The connections were from SDU Pins MP7E and MP7F to BSU Pins E and F.  The signals were defined in Note 18.  To allow for implementation of the Steering Inhibit function at a later date, some aircraft have been wired in this manner.  This wiring has the potential to cause the antenna to mispoint.  To eliminate this potential problem, these wires should be disconnected from BSU Pins E and F, then capped and stowed.  The Pins MP7E and MP7F may optionally be disconnected from the SDU, then capped and stowed. 

20. If a starboard BSU is installed, the following connections should be made with the port BSU for 
secondary control and BITE information transfer.  Also, SDU Multi-Control Output from Pins MP4G and MP4H should be connected to Pin Nos. T and U on Starboard BSU as well as Pins T and U on Port BSU.

22. The characteristic impedance of each coaxial interface, including the SDU/RFU IF interfaces 
(if used) should be 50 ohms. 
23. Not Used. 24. The BSU and the High Power Relay (HPR) may be wired as in Attachment 1-4B. 
25. The Satellite Control/Display Unit (SCDU) interface or Williamsburg SDU Controller (WSC) 
Interface (WSCI) is required to permit the SDU to be managed by cockpit control/status 
devices. The SDU should be capable of exchanging command and control information with SCDUs using the MCDU protocol standards defined in ARINC Characteristic 739, or with a WSC using ARINC 429 Williamsburg protocol to communicate specific messages and their signal elements as defined in Attachment 2F-42.1 of ARINC Characteristic 741, Part 2. Display and control details are manufacturer-specific. Note that no messages for the air-ground link 
will originate in or be routed to the SCDU/ WSC over this interface. The details of the SCDU 
interface are manufacturer specific.

26. This discrete input is used to enable the SDU to determine whether or not the aircraft is in 
motion.  The input should be programmable such that the "true" state may be annunciated by either an airframe dc ground, defined as 0 ±3 Vdc or a resistance to dc ground of less than 
1500 ohms at the SDU connector pin MP11A, or an open circuit or voltage.  An open circuit is defined as a resistance of 100,000 ohms or more between pin MP11A and airframe dc ground. The voltage at an input for a "true" indication should be 7 Vdc or more (max. 30 Vdc).  For this condition, the SDU should present a load of at least 10,000 ohms at each input. Resistance sensing should be based on current flow from the SDU to airframe dc ground.  In lieu of any available discrete to drive this circuit, Pin MP11B is programmed to the open circuit state, such that the unterminated (default) Motion Sensor Input is interrupted as "In Motion". 
Programming should be achieved by means of SDU connector pin MP11B.  When this pin is open circuit, the "true" state of its associated input should be indicated by the open circuit or voltage condition and the "false" state by the dc ground condition.  When the program pin is connected to MP15K (address common), the true state of the associated input should be indicated by the dc ground condition and the "false" state by the open circuit or voltage condition.  In all cases the "true" state is associated with the aircraft in motion. One possible source of the discrete is the aircraft parking brake.  When this is set, the aircraft is not in motion. When it is not set the SDU may assume the aircraft is in motion.  Other sources of the discrete which permit the SDU to draw the same inferences are also suitable. Note that in an IRS/INS equipped aircraft which supplies ground speed information to the SDU, the use of this discrete is unnecessary. 

27. These pins are reserved for possible future use as unspecified program pins whose functions 
are defined by the avionics suppliers.  They are to be left open circuit or wired to pin MP15K, "ICAO 24-Bit Aircraft Address Common", as necessary. 
28. All TNC and N type connectors should be provided with means to prevent the effects of 
vibration from causing the threaded collar with which the mating halves are secured together from becoming loose. 
29. Interface details are per ARINC Report 615.  Interwiring is only required on those aircraft 
having an ARINC 615 Airborne Computer High Speed Data Loader installed. 
30. Not Used. 

31. These twisted and shielded pairs are provided to handle fast rise-time discrete outputs from 
the BSU(s) to the HPA(s).  These discretes instruct the HPA(s) to mute in a side mounted antenna system when it is required to switch between port and starboard antennas.   This action may also increase the life of the High Power Relay (HPR), if installed.  The HPA mute condition is asserted when line A with respect to line B has a voltage of +6.5 to +13 volts on it. The "normal operation" condition is defined as all other states of the circuit, including the "zero" state of 0 ±2.5 volts and -6.5 to -13 volts measured from line A with respect to line B, and the open circuit condition.  Consult ARINC Specification 429 for additional details of the interface such as rise and fall times.  These voltage levels and desired HPA reaction times are shown on Attachment 1-4A.  The HPA muting functions should be a logical "OR" from the STBD and port BSU mute commands. 
32. Pin assignments will be different for the 2 MCU remote-located BSU using the ARINC 600 
series connector.  In this case, the pin assignments should conform to Attachment 1-3A "2 MCU Beam Steering Unit Size 1 Connector Pin Assignments". 
33. LRU and wire bundles/connectors  should be identified via the table provided below:

34. The HPR should use a MIL-C-26482 Series (crimp) type connector for the control 
interconnections.  It should be identified by part number MS 3120E-12-8P or equivalent which mates with a MS3126E-12-8S. 
35. Details of this interface are not yet defined. 36. For ANTENNA CONTROL STEERING and computed Doppler correction, the following ARINC

Each circuit breaker shall have a Type A (short delay) response. When dual SATCOM 
systems are installed, the circuit breakers utilized in each system are the same as those given above. 
38. System Configuration Pins definition and interpretation details are shown in Attachment 1-4C. 39. Reference Attachment 1-4C (pin TP13B) for the definition of the speed (high or low) of this

40. These discretes will be used to enable the SDU to determine whether or not the aircraft is 
airborne.  The inputs should be programmable such that the "true" state may be annunciated by either an airframe dc ground, defined as 0 ±3 Vdc or a resistance to dc ground of less than 
1500 ohms at the SDU connector pin MP5B, or an open circuit or voltage.  An open circuit is defined as a resistance of 100,000 ohms or more between pin MP5B (or MP5C) and airframe dc ground.  The voltage at an input for a "true" indication should be 7 Vdc or more (max 30 VDC).  For this condition, the SDU should present a load of at least 10,000 ohms at each input.  Resistance sensing should be based on current flow from the SDU to airframe dc ground. 
Programming should be achieved by means of SDU connector pin MP5D.  When this pin is open circuit, the "false" state of its associated input should be indicated by the open circuit or voltage condition, and the "true" state by the dc ground condition.  When the program pin is connected to MP15K (address common), the "false" state of the associated input should be indicated by the dc ground condition and the "true" state by the open circuit or voltage condition. In all cases, the "true" state is associated with the aircraft on the ground.  These discretes are only required to be wired if equivalent information is not strapped as being available to the SDU on an ARINC 429 input, for example, IRS or the CFDS.  Appropriate failsafe logic (assuming airborne when the air/ground state is unknown, or when multiple ARINC 429 sources contradict each other) should be used in most cases; however, when two or more ARINC 429 sources are wired and no valid data is available (including reception of invalid data), the on-ground state may be assumed in order to enable normal ground maintenance activities independent of other aircraft equipment. 

41. CEPT-E1 data bus defined in CCITT G.703 and G.704. 42. An SDU may be wired to any two of up to 3 IRSs.  Attachment 1-4C System Configuration 
Pins TP11C and D define which IRS pins on the SDU are wired to sources of IRS data. 
43. This discrete input will be used to permit the SDU to inhibit SATCOM activation of the chime 
and call light during takeoff and landing flight phases.  If ground-initiated call signaling is still active on the satellite channel when the inhibit is released (i.e., the call has not yet been cleared by the terrestrial party), the chime and light should be activated immediately in the normal fashion.   
The input "true" state (i.e., takeoff or landing phase/inhibit chime and lamps) is annunciated by either an airframe dc ground (defined as ±3 Vdc), or a resistance of less than 1500 ohms, between the SDU connector pin and airframe dc ground.  The "false" state (i.e., enable chime and lamps) is annunciated by either 7 Vdc or more (maximum 30 Vdc), or an open circuit (a resistance of 100,000 ohms or more), between the SDU connector pin and airframe dc ground. 

44. Not used. 45. Messages for the Air/Ground link will not be routed over this interface. 46. The SDU should sense a momentary (typically no less than 100 milliseconds) closure of 
external switches to dc ground.  The resistance to airframe dc ground presented to the SDU connector pins should be 100,000 ohms or more when open, and less than 10 ohms when grounded.  The transition from open to ground on the external switches will indicate End Call for any ongoing call on the respective channel, or if there is no ongoing call, to indicate Place ATC Call if there is a telephone number in the ATC Call Register, and if ORT (item o) is selected, and if TP13K=1.  Reference Section 4.13.

This is an optional two-channel full-duplex analog interface with the Cabin Communications 
System (CCS) Cabin Telecommunications Unit (CTU), as specified in ARINC Characteristic 746.  It is baseband audio, nominally -15 dBm into 600 ohms (0 dBm max), utilizing in-band 
DTMF signaling.  Either this analog interface, or the digital (CEPT E-1) interface, may be used between the SDU and the CTU, but not both simultaneously.  Use of either interface is 
indicated by the presence of signaling on the appropriate wire pairs. 
49. 
 
This optional output port may be used for GES-Specific Data Broadcast (GSDB) data.  Such 
data received from the satellite link is forwarded on this port to a Satellite News Unit (SNU) as specified in Attachment 2 for the "GSDB Word Sequence - SDU to SNU". 
This optional output port may also be used for Cabin Packet-Mode Data (CPD), see Note 54. Both applications may share the port by using unique labels/SALs. 

50. 
 
The optional Auxiliary Asynchronous Port interfaces shall function as defined in EIA Standard 
RS-232. 
51. 
 
The optional Encryptographic Data Interface lines for Channels 1 and 2 are defined as follows: 

| CH1_SER_OUT, CH2_SER_OUT     | Encrypted Data, 9600 bps output from SDU.     |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| CH1_SER_IN, CH2_SER_IN       | Encrypted Data, 9600 bps input to SDU.        |
| CH1_CMD_ACT, CH2_CMD_ACT     | Circuit Mode Data Activate, output from SDU.  |
| CH1_CMD_REQ, CH2_CMD_REQ     | Circuit Mode Data Request, input to SDU.      |
| CH1_DCD, CH2_DCD             | Data Carrier Detect, output from SDU          |
| TXCLK1, TXCLK2               | Transmit Data Clock 9600 Hz, output from SDU. |
| RXCLK1, RXCLK2               | Receive Data Clock 9600 Hz, output from SDU.  |

Note: The electrical characteristics of the signals are as defined in the EIA/TIA-232 Standard. 

52. 
 
This SDU output may also be wired to the EICAS/ECAM/EDU to permit that unit to monitor the 
Label 270 word, which is specified in ARINC Characteristic 741, Part 2, Section 4.7.3.1 
53. At least one manufacturer has connected this pin to common ground.  This pin was so 
designated in Supplement 4. 
54. 
 
These optional ARINC 429 input and output ports may be used to provide packet-mode data 
services for the Cabin Packet-mode Data Function (CPDF), as specified in Part 2, Section 4.9. 
55. 
 
Reference Attachment 1-4C (pin TP10E) for the definition of the speed (high or low) of this 
ARINC 429 bus. 
56. 
 
Reference Part 2 Section 4.8.7.4 regarding the usage of this interface signal in a dual 
SATCOM system.  In a dual system, the physical channel 1 and 2 interfaces on each SDU map to the AMS/ACP logical channel interfaces per ORT (Item p) (Reference Part 2 Section 4.5.2.3).  The SDU cockpit telephony signaling outputs in a dual system should only be asserted by the SDU supporting a call with one of its physical channels.  
57. There are a variety of means of interfacing different kinds of facsimile (fax) machines and 
other circuit-mode data equipment (e.g., personal computers, secure voice terminals) to the SATCOM system, including direct connection to the SDU, or via a DIU or TIFU (either of which can be a physical unit or integrated into the SDU -- reference ARINC Characteristic 741 Part 2 Section 4.4.3 and its subsections, which in turn reference the Inmarsat aeronautical system definition manual modules 1, 2 and 5), or via an ARINC 746 cabin communications system (CCS) cabin telecommunications unit (CTU, which may also involve an intervening cabin distribution system [CDS -- reference ARINC Specification 628]).  Options include analog 

## Attachment 1-4 Notes Applicable To Standard Interwiring

interconnections (utilizing voice-band modems) and direct digital-interconnect data service. The SDU physical interfaces referencing this note (Cabin Digital Voice/Data CEPT-E1 [CTU] and Analog PBX) have the potential to support one or more of these options.  Refer to the relevant vendors for specific options and details. 

58. These pins may have various applications, depending on the specific SDU manufacturer. For 
example, TP3F - TP3J are reserved for a two-wire hybrid fax interface on some SDUs; TP3G - TP3K are reserved for CEPT - E1 signaling on some SDUs. Contact the SDU vendor for specific interface information.  
59. This interface may be used by one or more manufacturers to support external HSDUs. 
Different signal designations may be manufacturer-dependent and/or may be SDU systemconfiguration-pin-dependent. Contact the manufacturer for specific usage and interwiring information. 
60. These ARINC 429 interfaces were formerly reserved for a future to-be-defined Radio 
Management Panel (RMP) and Call Annunciation Panel (CAP).  Those units were never implemented as originally conceived. Non-MCDU/SCDU SATCOM controllers did evolve, but 
they utilize the SCDU/WSC ARINC 429 interfaces on MP3C/D, 3E/F, 3J/K, and 8J/K -- 
reference Note 25.  Since one type of WSC uses the nomenclature RMP, in order to avoid confusion with the former and different RMP concept, the former RMP (and CAP) references have been deleted. 
--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
61. The non-HSD HPA and the HPA HSDU utilize different electrical signal characteristics 
and functionality (ARINC 429 vs. 0-15V discrete) on pins TP2E, TP2F, TP2H and TP2J, with different interwiring requirements for those two applications.  Aircraft wiring for non-HSD HPAs is obviously not adequate for HPA HSDUs, but aircraft wiring for HPA HSDUs that utilizes these particular circuits may not be electrically compatible with 
non-HSD HPAs and their affiliated SDUs.  Consult the SDU, HPA and HPA HSDU manufacturers, and exercise appropriate caution. 
62. Note that in Attachment 4, these HPA pins are used for part of the Swift64 high-speed 
data 24-bit Forward ID strapping for the HPA HSDU.  Some of these circuits will 
therefore be strapped to signal ground in aircraft interwiring.  As these pins are reserved for automatic test equipment (ATE) signals for non-HSD HPAs, and those ATE 
circuits may not have been designed to be permanently grounded via aircraft wiring, 
non-HSD HPAs may be electrically incompatible with such Forward ID strapping, and equipment damage may result if such non-HSD HPAs are installed on aircraft wired for HPA HSDUs.  Consult the HPA and HPA HSDU manufacturers, and exercise appropriate caution.

## Attachment 1-4C System Configuration Pins Definition And Interpretation

1. Pins assigned to bits required to take on the binary "one" state in a given code should be left as 
open circuits. Pins assigned to take on the binary "zero" state in the code should be jumpered to pin MP15K (Address Common) on the airframe side of the connection. 
2. The coverage of the Parity Pin is TP10A through TP10K and TP11B through TP13K (39 pins 
other than itself). The Parity Pin is programmed to a zero or one to yield an odd number of strap bits set to the one state including the Parity Pin itself. 
3. Other configurations are possible and may be added at a later date. Note that ARINC 
Characteristic 761 Attachment 1-4B Table 1-3K (which is an extension of ARINC Characteristic 741 Table 1-4K) defines configurations which include intermediate-gain antennas (IGAs). Those IGA configurations may also apply to ARINC Characteristic 741-compatible equipment; therefore, the IGA codes defined in ARINC Characteristic 761 should be considered as reserved for those definitions in this table as well. Any changes to this table should be 
coordinated with ARINC Characteristic 761. Note that the configuration codes for Type D and Non-Type D LNA/Diplexers are identical except for TP11J. 
4. The state of this strap is "Don't Care" for a single SDU configuration. 5. The steady vs. flashing light option applies to the call annunciation phase only. The light 
remains on (steady) for the duration of the call after the acknowledgment of the annunciation with either the STEADY or FLASHING option. 
6. Interwiring and operation is TBD. 7. The following apply for the case of this pin wired to the 0 state: Priority 4 calls are not allowed to 
or from the cockpit AMS. ORT item "i" (Allowance and Routing of ground-initiated Public Correspondence/Priority 4 calls--reference ARINC Characteristic 741 Part 2 Section 4.5.2.3) cannot be allowed to specify the cockpit AMS. (If Priority 4 calls are Allowed by item "i", they are to be routed to the CCS or cabin analog phones). All cockpit AMS-initiated calls are to be processed at Priority 3 or higher. Additionally, ORT item "g" (Codec Dedication) cannot be allowed to specify Cabin dedication. 
8. This configuration pin may be used by one or more manufacturers to indicate the installation of 
an external HSDU, or the installation of an RFU HSDU (as described in Attachment 4). Contact the manufacturer for specific usage and interwiring information. 
9. Pin MP11G is not included in the parity computations for TP11A. 10. For referencing convenience, the decimal equivalent is given for the binary coding shown for 
pins E-K, treating pin E as the LSB and pin K as the MSB.

## Attachment 2 Arinc 429 Labels And Word Formats Used In The Aviation Satellite Communications System

The following describes the implementation of the optional GSDB service; if this optional service is provided by the SDU, it shall be in accordance with these requirements. Following successful receipt, CRC verification and identification of Direct Link Service (DLS) GSDB S37 Lone Signal Units (LSUs) from the P-channel, the SDU shall extract the D2 9-octet GSDB Protocol Data Unit (GSDBPDU, octets 2 through 10 of S37), discarding the received Message Type and CRC fields. The SDU shall then construct a Link Interface Data Unit (LIDU) consisting of a Link Service Data Unit (LSDU) plus Link Interface Control Information (LICI). The LSDU shall contain the D2 GSDBPDU. The LICI shall include the current log-on GES ID, Satellite ID, Spot Beam ID, and a "flags" field. The ID fields shall be derived from the current Log-On Confirm table (specified in Part 2 Section 4.5.2.4); the Spot Beam ID field shall contain the code "zero" if the global beam is currently being used rather than a spot beam. The flags field shall specify the current P-channel rate (the P field). A simple variant of the ARINC 429 Williamsburg methodology (reference ARINC 429 Attachment 11) shall be used to enable a sequence of six Label 374 ARINC 429 words to transmit the GSDB LIDU via the GSDB port. The Williamsburg Word Type field (bits 29-31) is not necessary, and shall be replaced by a Word Sequence Number (WSN) field, which shall indicate the relative position of each word within the sequence of six words (numbered from 0 to 5) to facilitate LDU frame synchronization at the receiver. The first five words shall be full data words (each containing five nibbles of data), and the sixth word shall be a partial data word (containing one nibble of data). No other aspects of the Williamsburg protocol (handshake words, timers, etc.) shall be utilized on the GSDB interface. The six ARINC 429 words shall be transmitted at the physical layer as specified in ARINC 429, including the minimum word gap of four bit times between successive words in the six-word sequence. The SDU shall map the LIDU to the ARINC 429 words as shown. All spare bits shall be set to zero. 

Note: Except for the SAL, least significant bits of octets and nibbles 
are right-justified.

## Attachment 2 Arinc 429 Labels And Word Formats Used In The Aviation Satellite Communications System

For full details, reference ARINC Characteristic 761, Attachment 2, Item 2, which defines a satcom multi-bearer system (MBS), wherein the ARINC 761 SDU may support multiple satellite systems (e.g., Inmarsat and Iridium, or Inmarsat and Globalstar).  This capability is also defined from the CMU perspective in ARINC Characteristic 758 (Supplement 2 and subsequent, including in Attachment 6, Table 6-16).  Included in this capability is the MBS SDU's use of the ARINC 429 label 172 subsystem identifier word, transmitted at a nominal rate of 1 Hz on its output bus to the CMU (and EICAS/ECAM/EDU), to indicate the satellite systems through which it is capable of providing service.  In ARINC Characteristic 761, label 172 thus has a unique definition and usage of bits 17-29 that are only defined as pad (zero) bits in the generic ARINC Specification 429 definition of label 172. (ARINC 758 has similar unique definitions for some of the bits in its label 172 outputs to the SDU and other air/ground data link equipment.)   
The concept of an MBS SDU is beyond the scope of ARINC Characteristic 741. However, MBS/ARINC 761 SDUs can also be compatible with ARINC 741.  The label 172 definition above is included here for such ARINC 741-compatible SDUs. Such SDUs will, at a minimum, set bit 17 to indicate support of Inmarsat Aero service, and may also set other bits in the Satellite System Type field as applicable to the specific SDU design. 

## Attachment 2 Arinc 429 Labels And Word Formats Used In The Aviation Satellite Communications System Notes

1. 
Unless otherwise noted, field data bits are transmitted Least Significant Bit (LSB) first, and the 
Most Significant Bit is transmitted last. 
2. 
HPA CONTROL bit 16 is used to turn the HPA on or off for HGA/LGA selection. The carriers 
off level should be as specified in Section 2.2.5.6. 
3. 
PEAK/AVERAGE CODE 0000 has no explicit operation within the HPA. PEAK/AVERAGE is 
calculated from (Σ Vi)2/Σ Vi
2 where Vi is the relative voltage of the ith carrier. It is rounded to the 
nearest integer for reporting. If all carriers have the same power level, this is the same as the number of carriers. 
4. 
RATE:  5-10 words per second. 
5. 
Not used. 
6. 
The HPA will initiate its Functional Test following receipt of one or more valid Command 
words having the SSM set to Functional Test. The HPA Functional Test will execute until its completion, at which time the HPA will automatically return to Normal Operation (even if Functional Test is still being received in the SSM). Following such completion of the Functional Test, the HPA will not reinitiate the Functional Test until after it receives one or more subsequent Normal Operation commands followed by one or more Functional Test commands via the SSM. The HPA will ignore any Command words with the SSM set to No Computed Data or Failure Warning. 
7. 
The HPA shall indicate No Computed Data if no HPA Command Word is received from the 
SDU for one or more seconds. The HPA shall indicate Functional Test following initiation, and during execution, of its Functional Test, whether commanded by the SDU or by any other means such as power-on or a front panel test switch. Upon the completion of Functional Test, the HPA shall indicate Normal Operation if no failures were detected or Failure Warning if one or more failures were detected. Failure Warning shall also be indicated at any time outside of Functional Test when a monitored (or otherwise tested) parameter is in its failure state. A Failure Warning indication should persist until all conditions and parameters are subsequently re-tested by appropriate test and are found to be "OK." 
8. 
Reserved. 
9. 
Bit 16 shall indicate that the HPA has received the corresponding command from the SDU. 
Any discrepancy between the commanded and actual carrier state may be ascertained by the SDU by examination of the Actual Power Out Field. 
10. The actual power output reported by the HPA shall be the highest level measured since the 
previous report was transmitted. Bit 18 shall be set to 0 if, at any time during the reporting interval, the HPA RF input power is ≥ -32 dBm while the BSU is not muting the HPA. In this 
case, the Actual Power Out field will thus reflect the (highest) measured value for the reporting interval. Conversely, bit 18 shall be set to 1 if, during the entirety of the reporting interval, either or both of the following conditions are true at any given time:  (A) the HPA RF input power is < -32 dBm or (B) the BSU is muting the HPA. In this case, the last reported output power shall be held and continue to be reported in the Actual Power Out field. Power cannot be more than 3 dB above 40 Watts. 
Use of the 16.5 to 27.5 dB less than 40W range is optional. The HPA shall only report actual output power down to the level where measurement accuracy is consistent with the required back-off setting accuracy as specified in Section 2.2.5 (i.e., ±0.5 dB down to 16.0 dB below 
40W and ±1 dB for the optional extended range). If its Actual Power Out is at or below its limit 

## Attachment 2 Arinc 429 Labels And Word Formats Used In The Aviation Satellite Communications System

of measurement accuracy, the HPA should output code 00100/001000 for "At/Below Measurable Range" in this field. In lieu of information to the contrary via the Actual Power Out field, the SDU should assume that an HPA not indicating usage of the optional extended backoff range has a usable Actual Power Out reporting range down to 16.0 dB less than 40 watts. 

11. The SDI bits should be set to reflect the HPA's application as defined in Note 19 of 
Attachment 1-4. 
12. The maximum available RMS power is determined by the Linear HPA from the Peak/Average 
Input Power as well as other data. If the SDU wishes to add a carrier, it should send the Peak/Average ratio for the new rather than the current set of carriers. 
13. A "1" state in bits 12 and/or 13 and/or 14 and/or 15 will not cause the Sign/Status Matrix to 
indicate a Failure Warning. 
14. Only applicable to HGAs having self-test capability; all others will always be cleared to "OK." 15. Reserved. 16. RATE:  5-10 words per second (not synchronized to HPA commands). 17. The SSM should be used as follows: 

FUNCTIONAL TEST  
Test in Progress (ignore DISCRETE field, invalid). 
NORMAL OPERATION  
No failures detected in ACU/BSU. 
FAILURE WARNING  
Failure(s) detected in the ACU/BSU and indicated in DISCRETE field; does not include failures in the LNA/Diplexer, HPR, HGA or Control bus input. 
NO COMPUTED DATA  
No BSU Control Word or no BSU Open Loop Steering Word has been received from the SDU for one or more seconds. 

 
The ACU/BSU shall indicate Functional Test following initiation, and during execution, of its 
Functional Test, whether commanded by the SDU or by any other means such as power-on or a front panel test switch. Upon the completion of Functional Test, the ACU/BSU shall 
indicate Normal Operation if no failures were detected or Failure Warning if one or more failures were detected. Failure Warning shall also be indicated at any time outside of Functional Test when a monitored (or otherwise tested) parameter is in its failure state.  
18. The SDI bits should be set to reflect the ACU/BSU's application as defined in Note 19 of 
Attachment 1-4.  
19. The state "Functional Test" in the SSM will command the destination ACU/BSU to conduct a 
self-test and respond with the appropriate data. These data are included in the ACU/BSU MAINTENANCE WORD, which is output continuously at the rate specified. 
20. While commanding the Functional Test mode, the SDU will continuously send the CONTROL 
WORD with the SSM set to "Functional Test."  The ACU/BSU will continue to perform the selftest until the test is completed. The ACU/BSU will then automatically return to normal operation. Functional test will not be re-initiated until after receipt of SSM fields containing normal operation followed by functional test. 
21. The states "Failure Warning" and "No Computed Data" are not used and should be ignored. 

## Attachment 2 Arinc 429 Labels And Word Formats Used In The Aviation Satellite Communications System

22. When the Antenna System Select discrete is cleared to the LGA state, each ACU/BSU will 
turn-off the associated LNA. The SDU should turn off the associated HPA(s) via the Multi-
Control ARINC 429 output bus (HPA COMMAND word, bit 16). 
23. ARINC 429 labels 270 through 274 (octal) are reserved on all ACU/BSU ARINC 429 buses for 
testing and cross-talk. 
--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

24. Elevation data, bits 9-18, has a range of approximately +89.8 to -90 degrees. Bit 18 is used as 
the sign bit. A positive angle is considered upward toward the zenith. Resolution of angle is approximately 0.17 degrees. 
25. Azimuth data, bits 19-29, has a range of approximately +179.8 to -180 degrees. Bit 29 is used 
as the sign bit. A positive angle is considered right of the nose reference. Resolution of the angle is approximately 0.17 degrees. 
26. Data is encoded in BNR, 2's complement as defined in ARINC 429; with the exception of Note 
24 above. 
27. Reserved 28. Least Significant Bit is transmitted first in each data field. 29. Reserved 30. Same as Note 7 except that there is no application for the No Computed Data state, which 
therefore should not be used. The respective DISCRETES failure bit indications in the Maintenance Word shall persist as specified for the SSM Failure Warning indication in Note 7. 
31. RATE:  15-25 words per second. 32. RATE:  10-20 words per second. 33. Reserved 34. The SDI bits should be set to the code of the HPA(s) intended to receive and process the 
Command Word. 
35. The SDI bits should be set to the code of the ACU/BSU(s) intended to receive and process 
the Control Word. 
36. The Antenna TX Gain field is used to report gain variations at different steering angles to the 
SDU. The SDU will use this information from the selected subsystem to vary the HPA gain accordingly so as to maintain the same effective transmitted power from position to position, except for changes commanded by the GES. 
37. The HPA should indicate how many dB backoff it implements in this field. The SDU should 
utilize this information in its power control algorithm. 
38. "If a parameter can only be tested in certain circumstances (e.g., HPA Output VSWR Failure 
[HPA Maintenance Word bit 12] while power is being transmitted, or LNA/Diplexer Failed [ACU/BSU Maintenance Word bit 20] while the LNA is switched on), the failure indication should persist until a subsequent test or until the next monitored result indicates that the status has changed to "OK." 
39. If a discrete can be set to 'Failed' upon non-compliance of either of two test states (e.g., HPR 
BIT indicates 'on' when it should be 'off' or 'off' when it should be 'on'), both test states must pass in order to indicate "OK." 
40. If the LNA was being commanded 'off' before performing a Functional Test, the LNA should 
only be turned 'on' momentarily (< 100 ms) during Functional Test. 

## Arinc 429 Labels And Word Formats Used In The Aviation Satellite Communications System

41. Same as Note 17 except that there is no application for the No Computed Data State, which 
therefore should not be used. The same requirements as for the Failure Warning indication 
apply to the respective Discretes failure bit indications in the Maintenance Word. Failure Warning and respective DISCRETES failure bit indications should persist until all conditions and parameters are subsequently re-tested by appropriate tests and are found to be "OK."

Notes:  

1. One category for all equipments. 2. The lightning test category will be dictated by the placement of 
the antenna on the aircraft and the recommendations from the airframe manufacturer.  Antennas over six inches in height above the fuselage should be tested in a Zone 1 lightning category. 
3. Decompression test is the maximum operating altitude of the 
aircraft. 
4. This requirement can be satisfied by load analysis. 5. Test category dependent on the zone where the antenna is to 
be installed. 

## Attachment 4 Wiring Provisions For Internal High Speed Data

Provisions have been made to accommodate the addition of high speed data (HSD) services such as Inmarsat Swift64 and SwiftBroadband within the existing SDU, RFU and HPA architecture defined by this characteristic. This attachment provides guidance for aircraft wiring to accommodate these higher speed services. The specific interwiring to support HSD depends on the LRU which is chosen to host the HSD functionality. Various manufacturers may choose different LRUs to host the HSD function, depending on their pre-existing SDU, RFU and HPA implementations. As a result, a standardized interwiring scheme is not possible. This characteristic only defines the SDU, RFU and HPA rear connector pins to be set aside to allow the addition of HSD and provides general guidance on the interwiring necessary. 

The following diagram provides an overview of the user interfaces and system interwiring additions necessary to support HSD functionality inside the various LRUs.  A Type D diplexer/LNA (ARINC Characteristic 741, Part 1, Sections 2.2.4.3, 2.2.4.3.4, and ARINC characteristic 741, Part 2, Section 3.5.4.1.1) is required if SwiftBroadband services are provided.  Contact the specific manufacturer to determine the specific interwiring details appropriate for their implementation.

## Wiring Provisions For Internal High Speed Data Notes

61. 
Electrical Interface conforms to the ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI) standards at the S/T (Euro) interface.  
62. 
Electrical Interface conforms to IEEE 802.3 (10 Base-T).  
--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

63. 
Devices using the High Speed Data Ethernet, ISDN, or RS-232 interfaces must be 
wired only to the LRU that contains the HSD function.  The LRU that contains this function is manufacturer-specific.  
64. 
Wiring **for this signal** must be installed to support inclusion of the HSD capability in 
either the RFU or HPA (but not both).  In an HSD installation, an RFU or HPA that 
does not contain the HSD function must not interface to these circuits at **its** rear 
connector.   
65. 
For multi-channel HSD operation in the RFU or HPA (where each channel requires its 
own Swift64 Forward ID), the additional channels' IDs are assumed to be tabularly derived from the single base channel's programmed ID.  For SDU integration of HSD, this is likely to require an APM due to unavailability of spare program pins and the undesirability of airplane-unique ORTs. 
66. 
RFU HSDU Configuration Pins definition and interpretation details are shown in 
Attachment 4, Tables 4-3A through 4-3I. 
67. 
HPA HSDU Configuration Pins definition and interpretation details are shown in 
Attachment 4, Tables 4-4A **through** 4-4D. 
68. 
For the RFU HSDU, the CEPT E1 primary-rate ISDN interface may be wired to the cabin (e.g., the ARINC 746 CTU) or a compatible port on the SDU.  Strap option MP3D determines whether the protocol on this port is the telecommunications industry standard or as per ARINC 746.  For the HPA HSDU, this interface is defined by ARINC 746.  A CEPT E-1 interface to/from the cabin should only be connected to the RFU or HPA containing the High Speed Data function.  
69. 
Subscriber line interface circuit (two-wire POTS [plain-old telephone service]). 
70. 
DE-9-type RS-232 user interface (typically only used for test purposes). 
71. 
Wired to a maintenance terminal or PC for specialized on-aircraft maintenance. 
72. 
For the RFU HSDU, electrical characteristics are as per Attachment 1-4 Note 10 (i.e., 
current sink suitable for driving external 28VDC incandescent lamps).  For the HPA 
HSDU, electrical characteristics are either as per Attachment 1-4 Note 10, or suitable for driving the anode of an external LED with 10-25 mA from an HPA HSDU 5 Vdc source through a current-limiting resistor, returning to HPA HSDU common - consult the HPA HSDU manufacturer. 
73. 
Indicates that the HSD function has currently active failures that are preventing it from 
offering an HSD service in its defined user interface configuration. 
74. 
These discretes indicate availability of HSD service on the respective channels.  If the 
unit implements fewer than four channels, only the appropriate lower-numbered discretes will be pertinent and should be wired (e.g., only Ch 1 and Ch 2 for a twochannel unit). 
75. 
Enable HSD function = open (100,000 ohms or more), disable HSD function = ground 
(10 ohms or less to DC ground). 

## Attachment 4 Wiring Provisions For Internal High Speed Data

76. 
This HSD control/status wiring is required for some, but not all, HPA HSDUs - 
consult the SDU and HPA HSDU manufacturers.  In an HSD installation not including an HPA HSDU, the HPA must not interface to these circuits at its rear connector.  The protocol on this interface is manufacturer-specific.  This SDU 
interface is also reserved for use as the cross-talk bus between two SDUs in a dual system; as such, use of this interface between the SDU and the HPA HSDU may preclude a dual satcom configuration. 
77. 
The non-HSD HPA and the HPA HSDU utilize different electrical signal 
characteristics and functionality (ARINC 429 vs. 0-15V discrete) on pins TP2E, TP2F, TP2H and TP2J, with different interwiring requirements for those two applications.  Aircraft wiring for non-HSD HPAs is obviously not adequate for HPA HSDUs, but aircraft wiring for HPA HSDUs that utilizes these particular circuits may not be electrically compatible with non-HSD HPAs and their affiliated SDUs.  Consult the SDU, HPA and HPA HSDU manufacturers, and exercise appropriate caution. 
78. 
This note only applies to HPA pins TP6A through TP7K (not to the RFU HSDU).  
Note that in Attachment 1-4, these pins are Reserved for ATE (automatic test equipment) for non-HSD HPAs.  Such non-HSD HPA ATE circuits may not have been designed to be permanently grounded via aircraft wiring, as will be the case for some of the Swift64 Forward ID pins with the HPA HSDU.  As a result, non-HSD HPAs may be electrically incompatible with Forward ID strapping on these pins, and equipment damage may result if such non-HSD HPAs are installed on aircraft wired for HPA HSDUs.  Consult the HPA and HPA HSDU manufacturers, and exercise appropriate caution. 
79. 
In a non-HSD installation, these circuits are wired between the SDU and RFU (if 
any) for classic RFU functions.  For the case of an RFU HSDU, these circuits are used for HSD functions, as well as for any classic RFU functions that may remain.  The protocol on this interface is manufacturer-specific.

Same as for the non-HSD SDU; reference Attachment 1-4C.

## Attachment 4 Wiring Provisions For Internal High Speed Data Rfu Hsdu Configuration Pins Definition And Interpretation Rfu Hsdu Configuration Straps

Note: When installing the RFU HSDU, SDU Configuration pin TP10G must be strapped to indicate that the RFU HSDU is installed, reference Attachment 1-4C, Table 1-4 (TP10G). 

The electrical characteristics of these signals should be as specified in ARINC 741 Part 1, Attachment 1-4 Note 14. Pins assigned to bits required to take on binary 'one' state in a given code should be left open circuit. Pins assigned to bits required to take on binary 'zero' state in the code should be jumpered to pin MP3F, Discrete/Strap Common (taken from ARINC 741 Part 1, Attachment 1 - 4, Notes 14 and 38). 

The RFU HSDU should determine its Swift64 base Forward ID from discrete inputs. The RFU HSDU should use this single id to determine the four Swift64 id pairs.

## Notes:

1. "OK" status should always be indicated for equipment not installed or busses not used, as determined by the Satellite Data Unit system configuration pins or its design.   

2. Logic "1" state = one or more of channel modules 6 and beyond have failed; 
Logic "0" state = all of channel modules 6 and beyond are OK.   
3. Label 350 bits 26 and 27 are used in systems which include an RFU; systems that do not 
include an RFU (e.g., certain ARINC 761 configurations) use these Label 354 bits and the Label 350 bits to indicate failures, for compatibility with legacy as well as appropriately updated maintenance systems.  (Documentation for legacy maintenance systems may require explanatory notes regarding SATCOM systems that assert Label 350 bits 26 or 27, but do not include RFUs; for such systems, the pertinent LRU is the SDU, not the RFU. Updated maintenance systems can check for Label 350 bit 26 AND Label 354 bit 19 being set, or for Label 350 bit 27 AND Label 354 bit 20 being set, and if true, suppress the Label 350-triggered failure text (containing "RFU") in favor of the Label 354-triggered failure text (containing "SDU" instead of "RFU").

## Supplement 5 To Arinc Characteristic 741 Aviation Satellite Communication System Part 1 Aircraft Installation Provisions

Published: March 31, 1994 

## A. Purpose Of This Document

--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
This supplement introduces changes primarily in the areas of Standard Interwiring, Notes Applicable to Standard Interwiring, System Configuration Pins Definition and Interpretation, Connector Layouts and the ARINC 429 Labels and Word Formats used in the Aviation Satellite Communications System. A new Type B - diplexer/LNA characteristic is also defined. The Type B diplexer/LNA offers protection of GPS, GLONASS and TFTS receivers from unwanted interference from SATCOM transmissions. The old diplexer/LNA characteristics have also been retained as the Type A - diplexer/LNA. The Type A - diplexer/LNA offers protection of GPS receivers only. The concept of a SATCOM Switching Unit is introduced in Sections 1.5.11 and 2.2.7 as well as Attachments 1-2 and 1-14. 

## B. Organization Of This Supplement

In the past, changes introduced by a supplement to an ARINC Standard were identified by vertical change bars with an annotation indicating the change number. Electronic publication of ARINC Standards has made this mechanism impractical.

## 2.2.2.7 Noise Figure

Text was added to meet the overall system requirements for the receiver dynamic range which is specified in this document as well as the RTCA MOPS and the INMARSAT SDM. See also changes to Section 2.2.6.4. A commentary was also added to alert manufacturers and installers to the potential for interference from out of band sources causing an apparent degradation of the receiver system performance.  

## 2.2.4.3 Diplexer/Lna

Sections 2.2.4.3 and 2.2.4.4 have been combined into Section 2.2.4.3. Section 2.2.4.3 is now subdivided into Sections 2.2.4.3.1 and 2.2.4.3.2 to reflect that there are two different Diplexer/LNA electrical characteristics. One, Type A - Diplexer/LNA, offers protection for GPS receivers while the other, Type B, offers protection for GPS, GLONASS and TFTS receivers. 

## 2.2.4.3.1 Type A- For Protection Of Gps Only

This section was formerly in Sections 2.2.4.3 and 2.2.4.4. This section provides the Diplexer/LNA electrical characteristics for protecting GPS receivers against unwanted interference from SATCOM transmissions. 

## 2.2.4.3.2 Type B - For Protection Of Gps, Glonass And Tfts

This section provides new Diplexer/LNA electrical characteristics for protecting GPS, GLONASS and TFTS receivers against unwanted interference from SATCOM transmissions. The new electrical characteristics include changing "1530 - 1559 MHz (29 MHz)" to "1525 - 1559 MHz (34 MHz)" to reflect WARC spectrum reallocations. 

## 2.2.4.4 Reserved

## 2.2.5 High Power Amplifier (Hpa)

The 3rd, 5th, 7th and higher order Carrier-to-Intermodulation (C/IM) products are now specified to reduce SATCOM interference to GLONASS and TFTS receivers. The back-off adjustment was changed. New notes [6, 7, 8 and 9] were added. In the second paragraph of additional notes, a 25 db or greater gain reduction was added for transmit frequencies above 2000 MHz and below 1150 MHz. 

## 2.2.5.1 Harmonics And Spurious

Noise was deleted from the Section title. Frequency changes were made to reflect WARC spectrum reallocations from "1530 - 1559 MHz (29 MHz)" to "1525 - 1559 MHz (34 MHz)". The allowable spurious output from the HPA in any 1 MHz band was added. Additional commentary was added. These changes were made to help protect GLONASS and TFTS receivers from unwanted interference from SATCOM transmissions. 

## 2.2.5.2 Noise Figure

The noise figure was changed to allow a 1 dB degradation for every 1 dB of gain backoff without increasing the output noise density of the HPA. 

## 2.2.5.6 Hpa Muting And Carriers Off Level

The section header was changed. This section was modified to be consistent with the RTCA MOPS and INMARSAT SDM. The requirements are now stated in terms of absolute power rather than a level below the rated HPA output power. 

## 2.2.6.4 Loss Between Lna And Rfu

"SDU" was changed to "LNA" in the title. The total loss between the LNA output and the RFU input was changed from "25 dB" to "fall within the range 6 to 25 dB". See also changes to Section 2.2.2.7. A commentary was also added to alert manufacturers and installers to the potential for interference from out of band sources causing an apparent degradation of the receiver system performance.

## Supplement 6 To Arinc Characteristic 741 Aviation Satellite Communication System Part 1 Aircraft Installation Provisions

Published:  December 30, 1994 

## A. Purpose Of This Document

This supplement primarily introduces changes to the Radio Frequency Unit (RFU), Diplexer/Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), High Power Amplifier (HPA), coaxial cable loss, and High Gain Antenna (HGA) intermodulation Products which fall in the GNSS 
band areas of the interchangeability standards. A new Low Gain Antenna (LGA) system configuration was added. Changes are also introduced to the standard interwiring, notes applicable to the standard interwiring and related connector layouts. The system configuration pins definition and interpretation was updated to include definition of new pins for the Cabin Packet-mode Data Function (CPDF) (installed or not installed), 429 bus speed of AES ID input (high or low speed), and priority 4 calls to/from the cockpit (allowed or inhibited). In Attachment 2, the ARINC 429 labels and word formats were labeled with individual figure numbers, the SAL for the GSDB word sequence was corrected, and the notes section was revised. 

## B. Organization Of This Supplement

While the OPEN LOOP STEERING WORD's SSM contains "No Computed Data" or is absent for 1 second or more, the ACU/BSU should operate in Closed Loop Mode. If the next received CLOSED LOOP STEERING WORD's discrete "RX Carrier Frequency Status" is cleared to "SEARCH," the ACU/BSU will set the Operational Status field in the ACU/BSU STATUS WORD to "Omnidirectional" and operate its HGA in Omnidirectional mode. It should then proceed to follow the sequence outlined in Note 33. If the "RX Carrier Frequency Status" discrete in the CLOSED LOOP STEERING WORD is set to "FOUND" and Bit Sync is also indicated, the ACU/BSU will set the Operational Status Field in the ACU/BSU Status Word to "Closed Loop Tracking Mode Active" and enter that mode, bypassing the satellite acquisition sequence outlined in the commentary accompanying the ACU/BSU Status Word. 

## Figure 8 - Closed Loop Steering Word - Sdu To Acu/Bsu (Signal Quality - Sdu Multicontrol Output) Optional Word For Test Purposes Notes:

27. 
The ACU/BSU should operate in the Closed Loop mode when the SDU Open 
Loop Steering Word is either not received for one second after receipt of the last Open Loop Steering Word or when the SSM of that word indicates "No Computed Data." 
29. 
The C+N Data field is defined as the carrier plus noise (C+N) level as 
determined by the demodulator and is an eight bit BNR field which represents 
the RSS value of the demodulator, the square root of the sum of I2 and Q2 
integrated over approximately a 40 ms time period. Note:  The SDU will inhibit beam steering during this 40 ms period to assure a single beam position is observed. Alternatively an optional Signal Quality Test word providing an indication of Carrier-to-Noise ratio can be provided. 
33. 
When the SSM of the OPEN LOOP STEERING WORD contains "No 
Computed Data," the ACU/BSU will check the CLOSED LOOP STEERING WORD's discrete "RX Carrier Frequency Status" bit's state. If that discrete is cleared to "SEARCH," the ACU/BSU will set the Operational Status (OP.) field in the ACU/BSU STATUS WORD to "Omnidirectional," and set the HGA it controls to the Omnidirectional mode. The SDU will mute the HPA(s) during the ensuing Closed Loop Acquisition Mode. When the SDU is ready for the ACU/BSU to begin the satellite acquisition sequence, it will send "FOUND" in the "RX Carrier Frequency Status:  discrete of the CLOSED LOOP STEERING WORD. 
When the ACU/BSU detects that the SDU has FOUND the desired frequency's carrier, it will immediately change the state "Omnidirectional" mode in the STATUS WORD's Operational Status Field to "Acquisition Mode Active." While in the "Acquisition Mode Active" state, the ACU/BSU will move the beam when not inhibited by the "Steering Inhibit" discrete line from the SDU. The ACU/BSU must actually inhibit beam steering within no more than 10 ms after the Inhibit state has been set on the "Steering Inhibit" discrete line. Every 50 ms (nominally), the beam may be stepped to the next position. For each of these positions, the SDU will deliver one CLOSED LOOP STEERING 
WORD, with a carrier + noise (C+N) measurement for the previous beam position. The following timing diagram shows a typical sequence. 

 

## Acquisition Mode Timing

After all beam positions have been scanned, the ACU/BSU will position the beam to the angle with the highest C+N. The ACU/BSU will assume this is the angle which will provide the greatest signal strength on the desired frequency. The ACU/BSU will then place the state "Acquisition Complete" in the Operational Status code of the STATUS WORD. After the SDU indicates Carrier Lock, Bit Sync, and Frame Sync in the CLOSED LOOP STEERING WORD, the Operational Status code will display "Closed Loop Tracking Mode Active" indefinitely until the SDU replaces the state "No Computed Data" in the Sign Status Matrix of the OPEN LOOP STATUS WORD with "Normal Operation," causing the ACU/BSU to resume Open Loop operation. If the ACU/BSU discovered the "RX Carrier Frequency Status" discrete set to FOUND when it checked the CLOSED LOOP STEERING WORD along with Carrier Lock and Bit Sync, it will bypass the acquisition sequence outlined above, and immediately set the Operational Status field to "Closed Loop Tracking Mode Active," and enter that mode.
