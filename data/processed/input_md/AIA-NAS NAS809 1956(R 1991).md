## 4, Detail Requirements 4.1 Design

4.1.1 Gener&l: 
The seat shall be designed so that in any of its 
adjustable positions and when installed facing in a specif'ied direc­
tion or directions, it will provide protection for the occupant, 
i.e., pilot, cabin attendant, check pilot or passenger. 
4.1.1.1 Accommodation for Parachutes: 
Types II and III seats shall 
be designed to accommodate passengers wearing parachutes, 
except that Type II seats designed specifically for NORMAL 
CATEGORY AIHCRAFT need not comply with this requirement but 
shall be identified in the marking required in 4,2 as, 
11FOR NORMAL CATEGORY AiRCRAFT ONLY. 11 
4.1.1.2 Aft Facing Seats: 
The seat back height shall be sufficient 
to provide 36-1/2 inches support for the occupant as 
measured from the point of maximum seat cushion depression 
to the top of the seat back. 
This dimension may be 
deten::dned with the seat statically subjected to the loads 
specified in Table I, 
Padding for the back of the head 
should prevent 11bottoming 11 on the seat structure unless 
this structure is designed to absorb the remaining energy. 
4,1,2 Strength: All seats and berths intended for single occupancy shall 
be ciesigned for the ultimate loads specified in Table I. 
The loads 
shall be considered as acting separately and shall be based on a 
passenger weight of 170 pounds for Types I and IV seats and 190 
pounds (includes parachute) for Types II and III seats. The weight 
of the seat or berth i,imes the approximate 11g11 value shall be added 
to the ultimate loads specified in Table I. 
For seats intended for 
multiple occupancy the loads must be increased accordingly. 
Ultimate loads are 1.5 times the limit loads.

The reason for the down loads exceeding those prescribed in the emergency land­
ing conditions of the applicable Civil Air Regulations is to provide for the reduced weight gust-load-factor or special landing requirements which, in some cases, may be greater than the emergency landing loads.

4.1.2.1 Pilot and Co-Pilot Seat Loads: 
In addition to the loads 
specified in Table I above, pilot and co-pilot seats 
shall be designed to withstand the following rearward 
loads applied 8 inches above the intersection of the seat 
back and seat bottom to provide for the application of 
pilot forces. to the flight controls: 

Type I seats

when in the most vertical position, shall withstand the 
· following airplane forward loads applied separately:

back with the load C.G. located 10.5 inches up from the 
base of the seat back as described in the note in 
Section 4.J.l.

the seat back with the load C.G. located 10.5 inches up 
from the base of the seat back as described in the note 
in Section 4.3.1.

specified above shall be acceptable if they are found to 
be appropriately related to tests and to inspection 
procedures. 
4.1.2.4 Ultimate Load Strength: 
The seat or berth in any of its 
adjustable positions, when installed facing-in a specified 
direction or directions and when occupied by maximum num­
ber of occupants, shall be capable of withstanding ultimate 
loads without failure for at least three (3) seconds. 
4.1.2.5 
Limit Load Strength: 
The seat or berth in any of its 
adjustable positions shall be capable of withstanding the 
limit loads without suffering detrimental permanent defonna­
tion. At all loads up to these limit loads the def'onnation 
shall be such as not to interfere with safe operation of 
the airplane. 
(Note: 
this limit load requirement is not 
applicable to the forward or the 3 11g11 side loading since 
it is an emergency condition.) 
4.1.3 Attachments: - For Types I, II and III seats and berths the strength 
of the seat or berth attachments to the structure and safety belt or 
shoulder harness attachments to the seat or structure, shall be 1.33 
times the ultimate loads specified in Table I except that the down 
load need not be considered for the safety belt or shoulder harness 
attachments. When anchorages for safety belts are provided, they 
should be of a type which will pennit self-aligning of the belt or 
fitting. 
For berth belt attachments, the factor shall be 1.15. 
4.1.4 Projections: 
The surfaces of the seat shall be free from sharp 
edges or projections which may chafe the safety belt or shoulder 
harness webbing. 
Projections, sharp corners, and other hazardous 
features, against which the seat occupant may be thro'Wll during a 
crash, shall be avoided insofar as possible. 
Any unavoidable 
features of this nature shall be padded to prevent serious head, 
neck or chest injury to the occupa.ᄑts. 
4.2 Marking: 
Each seat or berth shall be legibly and pennanently marked with 
the following information:

4.3 Qualification j'ests: 
Tests shall be conducted as necessary to demonstrate: 
(a) 
that the seats or berths are capable of supporting the limit loads 
without detrimental permanent deformation; 
(b) 
that, at all loads up to limit loads, the deformation shall be such 
as not to interfere with the safe operation of the a_ircraft;

separately. 
If it can be shown that failure of an arm rest on a seat assembly does not reduce the degree of safety afforded the occupant, such failure will not be cause for rejection. 

4.3.1 Detail Qualification Test Requirements: 
The seat or berth shall be 
loaded in tests such that the loads imposed on the seat or berth by 
the occupant(s) in conjunction with the safety belt or belts and 
their attachments are accurately simulated by means of a block or 
frame or dummy which is restrained in the seat or berth by the belt 
or belts attached to their fittings. 
The te sts may be conducted in 
a jig simulating installation conditions. 
The ultimate loads, when 
applied separately, 'Will se rve to simulate the loads imposed by the 
occupant.
