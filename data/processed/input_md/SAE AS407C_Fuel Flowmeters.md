## 6. Individual Performance Requirements:

All instruments or components of such shall be subjected to whatever tests the manufacturer deems necessary to demonstrate specific compliance with this Aeronautical Standard including the following requirements where applicable.

## 6.1 Scale Errors:

The instrument scale error shall be determined at all major graduations.  This test shall be conducted by subjecting the instrument first with rates of flow increasing, then with rates of flow decreasing. With the rate of flow increasing, the rate shall be brought up to, but shall not exceed, the rate specified to give the desired reading, and with the rate of flow decreasing, the rate shall be brought down to, but shall not fall below, the rate specified to obtain the desired reading.  The error at each major graduation shall not exceed 3% of full scale reading.  The difference between the reading on increasing rate of flow and the reading on decreasing rate of flow at each major graduation shall not exceed 1% of full scale reading.

## 6.2 Dielectric:

Each instrument shall be tested by the methods of inspection listed in paragraphs 6.2.1 and 6.2.2.

6.2.1
Insulation Resistance: The insulation resistance measured at 200 volts DC for five seconds between all electrical circuits connected together and the metallic case shall not be less than 5 megohms.  Insulation resistance measurements shall not be made to circuits where the potential will appear across elements such as windings, resistors, capacitors, etc. since this measurement is intended only to determine adequacy of insulation.
6.2.2
Overpotential Tests: Equipment shall not be damaged by the application of a test potential between electrical circuits and between electrical circuits and the metallic case.  The test potential shall be a sinusoidal voltage of a commercial frequency with an RMS value of five times the maximum circuit voltage or per paragraphs 6.2.2.1 or 6.2.2.2 whichever applies.  The potential shall start from zero and be increased at a uniform rate to its test value.  It shall be maintained at this value for five seconds and then reduced at a uniform rate to zero.
Since these tests are intended to assure proper electrical isolation of the circuit components in question, these tests shall not be applied to circuits where the potential will appear across elements such as windings, resistors, capacitors, etc.

6.2.2.1
Hermetically sealed instruments shall be tested at 200 volts RMS.
6.2.2.2
Circuits that operate at potentials below 15 volts are not to be subjected to Overpotential tests.

## 6.3 Leak Test:

The transmitter shall be tested for leaks immediately after the scale error test while the flow chamber is still moist from gasoline, but with all free gasoline drained out.  The flow chamber shall be subjected t an air pressure of 40 psi and sealed off.  During a five-minute period, there shall be no change in pressure indicated on a test gage capable of accurately distinguishing minimum changes of 0.125 psi.

## 6.4 Position Error:

The difference in indicator reading when the indicator is rotated from the normal position to any other position shall not exceed 2-1/2% of full scale reading.

## 7. Qualification Tests:

As many instruments as deemed necessary to demonstrate that all instruments will comply with the requirements of this section shall be tested in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.

## 7.1 Low And High Temperature:

The instrument shall be subjected to the applicable low and high temperatures as specified in paragraph 3.3.1, Column A for 3 hours.  The scale errors determined for the indicator with gasoline also at the same temperature shall not exceed 6% of full scale value.  Following this test and while still at the same temperature, the leak test of paragraph 6.3 shall be repeated.

## 7.2 Extreme Temperature Exposure:

The instrument shall, after alternate exposures to the applicable low and high temperatures specified in paragraph 3.3.1, Column B for a period of 24 hours each and a delay of 3 hours at room temperature following completion of the exposure, meet the requirements of paragraph 6.1.  There shall be no evidence of damage as a result of exposure to the extreme temperatures specified herein.

## 7.3 Magnetic Effect:

The magnetic effect of the indicator shall be determined in terms of the deflection of a free magnet, approximately 1-1/2 inches long, in a magnetic field with a horizontal intensity of 0.18, plus or minus 0.01 gauss, when the indicator is held in various positions on an east-west line with its nearest part five inches from the center of the magnet. (An aircraft compass with the compensating magnets removed therefrom may be used as the free magnet for this test.)  The maximum deflection of the magnet shall not exceed one degree for any pointer deflection.

## 7.4 Humidity:

The instrument shall be mounted in its normal operating position in a chamber maintained at a temperature of 70 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 95 ± 5% for a period of six hours.  After this period, the heat shall be shut off and the instrument shall be allowed to cool for a period of 18 hours in this atmosphere in which the humidity rises to 100% as the temperature decreases to not more than 38 °C.  This complete cycle shall be conducted:

a.
Five times for instruments located in uncontrolled temperature areas.
b.
Once for instruments located in controlled temperature areas.
Immediately after cycling, there shall be no evidence of damage or corrosion which affects performance following this test and the instrument shall be subjected to the scale error at room temperature test of 6.1.  The change in reading between this test and the original scale error at room temperature test shall not exceed 2% of full scale reading.

## 7.5 Vibration:

7.5.1
Resonance: The instrument, while operating (fuel flowing through the transmitter), shall be subjected to a resonant frequency survey of the appropriate range specified in Section 3.3.3 in order to determine if there exists any resonant frequencies of the parts.  The amplitude used may be any convenient value that does not exceed the maximum double amplitude and the maximum acceleration specified in Section 3.3.3. The instrument shall then be subjected to vibration at the appropriate maximum double amplitude or maximum acceleration specified in Section 3.3.3 at the resonant frequency for a period of one hour in each axis or with circular motion vibration whichever is applicable.  When more than one resonant frequency is encountered with vibration applied along any one axis, a test period may be accomplished at the most severe resonance, or the period may be divided among the resonant frequencies, whichever shall be considered most likely to produce failure.  The test period shall not 
be less than one-half hour at any resonant mode.  When resonant frequencies are not apparent within the specified frequency range, the instrument shall be vibrated for two hours in accordance with the vibration requirements schedule (Section 3) at the maximum double amplitude and the frequency to provide the maximum acceleration.
7.5.2
Cycling: The instrument, while operating (fuel flowing through the transmitter), shall be tested with the frequency cycled between limits specified in Section 3.3.3 in 15-minute cycles for a period of one hour in each axis at an applied double amplitude specified in Section 3.3.3, or an acceleration specified in 3.3.3 whichever is the limiting value or a total of three hours for circular motion vibration, whichever is applicable.
After the completion of this vibration test, no damage shall be evident and the instrument shall meet the applicable requirements of Section 6.

## 7.6 Blocked Movable Element:

The pressure drop with the transmitter movable element blocked in the zero flow position, measured by any suitable method, shall not exceed the values tabulated below:
