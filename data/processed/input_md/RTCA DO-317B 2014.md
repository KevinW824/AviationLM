## 1 Purpose And Scope 1.1 Introduction

This document contains Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for the Aircraft Surveillance Applications (ASA) System. These standards specify system characteristics that should be useful to designers, manufacturers, installers and users of the equipment. These MOPS for the ASA System contain requirements for processing, control and display of traffic and Ownship information for use by the flight crew in performing airborne applications. Compliance with these standards is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operation. Any regulatory application of this document is the sole responsibility of appropriate governmental agencies. 

Section 1 of this document provides information needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated in the remaining sections. It describes typical equipment operations and operation goals, as envisioned by the members of RTCA Special Committee 186 (SC-186) and EUROCAE Working Group 51 (WG-51), and establishes the basis for the standards stated in Sections 2 through 3. Definitions and assumptions essential to proper understanding of this document are also provided in this section. 

Section 2 contains the Minimum Performance Standards for the equipment. These standards specify the required performance under standard environmental conditions.  
Section 3 includes recommended bench test procedures necessary to demonstrate equipment compliance with the stated minimum requirements. 

Section 4 describes the performance required of installed equipment. Tests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. 

This document considers functional requirements consisting of: airborne surveillance and separation assurance processing (ASSAP), and cockpit display of traffic information 
(CDTI) as described in the Aircraft Surveillance Applications (ASA) Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS), RTCA Document DO-289, and in the Safety, Performance and Interoperability Requirements documents for the applications developed by RTCA SC-186 and EUROCAE WG-51: ATSA-AIRB (DO-319/
EUROCAE DOCUMENT ED-164), ATSA-VSA 
(DO-314/ED-160), ATSA-ITP 
(DO-312/ED-159) ATSA-SURF (DO-322/ED-165), TSAA (DO-348/ED-232), and CAVS (DO-354/ED- 233). Operational performance standards for functions or components that exceed the stated minimum requirements are identified as optional features. 

The word "function" as used in this document includes all components and units necessary for the system to properly perform as intended. The functional requirements are allocated so that most input and output between the ASA system and the aircraft interacts with the ASSAP functional block. Functions that display data to the flight crew or accept input from the flight crew are allocated to the CDTI functional block. ASSAP 
and CDTI should not be misinterpreted to be synonymous to hardware architecture. ASSAP and CDTI functions may be allocated to a hardware architecture as the manufacturer desires, not considering approval processes. If the functional implementation includes a computer software package, the guidelines contained in DO-178C / ED-12C, Software Consideration in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, should be considered. 

The initial Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) implementations on aircraft are expected to be a mixture of DO-260 / ED-102 (Version 0), DO-260A (version 
1), DO-260B / ED-102A (Version 2), DO-282A and DO-282B and ED-108A.  During the interim state, prior to universal Version 2 equipage, ADS-B receivers may make use of Version 0 and Version 1 transmissions for the advisory applications as described in this document. Future applications may require more rigorous parameter validation either via certification approval or real-time validation. 

Note:   Documents referenced with empty parentheses, such as DO-260() / ED-102() or 
DO-282(), refer to all versions of the document.  References to specific document versions include an indication of the revision.   

## 1.1.1 Revisions To Previous Version

Revisions to the previous version of this document (DO-317A) include: 

•
Addition of the Traffic Situation Awareness with Alerts (TSAA) application
•
Addition of the CDTI Assisted Visual Separation (CAVS) application
•
Addition of Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) traffic designation
support
Note:   ACAS traffic designation support is a feature that uses the ASA System user 
interface as a means to specify that ACAS performs alternate logic on the designated target.  The operational concept for ACAS alternate logic features is being developed by RTCA SC-147 / EUROCAE WG75. 

## 1.2 System Overview

The ASA system provides the avionics for the surveillance processing and display of aircraft-to-aircraft applications.  It is part of the larger aviation system described in the ASA MASPS (DO-289) and the avionics performing the functions needed to support or perform the applications developed by RTCA SC-186 and EUROCAE WG-51, ATSA-AIRB (DO-319/ED-164), ATSA-VSA (DO-314/ED-160), ATSA-ITP (DO-312/
ED-159) ATSA-SURF (DO-322/ED-165), TSAA (DO-348/ED-232), and CAVS 
(DO-354/ED-233).

## 1.2.1 Aircraft Surveillance Applications

The ASA MASPS includes three major subsystems.  Figure 1-1 provides an overview of the standard ASA architecture and depicts the interfaces between functional elements for an ASA aircraft participant. Note that the ADS-B transmit and receive subsystems are specified in DO-260() / EUROCAE ED-102() and DO-282() and ED-108() for the 1090 
MHz and Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) and Very High Frequency Data Link Mode 4 (VDL4) systems respectively.    
This ASA system MOPS specifies the two standard subsystems for the ASA Receive Participant: 

•
Surveillance data processing subsystem: ASSAP.
•
Display and control subsystem: CDTI.
The blocks in Figure 1-1 labeled ASSAP and CDTI collectively are referred to as the ASA system and are the scope of this document.  The ASA system also interfaces with other aircraft systems. 

Appendix J describes the system interfaces depicted in Figure J-1.  It also provides a mapping of latency requirements to relevant SPR and other MOPS documents. Traffic Information Service-Broadcast (TIS-B) messages are generated from information obtained through ground surveillance systems.  TIS-B messages are broadcast by the TIS-B Transmit Subsystem. ADS-B Rebroadcast (ADS-R) provides traffic information to equipped aircraft based on ADS-B transmission from aircraft on independent data links 
(1090ES and UAT and VDL4).  
ADS-B, TIS-B and ADS-R messages are received by the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B Receive Subsystem at the receiving ASA Aircraft/Vehicle (A/V).  The ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B Receive Subsystem processes these messages and provides ADS-B, TIS-B, and ADS-R 
traffic reports to ASSAP.  

## 1.2.2 Asa System Function

The ASA system provides the platform for the processing and display of the ASA applications.  This document includes requirements to support applications approved by SC-186 and EUROCAE WG-51.  The applications are described in Section §1.3.   
In order to provide more complete traffic situation awareness, the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) display should be integrated with the CDTI on aircraft equipped with TCAS.  This document provides requirements and guidance for integration of TCAS with the ASA system.  See Appendix B.  TCAS in this document is meant to include all versions of certified traffic advisory systems (TAS), TCAS and TCAS II (including hybrid surveillance).   

## 1.2.2.1 Assap

ASSAP is the processing subsystem that accepts surveillance inputs (e.g., ADS-B 
reports), performs surveillance processing to provide reports and tracks, and performs application-specific processing.  Surveillance reports, tracks, and any application-specific alerts or guidance are output by ASSAP to the CDTI function.  ASSAP surveillance processing consists of track processing and correlation of ADS-B, TIS-B, ADS-R, and TCAS reports.  

## 1.2.2.2 Cdti

The CDTI subsystem includes the actual display media and the necessary controls to interface with the flight crew.  Thus the CDTI consists of all displays and controls necessary to support the applications.  The controls may be a dedicated CDTI control panel or it may be incorporated into other controls, (e.g., multifunction control display unit [MCDU] or Electronic Flight Bag [EFB]). Similarly, the CDTI display may be a stand-alone display or displays (dedicated display(s)) or the CDTI information may be present on an existing display(s) (e.g., multi-function display) or an EFB.  At a minimum, CDTI includes a graphical plan-view (top down) traffic display, in these MOPS referred to as the Traffic Display, and the controls for the display and applications (as required). 

## 1.2.2.3 Tsaa Installations Without A Traffic Display

The TSAA application may be installed without a Traffic Display. In this type of installation, the user interface functionality may be provided via an annunciator panel or individual lamps and controls. See Section §2.4.1.   
Note: 
The TSAA SPR (DO-348/ED-232) refers to installations without a Traffic Display as "class 1".  This is not consistent with the terminology used in these MOPS.

## 1.3 Operational Application(S) 1.3.1 Supported Applications

The standards defined in this version of the ASA system MOPS support the applications listed below: 

•
Enhanced Visual Acquisition (EVAcq)
•
Basic Airborne Situation Awareness (AIRB)
•
Basic Surface Situation Awareness (SURF)Visual Separation on Approach
(VSA)
•
In-Trail Procedure (ITP)
•
Traffic Situation Awareness with Alerts (TSAA)
•
CDTI Assisted Visual Separation (CAVS)
EVAcq defines the requirements ASA systems must meet to provide ADS-B enhanced traffic situation awareness.  The AIRB application defines the requirements ASA systems must meet to provide a foundation for additional applications (SURF, VSA, ITP and CAVS) and to provide enhanced traffic situation awareness.  SURF, VSA, ITP, TSAA 
and CAVS are all optional applications. 

1.
The EVAcq and the AIRB applications are very similar. On top of the EVAcq
requirements, a minimum AIRB installation also needs to provide Traffic ID, Traffic
Category (i.e., Emitter Category) and Traffic Ground Speed for display to the flight crew.  The AIRB application includes the preferred minimum basic situation
awareness functionality and is the minimum baseline for adding other applications,
excluding the TSAA application which can be included with either EVAcq or AIRB.
The EVAcq application is envisaged to only be installed on smaller aircraft.
2.
TSAA can use either EVAcq or AIRB requirements as a foundation for its requirements.  TSAA without a Traffic Display utilizes only the ASSAP requirements
from EVAcq.
A description of each of the applications follows: 
Enhanced Visual Acquisition (EVAcq): CDTI provides traffic information to assist the flight crew in visually acquiring traffic out the window.  This application is expected to improve both safety and efficiency by providing the flight crew enhanced traffic awareness.  Refer to DO-289 for a complete EVAcq description. 

Basic Airborne Situation Awareness (AIRB): CDTI provides traffic information to assist the flight crew in visually acquiring traffic out the window and provide traffic situation awareness beyond visual range.  This application is expected to improve both safety and efficiency by providing the flight crew enhanced traffic awareness.  This application also provides Flight ID and ground speed of selected traffic.  Refer to DO-319/ED-164 for a description of the AIRB application. 

This document modifies one aspect of the operational concept described in DO-319/ED-164.  The ASA MOPS version of the AIRB application allows for display of ground traffic including ownship.   
Basic Surface Situation Awareness (SURF):  In this application, the CDTI includes an airport surface map underlay, and is used to support the flight crew in making decisions about taxiing, takeoff and landing.  The underlaying map may depict runways only, or runways, taxiways, and other movement areas.  This application is expected to increase efficiency of operations on the airport surface and reduce the possibility of runway incursions and collisions.  Refer to DO-322/ED-165 for a description of the SURF 
application.  
This document modifies one aspect of the operational concept described in DO-322/ED-
165: A compromise was made when integrating the traffic quality requirements for SURF, AIRB, and VSA for traffic on approach.  The quality required by this document does not support the operational concept of using CDTI to determine which runway traffic is aligned with at airports with closely spaced parallel runways.  Therefore SURF 
implementations compliant with these MOPS may not be used to determine which runway the traffic is aligned with at closely spaced parallel runways.  This limitation should be included in pilot's guides and other training materials. 

Visual Separation on Approach (VSA): The CDTI is used to assist the flight crew in acquiring and maintaining visual contact during visual separation on approach.  The CDTI is also used in conjunction with visual, out-the-window contact to follow the preceding aircraft during the approach.  The application is expected to improve both the safety and the performance of visual separation on approach.  It may allow for the continuation of visual separation on approach when they otherwise would have to be suspended due to the difficulty of visually acquiring and tracking the other preceding aircraft. Refer to DO-314/ED-160 for a complete VSA description. 

In-Trail Procedure (ITP): The objective of the In-Trail Procedure (ITP) is to enable aircraft that desire flight level changes in procedural airspace to achieve these changes on a more frequent basis, thus improving flight efficiency and safety.  The ITP achieves this objective by permitting a climb-through or descend-through maneuver between properly equipped aircraft, using a new distance-based longitudinal separation minimum during the maneuver.  The ITP requires the flight crew to use information derived on the aircraft to determine if the initiation criteria required for an ITP are met.  The initiation criteria are designed such that the spacing between the estimated positions of ownship and surrounding aircraft is no closer than an approved distance throughout the maneuver.  ITP requires specific application-unique processing and display parameters. Refer to DO-
312/ED-159 for a complete ITP description. 

Traffic Situation Awareness with Alerts (TSAA): Traffic Situation Awareness with Alerts (TSAA) is an application that is intended to reduce the number of mid-air collisions and near mid-air collisions involving general aviation aircraft.  TSAA provides voice annunciations to flight crews to draw attention to Target Aircraft and also adds visual cues to the underlying basic traffic situation awareness.  The TSAA application uses ADS-B information, and where available Automatic Dependent Surveillance- Rebroadcast (ADS-R) and Traffic Information Service-Broadcast (TIS-B) information to provide the flight crew with indications of nearby aircraft in support of their see-andavoid responsibility. 

Analysis has shown that it is safe to install and operate TSAA on helicopters; however the sample TSAA algorithm was not optimized for helicopter operations in close proximity, such as electronic news gathering.  As a result, when implementing the sample algorithm there may be a set of helicopter operations where performance is undesirable. 

TSAA may be implemented without a Traffic Display (see §1.2.2.3).  
CDTI Assisted Visual Separation (CAVS):  Similar to VSA, the CDTI is used to assist the flight crew in acquiring and maintaining visual contact with a preceding aircraft (designated traffic) while performing a visual separation on approach procedure in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC).  The fundamental difference between VSA and CAVS is that the flight crew is authorized to use the information provided by the CDTI for the preceding aircraft, after visual acquisition and cross correlation on the CDTI, as a substitute for out the window information while performing the CAVS procedure. Therefore, once the preceding aircraft has been acquired by correlating the traffic on the CDTI with a visual acquisition of the traffic out-the-window, the CAVS procedure can continue through the use of the Traffic Display when the traffic information out-thewindow is no longer available (for example, lost in lights during approach at night). CAVS can be used for parallel runway operations; however it cannot be used for designated traffic closer than the Caution "CAVS Minimum Range" Alert threshold. 

## 1.3.1.1 Application History

DO-317, Aircraft Surveillance Applications System (ASAS) MOPS, was first published in April 2009.  It included support for five initial applications defined in DO-289. Following publication of DO-317, RTCA and EUROCAE formed a Requirements Focus Group (RFG) to harmonize their similar applications into a unified standard.  This resulted in the publication of DO-317A/EUROCAE ED-194 in December 2011, and a change of the title to Aircraft Surveillance Applications (ASA) System MOPS to avoid confusion with other uses of the ASAS acronym in Europe.  In this document, four of the initial DO-317 applications were harmonized with European applications to form three RFG harmonized applications.  One of the initial DO-289 applications (EVAcq) was maintained to support the most basic General Aviation users. The Conflict Detection application, which was considered to be immature, was deleted.  One new harmonized application, In-Trail Procedure, was added.  Table 1-1 lists the resulting harmonized applications included in DO-317A / ED-194 together with the applications defined in DO-317 and in the RFG SPRs prior the harmonization.

## 1.3.2 Future Applications

Some future applications may demand significantly more application-specific processing, and provide spacing, separation and self-separation functionality in all weather conditions.  As such, the ASA system designer may wish to consider providing system expansion capability to support additional future applications.  It is also likely the future applications will replace the initial applications by providing all-weather support.  These MOPS includes some guidance for supporting future applications. Future applications may remove certain traffic from other application processing.  For example, traffic may be chosen for a parallel approach application, and the processing of that application would subsume monitoring of that traffic by a more general conflict detection application.  Several A/Vs may be designated concurrently for these applications. Controls and displays may also be affected by the addition of future applications, as applications may be used for only specific tasks in certain airspaces.  It is likely that future applications will not rely solely on using the Traffic Display, but also on alerts and guidance, and possibly other application-specific displays.   
ASA Capability Level (ACL) has not been addressed within this document.  The ACL 
concept was included in DO-289 due to concerns about the number of possible combinations of applications, and human factors issues relating to the use of these applications.  These issues do not apply to the applications included in this version, as there is no need for ground systems, or other users, to know the capabilities of an individual aircraft.  Use of some type of ACL may be required for future applications. Transmit Quality Level (TQL) has not been addressed within this document.  The TQL concept was included in DO-289 to address transmit quality factors that have not been included in DO-242 and DO-242A compliant link MOPS.  The additional quality information is not needed to support the applications addressed in this version of the ASA 
system MOPS.    

## 1.3.3 Application Integration

In this document, an underlying situation awareness application is the foundation of the optional applications (VSA, SURF, ITP, TSAA, and CAVS).  In order to provide enhanced capabilities to the flight crew, some designers may choose to implement additional applications described in this document.  In most cases, AIRB is the foundation for these additional applications; however EVAcq may also serve as the foundation for TSAA.  For systems implementing TSAA without a Traffic Display, the ASSAP requirements from EVAcq are used as the foundation of TSAA, and no additional applications are permitted.  Each application has specific quality requirements for both ownship and traffic (see Section 2).  As such, consideration should be given to the integration of the implemented applications. Appendix Q provides information and examples for consideration in application integration, specifically how the data requirements change for the ownship and the traffic as the ownship transitions from one application to the other in different phases of flight.  

## 1.4 Intended Function

The intended function of equipment built to the specifications in these MOPS is to provide the processing and human-system interface that support the requirements of the applications described in Section §1.3.  The equipment will perform its intended function(s) as defined by this document and the manufacturer, and its proper use will not create a hazard to other aircraft.  

## 1.5 Assumptions 1.5.1 Assap Assumptions

The design and operational performance requirements and guidelines presented in Section §2.2 of this document were developed based on the following assumptions and limitations.    

## 1.5.1.1 Ownship Position

The position source for ownship provides position updates at least once per second. Ownship horizontal position data will be delivered to ASSAP such that the Latency Compensation Error (between interfaces A3 and B3) is less than 600 ms.  
It is assumed that ASSAP and CDTI use the same ownship position source.  Section §4.1.8 provides requirements for installations where this assumption does not apply. The pressure altimetry system of the ownship is assumed to perform as well as or better than what is required during current operations. 

Note: Current altitude system performance for transponder-based surveillance is defined in ICAO Annex 10.  

## 1.5.1.2 Traffic Position

The pressure altimetry and reporting system of the Transmit Domain is assumed to perform as well as or better than what is required during current operations. 

Note: Current altitude system performance for transponder-based surveillance is defined in ICAO Annex 10.  

## 1.5.1.2.1 Ads-B Traffic

The Total Latency of horizontal position data from ADS-B Traffic is less than 2.0 
seconds measured from interface A1 to interface D. The Latency Compensation Error between interface A1 and interface D is less than 1.5 seconds for version 0 and 1 traffic and less than 0.6 seconds for version 2 traffic.   

## 1.5.1.2.2 Ads-R Traffic

ADS-R will not add more than 1.0 second to the Total Latency of the traffic horizontal position data.  ADS-R will not add more than 0.1 second of Latency Compensation Error to the traffic horizontal position data.  

## 1.5.1.2.3 Tis-B Traffic

The Total Latency between interface A2 and interface D is less than 3.25 seconds for airborne traffic and less than 2.0 seconds for ground traffic.  The Latency Compensation Error between interface A2 and interface D is less than 0.6 seconds for airborne traffic and less than 0.5 seconds for ground traffic. 

For TIS-B service provided in the United States, the following is assumed with respect to SDA and SIL.  The probability that TIS-B Service introduces any error into a TIS-B 
Message is less than or equal to 1.0E-5 per message.  This probability of error includes the linear position extrapolation process using the instantaneous velocity reported for a target.  The Source Integrity Level (SIL) is a Surveillance and Broadcast Services (SBS) system-wide configured value and is set to 2 by default.  The Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) is computed for TIS-B messages based on the configured SIL value, the target's NACP (described below), and the containment error 'tail' based on radar plot error assumptions.  Radar PARROTs and the Airport Surface Detection Equipment, Model X (ASDE-X) system are monitored for faults and excessive biases.  The SIL 
supplement is always encoded as 1 to indicate that the probability that a TIS-B target exceeds the NIC containment radius is calculated on a per sample basis.  Although the SDA and SIL supplement are not transmitted over the 1090ES link, they should be assumed to be the values stated in this document by avionics processors in support of the relevant applications. TIS-B messages indicating aircraft on the ground are only provided when data is available from a multilateration system.  The surface application traffic data requirements are met by the TIS-B service in the United States at the airports where multilateration systems are deployed. 

## 1.5.1.3 Ads-B Reports

All ADS-B Reports generated by the ADS-B link receiver are subject to track initiation and update criteria as defined by the appropriate link MOPS (DO-260() / ED-102(), DO-
282() and ED-108()).  Therefore, ASSAP is required to track all reports received from the ADS-B receiver.  ASSAP uses state vector and mode status reports as defined in DO- 
242().  Traffic horizontal position data will be delivered to ASSAP such that the Total Latency between time of reception (interfaces D) and time of delivery of data to ASSAP (interface E) is less than 500 ms.  Time of Applicability at interface D is assumed to 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
equal the time of reception at interface D.  The data is recommended to be delivered to ASSAP in such way that ASSAP is able to compensate for any latency introduced by the receiver.  If ASSAP is not able to compensate for receiver latency the Latency Compensation Error introduced by the receiver must be included in the ASSAP compensation error budget, refer to Section §2.2.3.6.   
The installation's report format supports distinction between ADS-B, ADS-R and TIS-B 
sources. 

## 1.5.1.4 Dual Link Transmissions From Traffic

These MOPS assumes that the ground system does not uplink a dual link transmitting aircraft as an ADS-R or TIS-B Target.  The FAA Surveillance and Broadcast Service System (SBSS) complies with this assumption. 

## 1.5.1.5 1090Es Duplicate 24-Bit Address

In the 1090ES system, decoding messages and correlating data to the correct aircraft/vehicle depends on unique addresses.  Although duplicate address events should be unlikely, provisions are included to handle such occurrences.  1090ES receiving subsystems compliant with DO-260B / ED-102A or later are required to output separate reports for aircraft/vehicles containing a duplicate address.  The 1090ES receiver produces and outputs separate reports when duplicate addressed aircraft/vehicles are within receiver coverage.  Although non-position information is included, it cannot be correctly associated with the proper aircraft/vehicle.  Data from the other participant will often be contained in a report.  Therefore, ASSAP cannot correlate the information to the proper individual track unless additional processing is performed.  These tracks are identified by the 1090ES receiver as duplicates so ASSAP should discard non-position information, unless ASSAP includes additional processing to improve correlation beyond the minimum requirements of DO-260B / ED-102A.  Without additional data tracking, tracks identified as duplicates will be processed as Version 0 since the status messages which contain the Version indication cannot be correlated.  

## 1.5.1.6 24-Bit Mode S Address With Tcas Track Updates

The ASSAP example architecture will use the Mode S address from TCAS when available.  Existing interface documents (i.e., ARINC 735B) do not support this assumption. ASSAP implementations that are external to TCAS line replaceable units (LRUs) may not have access to TCAS traffic Mode S address.  It is possible to meet ASSAP requirements without the Mode S address on TCAS traffic. 

## 1.5.1.7 Dual Link Receiver

ASSAP requirements and test scenarios and the reference system design in Appendix C do not address the case of dual link receivers on the ownship.  The FAA Ground infrastructure utilizes bits in the Version 2 ADS-B transmissions to detect the receiver capability on the aircraft.  However, Dual link receivers may receive ADS-B on one link and ADS-R on the other link for the same aircraft.  In this case, ADS-R may be disregarded.  While it is not prohibited to use ADS-R to update a track, it is not a minimum requirement.  Likewise, Dual link receivers may receive ADS-B on both links from Dual link transmit aircraft. In this case, one link may also be disregarded.  Dual link transmit aircraft are assumed to use the same 24-bit Address for both links. 

## 1.5.1.8 Tis-B Service Status

Requirements in this document for TIS-B and ADS-R Service Status assume that the ground station is providing a combined TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status message on both the UAT and 1090ES links in the format described in Appendix H.  VDL4 supports a dedicated TIS-B Service Status message and it is assumed that currently it is only required to support TIS-B services.  However, if VDL4 is required to support ADS-R 
then the standards can be easily updated to provide for a combined TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status message in a similar manner to UAT and 1090ES.  Appendix H also provides information and an example implementation for the TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status annunciation. 

## 1.5.1.9 Vdl4 Support For Tis-B And Ads-R

This version of the MOPS assumes that VDL4 will not be used to support TIS-B and ADS-R as there are no known planned operational implementations of TIS-B or ADS-R 
using VDL4.  Therefore any ASSAP function used solely with VDL4 will not need to support TIS-B and ADS-R functionality.  However, VDL4 has the capability to support both TIS-B and ADS-R and more information on this capability is contained in Appendix H.   

## 1.5.1.10 Tis-B & Ads-R Ground Infrastructure

For implementations operating in the US, ASA Systems will interoperate with the FAA 
Ground Infrastructure as described by the SBS Surveillance and Broadcast Services Description Document.    

## 1.5.1.11 24-Bit Addresses

A Single 24-bit Address will be used onboard an aircraft across all links.   
Note: This will be the Mode S address for installations with a Mode S transponder. 

## 1.5.1.12 Airborne/On Ground Status

ASSAP relies on the Airborne/On Ground Status reported in the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B 
message.  It is assumed that the installation's report format includes this element. Therefore ASSAP requirements do not include any logic to infer this status. 

Note: It is recognized that some installations will report Airborne at all times including while on the surface.  This is not considered a serious concern for these initial applications, but subsequent versions of these MOPS may include validation of the reported Airborne/On Ground Status.   

## 1.5.1.13 1090Es Data Link Versions

1090ES receiving subsystems supporting this version of the ASA system will process: 

•
Version 2 messages formatted per the requirements of DO-260B/ED-102A,
•
Version 1 messages formatted per the requirements of DO-260A, and
•
Version 0 messages formatted per the requirements of DO-260/ED-102.
These MOPS assumes that reports sent to ASSAP will be labeled as to whether they are from Version 0, 1, or 2 transmitting systems. Version 0 reports will have their Navigation Uncertainty Category (NUC) converted to the Navigation Integrity Category (NIC), Navigation Accuracy Category for position 
(NACP) and Source Integrity Level (SIL) parameters per Appendix N of DO-260B/ED-
102A.  Version 1 reports, where they differ from Version 2, will also be addressed per Appendix N of DO-260B/ED-102A. 

Note: The terms NIC and SIL refer to both the parameters and the supplements. 

Ownship 1090ES transmitting and receiving subsystems supporting ASA system installations will comply with DO-260B/ED-102A or later. 

## 1.5.1.14 Uat Version

UAT receiving subsystems supporting this version of the ASA system will process: 

•
Version 2 messages formatted per the requirements of DO-282B, and
•
Version 1 messages formatted per the requirements of DO-282A.
These MOPS assumes that reports sent to ASSAP will be labeled as to whether they are from Version 1 or 2 transmitting systems. Version 1 reports, where they differ from Version 2, will be converted per Appendix R of DO-282B. Ownship UAT receiving subsystems supporting ASA system installations will comply with DO-282B or later. 

## 1.5.1.15 Vdl4 Version

For VDL4 there is only one version, this is described in ED-108A.  This version is equivalent to 1090ES Version 1. The update rate for VDL4 messages is 2.5 seconds and the probability of detection is 
0.97. 

## 1.5.1.16 Transmitted Message Information Integrity

ASSAP processing assumes all received message data originates from approved installations and thus do not overstate any accuracy or integrity parameters. 

## 1.5.2 Cdti Assumptions

The CDTI design and operational performance requirements and guidelines presented in Section 2.3 were developed based on the following assumptions and limitations. 

## 1.5.2.1 Source Selection

If multiple sources of surveillance data are used, ASSAP will provide the best source information available.   
Note: See §2.2.3.3 for determination of best source. 

## 1.5.2.2 Cdti Display Platform

The CDTI data may be presented on a stand-alone display dedicated to traffic information only, or part of a shared/multi-function display, or an EFB. These MOPS do not include an exhaustive or comprehensive list of shared/multi-function display considerations or requirements. 

## 1.5.2.3 Display Depictions

The requirements are focused on 2-dimensional plan view graphical display depictions. 

These MOPS do not address 3-dimensional, non-graphical, or head-up displays (HUDs). 

## 1.5.2.4 Integration Of Cdti With Other Display Functions

The CDTI and associated alerting, if any, will be properly integrated with other display functions and will not interfere with critical functions or other alerting. 

## 1.5.2.5 Units Of Measure

The ASA system MOPS requirements assume a flight deck philosophy based on the use of nautical miles for distance, knots for speed and feet for altitude.  If the requirements are implemented in a flight deck using different units of measure, the requirements for distance, speed and altitude should be changed to equivalent or appropriate values. 

## 1.5.2.6 Map Database

The SURF application assumes an underlying airport surface map.  The map database includes all runways and runway identifiers for the supported airports (i.e., runways have not been filtered out of the database for a supported airport). When implementing SURF with taxiways, the map database includes all taxiways and taxiway identifiers for the supported airports. The map database is assumed to meet 5.0 meter accuracy and 1.0 meter resolution for displayed data elements. 

Note:  Airport elevation may be determined referenced to runway threshold elevation, airport survey control point, or touchdown zone elevation. 

The airport map database uses World Geodetic System-1984 (WGS 84) as its reference datum or, alternatively, uses WGS 84 as horizontal reference datum and MSL as vertical reference datum. 

Note:  If the airport map database is using MSL as vertical reference datum, it should allow conversion of the MSL altitude to WGS 84 height above ellipsoid such that it can be compared with the Global Positioning System (GPS) height above the ellipsoid.  For this, the database manufacturer needs to indicate the geoid model used to develop the database such that vertical data can be compared with the GPS vertical outputs in WGS 84 without additional conversion error. 

The information elements of the underlying airport map are assumed to be valid for the current Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control (AIRAC) defined cycle.

Note: It is the responsibility of the end user to ascertain airport map data currency. 

The end user has means to be aware of the currency of the underlying airport map. The information elements of the underlying airport map will be at DO-200A / ED-76 
essential data integrity quality. 

Note:  Essential data quality allows for undetected data corruptions of up to 10-5 per 
data item processed.  Data item processing refers here to prior to installation on the aircraft.  Per DO-272C / ED-99C, not all airport map elements in an airport 
map database, meeting medium data quality, may be at essential data integrity quality (e.g., the airport reference point may only be at routine data integrity 
quality). 

## 1.6 Test Procedures

The test procedures specified in this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the performance requirement.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred.  These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information. In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. 

The order of tests specified suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design, and design qualification, into operational use.  For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2 shall have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section 3. 

a.
Environmental Tests
Environmental test requirements are specified in subsections of Section 3 for ASSAP, CDTI and alternate systems.  The procedures and their associated limits are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations. Unless otherwise specified, the environmental conditions and test procedures contained in DO-160G / ED-14G, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, will be used to demonstrate equipment compliance.

b.
Bench Tests
Bench test procedures are specified in Sections §3.2 (ASSAP), §3.3 (CDTI) and §3.4
(alternate systems).  These tests provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Sections §2.2, §2.3, and §2.4 respectively.  Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance, for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design. 

c.
Installed Equipment Tests
The installed equipment test procedures and their associated limits are specified in Section 4.  Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included in the installed equipment test, their successful completion is a precondition to completion of the installed test.  In certain instances, however, installed equipment test may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from or to other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc.  Installed tests are normally performed under two conditions:

•
With the aircraft on the ground and using simulated or operational system inputs.
•
With the aircraft in flight using operational system inputs appropriate to the equipment under test.
Test results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the intended operational environment.   

## 1.7 Definition Of Terms

This section contains definition of terms used in this document that may have ambiguous or multiple meanings or that are not normally used in RTCA/EUROCAE standards.  See Appendix A for additional definition of terms.  Terms specific to the test sections are included in Section §3.2.1 for ASSAP and Section §3.3.1 for CDTI.   
SHALL: A mandatory requirement.  An approved design must comply with every requirement, which can be assured by inspection, test, analysis, or demonstration. SHOULD: A recommendation that would typically improve the equipment, but does not constitute a requirement. MAY: A permission that would likely improve the equipment, but does not constitute a requirement. 

Note: Notes are in italic and are used for commentary and clarification of requirements and recommendations. 

## 1.7.1 Select And Designate

Flight crew action is required to control the ASA system.  Applications may be selected for use, and specific traffic aircraft may be selected for additional information.  Also, some applications may operate only on specific aircraft that have been designated for the application.  Select and Designate, as used in this document, are high-level terms for these functions, and do not imply specific flight crew action as specified in ARINC 735B.  
Note: The term "designate" replaces the term "couple" used in ASA MASPS (DO-289) 
and the original ASAS MOPS (DO-317). 

The Select feature provides additional information, displayed in a data block, on the selected traffic.  The additional information may be a combination of common data, and data items specific to the active application.     
Note: The display of additional traffic information on all traffic may be accomplished by other means. 

The Designate feature provides a set of capabilities to support applications that operate on specifically designated traffic.  These capabilities include: 

•
Ability to designate and un-designate specific traffic elements for a specific application
•
Prevent traffic that is invalid for the application from being designated
•
Distinguish the designated traffic on the Traffic Display
•
Link the designated traffic to the particular application (for ASSAP)
•
Indicate loss of designated status to the flight crew.
CAVS requires Designate features.  AIRB, VSA and ITP may use Designate features, depending on the implementation.   

## 1.8 Additional Information

A supplement to these MOPS is available from RTCA and EUROCAE.  This supplement is in the form of a single zip archive.  One portion of this archive decompresses into the stimulus test data (scenarios) described in Sections §3.2.7 through §3.2.10 of these MOPS.  The data files reflect all appropriate surveillance sources for the scenario (e.g., ADS-B, ADS-R, TIS-B and TCAS) and are provided separately for 1090ES, UAT, and VDL4 implementations where necessary (due to the differences in state vector construction for each).  Additionally, truth data is provided for ownship and traffic aircraft. Truth data represents the ideal aircraft states without the addition of surveillance error. Appendix C of this document describes sample ASSAP processor algorithms (oriented to a 1090ES split state vector installation).  Appendix S of this document describes sample ITP application algorithms.  Appendix T of this document describes a sample TSAA application algorithm.  MATLAB implementations of these algorithms were developed in support of these MOPS.  The other portion of the archive contains the MATLAB files that constitute the sample ASSAP and ITP implementations.  The zip file will extract into the following directory structure: 

1.
ASSAP_test_data

Application_processing_test_data
This directory includes EVAcq and AIRB polar region test data and ITP test data for all implementations.

b. Surveillance_processing_test_data 
This directory contains surveillance processing test data for 1090ES, UAT, and VDL4 implementations. 

2. Sample_implementations 
a. ASA_sample_1090ES_implementation 
This directory contains the MATLAB files that constitute the sample 
1090ES ASSAP implementation with a CDTI mockup.

This directory contains the MATLAB files that constitute the sample ITP implementation (for all links). 

## 2 Equipment Performance Requirements 2.1 General Requirements

General equipment requirements need not be tested in the test procedure subsection.  If a requirement needs to be tested, it is not a general requirement and should be included in Section §2.2 for ASSAP, §2.3 for CDTI, and §2.4 for alternate systems. 

## 2.1.1 Airworthiness

In the design and manufacture of the equipment, the manufacturer **shall** provide for installation so as not to impair the airworthiness of the aircraft. 

## 2.1.2 Intended Function

The equipment **shall** perform its intended function(s), as defined by the manufacturer, and its proper use **shall** not create a hazard to other aircraft.   

## 2.1.3 Federal Communications Commission Rules

All equipment **shall** comply with the applicable rules of the Federal Communication Commission or (outside of the USA) the relevant International Telecommunications Union Radio Regulations.   

## 2.1.4 Fire Protection

All materials used **shall** be self-extinguishing except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire. 

Note: One means of showing compliance is contained in Federal Aviation Regulations 
(FAR), Part 25, Appendix F. 

## 2.1.5 Operation Of Controls

The equipment **shall** be designed so that controls intended for use during ground or flight operations cannot be operated in any position, combination or sequence that would result in a condition detrimental to the reliability of the equipment or operation of the aircraft. 

## 2.1.6 Effects Of Test

The equipment **shall** be designed so that the application of specified test procedures is not detrimental to equipment performance following the application of the tests, except as specifically allowed. 

## 2.1.7 Design Assurance

The hardware and software **shall** be designed and developed such that the probability of providing misleading information (MI) and the probability of loss of function are acceptable based on the overall allocated system integrity and continuity requirements, respectively.  These requirements apply when the equipment is in its installed configuration for the most stringent operation supported.  To demonstrate compliance, it will be necessary to conduct a safety assessment to evaluate the system's implementation against known failure conditions.  
Design assurance of the ADS-B In system is not represented in the System Design Assurance (SDA) field.  The SDA field represents the design assurance of the ADS-B 
Out system installation. 

Note: For ASSAP architectures integrating with functions requiring a higher level of 
design assurance (e.g., TCAS), the system designer can apply a single design assurance level to an entire hardware item (based upon most severe application) or a hardware item may be evaluated as having separate functional failure paths 
(FFPs) in order to accommodate a mix of design assurance levels.  The hardware safety assessment may use various qualitative and quantitative assessment methods.  These may include fault tree analysis (FTA), common mode 
analysis, failure modes and effects analysis, and statistical reliability analysis 
methods for applicable quantitative assessment of random faults.  Reference 
RTCA DO-254 /EUROCAE ED-80.  Software partitioning may also be employed to address different design assurance levels. 

## 2.1.8 Latency

These MOPS contain a series of latency requirements.  An end-to-end detailed latency description is provided in Appendix J.  The latency requirements are expressed both as end-to-end ASA system requirements and as specific requirements allocated to ASSAP, CDTI and TSAA without a Traffic Display in Sections §2.2, §2.3 and §2.4.1.  The latency requirements also include latency budget for systems outside the scope of these MOPS; assumptions on such latency contributions are made in Section §1.5.  All the latency requirements and assumptions in these MOPS are to be considered as not to exceed (NTE) values, i.e., upper or lower bounds.  
These MOPS recommend allocations of the total latency for individual functions in Table 
2-4.  For interchangeability reasons it is recommended that manufacturers follow these allocations.  For the same reason it is also recommended that manufacturers publish latency specifications for their equipment.   

## 2.1.9 Equipment Classes

ASA equipment classes are defined by the avionics equipment functionality they provide for each of the applications listed in Table 2-1.  The four equipment functionalities are Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI), CDTI (Surface Only), Airborne Surveillance and Separation Assurance Processing (ASSAP), and TSAA annunciator panel.  The CDTI class provides Traffic Display and system control functionality per Section §2.3.  The surface only CDTI class is meant to allow the SURF application to be deployed on equipment developed to a less stringent design assurance level.  The ASSAP class provides traffic tracking and application processing functionality per Section §2.2. 

The class for TSAA without a Traffic Display is described in Section §2.4.1. The applicable requirements for each equipment class are identified in Appendix L.

## 2.2 Airborne Surveillance And Separation Assurance Processing (Assap) Subsystem Requirements 2.2.1 Introduction

ASSAP is a function that receives surveillance reports on other aircraft/vehicles from multiple sources and derives traffic surveillance and application-specific information for the CDTI. ASSAP receives ADS-B / ADS-R / TIS-B reports that are assembled by the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B Receive subsystem from corresponding ADS-B / ADS-R / TIS-B messages.  ASSAP surveillance processing consists of correlation, and track processing of ADS-B, ADS-R, TIS-B and TCAS (if equipped) traffic reports.  ASSAP application processing provides the application-specific processing of all ASA applications.  
Note: Future ASA system MOPS that include other applications may also provide guidance information to the CDTI.  
It is recognized that manufacturers may implement separate ASSAP and CDTI functions, or a single integrated function that satisfies the requirements of both the ASSAP and CDTI functions.  The ASSAP requirements have been written to allow this implementation flexibility.  For the purposes of these MOPS and the following sections, the phrase "ASSAP equipment" refers to the equipment providing the ASSAP functionality and does not imply any implementation or design.    
This section defines the general requirements for the ASSAP function.  The ASSAP subsystem provides the necessary surveillance and application-specific processing of the ASA system.  ASSAP also maintains the interface with the CDTI Display and Control Panel subsystem.  The combination of the aircraft data sources on the receiving aircraft, the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B Receive Subsystem and the ASSAP function make up the ASA System Receive System.  This is illustrated in Figure 2-1. 

The entire ASA System Receive System is responsible for the reception and processing of ownship data as well as the reception of ADS-B, ADS-R and TIS-B messages from other A/Vs and ground systems.  This is for the purpose of supporting ASA application processing and providing aural and visual ASA system-specific information to the flight crew.  Section §2.2 specifies requirements that apply specifically to the ASSAP 
functionality occurring between interfaces E and F as illustrated in Figure 2-1. 

ASSAP surveillance requirements include track initiation, update, deletion, extrapolation and prediction; track merging and splitting; inter-source correlation (TIS-B & 
ADS-B/ADS-R; TCAS & others; TIS-B & Ownship) and best selection of data sources. 

A functional representation of the ASSAP surveillance processing is shown in Figure 2-3. 

The ASSAP function may be implemented in stand-alone equipment, integrated with the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B Receive equipment or integrated with other systems.  The ASSAP 
requirements remain applicable when integrated in these alternative implementations. The remainder of Section §2.2 is organized by: Input/Output, Surveillance Processing, Application Processing and Monitoring.  

## 2.2.2 Assap Input/Output Requirements

This section summarizes ASSAP input/output interfaces to other subsystems as shown in Figure 2-2 below.  

## Figure 2-2  Summary Of Assap Input/Output Interfaces

The following subsections contain basic ASSAP input/output requirements that are required to support the respective applications.  Depending on implementation, the EVAcq or the AIRB application requirements must be met as a minimum.    

Note: Requirements delimited with "when available" indicate that ASSAP must receive 
the information if it is supplied by the data source. 
The SURF, VSA, ITP, and CAVS, applications are optional; but when they are implemented, the AIRB requirements, together with the requirements designated for the optional applications, must be met.    
The TSAA application is optional.  When TSAA is implemented with a CDTI, either the AIRB or EVAcq requirements, together with the requirements designated for TSAA, must be met. AIRB requirements must be met if TSAA is implemented with any additional optional applications. TSAA may be implemented using an annunciator panel without a Traffic Display.  In such implementations, the ASSAP requirements for EVAcq are the foundation of TSAA. These implementations are not required to meet the Traffic Display requirements.    
Note: All applications except TSAA require a Traffic Display. TSAA may use an annunciator panel in addition to a Traffic Display.  

## 2.2.2.1 Evacq Input/Output Requirements

This section defines the ASSAP input/output requirements to support the EVAcq application. 

## 2.2.2.1.1 Assap Input Requirements From Ads-B/Ads-R/Tis-B Receiver

This section defines the traffic state data, traffic ID/status data, and TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status data supplied to the ASSAP function from the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver.  Reception of various data links will be possible which may include 1090 
Megahertz (MHz) Extended Squitter (1090ES), Universal Access Transceiver (UAT), or Very High Frequency Data Link Mode 4 (VDL4).  The requirements specified in this section are meant to define the minimum required traffic data set needed to support ASSAP. Specific ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver and data link requirements can be found in the MOPS for 1090 MHz (DO-260B / ED-102A [and later]), UAT (DO-282B), and VDL4 (ED-108A). 

## 2.2.2.1.1.1 Traffic State Vector Report Input Requirements

Traffic state data is information describing the aircraft state that is normally changing (e.g., position, altitude, and velocity).  The following traffic state data is required for ASSAP in accordance with RTCA DO-260B / EUROCAE ED-102A and RTCA 
DO-282B and EUROCAE ED-108A or later versions of these documents.  For earlier versions of these documents, requirements may be translated into corresponding parameters. 

a.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2000) receive the Time(s) of Applicability (TOA) of the
received traffic state data from the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B Receiver.
Note: For 1090ES, each of these reports was triggered by either a position message reception or a velocity message reception.  The report includes both position and velocity and the TOA for position and the TOA for velocity.  Of these two, the more recent TOA indicates which type was just received.  

b.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2001) receive the Horizontal Position latitude/longitude 
referenced to WGS 84 from the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver.
c.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2003) receive the Heading (i.e., true or magnetic
heading) or Ground Track for ground traffic from the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver
when available.
Note: True heading or true track angle is used for determining ground traffic directionality and position estimation.  If magnetic heading is received from ground traffic, then it may be considered invalid or may be converted to true reference using ownship magnetic variation based on present position.  Since any ground traffic that is relevant to ownship will be within relatively close proximity to ownship (for instance, 10 miles), changes in magnetic variation between ownship's location and traffic's location will be minimal, even in areas with large magnetic variation gradients.  Thus the complexity of calculating different magnetic variation values for each individual traffic element can be avoided.  

d.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2004) receive N/S and E/W velocities from the
ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available.
e.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2002) receive the Ground Speed for ground traffic from
the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available.
f.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2005) receive the Pressure Altitude from the
ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available.
g.
When Geometric Altitude is used to determine Relative Altitude (optional), the
ASSAP function **shall** (2006) receive the Geometric Altitude from the
ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available.
h.
When Geometric Altitude is used to determine Relative Altitude (optional), the
ASSAP function **shall** (2300) receive the Geometric Vertical Accuracy (GVA) from
the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available.
i.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2007) receive the Vertical Rate from the
ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available.
Note: Since the received vertical rate data may be noisy, ASSAP designers may
consider in their implementation to filter (smooth) the Vertical Rate data 
based on receiving Vertical Rate Type (i.e., Geometric or Barometric) from 
the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available. 
j.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2010) receive the Air/Ground State from the
ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available.
Note: The ASSAP system may, under the condition that the user is made aware, e.g., 
through design specifications, choose not to process (Heading, Ground Track, and Ground Speed from ground traffic) and forward ground traffic to the CDTI. 
It is recommended that EVAcq implementations process and forward ground traffic to the CDTI.   

## 2.2.2.1.1.2 Traffic Id/Status Data Report Input Requirements

Traffic ID/status data (e.g., Flight ID) is information about the aircraft that generally changes less frequently than the traffic state data.  The following Traffic ID/status data is required for ASSAP in accordance with DO-260B / ED-102A (and later), and DO-282() 
and ED108A.   

a.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2012) receive the 24-bit Address from the
ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver.
b.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2013) receive the Address Qualifier (indicating whether
the 24-bit Address is a 24-bit ICAO address or another kind of address) from the
ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available.
c.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2016) receive the Navigational Accuracy Category for
Position (NACP) from the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available.
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

d. The ASSAP function **shall** (2017) receive the Navigational Accuracy Category for 
Velocity (NACV) from the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available. 
e. When used to display the Emergency/Priority Status (optional), the ASSAP function 
shall (2019) receive the Emergency/Priority Status from the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B 
receiver when available. 
f. The ASSAP function **shall** (2020) receive the link version number from the 
ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available. 
g. The ASSAP function **shall** (2301) receive the System Design Assurance (SDA) from 
the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B receiver when available. 

## 2.2.2.1.1.3 Tis-B/Ads-R Service Status Input Requirements

For systems that don't receive information from TCAS, the ASSAP function **shall** (2302) 
receive the TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status message from the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B 
Receiver when available.   

## 2.2.2.1.2 Assap Input Requirements From Tcas

The following TCAS traffic information is required for systems that receive information from TCAS. 

a. The ASSAP function **shall** (2021) be capable of receiving a traffic capacity of at least 
30 tracks from TCAS. 
Note: A traffic capacity of 30 tracks is based on supporting the TCAS II tracking capacity for active surveillance (Reference DO-185B / ED-143 TCAS II MOPS Section 2.2.4.6.1 Surveillance Track Capacity).  If TCAS provides more tracks than ASSAP's traffic capacity, then ASSAP should accept the highest priority tracks.  TCAS usually provides all tracks in the order of priority. 

b. The ASSAP function **shall** (2022) receive the TCAS Track ID from TCAS when 
available. 
Note: The TCAS Track ID is a unique identifier that identifies the traffic for which data is being provided.   

c. The ASSAP function **shall** (2023) receive the Traffic 24-bit Address from TCAS 
when available. 
d. The ASSAP function **shall** (2024) receive the Traffic Range from TCAS when 
available. 
Note: ASSAP designers must consider in their implementation that the type of range from TCAS may be represented as either slant or horizontal range relative to ownship's position. 

e. The ASSAP function **shall** (2025) receive the Traffic Bearing from TCAS when 
available. 
f. The ASSAP function **shall** (2026) receive the Traffic Pressure Altitude from TCAS 
when available. 
g.
To determine the displayed Traffic Vertical Direction, the ASSAP function shall
(2303) receive either the Traffic TCAS Vertical Sense or the Traffic Pressure
Altitude Rate from TCAS when available.
Note: The TCAS Vertical Sense is an indication whether the traffic vertical direction is climbing, descending, or level. 

h.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2028) receive the Traffic TCAS Alert Status (i.e., no
threat, proximity traffic, traffic advisory, resolution advisory) from TCAS when available.

## 2.2.2.1.3 Assap Input Requirements From Ownship Position Source

This section defines the ownship state data and ownship quality data supplied to the ASSAP function from the ownship position sources.   
The ASSAP function **shall** (2030) use the same data source for all of the following ownship parameters:  

•
horizontal position
o
latitude
o
longitude
•
horizontal position accuracy data (e.g., horizontal figure of merit [HFOM])
•
horizontal position integrity data (e.g., horizontal integrity limit [HIL])
•
horizontal velocity
o
N/S velocity
o
E/W velocity
•
horizontal velocity accuracy data (e.g., HFOMR)
•
geometric vertical position (height above ellipsoid)
•
vertical position accuracy data (e.g., VFOM)
•
geometric vertical rate
If the horizontal position data from a position source is not valid, then no data from that source **shall** (2031) be accepted. 

1.
An ASSAP data source may have a position, velocity or vertical rate blended from
multiple sensors (e.g., an IRS and GNSS).
2.
The term "position source" used in this document is a potential source of position
and velocity information that may be used by ASA system equipment.  It is not meant
to imply that the same source is used for navigating the aircraft.
The ASSAP and CDTI functions should use the same ownship position sources as that used by the transponder for transmission.  If an aircraft architecture uses separate position sources for ASSAP or CDTI and the ADS-B Out system, the ASSAP function should monitor both sources.  If the difference between the horizontal position of the separate sources exceeds the sum of the Integrity bounds of those sources, then the monitor should indicate this divergence to the flight crew via the CDTI.  Some ADS-B operations may not be advised under these conditions.  Aircraft Flight Manuals should indicate what the limitations are when this condition is detected and any possible corrective actions. 

Note: Future applications may require that ASSAP, CDTI, and the ADS-B Out equipment use the same position source.  System designers should plan accordingly to prevent extensive redesign. 

## 2.2.2.1.3.1 Ownship State Data Input Requirements

Ownship state data is information describing the ownship state that generally changes rapidly (e.g., position, altitude, and velocity).  The following ownship state data is required for ASSAP. 

a.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2032) receive the TOA of the received ownship state
data from the ownship position sources.  In an unsynchronized installation, time of
receipt may be used to represent TOA.
b.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2033) receive the Horizontal Position based on 
referenced to WGS 84 latitude/longitude from the ownship position sources.
c.
When used, the ASSAP function **shall** (2034) receive the N/S and E/W Velocities
from the ownship position sources when available.
Note: The magnitude of velocity from ownship should be used for any computations with traffic velocities (i.e., do not use ownship ground speed since it is ground referenced).   

d.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2037) receive the Pressure Altitude from the ownship
position sources when available.
e.
When Geometric Altitude is used to determine Relative Altitude (optional), the
ASSAP function **shall** (2038) receive the Geometric Altitude from the ownship
position sources when available.
f.
For systems that receive information from TCAS or when used to determine relative
bearing for traffic sent to the CDTI, the ASSAP function **shall** (2041) receive the
True Heading from an ownship source when available.
g.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2042) receive the 24-bit Address from the ownship
sources when available.
h.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2045) receive the ownship Air/Ground State.

## 2.2.2.1.3.2 Ownship Quality Data Input Requirements

Ownship quality data is very similar to traffic quality data; however, as the information comes directly from the ownship position source it is not yet categorized into NIC, NAC 
and SIL values.  The following ownship quality data is required for ASSAP. 

a.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2046) receive the Horizontal Position Uncertainty when
available.
b.
When Geometric Altitude is used to determine Relative Altitude (optional), the
ASSAP function **shall** (2047) receive the Vertical Position Uncertainty when
available.
c.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2048) receive the Horizontal Velocity Uncertainty when
available.  For ownship sources that don't provide Horizontal Velocity Uncertainty,
the Horizontal Velocity Uncertainty performance may be established by analysis of
the installed equipment.  If the Horizontal Velocity Uncertainty is established this way, the analysis must be approved during the installation approval process.

## 2.2.2.1.4 Assap Input Requirements From Cdti

The ASSAP function **shall** (2054) be capable of receiving and processing the CDTI 
outputs to ASSAP as defined in Section §2.3.2.4 Outputs from CDTI to ASSAP. 

## 2.2.2.1.5 Assap Output Requirements To Cdti

This section defines the traffic, alert, ownship, and ASSAP status output requirements from the ASSAP function to the CDTI. 

The ASSAP function **shall** (2055) provide validation status information (e.g., valid/invalid flags) for each data element provided to the CDTI. 

Note: No longer providing the data element (e.g., label or data word) may be another 
method of inferring valid/invalid status. 
The ASSAP function **shall** (2397) provide TCAS tracks to the CDTI when TCAS is chosen as the best or only source (see Section §2.2.3.3). 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1 Traffic Information Output Requirements

The following subsections contain traffic information output requirements from the ASSAP function to the CDTI.  Output data **shall** (2056) be calculated and updated at least once per second. 

Note: This section specifies the information elements to be output from ASSAP but does 
not specify a format for the information. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.1 Traffic Output Capacity

The ASSAP function **shall** (2057) provide a traffic capacity of at least 60 tracks to the CDTI.  
When CDTI is prioritizing traffic, the ASSAP function **shall** (2039) provide a traffic capacity of at least 120 tracks to the CDTI.  
Note: The traffic capacity requirements above are based on supporting 30 airborne tracks with the remaining tracks reserved for closest ground traffic. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.2 Traffic Priority

Traffic is prioritized to ensure that the most relevant traffic is available for display on the CDTI.   
Implementations that include the SURF application use a different priority when SURF is active.  When the SURF application is active, airborne and ground traffic 
(aircraft/vehicles on ground) are prioritized independently and both provided to CDTI.  
When the SURF application is not active, the ASSAP function **shall** (2059) provide airborne and surface tracks to the CDTI in order to support displaying traffic in the following priority:  

1. TCAS Resolution Advisory 2. TCAS Traffic Advisory  
3. TSAA Traffic Caution Alert (See note 6) 
4. Designated Traffic 5. Selected Traffic 
6. Nearby Airborne Traffic (see note 3) 
7. Other Traffic (see note 4) 
When the SURF application is implemented and active, the ASSAP function **shall** (2387) 
provide airborne and surface tracks to the CDTI in order to support displaying traffic in the following priority:  

## Airborne Traffic:

1. TCAS Resolution Advisory 2. TCAS Traffic Advisory  
3. TSAA Traffic Caution Alert (See note 6) 
4. Designated Traffic 5. Selected Traffic 6. SURF Airborne Relevant Traffic (see Section §2.2.2.1.5.1.2.1) 
7. Nearby Airborne Traffic (see note 3) 
8. Other Airborne Traffic  

## Ground Traffic:

1. Designated Traffic 2. Selected Traffic 
3. SURF on-ground Relevant Traffic (see Section §2.2.2.1.5.1.2.1) 
4. Other Ground traffic 
For systems integrated with TCAS, tracks with Resolution Advisory or Traffic Advisory priority levels **shall** (2388) be ordered in the track priority assigned by TCAS.  All other tracks **shall** (2389) be ordered by range within a priority level, or by an alternative criteria suited to the specific application. 

1. Priority items not implemented in a particular system are skipped (e.g., priority for 
Resolution Advisories and Traffic Advisories do not apply to systems that are not integrated with TCAS).  
2. This traffic priority is not the same as used for legacy TCAS-only displays (e.g., 
TCAS does not include Designated or Selected Traffic features). 
3. Nearby Airborne Traffic is defined in Appendix §A.2. 
4. Other Traffic may include ground traffic. 
5. System designers should consider that future applications may require additional 
priority items. 
6. This includes both initial and updated traffic alerts. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.2.1 Surf Relevant Traffic

Traffic that is viewed from ownship's current state is "relevant" if that traffic position, orientation, and movement leads to or could potentially lead to a runway incursion or collision within a foreseeable period of time. When ownship is on ground, the Relevant Runway is the closest runway within 300 meters of ownship.  When ownship is between parallel runways, the Relevant Runway can be both runways or the runway in the direction of travel.  If there is no runway within 300 meters of ownship, there is no Relevant Runway and hence no SURF Relevant Traffic. When the ownship is in the air, the Relevant Runway is the runway to which the aircraft is on approach.  If ownship is not on approach, there is no Relevant Runway and hence no SURF Relevant Traffic.  
SURF airborne Relevant Traffic are defined as: 

1. 
Traffic on approach to the Relevant Runway. 
2. 
Traffic on approach to a runway that crosses the Relevant Runway. 
SURF on-ground Relevant Traffic are defined as: 

1. 
Traffic on the Relevant Runway. 
2. 
Traffic on a runway that crosses the Relevant Runway. 
3. 
Traffic at the holding position(s) of the Relevant Runway. 
1. SURF Relevant Traffic may use additional criteria beyond the minimum requirement. 2. Traffic on the parallel taxiway is not considered SURF relevant traffic. 3. An acceptable means to determine traffic on a runway or traffic holding at a runway 
is to include all traffic within 30 meters of the runway edges. 
4. Traffic on approach is defined as Airborne Traffic from GND up to 1000 ft Above 
Field Elevation and within 3 NM of the runway threshold.  This definition allows for 
traffic approaching parallel runways. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.3 Track Id

a. The ASSAP function **shall** (2061) provide a Track ID for traffic sent to the CDTI. 
b. When new traffic has been added due to traffic being dropped, the new traffic **shall** 
(2062) use a new Track ID (not the same Track ID that was used for the dropped traffic).   
c. Dropped track IDs **shall** (2063) not be reused for at least 2 seconds.  
Note: The Track ID is a unique identifier that identifies the traffic for which data is being provided.   

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.4 Traffic Altitude

a. The ASSAP function **shall** (2073) provide Traffic Altitude for airborne traffic sent to 
the CDTI when available. 
b. Traffic Altitude **shall** (2074) be provided as Traffic Relative Altitude (see 
§2.3.5.5.1), Traffic Actual Altitude (see §2.3.5.5.2), or Traffic Pressure Altitude (see §2.3.5.5.4). 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.5 Traffic Geometric Altitude

a. When used (optional), the ASSAP function **shall** (2075) provide Traffic relative 
Geometric Altitude for traffic sent to the CDTI when available. 
b. When Geometric Altitude is used by the CDTI to determine Traffic relative 
Geometric Altitude (optional), Traffic Geometric Altitude **shall** (2076) be provided 
as Height above Ellipsoid (HAE) geometric altitude.   
Note: Traffic Geometric Altitude is not needed for ground traffic. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.6 Traffic Track Angle/Heading (Traffic Directionality)

a. The ASSAP function **shall** (2078) provide Traffic Track Angle/Heading for traffic 
sent to the CDTI when available. 
b. Traffic Track Angle/heading **shall** (2079) be provided as true reference. 
c. For traffic reporting airborne status, the following requirements apply: 1) The Traffic 
Track Angle **shall** (2080) be determined based upon the traffic reported N/S and E/W 
velocities when available and valid.  2) The traffic track angle **shall** (2081) be 
considered invalid when the traffic track angle uncertainty (95%) is greater than ± 30 
degrees based on NACV and ground speed.  See Table 2-2 below for guidance in 
establishing the ± 30 degree uncertainty limit. 
d. For traffic reporting On Ground status with a heading source, the traffic directionality 
shall (2082) be determined based upon the reported heading, when valid. 
e.
For traffic reporting On Ground status with a track source, the traffic directionality
shall (2083) be based upon the reported track angle, when valid.  The traffic track
angle **shall** (2390) be considered invalid when the traffic track angle uncertainty
(95%) is greater than ± 30 degrees based on NACV and ground speed.  See Table 2-2
below for guidance in establishing the ± 30 degree uncertainty limit.
Notes:
1.
± 30 degrees is the total accuracy allocated to ASSAP and CDTI.
2.
On the surface, heading is preferred when available.
f.
When TIS-B tracks with a NACV of 0 are used for display (optional), ASSAP shall
(2261) set the Traffic Track Angle/Heading reported to the CDTI to invalid.  These
tracks may be displayed as non-directional symbols.

1.
For NACV ≥ 1 (< 10 m/s), the minimum speeds supporting traffic directionality of
slowly moving traffic reporting airborne status were derived from a) the midpoint of
the corresponding 95% horizontal speed uncertainty range as given in Table 2-22 of
DO-260B / ED-102A, and b) the assumption that the cross-track velocity uncertainty
is equal to the along-track velocity uncertainty (i.e., the horizontal velocity error
distribution is circular).  For the NACV = 0 case, it is asserted that the minimum
traffic speed determined for NACV = 1 using the assumptions above is also
appropriate for the purpose of supporting traffic directionality.  Values have been rounded to the nearest 0.5 knots.
2.
Traffic Track Angle is used for calculating Traffic Directionality displayed on the
CDTI.

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.7 Traffic Horizontal Position

a.
The ASSAP function **shall** (2067) provide Traffic Horizontal Position for traffic sent
to the CDTI.
b.
For airborne traffic, Traffic Horizontal Position **shall** (2068) be provided as either
latitude/longitude or relative range and bearing referenced from ownship position.
Note:  The manufacturer may choose the horizontal position format on a per traffic basis. 

c.
For ground traffic, Traffic Horizontal Position **shall** (2309) be provided as
latitude/longitude.
d. Traffic relative range and bearing from ownship **shall** (2069) be calculated based on 
the Ownship Horizontal Position source defined in Section §2.2.2.1.3.1 Ownship 
Horizontal Position. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.8 Traffic Vertical Direction

a. The ASSAP function **shall** (2084) provide a Traffic Vertical Direction for airborne 
traffic sent to the CDTI when available. 
b. Traffic Vertical Direction **shall** (2085) be provided as either actual traffic vertical 
rate or as traffic vertical sense (an indication whether the traffic vertical direction is climbing, descending, or level). 
c. If the traffic vertical sense is calculated by ASSAP a climb **shall** (2086) be indicated 
when there is a positive vertical rate greater than or equal to 500 feet per minute 
(fpm); a descent **shall** (2087) be indicated when there is a negative vertical rate less 
than or equal -500 fpm. 
1. This requirement does not imply a range of vertical rates for which a vertical 
sense indication is not shown.  For example, a vertical sense indication may be shown for a smaller absolute vertical rate (e.g., 300 fpm) for ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-
B traffic. 
2. Traffic Vertical Direction is not required for ground traffic. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.9 Traffic Air/Ground Status

The ASSAP function **shall** (2088) provide a Traffic Air/Ground Status for traffic sent to the CDTI. 

Note: Traffic Air/Ground Status is used for differentiating between airborne and 
ground traffic on the display. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.10 Traffic Tcas Correlated Status

For systems that receive information from TCAS, the ASSAP function **shall** (2089) 
provide a Traffic TCAS Correlated Status for traffic sent to the CDTI. 

1. Traffic TCAS Correlated Status indicates that the traffic source (i.e., ADS-B, ADS-R, 
or TIS-B track) is correlated with an existing TCAS track or the traffic source is TCAS. 
2. In order to provide more complete traffic situation awareness, the Traffic Alert and 
Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) display should be integrated with the CDTI on aircraft equipped with TCAS. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.11 Traffic Application Capability

Note: "Traffic Application Capability" is equivalent to the term "Traffic Information Quality" as used in RTCA DO-289. 

If any applications are implemented besides EVAcq or AIRB, the ASSAP function must provide a Traffic Application Capability for traffic sent to the CDTI.  Therefore, Traffic Application Capability is defined in the other application input/output requirement sections. Each application specifies minimum requirements for the traffic element to support the application.  The Traffic Application Capability has the states: "valid for use by the application," and "invalid for use by the application." Either AIRB or EVAcq is the required minimum application, providing traffic situation awareness.  When ADS-B, ADS-R or TIS-B is the source (see Section §2.2.3.3), traffic not meeting the AIRB or EVAcq data quality thresholds are not forwarded to CDTI from ASSAP and therefore are not displayed. Additional applications are optional, and may have different (more strict) data quality thresholds. When other applications are implemented besides EVAcq or AIRB, the ASSAP function shall (2310) provide a Traffic Application Capability for each available application (not just the active applications) for each traffic sent to the CDTI. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.12 Traffic Tcas Alert Status

For traffic sources (i.e., ADS-B, ADS-R, or TIS-B tracks) that are correlated with TCAS 
tracks and TCAS only tracks, the ASSAP function **shall** (2094) provide the Traffic TCAS 
Alert Status (i.e., Other, Proximate, Traffic Advisory, Resolution Advisory) for the traffic sent to the CDTI when available. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.1.13 Traffic Emergency Priority Status

When used to display the Emergency/Priority Status (optional), the ASSAP function shall (2095) provide the Emergency/Priority Status for traffic sent to the CDTI when available. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.2 Ownship Information Output Requirements

The following subsections contain ownship information output requirements from the ASSAP function to the CDTI. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.2.1 Ownship Pvt Data

Ownship position and velocity (PVT) data is provided to the CDTI either from ASSAP or from the ownship position sources directly (e.g., GNSS Receiver). 

If the CDTI receives ownship PVT data from ASSAP, the ASSAP function **shall** (2313) 
provide the ownship PVT data to the CDTI as defined in Section §2.3.2.3.1. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.3 Assap Status Output Requirements

The following subsections contain ASSAP status output requirements from the ASSAP function to the CDTI. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.3.1 Asa Application Status

The ASSAP function **shall** (2108) provide the ASA Application Status for each installed application to the CDTI.  This status is based upon ownship's data meeting individual application requirements, and the equipment status. 

The ASA Application Status **shall** (2109) include that each ASA Application is in one of the following five states: On, Available to Run, Unavailable to Run, Unavailable - Fault, or Not Configured. Each ASA Application Status is in one of the following states: 

- 
On: Application is on/running; required ownship input data is available and 
meets the performance criteria. 
- 
Available to Run: Application is configured.  Required ownship input data is available and meets the performance criteria (This state represents that the ASA Application is manually or automatically selected off). 
- 
Unavailable to Run: Required ownship input data is available but does not 
meet the performance criteria or is not available due to Non-Computed Data (NCD) conditions. 
- 
Unavailable - Fault: Required ownship input data is not available due to a 
failure or the ASA Application process is failed. 
- 
Not Configured: Application is not installed. 

## 2.2.2.1.5.3.2 Assap Fault

An ASSAP Fault **shall** (2110) be provided to the CDTI per the fault requirements in Section §2.2.5 Monitoring.   

## 2.2.2.1.5.4 Tis-B/Ads-R Service Status Output Requirement

For systems that don't receive information from TCAS, the ASSAP **shall** (2200) output the TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status to the CDTI. 

## 2.2.2.1.6 Assap Aural Requirements

These requirements are only applicable to a system that provides aural annunciations. 

The ASSAP **shall** (2257) provide annunciations that are audible and distinguishable in all expected flight deck ambient noise conditions.  

1. TSAA aural alerts are an example of an annunciation. 
2. Automatic volume adjustment for ambient conditions is highly recommended. The 
TCAS MOPS [ref DO-185B / ED-143, Section 2.2.6.3.2] recommends that the volume level of the automatic adjustment provide a range of 0 to 4 watts Root Mean Square (RMS) at 1000 Hz into 8 ohms for speaker output and the automatic adjustment provide a range of 0 to 40 milliwatts at 1000 Hz into a 600 ohm audio distribution system.  Considerations with and without headsets should be addressed. 
The ASSAP **shall** (2258) be capable of receiving and processing an aural inhibit signal from higher priority systems in order to automatically inhibit aural annunciations. 

Note:  Aural annunciations must be automatically inhibited by annunciations issued by 
reactive and predictive wind shear systems, by ground proximity warning 
systems (GPWS), and by any other aural warnings that are deemed to be a higher priority for an installation (stall warnings, engine out warnings, TCAS, etc.).  This aural inhibit does not affect the visual aspect of the alert. 
The Total Latency for an aural annunciation, from the time of output of the aural message 
(at interface F) to the initiation of aural annunciation (at interface G) **shall** (3174) be less than 0.5 seconds. 

## 2.2.2.2 Asa System Latency

ASA systems should be designed to minimize latency of ownship and traffic position and velocity information.  The latency requirements in this section accommodate legacy air transport architectures to allow for retrofit of ASA equipment.  New avionics systems should support Total Latency of position and velocity less than 2 seconds between A3 
and G for ownship and between D and G for traffic. The Total Latency of ownship State Data, from the time of measurement (at interface A3) 
to actual time of display (at interface G) **shall** (2314) be less than 3.5 seconds. 

1.
This requirement includes any Total Latency introduced between interfaces A3 and
G, e.g., as referenced in Section §1.5.1.1 and Section §2.3.2.1.
2.
Actual time of display refers to when the information appears on the display.  Data
ageing of information while being displayed is not part of the latency budget.
The Total Latency of traffic data excluding Traffic ID, from initial time of applicability 
(at interface D) to actual time of display (at interface G), **shall** (2315) be less than 3.5 
seconds. 

1.
This requirement includes any Total Latency introduced between interfaces D and G,
e.g., as referenced in Section §1.5.1.2 and Section §2.3.2.1.
2.
Actual time of display refers to when the information appears on the display. Data ageing of information while being displayed is not part of the latency budget.
ASSAP **shall** (2111) receive ADS-B, ADS-R and TIS-B reports from the input interface 
(at interface E) and output correlated tracks to the CDTI (at interface F) within 2.5 
seconds. 

Note: This requirement applies between the input (interface E) and output (interface F) 
of the ASSAP function per Figure 1-1 and Table 2-4.  The requirement relates to when the last bit becomes available to ASSAP until the last bit has been made available to the CDTI.   
The Total Latency of Traffic ID, from initial time of applicability (at interface D) to actual time of display (at interface G), **shall** (2383) be less than 19 seconds. 

## 2.2.2.3 Surf Input/Output Requirements

This section defines the ASSAP input/output requirements to support the SURF application.  The SURF application is optional; but when implemented, the SURF input/output requirements in this section must be met.  The AIRB input/output requirements are required to support the SURF application; therefore, the AIRB 
input/output requirements must also be met.  
If the SURF application is implemented, the ASSAP function **shall** (2316) be capable of processing the AIRB input and output requirements as defined in Section §2.2.2.4. 

Note: In the AIRB Input and Output Sections (see §2.2.2.4), AIRB requires the EVAcq input and output requirements as defined in Section §2.2.2.1.  An implementer will include these when considering the above requirement (2316).

When used to display the exact position of the aircraft (optional), the ASSAP function shall (3173) provide Traffic Antenna Offset codes for traffic sent to the CDTI when available.  

## 2.2.2.3.3.2 Surf Traffic Application Capability

For the SURF application, the traffic application capability is one of the following states 
(SURF is for ground traffic when overlaid over an airport map): 

a.
Invalid:  Traffic does not meet the performance criteria for SURF.
b.
Valid: Traffic meets the performance criteria for SURF.

## 2.2.2.4 Airb Input/Output Requirements

This section defines the ASSAP input/output requirements to support the AIRB application.  The EVAcq input/output requirements are required to support the AIRB 
application; therefore, the EVAcq input/output requirements must also be met. 

If the AIRB application is implemented, the ASSAP function **shall** (2319) be capable of processing the EVAcq input and output requirements as defined in Section §2.2.2.1.   

## 2.2.2.4.1 Assap Input Requirements From Ads-B/Ads-R/Tis-B Receiver

1. Traffic Ground Speed is used for displaying traffic velocity vectors or traffic ground 
speed.   
2. The magnitude of velocity is acceptable for ground speed.   

## 2.2.2.4.3.4 Airb Traffic Application Capability

Note: "Traffic Application Capability" is equivalent to the term "Traffic Information 
Quality" as used in DO-289.    
If any applications are implemented besides AIRB, the ASSAP function must provide a Traffic Application Capability for traffic sent to the CDTI.  The Traffic Application Capability for those other applications is defined in the other application input/output requirement sections.  They also must meet the general requirements in §2.2.2.1.5.1.11 as well. 

## 2.2.2.4.4 Acas Traffic Designation Support Input/Output Requirements

This section defines the input/output requirements to support ACAS traffic designation. ACAS traffic designation is an optional addition to ACAS systems which will allow alternative collision avoidance logic to be applied to specifically designated traffic while maintaining normal ACAS logic protection against the other traffic.   

Note:   Traffic designation to support ACAS traffic designation is an optional function of 
AIRB, with ASA providing only traffic designation of certain ACAS traffic for alternative logic. 

## 2.2.2.4.4.1 Assap Input Requirements From Acas

The following additional ACAS traffic information is required for systems supporting ACAS traffic designation.  This provides traffic status information from the ACAS unit to ASA to support flight crew designation and for status monitoring. 

a. The ASSAP function **shall** (2100) receive the Traffic ACAS Traffic Designation 
Validity when available. 
1. Traffic ACAS Traffic Designation Validity is equivalent to Traffic Application 
Capability.  It indicates that ACAS has determined that the traffic is capable of supporting ACAS alternative logic. 
2. The flight crew may designate traffic for ACAS alternative logic when valid. 
b. The ASSAP function **shall** (2101) receive the Traffic ACAS Alternative Logic 
Designation Status when available. 
Note: The Traffic ACAS Alternative Logic Designation Status identifies traffic 
currently in a designated state within the ACAS system.   

## 2.2.2.4.4.2 Assap Output Requirements To Acas

For systems supporting ACAS traffic designation, the ASSAP function **shall** (2102) send the Traffic ACAS Alternative Logic Designation to the ACAS interface when available.

## 2.2.2.5 Vsa Input/Output Requirements

This section defines the ASSAP input/output requirements to support the VSA application.  The VSA application is optional; but when implemented, the VSA input/output requirements in this section must be met. 

If the VSA application is implemented, the ASSAP function **shall** (2327) be capable of processing the AIRB input and output requirements as defined in Section §2.2.2.4. 

Note:   In the AIRB Input and Output Sections (see §2.2.2.4), AIRB requires the EVAcq input and output requirements as defined in Section §2.2.2.1.  An implementer will include these when considering the above requirement (2327).   

## 2.2.2.5.1 Assap Input Requirements From Ads-B/Ads-R/Tis-B Receiver

This section defines the data supplied to the ASSAP function from the ADS-B/ADS-
R/TIS-B receiver.

## 2.2.3 Surveillance Processing

Surveillance processing includes the functions source-level track generation and maintenance, inter-source correlation, and best source selection.  The purpose of sourcelevel track generation and maintenance is to establish tracks from ADS-B/ADS-R and TIS-B sources separately and thereafter maintain the tracks.  Note that TCAS effectively provides source-level tracking for ATCRBS or Mode S equipped aircraft within range of the TCAS sensor.  The purpose of inter-source correlation is to perform correlation between source-level tracks (ADS-B/ADS-R tracks and TIS-B and TCAS tracks) to detect when an A/V is tracked by multiple sources; to perform correlation between Ownship track and TIS-B track to remove "shadows" on Ownship; and to perform correlation between TCAS reports and current source-level tracks and tag the sourcelevel tracks with the correlation status.  The purpose of best source selection is to select the best track when source-level tracks from ADS-B/ADS-R and TIS-B sources correlate.  
An example of a functional architecture for surveillance processing is illustrated in Figure 2-3, which shows the relationships among these functions. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

1.
Depending on the implementation or configuration (1090ES, UAT, or VDL4), ASSAP will receive varying report formats: split state vector and state uncertainty separately, full state vector and state uncertainty, or full state vector and state uncertainty separately.  TIS-B processing may be optional, depending on the
installation.
2.
Correlation tags include TCAS correlation tags (e.g., TCAS to ADS). These tags may also pertain to TIS-B to TIS-B correlation, TIS-B to ownship correlation, TCAS to
TIS-B correlation, and TIS-B to ADS correlation (if such functionality is
implemented).
3.
TCAS tracks are only merged into the traffic state file when ASSAP determines that TCAS represents the sole surveillance source or best surveillance source for a particular target.
The rationale for this architecture is the need to provide tracks from the best source (if more than one) for application processing, while avoiding the complexity of a fusion tracker as a minimum requirement.  These MOPS do not define requirements for data fusion.  It is desirable, in the rare case in which both services report the same A/V that this be detected by ASSAP to mitigate sending dual tracks to the CDTI for the same A/V. See Appendix C for more detail. 

## 2.2.3.1 Source Level Track Generation And Maintenance

Reports from each available source (i.e., ADS-B, ADS-R, and TIS-B) are tracked and maintained separately.  ASSAP **shall** (2104) track traffic with closing speeds up to at least 1200 kts and relative altitude rates up to at least 10,000 ft/min. 

## 2.2.3.1.1 Track Initiation

For the following reports, sources and address types (e.g., ICAO vs. non-ICAO) for which there is no track with a matching participant address and source (i.e., ADS-B, ADS-R, and TIS-B), ASSAP **shall** (2112) begin the track initiation process for: 

a. All ADS-B and ADS-R reports. 
b. All TIS-B reports when ownship is not TCAS equipped. 
c. Surface TIS-B reports regardless of ownship TCAS equipage. 
Note: It is not a requirement for TCAS equipped aircraft to process TIS-B reports for airborne targets because TCAS equipped aircraft will see transponder equipped aircraft.  If a TCAS equipped aircraft does process TIS-B reports while airborne, then the correlation requirements throughout Section §2.2.3 
apply.  All ASA system equipped aircraft (regardless of TCAS equipage) should process TIS-B reports for ground traffic.   

## 2.2.3.1.2 Track Storage

a. ASSAP **shall** (2113) be capable of maintaining at least 60 source tracks; in this case 
priority will determine which tracks are maintained when more than 60 unique reports are presented to ASSAP.  Track prioritization is described in Section §2.2.2.1.5.1.2.   
b. In ASSAP installations supporting TCAS, ASSAP **shall** (2115) be capable of 
maintaining an additional 30 TCAS source tracks. 

## 2.2.3.1.3 Track Maintenance

For each report containing an updated position and/or velocity, and where there is an existing track with the same source and participant address, ASSAP **shall** (2116) update that track with the report only when it passes all the following Report Validity Checks given in Section §2.2.3.1.3.1.    

## 2.2.3.1.3.1 Report Validity Checks

Report validation **shall** (2201) consist of at least horizontal velocity validation, horizontal position validation, and vertical position validation. 

The Horizontal Velocity validation criteria design is left to the manufacturer but **shall** 
(2335) reject velocity magnitude changes that exceed 1.5g over the time between Velocity reports. 

The Horizontal Position validation criteria design is left to the manufacturer but shall 
(2336) reject position changes that would require the aircraft horizontal acceleration in any direction to exceed 1.5g over the time between Horizontal Position reports. 

The Vertical Position validation criteria design is left to the manufacturer but **shall** 
(2337) reject vertical positions changes that would require the aircraft vertical rate to exceed 10,000 fpm over the time between Vertical Position reports. An acceptable implementation of the validation criteria is found in Appendix D. 

1.
The traffic horizontal acceleration performance criterion is intended to cover the
validity of updated horizontal position and velocity values.
2.
The value of 1.5g (14.7 m/s2) was derived by investigating the horizontal acceleration
of high performance business jets during surface takeoff and landings in conjunction with an OEM.
3.
The validation constant of 10,000 ft/min is based on TCAS vertical tracker
performance.

## 2.2.3.1.3.2 Additional Velocity Quality Monitoring

Version 2 ADS-B Out installations are expected to standardize the implementation of reporting velocity accuracy.  However, a considerable number of legacy installations are already fielded that either utilize earlier standards or do not adequately address velocity accuracy.  While the majority of legacy ADS-B Out installations are expected to provide adequate data quality to support the applications in these MOPS, the transmitted velocity accuracy may not accurately reflect the actual quality.  This could disqualify them from participating in the application, when the actual reported velocity is sufficiently accurate. 

The limited ability for today's avionic configurations to qualify velocity data to a 10 m/s accuracy, despite that GPS receivers report very good velocity accuracy (in the order of 1-2 m/s), was recognized by the ASA MOPS group.  ASA MOPS therefore provides alternative means to qualify traffic velocity accuracy based on the knowledge that the transmitted velocity comes from a GPS receiver.   
In order to ensure adequate velocity quality of legacy aircraft for a particular application these MOPS have identified acceptable qualification means as described in the Section 
§2.2.4 *Application Processing* and summarized in Table 2-3 below.

1. Alternative position qualification refers to the method described in Appendix O.  This 
qualification validates a velocity accuracy equivalent to a NACV = 2 for the 
associated traffic.  Once established, this qualification lasts until the traffic becomes airborne or until the track is discontinued. 
2. Velocity validation refers to a receiving aircraft implementing a function to confirm 
that available velocity data is of sufficient quality for the application.  An example 
algorithm for verifying velocity quality from position reports is given in Appendix E.  
3. For the AIRB, EVAcq and TSAA applications, the < 10m/s (NACV ≥ 1) requirement is 
not required for airborne TIS-B traffic. 
4. Identification of GPS source (using NACV and NUCp) for version 0 and version 1 
was deemed acceptable for situation awareness applications, but not for ITP/CAVS. 
5. For version 1 the NACV of 1 or better identifies a GPS source since it can be 
associated with a GPS' HFOMR or inferred with HFOM. 
6. For version 0 the NUCP of 4 or better (with a high likelihood) identifies a GPS 
source.  
More generally, for all applications but especially for SURF ground traffic, a velocity/heading monitoring function should also be used to protect against sustained rogue velocity or heading information, such as could occur from a fault in the input from a heading sensor or some other systematic processing fault.  A receiving aircraft should check that heading as well as speed are reasonable.  In this case it is important to be aware that speed and heading data may generate from different sources and hence have independent failure modes (one example that has been observed from legacy installations is correct speed information reported together with an incorrect, frozen, heading value). 

Validation of heading may be done using position reports when the traffic is moving sufficiently.  If the velocity quality checks fail, then the velocity should be considered invalid for the application. 

## 2.2.3.1.3.3 Duplicate Address Processing For Uat And Vdl4 Systems

When ASA equipment is integrated with UAT or VDL4 sources, ASSAP **shall** (2395) 
detect and track Airborne ADS-B traffic from UAT and VDL4 sources with duplicate addresses. ADS-B reports from UAT and VDL4 equipped traffic which do not pass the Report Validity Checks given in Section §2.2.3.1.3.1 are subject to further processing on UAT and VDL4 systems to determine if they are the result of a duplicate address as specified below: 

a.
For reports which do not correlate with an existing duplicate address track with a
matching participant address, ASSAP **shall** (2117) begin the track initiation process.
Track initiation should mitigate for outliers and should not display a duplicate track at the first track update.
b.
For each report containing an updated position and/or velocity, and where there is an
existing track created as a result of duplicate address processing with the same
participant address, ASSAP **shall** (2118) update that track with the report only when
it passes the Report Validity Tests given in Section §2.2.3.1.3.1.

## 2.2.3.1.3.4 Duplicate Address Processing For 1090 Mhz Systems

When ASA equipment is integrated with a 1090 MHz receiver, ASSAP **shall** (2396) 
detect airborne ADS-B traffic with duplicate addresses. Duplicate address traffic are not required to be displayed.  Since horizontal velocity and track angle are considered invalid, these tracks may be processed without track estimation and displayed as nondirectional symbols. ADS-B reports from DO-260B / ED-102A compliant receivers will be marked with a duplicate address flag under certain criteria.  This criteria is less stringent than the Report Validity Checks given in Section §2.2.3.1.3.1.  In cases where the ASA system function is integrated with a DO-260B / ED-102A receiver, there is no need to implement the duplicate address processing by the receiver.  The single criteria defined below using the Report Validity Checks will meet the minimum requirements of both specifications. 

ADS-B reports from 1090 MHz equipped traffic which do not pass the Report Validity Checks given in Section §2.2.3.1.3.1 or are marked as duplicates by a DO-260B / 
ED-102A receiver are subject to further processing to support tracking duplicate addresses as specified below.   

a.
Upon receipt of a report that does not meet the Report Validity criteria in Section §2.2.3.1.3.1 and there is not an existing duplicate address track for this participant
address and track source, ASSAP **shall** (2338) create a candidate duplicate address track. 

b. Candidate duplicate address tracks that are updated with position reports passing the 
Report Validity criteria three times within 25 seconds **shall** (2339) transition to a 
duplicate address track. 
c. The existing track and the newly created track are duplicate address tracks.  A track 
shall (2340) be flagged with a duplicate address condition by any of the following 
events:  
1. a candidate duplicate address track transitions to a duplicate address track per 
b. above  
2. an existing track has an identical address as a new duplicate address track per 
b. above 
3. an existing track is updated by a 1090 MHz report with the duplicate address 
flag set 
d. Upon transitioning to a duplicate address track, data for these tracks **shall** (2341) be 
invalidated except for data from Type Codes 5 - 18 or 20 - 22 (see DO-260B /  
ED-102A Section §2.2 and Appendix N) and all reports processed as Version 0 
participants. 
Note:  Additional data from other Type Codes could be used if additional processing is provided to correlate the data to the proper track.  

e. When initiating or updating a duplicate address track with a report, all data from the 
following 1090 MHz Message Type Codes (see DO-260B / ED-102A Section §2.2 
and Appendix N) **shall** (2342) be invalidated: Type Codes 1 - 4, 19, and 23 - 31, 
unless additional processing is provided to correlate the data to the proper track. 
f. A duplicate address track, once initiated for a participant address, **shall** (2343) exist 
until all tracks with this participant address are terminated per Section §2.2.3.4.    

## 2.2.3.1.3.5 Additional Validation Of Traffic Position With Tcas Data

There are a considerable number of legacy ADS-B Out installations that are already fielded that do not adequately address position accuracy.  Therefore, some of the applications will require additional validation of traffic position with TCAS data (e.g., ITP and CAVS) as identified in Section §2.2.4, *Application Processing*. 

Only the general validation requirements are defined in this section; the specific requirements (e.g., validation thresholds) for each identified application are defined in Section §2.2.4, *Application Processing*. 

If required for an application, ASSAP **shall** (2105) validate the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B 
position data of traffic by comparing the ADS-B position data with the TCAS range, bearing (if available), and altitude data.  

1.
The specific range, bearing, and altitude validation thresholds are defined in Section
§2.2.4, Application Processing.
2.
If TCAS bearing is not available, then the bearing comparison is not required to meet
the validation requirements.  One reason that bearing may not be available is the
case of an aircraft that is tracked only with an omni-directional lower antenna.
3.
An implementation should use filter criteria to prevent single validation failures from erroneously disqualifying traffic.
4.
The validation comparison may be based on TCAS output track data or TCAS reply
data solicited from standard TCAS surveillance interrogations. TCAS Hybrid
Surveillance validates ADS-B position data in a manner acceptable for use with the
existing applications.  Future applications will need additional analysis.
If the validation passes, ASSAP **shall** (2106) mark the Traffic Application Capability as valid on the CDTI interface, otherwise mark as invalid. For systems that are performing validation based on TCAS output track data, ASSAP 
shall (2107) revalidate the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B position data of traffic at least once every 10 seconds. For systems that are performing validation based on TCAS reply data solicited from standard TCAS surveillance interrogations, ASSAP **shall** (2149) revalidate the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B position data of traffic at the revalidation intervals defined in DO-300, Section §2.2.7.4, or DO-300A, Section §2.2.7.5. 

1.
For a system integrated with TCAS Hybrid Surveillance based on DO-300 or
DO-300A, it is not the intent to perform any additional active interrogations beyond
DO-300 or DO-300A.  In DO-300, the interval between revalidation is either 10 or
60 seconds.  In DO-300A, the interval between revalidation varies from 10 up to a
maximum of 60 seconds based on range and range rate.
2.
In DO-300A, validation and revalidations do not apply to established tracks under
extended hybrid surveillance; therefore, these tracks are considered validated.

## 2.2.3.2 Inter-Source Correlation

The purpose of inter-source correlation is to ensure that a single Aircraft/Vehicle (A/V) detected on different surveillance sources is properly identified as such to prevent the display of spurious traffic elements on the CDTI.  This suppression is performed in the Best Source Selection process described in Section §2.2.3.3, in which the best source for correlated tracks is selected for display.  Additionally, to prevent the spurious display or alerting of ownship TIS-B shadows prior to correlation with the ownship, updates for a new TIS-B source track may be suppressed from display or alerting while undergoing this correlation.    
Note: Since inter-source correlation is performed after a track update and before the Best Source Selection, a track that is fully correlated with another track on its first report (e.g., using an ICAO address match) will be suppressed entirely from display if it is not selected as the best source. 

Individual reports **shall** (2119) be used for inter-source correlation only after they have passed the Report Validation Checks given in Section §2.2.3.1.3.1. Inter-source correlation is a one-to-one correlation process, i.e., a track **shall** (2120) be correlated to at most one track of another source.  Inter-source correlation obtained with an address match **shall** (2121) take precedence over correlation obtained with another method.  See Appendix C for one acceptable method of performing inter-source correlation. 

The inter-source correlation requirements presented in this section are defined for the following conditions: 

a. Maximum aircraft horizontal acceleration of 1.5g (14.7 m/s2). 
b. Maximum aircraft ground speed of 600 knots. 
c. Maximum time between received ADS-B and ADS-R reports (airborne traffic) of 6 
seconds. 
d. Maximum time between received TIS-B reports of 25 seconds. 
e. Minimum NACP of 5 (< 0.5 NM) for all ADS-B, ADS-R and TIS-B report updates. 
Decorrelation is defined as the removal of the established correlation between tracks from different sources on the same A/V.  Miscorrelation is defined as the match of different sources that are not from the same A/V.  Spatial correlation refers to any correlation not using an ICAO address match.  

1. Miscorrelation should not affect the decorrelation rate, as any subsequent 
decorrelation that may occur for incorrectly matched tracks is appropriate. However, a miscorrelation may affect the correlation rate if the subsequent correct 
decorrelation and correlation of sources requires more updates than given below.  
2. ASSAP does not address spatial correlation between TIS-B and other sources 
(ADS-B, ADS-R) or ownship for the airport surface.  The geometric filters used for 
determining correlation would be unable to function properly in the dense target environment that could exist on the surface, potentially resulting in a higher rate of ghosting between ADS-B and TIS-B targets and possibly ghosting of the ownship as 
well.  

## 2.2.3.2.1 Inter-Source Correlation Of Tis-B With Ads-B And Ads-R Tracks

Two methods of inter-source correlation of TIS-B with ADS-B/ADS-R tracks are possible.  One method is if the TIS-B track has been assigned an ICAO address.  Since these addresses are unique for a given aircraft, inter-source correlation is accomplished if an address match with the ADS-B/ADS-R track is found, and a reasonableness check is passed. The second (more common) case is where the TIS-B track address has been assigned by the TIS-B service provider, and thus an address match with the ADS-B/ADS-R track is not possible.  This second case applies only to airborne tracks.  In this second case, a correlation technique can be applied that uses other track characteristics such as position and position history; such a technique is termed a "spatial" correlation method, but nonpositional track information such a velocity or call-sign (if provided) may be used as well.  This spatial technique involves additional processing over an address match, and is not required since the presence of both TIS-B and ADS-B/ADS-R tracks for the same A/V should be relatively rare. If TIS-B and ADS-B/ADS-R tracks on the same A/V have matching ICAO addresses, then ASSAP **shall** (2122) correlate these tracks with the following performance: 

a.
At least a 99% correlation rate for the first TIS-B report and subsequent TIS-B track
updates.
b.
Less than the maximum permitted decorrelation rate of 0.2% after correct correlation has been achieved.
c.
Less than a 0.2% miscorrelation rate.
If the spatial correlation of TIS-B tracks with ADS-B/ADS-R tracks is implemented, then ASSAP **shall** (2123) correlate these tracks for the same A/V with the following performance: 

a.
At least a 95% correlation rate on and after the 6th TIS-B track update.
b.
Less than the maximum permitted decorrelation rate of 1% after correct correlation has been achieved.
c.
Less than a 1% miscorrelation rate.

## 2.2.3.2.2 Inter-Source Correlation Of Tis-B Tracks With The Ownship

The inter-source correlation of TIS-B tracks with the ownship is similar to that of TIS-B 
correlation with an ADS-B/ADS-R track, with the ownship substituting for the ADS-B/ADS-R track.  The correlation of TIS-B tracks with the ownship thus has two techniques, depending on whether or not an ICAO address match is possible.   
If a TIS-B track of the ownship has an ICAO address, then ASSAP **shall** (2124) correlate that TIS-B track with the ownship with the following performance: 

a.
At least a 99.5% correlation rate for the first TIS-B report and subsequent TIS-B
track updates.
b.
Less than the maximum permitted decorrelation rate of 0.1% after correct correlation has been achieved.
c.
Less than a 0.1% miscorrelation rate.
If a TIS-B track of the ownship does not have an ICAO address, then ASSAP **shall** 
(2125) correlate that TIS-B track with the ownship with the following performance: 

a.
At least a 99% correlation rate on and after the 6th TIS-B track update.
b.
Less than the maximum permitted decorrelation rate of 0.2% after correct correlation has been achieved.
c.
Less than a 0.2% miscorrelation rate.
When a new TIS-B source track is initiated, it may take several reports for spatial correlation with ownship to be confirmed or rejected.  During this correlation process, it is permissible to suppress the TIS-B target from display and alert processing.  This will help to prevent ownship TIS-B shadows and potential alerts based on these shadows. 

## 2.2.3.2.3 Inter-Source Correlation Of Tcas With Ads-B, Ads-R, And Tis-B Tracks

The inter-source correlation of TCAS with ADS-B, ADS-R, and TIS-B Tracks also has two correlation techniques, depending on whether or not an ICAO address match is possible.  With TCAS, the ICAO address is that of the Mode S address available in the TCAS file in TCAS/ASA integrated systems, when the target aircraft is equipped with a Mode S transponder. It is not a requirement for TCAS equipped aircraft to process TIS-B reports for airborne targets because TCAS equipped aircraft will see transponder equipped aircraft.  All ASA system equipped aircraft (regardless of TCAS equipage) should process TIS-B reports for ground traffic.  If TIS-B is incorporated for airborne targets when ownship has an operational TCAS, all correlation requirements must be met.  For installations that do not support correlation, a TIS-B track for a surface target is terminated once the target begins reporting an airborne status. If TCAS and ADS-B/ADS-R (and optionally, TIS-B) tracks on the same A/V have matching ICAO addresses, then ASSAP **shall** (2126) correlate these tracks with the following performance: 

a. At least a 99% correlation rate for the first TCAS track report, and subsequent TCAS 
track updates. 
b. Less than the maximum permitted decorrelation rate of 0.2% after correct correlation 
has been achieved. 
c. Less than a 0.2% miscorrelation rate.  
If an ICAO address is not available for a TCAS track, ASSAP **shall** (2127) correlate this track with an ADS-B/ADS-R (and optionally, TIS-B) track for the same A/V with the following performance: 

a. At least a 95% correlation rate on and after the 6th TCAS track update. 
b. Less than the maximum permitted decorrelation rate of 1% after correct correlation 
has been achieved. 
c. Less than a 1% miscorrelation rate.  

## 2.2.3.2.4 Intra-Source Correlation Of Tis-B With Tis-B Tracks

TIS-B service volumes are assumed to have adjacent boundaries with minimal overlap. In this case, a TIS-B source track in one volume may co-exist for some short time period with a TIS-B source track for the same traffic with a different TIS-B ID.  This ASSAP 
function detects this case and prevents duplicate traffic symbols from being sent to the CDTI. Same ID track correlation is not possible in this case as the two TIS-B volumes are assumed to produce unique track IDs.   
A correlation technique can be applied that uses track characteristics such as position and position history; such a technique is termed a "spatial" correlation method, but nonpositional track information such as velocity or call-sign (if provided) may be used as well.  TIS-B to TIS-B spatial correlation **shall** (2344) be implemented when the ASSAP 
function implements TIS-B for airborne traffic. 

If the spatial correlation of airborne TIS-B to TIS-B tracks is implemented, then ASSAP 
shall (2345) correlate these tracks for the same A/V with the following performance: 

a.
At least a 95% correlation rate on first TIS-B track update.
b.
Less than the maximum permitted decorrelation rate of 5% after correct correlation has been achieved.
c.
Less than a 1% miscorrelation rate.

## 2.2.3.3 Best Source Selection

When multiple source tracks correlate, the best quality source track **shall** (2128) be chosen using the following criteria in priority order until one source is selected:  

1.
From the sources that have a non-zero NIC, select the source with the highest nonzero SIL.
2.
From sources that have the same highest non-zero SIL value, select the source with
the highest NIC.
3.
From sources that have the same highest values of SIL and NIC, select the source
with the highest NACP.
4.
From sources that have the same highest values of SIL, NIC, and NACP, select the
one source with the highest NACV.
5.
From sources that have the same highest SIL, NIC, NACP, and NACV values, select
the ADS-B source first, then the ADS-R source, and finally the TIS-B source.
TCAS reports do not contain any of these criteria.  When a TCAS track correlates with an existing track it **shall** (2129) only be chosen as the best track when all other source position accuracies drop below the minimum threshold for EVAcq / AIRB traffic (see Table 2-4).  This implies that range and bearing information is calculated using ownship and traffic ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B position when TCAS is not chosen as the best track.   
The maximum data age is different from application to application (see Table 2-4). 

When running multiple applications, the maximum data age of the most stringent application running may be used.  When the selected source has not been updated and the maximum data age is exceeded, the next highest quality source may be selected. It is recognized that alternate means of dealing with data age exist.  For instance, the accuracy parameters may be extrapolated over time and used to determine when to select an alternate source.  These requirements are not intended to prevent more sophisticated designs.  
If the update interval for a data source is near the maximum allowed data age for an application, but does not exceed the maximum allowed data age, the manufacturer may choose to exclude that data source from selection for that application to prevent track drops and track reacquisition or source swapping.  
Note: Switching the traffic source may result in altered Traffic Application Capability.   

## 2.2.3.4 Track Termination

ASSAP **shall** (2130) terminate a track when the maximum data age has been exceeded for all of the applications for which the track is being used.  The data age is the elapsed time since a report from any source has been correlated with the track.  

## 2.2.3.5 Common Time Of Track Extrapolation And Traffic State File Generation

Track estimates **shall** (2131) be generated and output at a rate of 1 hertz (Hz) or greater.   
The absolute difference in Time of Applicability between any traffic horizontal positions at interface F **shall** (2346) be no more than 200 ms. 

Note: The difference in Time of Applicability at interface F applies to the Initial Time of Applicability as measured from interface D. 

The absolute difference in Time of Applicability between ownship's and any traffic's horizontal positions, when used for application processing, **shall** (2347) be no more than 500 ms.  When traffic ground speed is less than 10 knots, the track estimates **shall** (2191) 
not be extrapolated without further justification (refer to SURF SPR DO-322/ED-165) 

1. This requirement limits the error when relative computations are made between 
ownship and target positions (e.g., ITP Distance, traffic range). 
2. The difference in Time of Applicability at input to application processing applies to 
the Initial Time of Applicability as measured at interface D (time of reception) and 
interface A3 (time of measurement) respectively. 
The absolute difference in Time of Applicability between ownship's and any traffic's altitude, when used for application processing, **shall** (2384) be no more than 500 ms.  
Track estimates for display on the CDTI **shall** (2385) limit extrapolation of altitude to 11 
seconds.  After 11 seconds, the altitude for display **shall** (2386) maintain the extrapolated value until a new report is received or the target times out. 

Note: The sample algorithms for this function (described in Appendix C of this 
document) produce two altitude parameters per track estimate: display altitude with limited extrapolation and application altitude (extrapolated until target time out). 
When TIS-B tracks with a NACV of 0 are used for display (optional), they **shall** (2393) 
be excluded from common time track extrapolation.  These tracks may be processed without track estimation and displayed as non-directional symbols.  The reported horizontal velocity and track angle for these tracks may only be used for TSAA alerting purposes and must be considered invalid for all other application calculations. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
When airborne 1090 MHz ADS-B tracks identified as duplicate address tracks are used for display (optional), they **shall** (2394) be excluded from common time track extrapolation since their reported horizontal velocities and track angles are considered invalid.  These tracks may be processed without track estimation and displayed as nondirectional symbols.  

## 2.2.3.6 Individual Time Of Track Extrapolation And Traffic State File Generation

Data processing and update intervals results in increased data age which reduces the usability of dynamic data.  To improve the usability of the horizontal position data for traffic and ownship it has been deemed necessary to require a maximum difference between the Time of Applicability of the data and the time at which the data is being used. For requirements relating to display of data, the time at which the data is being used has been defined to be the time the data first appears on the display (interface G). 

The Total Compensation Error of ownship's horizontal position between interface A3 
and interface G **shall** (2348) be no more than 1.0 second. 

Note: This requirement includes the Compensation Error referenced in Section 
§1.5.1.1.

The Total Compensation Error of traffic's horizontal position between interface D and interface G **shall** (2349) be no more than 1.0 second.   

## 2.2.4 Application Processing

The application processing section contains specific requirements for EVAcq, AIRB, SURF, VSA, ITP, TSAA, and CAVS.  Each application determines the traffic application capability for each traffic element. Ownship and traffic quality/integrity data is used to determine the traffic application capability.  Application processing also includes the processing of alerts and other information. An example application processing architecture is shown in Figure 2-4.  The track state file is provided by surveillance processing. 

Note:  An implementation has the option to set traffic requirements which are more stringent than those specified in the traffic requirements section for each application. 

Table 2-4 summarizes the Traffic requirements for each application, expressed for version 2 ADS-B Out.  Table 2-5 summarizes the Ownship requirements for each application.  The individual requirements are covered in detail in the following subparagraphs, including alternative qualification means for Version 2 and legacy systems.

1. Most current ADS-B/ADS-R Version 0 and TIS-B implementations report NACV as "unavailable" 
despite reporting velocities that may be acceptable in the near term.  Each application specific requirements section will address acceptable mitigations for traffic sources that present potential 
velocity quality issues.  For the AIRB, EVAcq, and TSAA applications, the < 10m/s (NACV ≥ 1) 
requirement is not required for airborne TIS-B traffic. 
2. System Design Assurance (SDA) is defined in Version 2 equipment or later. 
3.
For Version 2 reports, if valid pressure altitude is unavailable, geometric altitude may be used
when GVA ≥ 2.
4.
Traffic vertical requirements for SURF are described in 2.2.4.2.2.
5.
The total latency of 29 seconds was based on the DO-289 allocation.  DO-260B / ED-102A
requires Traffic ID to be stable for 4 seconds and the Traffic ID nominal transmit interval is 5.0
seconds (i.e., B-D 9.0s).  The delay through the report generator is 0.5 seconds.  The delay
through ASSAP is 2.5 seconds and an additional 15.5 seconds was provided to ASSAP to allow for
changes in Traffic ID to be verified by up to 3 Traffic ID updates, hence 18 seconds total latency E to F.
6.
The F→G latency is applicable to a CDTI system that is operating in normal mode (all processing
components operational).
7.
An implementation has the option to set traffic requirements which are more stringent than those
specified in the Application Processing section for each application.
8.
See Section 2.1.8 for general latency requirements.
9.
TSAA is not designed to alert for traffic on the ground or when ownship is on the ground.
10. Traffic not reporting altitude is displayed without relative altitude.

Alternatively, a GPS using the SA on assumption may qualify ownship position with a reported
HDOP (95%) less than 2.

## 2.2.4.1 Enhanced Visual Acquisition (Evacq) Or Basic Airborne Situation Awareness (Airb)

ASSAP's contribution to this application includes the tracking and traffic correlation requirements that are applicable to all applications.  ASSAP also determines whether ownship information and traffic information is good enough to perform EVAcq or AIRB.  

## 2.2.4.1.1 Ownship Requirements For Evacq Or Airb

ASSAP can only perform the Enhanced Visual Acquisition or Basic Airborne Situation Awareness application when Ownship horizontal position is valid.  
When Ownship horizontal position is invalid, ASSAP **shall** (2136) signal that EVAcq or AIRB is Unavailable (fail) via the CDTI interface.  
ASSAP **shall** (2137) signal that EVAcq or AIRB is unavailable to run via the CDTI 
interface when: 

a. Ownship is on ground and Ground traffic is displayed and Ownship horizontal 
position uncertainty (95%) is worse than or equal to 0.1 NM. 
b. Not covered by (a) and Ownship horizontal position uncertainty (95%) is worse than 
or equal to 0.5 NM. 
Note: One implementation method is to remove ground traffic when condition a) is not 
met but condition b) is met.   
No ASSAP system should be designed or installed without a pressure altitude source.  If Ownship pressure altitude becomes invalid, EVAcq or AIRB may continue to operate.  In this reversionary state, the Traffic Relative Altitude computed using Traffic Pressure Altitude **shall** (2138) not be output.   
If the Ownship velocity is used (e.g., in ground speed differential calculations), any related information **shall** (2350) only be provided to the CDTI interface if the Ownship Velocity Uncertainty is less than 10 m/s.   

## 2.2.4.1.2 Traffic Requirements For Evacq Or Airb

All existing versions of the 1090ES, UAT and VDL4 ADS-B links are capable of producing EVAcq or AIRB traffic data (e.g., DO-260/ED-102 Version 0), and all future version are expected to be developed to be capable of producing EVAcq or AIRB traffic data. The ASSAP system may, under the condition that the user is made aware, e.g., through design specifications, choose not to process and forward ground traffic to the CDTI.  It is recommended that EVAcq implementations process and forward ground traffic to the CDTI.  
An EVAcq or AIRB traffic **shall** (2139) be derived from a track with valid horizontal position.  
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
An EVAcq or AIRB traffic track **shall** (2140) only be provided to the CDTI interface when: 

a1. 
Traffic and Ownship are on ground and traffic is reporting valid horizontal 
position with a NACP of 7 or greater (< 0.1 NM). 
OR 
a2. 
Traffic or Ownship is airborne and traffic is reporting valid horizontal position 
with a NACP of 5 or greater (< 0.5 NM). 
AND 

b.
Version 2 traffic is reporting an SDA greater than 0.
AND 

c1.  Traffic is reporting valid horizontal velocity with a NACV of 1 or greater (< 10 
m/s). OR 
c2. 
(Optional) Version 0 traffic is reporting valid horizontal velocity AND a 
NUCP ≥ 4 (< 1.0 NM).  
OR 
c3. 
(Optional) ADS-B/ADS-R (not TIS-B) traffic is reporting valid velocity, and 
velocity quality can be ensured to meet 10 m/s accuracy based on derived 
velocity using the ADS-B position messages. OR 
c4. 
(Optional), TIS-B traffic is reporting a NACV of 0.  The reported horizontal 
velocity and track angle for these tracks will only be used for TSAA alerting purposes.  Velocity and track angle must be considered invalid for other 
applications.  These tracks may be displayed as non-directional symbols. 
OR 
c5. 
(Optional) Airborne 1090 MHz ADS-B traffic is identified as a duplicate 
address track.  Since horizontal velocity and track angle are considered invalid, these tracks may be processed without track estimation and displayed as nondirectional symbols. 
AND 

d1. 
Traffic on ground is moving and a position message has been received within 
the last 11 seconds. OR 
d2. 
Traffic on ground is static and a position message has been received within the 
last 25 seconds. OR 
d3. 
Traffic is airborne and a position message has been received within the last 25 seconds. 
1. An acceptable means of compliance for deriving velocity accuracy is shown in 
Appendix E. 
2. Most current ADS-B/ADS-R DO-260/ED-102 Version 0 traffic report velocity 
quality as "unknown" despite reporting velocity that is acceptable for the AIRB application.  To be valid AIRB traffic, they must continue to report a valid 
horizontal velocity and meet the other minimum traffic requirements for this application.  Currently, airborne TIS-B traffic will not meet 10 m/s when 
exceeding a 0.05g turn; therefore, TIS-B traffic reporting a NACV of 0 may not be 
used to determine AIRB traffic validity.  
When Traffic is airborne and a position message has not been received within the last 13 seconds, a "coasting" flag should be provided to the CDTI interface to indicate Coasting Status. An EVAcq or AIRB traffic may not be reporting pressure altitude.  This condition is known as non-altitude reporting or NAR.  If valid traffic pressure altitude is unavailable and if Traffic Relative Altitude is derived using geometric altitude (optional), the following **shall** (2141) apply: Version 2 traffic's GVA must be 2 or greater (≤ 45 m), and ownship geometric altitude uncertainty (95%) must be less than or equal to 45m. 

Geometric altitude **shall** (2351) only be used from Version 2 or higher traffic.  Otherwise the traffic relative altitude **shall** (3175) be set to invalid. 

1. TIS-B Service provided in the United States can be assumed to comply with this 
requirement, see Section §1.5.1.2.3.  
2. When implementing the TSAA application, the option to compute Traffic Relative 
Altitude is mandatory (see Section §2.2.4.5.2).    

## 2.2.4.1.3 Aural Annunciation Input

This requirement is only applicable to a system that provides aural annunciations. This input is used by other systems when higher priority alerts are necessary.   
The ASSAP **shall** (2259) inhibit aural annunciations when it receives an input to do so. 

Note:  Aural annunciations must be automatically inhibited by annunciations issued by 
reactive and predictive wind shear systems, by ground proximity warning systems (GPWS), and by any other aural warnings that are deemed to be a higher priority for an installation (stall warnings, engine out warnings, TCAS, etc.).  This aural inhibit does not affect the visual aspect of the alert.  

## 2.2.4.2 Basic Surface Situation Awareness (Surf)

ASSAP's contribution to this application includes the tracking and traffic correlation requirements that are applicable to all applications.  ASSAP also determines whether Ownship information and traffic information is good enough to perform SURF.  
ASSAP **shall** (2353) determine if traffic is inside or outside of the Surface Volume. 

ASSAP may use the provided Field Elevation from CDTI.  If ASSAP cannot determine if traffic is inside or outside of the Surface Volume, the SURF Application Status **shall** 
(2392) be flagged as unavailable to run.   
Note: For implementations that use the same traffic performance requirements for traffic inside and outside of the Surface Volume based on the most stringent criteria of the two, determination of the Surface Volume is not necessary.  

## 2.2.4.2.1 Ownship Requirements For Surf

ASSAP can only perform the SURF application when Ownship horizontal position and vertical position are valid and of sufficient quality.  
Ownship data must meet the following criteria or ASSAP **shall** (2143) signal that SURF 
is unavailable to run via the CDTI interface: 

•
Ownship Horizontal Position is valid with a reported horizontal position uncertainty (95%) less than 50 meters AND reported Pressure Altitude is valid.
OR
•
An un-augmented GPS is providing valid Ownship Horizontal Position with a reported HDOP of 2 or less AND reported Pressure Altitude is valid.

## Or

•
Ownship Horizontal Position is valid with a reported horizontal uncertainty (95%) less than 50 meters AND reported vertical uncertainty (95%) less than 45 meters. OR
•
An un-augmented GPS is providing valid Ownship Horizontal Position with a reported HDOP of 2 or less AND reported vertical uncertainty (95%) less than 45 meters.

## 2.2.4.2.2 Traffic Requirements For Surf

All existing versions of the 1090ES, UAT and VDL4 ADS-B links are capable of producing SURF traffic data (e.g., DO-260 / ED-102 Version 0), and all future versions are expected to be developed to be capable of producing SURF traffic data.   
Version 2 SURF traffic with an SDA less than 1 **shall** (2356) not be marked valid for SURF on the CDTI interface. 

Note:  TIS-B Service provided in the United States can be assumed to comply with this requirement, see Section §1.5.1.2.3.  
If surveillance position reference point (SPRP) compensation data is received, and it is determined that compensation has not been performed prior to reception, the ASSAP should compensate the traffic horizontal position to the SPRP. Traffic Application Capability for the SURF Application varies with the location of Ownship and Traffic (i.e., Inside or outside of the Surface Volume and whether the aircraft has a status of airborne or on ground).  

## 2.2.4.2.2.1 Traffic Is On Ground

When on-ground traffic meets the following criteria, ASSAP **shall** (2148) mark the traffic valid for SURF on the CDTI interface: 

a1. 
Traffic is reporting valid Horizontal position with a NACP of 9 or greater  
(< 30 m). 
 
OR  
a2. 
(optional) Version 2 ADS-B/ADS-R (not TIS-B) traffic is reporting valid 
Horizontal position with a NACP of 7 or greater (< 0.1NM) AND SIL of 3 
encoded per hour (≤ 1E-7 / hr) AND Ownship GPS is providing valid Ownship 
Horizontal Position with a HDOP of 2 or less. 
 
OR  
a3. 
(optional) Version 1 ADS-B/ADS-R (not TIS-B) traffic is reporting valid 
Horizontal position with a NACP of 7 or greater (< 0.1NM) AND SIL of 2 or 
greater (≤ 1E-5) AND Ownship GPS is providing valid Ownship Horizontal Position with a HDOP of 2 or less. 
 
OR  
a4. 
(optional) Version 0 ADS-B/ADS-R (not TIS-B) traffic is reporting valid 
Horizontal position with a NUCp of 7 or greater (< 0.1NM) AND Ownship GPS is providing valid Ownship Horizontal Position with a HDOP of 2 or less. 
Note: Justification material for the requirement qualifications of ADS-B/ADS-R 
Traffic as described in a2, a3 and a4 is found in Appendix O.  

## And

b1. 
Traffic is in moving AND a position message has been received within the last 
11 seconds.  
 
OR 
b2. 
Traffic is static AND a position message has been received within the last 25 
seconds. 

## And

c1. 
Version 2 (or higher) traffic (including TIS-B) is reporting valid horizontal 
velocity with a NACV of 2 or greater (< 3 m/s). 
 
OR 
c2. 
(optional) Version 2 (or higher) ADS-B/ADS-R (not TIS-B) traffic is reporting 
valid horizontal velocity when it is reporting valid Horizontal position with a 
NACP of 7 or greater (< 0.1NM) AND SIL of 3 encoded per hour (≤ 1E-7 / hr) 
AND Ownship GPS is providing valid Ownship Horizontal Position with a HDOP of 2 or less. 
 
OR  
c3. 
(optional) Version 1 ADS-B/ADS-R (not TIS-B) traffic is reporting valid 
horizontal velocity when it is reporting valid Horizontal position with a NACP 
of 7 or greater (< 0.1NM) AND SIL of 2 or greater (≤ 1E-5) AND Ownship GPS is providing valid Ownship Horizontal Position with a HDOP of 2 or less. 

OR 

c4. 
(optional) Version 0 ADS-B/ADS-R (not TIS-B) traffic is reporting valid 
horizontal velocity when it is reporting valid Horizontal position with a NUCP 
of 7 or greater (< 0.1NM) AND Ownship GPS is providing valid Ownship Horizontal Position with a HDOP of 2 or less. 
Note: The justification for c2, c3 and c4 is based on ensuring GPS velocity data is valid for use by using the same criteria as used for alternative position qualification in a2, a3 and a4 requirements.  The derivations for these requirements are described in Appendix O.  

## 2.2.4.2.2.2 Traffic Is Airborne 2.2.4.2.2.2.1 Traffic Is Inside Of The Surface Volume 2.2.4.2.2.2.1.1 Ownship Is On Ground

When ownship is on ground and airborne traffic inside the Surface Volume meets the following criteria, ASSAP **shall** (2355) mark the traffic valid for SURF on the CDTI

of 4 or greater (< 1.0 NM). OR 
d3.  (Optional) ADS-B/ADS-R (not TIS-B) traffic is reporting valid velocity, and 
velocity quality can be ensured to meet 10 m/s accuracy based on derived velocity using the ADS-B position messages. 
 
OR 
d4.  (Optional) Airborne 1090 MHz ADS-B traffic is identified as a duplicate 
address track.  Since horizontal velocity and track angle are considered invalid, these tracks may be processed without track estimation and displayed as nondirectional symbols. 
1. An acceptable means of compliance for deriving velocity accuracy is shown in 
Appendix E. 
2. Most current ADS-B/ADS-R DO-260/ED-102 Version 0 traffic report velocity 
quality as "unknown" despite reporting velocity that is acceptable for the SURF application.  To be valid SURF traffic they must continue to report a valid horizontal velocity and meet the other minimum traffic requirements for this 
application.  Currently, airborne TIS-B traffic will not meet 10 m/s when 
exceeding a 0.05g turn; therefore, TIS-B traffic reporting a NACV of 0 may not be 
used to determine SURF traffic validity.   

## 2.2.4.2.2.2.1.2 Ownship Is Airborne

When ownship is airborne and airborne traffic inside the Surface Volume meets the following criteria, ASSAP **shall** (2354) mark the traffic valid for SURF on the CDTI

d4. 
(Optional) Airborne 1090 MHz ADS-B traffic is identified as a duplicate 
address track.  Since horizontal velocity and track angle are considered invalid, these tracks may be processed without track estimation and displayed as nondirectional symbols.

An acceptable means of compliance for deriving velocity accuracy is shown in
Appendix E.
2.
Most current ADS-B/ADS-R DO-260/ED-102 Version 0 traffic report velocity
quality as "unknown" despite reporting velocity that is acceptable for the SURF application. To be valid SURF traffic they must continue to report a valid horizontal velocity and meet the other minimum traffic requirements for this
application. Currently, airborne TIS-B traffic will not meet 10 m/s when
exceeding a 0.05g turn; therefore, TIS-B traffic reporting a NACV of 0 may not be
used to determine SURF traffic validity.

## 2.2.4.2.2.2.2 Traffic Is Outside Of The Surface Volume

When airborne traffic outside the Surface Volume meets the following criteria, ASSAP 
shall (2147) mark the SURF Traffic Application Capability as valid for SURF on the CDTI interface:

application.  Currently, airborne TIS-B traffic will not meet 10 m/s when 
exceeding a 0.05g turn; therefore, TIS-B traffic reporting a NACV of 0 may not be 
used to determine SURF traffic validity.  

## 2.2.4.3 Visual Separation On Approach (Vsa)

All existing versions of the 1090ES, UAT and VDL4 ADS-B links are capable of producing VSA traffic data (e.g., DO-260 / ED-102 Version 0), and all future versions are expected to be developed to be capable of producing VSA traffic data.  
ASSAP's contribution to this application includes the tracking and traffic correlation requirements that are applicable to all applications.  ASSAP also determines whether the quality of Traffic and Ownship information satisfies the VSA requirements, and notifies the CDTI if VSA is available.   

## 2.2.4.3.1 Ownship Requirements

ASSAP can only perform the Visual Separation on Approach application when ownship horizontal and vertical positions are valid and of sufficient quality.  Vertical position is satisfied by geometric altitude (optional) or pressure altitude.  

a. When ownship horizontal or vertical position is invalid, ASSAP **shall** (2165) signal 
that VSA is Unavailable (fail) via the CDTI interface.  
b. When ownship horizontal position uncertainty (95%) is greater than or equal to 0.3 
NM (555.6 m), ASSAP **shall** (2166) signal that VSA is Unavailable (fail) via the 
CDTI interface.  
c. When geometric altitude is used for vertical position (optional) and own aircraft 
vertical position uncertainty (95%) is greater than 45 m, ASSAP **shall** (2167) signal 
that VSA is Unavailable (fail) via the CDTI interface. 
ASSAP can only perform the Visual Separation on Approach application when ownship horizontal velocity is of sufficient quality.  

d. When ownship horizontal velocity uncertainty (95%) is greater than or equal to 10 
m/s, ASSAP **shall** (2168) signal that VSA is Unavailable (fail) via the CDTI 
interface.  
e.
When the ownship SIL is less than 1 (1E-3/hr) or the horizontal position integrity
bound is greater than or equal to 0.75 NM, ASSAP **shall** (2169) signal that VSA is
Unavailable (fail) via the CDTI interface.

## 2.2.4.3.2 Vsa Traffic Requirements

For use with the VSA application, traffic must be derived from valid horizontal and vertical position and valid horizontal velocity data.  Vertical position can be satisfied by pressure altitude or if unavailable, geometric altitude (optional).  When traffic meets the following criteria, ASSAP **shall** (2170) mark the VSA Traffic Application Capability as valid on the CDTI interface: 

a1.  When pressure altitude is used for vertical position, traffic has a NACP of 6 or 
greater (< 0.3 NM). 
OR 
a2. 
When geometric altitude is used for vertical position (optional), DO-260B/ED-
102A (i.e., Version 2) traffic has a NACP of 6 or greater (< 0.3 NM) and a 
GVA of 2 or greater (≤ 45 m). 
Note: Geometric altitude from Version 0 or Version 1 may not be used to determine VSA validity. 

## And

b1. 
Traffic is reporting valid velocity and has a NACV of 1 or greater (< 10 m/s). 
OR 
b2. 
(Optional) Version 0 traffic is reporting valid horizontal velocity AND a NUCP 
of 4 or greater (< 1.0 NM). OR 
b3. 
(Optional) ADS-B/ADS-R (not TIS-B) traffic is reporting valid velocity, and velocity quality can be ensured to meet 10 m/s accuracy based on derived velocity using the ADS-B position messages.   
1.
An acceptable means of compliance for deriving velocity accuracy is shown in
Appendix E.
2.
Most current ADS-B/ADS-R DO-260/ED-102 (Version 0) traffic report velocity
quality as "unknown" despite reporting velocity that is acceptable for the VSA
application. To be valid VSA traffic they must continue to report a valid horizontal velocity and meet the other minimum traffic requirements for this
application. Currently, airborne TIS-B traffic will not meet 10 m/s when
exceeding a 0.05 g turn; therefore, TIS-B traffic reporting a NACV of 0 may not
be used to determine VSA traffic validity.

## And

c.
Traffic has a NIC of 6 or greater (< 0.6 NM) AND a SIL of 1 or greater (≤ 1E-3).
AND 

d. 
Traffic's State Data is updated within the maximum data age of 15 seconds. 
AND 

e. 
DO-260B/ED-102A (Version 2) traffic has an SDA of greater than or equal to 
1 (≤ 1E-3). 
Note:  TIS-B Service provided in the United States can be assumed to comply with this requirement, see Section §1.5.1.2.3.    

## 2.2.4.3.3 Differential Ground Speed

When used by the CDTI (optional), ASSAP **shall** (2263) calculate Differential Ground Speed within a ±1 knot tolerance. 

Differential Ground Speed = Horizontal Velocity of Ownship - Horizontal Velocity of Designated Traffic. 

Note:  It is acceptable for the CDTI to calculate Differential Ground Speed instead of ASSAP. 

## 2.2.4.4 In-Trail Procedure (Itp)

ASSAP's contribution to this application includes the tracking and traffic correlation requirements that are applicable to all applications.  ASSAP also determines whether ownship information and traffic information is of adequate quality to perform ITP.  
ASSAP also calculates all the ITP parameters for the ITP Traffic. 

## 2.2.4.4.1 Ownship Requirements

ASSAP **shall** (2358) only perform the In Trail Procedures application when the following are valid:  

a. Ownship horizontal position uncertainty is less than 0.5 NM; 
b. Ownship horizontal position integrity bound is less than 1.0 NM with an integrity 
level of 1E-5;   
c. Ownship horizontal velocity uncertainty is less than 10m/s;  
Note: The horizontal velocity accuracy performance may be established by analysis of the installed equipment.  If the ownship velocity accuracy is established this way, the analysis must be approved during the installation approval process.  
d. Ownship pressure altitude is valid.  
ASSAP **shall** (2359) signal the ITP Application as unavailable to run on the CDTI 
interface if the Basic Airborne Application is unavailable to run or unavailable (fault).    

## 2.2.4.4.2 Itp Traffic Requirements

When traffic meets the following criteria, ASSAP **shall** (2360) mark the ITP Traffic Application Capability as valid on the CDTI interface (in this document this traffic is referred to as "ITP Traffic"): 

1.
Some implementations may intentionally restrict ITP Traffic to aircraft within an
altitude band (e.g., between the ownship's current altitude and the destination altitude) and/or a defined longitudinal and lateral range from the ownship's position.
2.
A traffic application capability status of Valid for ITP indicates that the traffic data
quality supports the application, but does not indicate that the traffic meets the ITP
geometric initiation criteria.
a.
Traffic is reporting a valid horizontal position with a NACP of 5 or greater
(< 0.5 NM).
b.
Traffic is reporting a valid horizontal position integrity bound with a NIC 5 or greater (< 1.0 NM).
Note: Existing version 0 and version 1 ADS-B systems may not output position integrity based on HIL.  It is therefore required to validate position information from version 0 and 1 traffic.  See Section §2.2.4.4.2.1.    

c.
Version 2 traffic is reporting a valid horizontal velocity with a NACV of 1 or greater
(< 10m/s (19.4kts)).
Note: Many existing version 0 and version 1 ADS-B systems do not appropriately output their velocity quality. It is therefore required to validate velocity information from version 0 and 1 traffic. See Section §2.2.4.4.2.2.   

d.
Version 2 (or higher) traffic is reporting a SIL of 2 or greater encoded per hour (≤ 1E-5 / hr)
e.
Version 1 traffic is reporting a SIL of 2 or greater (≤ 1E-5).
f.
Version 2 traffic is reporting a SDA of 2 or greater (≤ 1E-5).
g.
Traffic is reporting valid pressure altitude.
h.
Traffic position message has been received within the last 25 seconds.

## 2.2.4.4.2.1 Validation Of Traffic Position With Tcas Data

For use with the ITP application, traffic position must be validated with active TCAS data.  The specific requirements (e.g., validation thresholds) for the ITP application are defined in this section; the general validation requirements are defined in Section 
§2.2.3.1.3.5 *Additional Validation of Traffic Position with TCAS Data*.

ASSAP **shall** (2249) perform ADS-B position data validation for ITP traffic at ranges less than 30 NM from ownship and is only required at ranges greater than or equal to 30 NM if TCAS measurements are available.    
Note:  In some TCAS installations, TCAS tracking range may be limited in the aft direction, but ADS-B position data validation for ITP must be performed at ranges less than 30 NM from ownship. 

ASSAP **shall** (2250) pass the validation test if: 
|slant range difference| < 0.7 NM; and 
|bearing difference| ≤ 45 degrees; and 
|altitude difference| < 200 feet. 

## 2.2.4.4.2.2 Validation Of Traffic Velocity

ADS-B tracks based on version 0 or version 1 messages **shall** (2372) be validated using the requirements in this subparagraph in order to be used as ITP Traffic.  ADS-B tracks based on version 2 messages may be validated using the requirements in this subparagraph in order to qualify valid velocity data. 

ASSAP **shall** (2373) derive velocity accuracy using the ADS-B position messages from candidate ITP Traffic.  An acceptable means of compliance for deriving velocity accuracy is shown in Appendix E.  The velocity **shall** (2374) be validated within 5 
minutes of evaluating the ITP geometric criteria.   
The velocity validation threshold **shall** (2375) be 10 m/s.  If the velocity validation fails, the traffic **shall** (2305) be marked invalid for the ITP Application. 

## 2.2.4.4.3 Itp Computation Requirements

ASSAP **shall** (2304) compute Similar Track Criteria for ITP Traffic.  If the ITP traffic Similar Track Criteria is valid, then ASSAP **shall** (2376) compute ITP Geometric Status.   

## 2.2.4.4.3.1 Similar Track Criteria

Similar Track Criteria **shall** (2382) be marked valid if the relative track angle between ownship and ITP Traffic is less than 45° and greater than 315°.   

## 2.2.4.4.3.2 Itp Distance

The ASSAP **shall** (2391) calculate ITP distance, within ±0.15 NM tolerance, for all ITP 
traffic. ITP Distance, dITP, is the absolute value of the distance between ownship and ITP Traffic as defined by the difference in distance to a common point along the projection of each aircraft's track.  The diagrams below show how ITP Distance is calculated for various traffic configurations. For the case where aircraft are on parallel tracks, the ITP Distance is measured along the track of one of the aircraft using its calculated position and the point abeam the calculated position of the other aircraft.  The common point can be an arbitrary point along one aircraft's track or the abeam point (i.e., in the diagram below d2 can be equal to zero). 

The distance from each aircraft to the common point is a scalar quantity and is always positive (i.e., d1 and d2 are always positive scalar quantities).  
For situations where aircraft are on opposite sides of the common point, note that the equation changes and the distances are additive. 

## 2.2.4.4.3.3 Ahead Or Behind Status

ASSAP **shall** (2377) determine whether ownship is "ahead" or "behind" in relation to all ITP traffic.  
When two aircraft are on converging intersecting tracks (i.e., both before the common point - see Figure 2-11), the aircraft with the shortest distance to the common point is the aircraft ahead and the aircraft with the longest distance to the common point is the aircraft behind. 

When two aircraft are on diverging intersecting tracks (i.e., both after the common point 
- see Figure 2-12), the aircraft with the longest distance to the common point is the aircraft ahead and the aircraft with the shortest distance to the common point is the aircraft behind. 

When aircraft are on intersecting tracks with one flying away from the common point and one flying towards the common point (i.e., one before the common point and one after the common point - see Figure 2-13), the aircraft ahead is the one flying away from the common point and the aircraft behind is the one flying towards the common point. 

## 2.2.4.4.3.4 Rate Of Change Of Itp Distance

ASSAP **shall** (2378) calculate the Rate of Change of ITP Distance within a ±1 knot tolerance. The Rate of Change of ITP distance is the speed, expressed in knots, at which the ITP Distance is changing.  When the Rate of Change of ITP Distance is positive, the ITP Distance is decreasing.  When the Rate of Change of ITP Distance is 0, the ITP Distance is constant.  When the Rate of Change of ITP Distance is negative, the ITP Distance is increasing. Rate of Change of ITP distance is the horizontal velocity of the aircraft behind minus the horizontal velocity of the aircraft ahead: Rate of Change of ITP distance = Horizontal Velocity of Aircraft Behind - Horizontal Velocity of Aircraft Ahead 

## 2.2.4.4.3.5 Itp Geometric Status

When traffic meets the following criteria, ASSAP **shall** (2379) mark the traffic ITP 
Geometric Status as valid on the CDTI interface:  

a. The difference in altitude between the ownship aircraft and the traffic is 2500 feet or 
less.  
1. To prevent the unwanted exclusion of ITP Traffic due to altimeter error and/or 
aircraft currently flying marginally above or below their assigned flight level it is recommended that implementations use difference of altitude of between 500 and 2500 feet.  
2. The value for relative altitude difference was previously listed as 3000 feet in 
DO-312/ED-159. The ICAO Separation and Airspace Safety Panel (SASP) 
conducted subsequent additional analyses using more conservative collision risk modeling which resulted in a 2000 value for the relative altitude criteria. 
AND 

b1. 
ITP Distance ≥ 15 NM and Rate of Change of ITP Distance ≤ 20 Knots 
OR 

b2. 
ITP Distance ≥ 20 NM and Rate of Change of ITP Distance ≤ 30 Knots  

## 2.2.4.5 Tsaa Application Processing Requirements

The ASSAP function contributes to TSAA by analyzing ownship and traffic trajectories to identify traffic that poses a collision risk. It also generates aural messages for annunciating alerts to the pilot.  
Appendix T of this document describes a sample TSAA application algorithm. The TSAA application is expected to provide the flight crew with adequate time to respond to the TSAA Traffic Caution Alert.  Current traffic alerting systems nominally provide 20 to 40 seconds of time for flight crew response. (Reference DO-348/ED-232) The ability for a system to automatically update a traffic alert when the encounter persists or degrades is an optional feature of the TSAA application. This optional feature is present in the sample algorithm in Appendix T.   

## 2.2.4.5.1 Tsaa Ownship Requirements

ASSAP **shall** (2216) signal that TSAA is unavailable to run if:  

a. the underlying traffic application (i.e., AIRB or EVAcq) is unavailable to run or 
unavailable - fault; 
OR 

b. Ownship horizontal velocity accuracy is greater than or equal to 10 m/s. 
OR 
c1. Ownship pressure altitude is invalid, AND 

c2. Either ownship geometric altitude is invalid OR ownship geometric vertical 
uncertainty is greater than 45 meters. 

## 2.2.4.5.2 Tsaa Traffic Requirements

ASSAP **shall** (2217) mark the TSAA Traffic Application Capability as valid only for traffic that meets the AIRB or EVAcq Traffic Requirements in Section §2.2.4.1.2.  For TIS-B tracks reporting NACV of 0 TSAA may assume a directionality accuracy of 30 
degrees.   
Note: For systems without a Traffic Display, the EVAcq traffic requirements are the minimum for TSAA. 

An EVAcq or AIRB traffic may not be reporting pressure altitude.  This condition is known as Non-Altitude Reporting (NAR).  If traffic pressure altitude is unavailable, Traffic Relative Altitude **shall** (2254) be derived using geometric altitude when: traffic ADS-B Version is 2 or greater, traffic reported GVA is 2 or greater (≤ 45 m), and ownship geometric altitude uncertainty (95%) is less than or equal to 45 m.   
Note: TSAA may optionally alert on NAR traffic. It should be rare for both pressure altitude and geometric altitude to be unavailable. Therefore, the missed alerts due to a system choosing not to alert on NAR traffic is considered acceptable. 

## 2.2.4.5.3 Tsaa Traffic Caution Alert Criteria

The ASSAP function will generate traffic alerts for display on the CDTI according to the following subsections. TSAA logic should use ownship and traffic state data from the ASSAP to predict trajectories and detect threatening encounters. TSAA should provide a single TSAA Traffic Caution Alert per threatening encounter. 

However TSAA may include additional logic that automatically updates the Traffic Caution Alert when the encounter persists or degrades (See Section §2.2.4.5.3.1.1).    

## 2.2.4.5.3.1 Tsaa Traffic Caution Alert Performance Requirements

The ASSAP TSAA Traffic Caution Alert criteria is determined by two cylindrical volumes around the TSAA Aircraft; one to specify when alerts must be issued, and the other to specify when alerts must not be issued.  The dimensions of the cylinder are based on closest point of approach in the operational environment and are summarized in Table 
2-6.  The subsequent sections describe the requirements based on these alerting criteria. 

The design requirements are intended to guide the design.  Effects from sensor errors are not called out in the requirements but are accounted for in the test tracks in Appendix U. 

Hysteresis can be applied as long as the requirements are met.

## 2.2.4.5.3.1.1 Must Alert Tracks

A specific algorithm is not required for TSAA.  The following Must Alert requirements are meant to bound the performance of the system while not prescribing any specific algorithm.  
The ASSAP **shall** (2218) generate alerts in threatening encounters at least 35 seconds prior to closest point of approach (CPA) with TSAA traffic for scenarios where ownship and TSAA traffic are not accelerating.  This requirement should apply for all threatening encounters, but some dynamics make this infeasible.  Test tracks in Section U.2.2 and U.2.3 have been designed such that the average time to alert across all the test tracks must be greater than 30 seconds. This is consistent with desired TCAS TA timing.   
The ASSAP **shall** (2219) generate alerts more than 12.5 seconds prior to CPA with TSAA traffic when CPA will be within 500 ft horizontally and 200 ft vertically of the ownship and the ownship is operating in the airport environment. 

The ASSAP **shall** (2242) generate alerts more than 12.5 seconds prior to CPA with TSAA traffic when CPA will be within 500 ft horizontally and 450 ft vertically of the ownship and the ownship is operating in the en route environment. 

1. There is no requirement to detect the airport environment. A system alerting at 500 ft 
horizontally and 450 ft vertically both nearby and away from airports will meet both 
requirements above.  However, systems should be designed to accommodate smaller horizontal and vertical separations in the airport environment than in the en route environment. This document does not state how the airport environment may be 
determined or inferred (e.g., radio altitude, gear position, airport database).  The 
sample algorithm uses the velocities of ownship and traffic as proxies for the operating environment (See Appendix T).  There is also no requirement to calculate 
the predicted CPA either horizontally or vertically.  The predicted separation at CPA 
is one of many ways to determine the threat level of the encounter. 
2. The alert timing requirements apply between system interfaces D and F. 
The following requirement is intended to ensure ASSAP generates timely alerts during slow closure rate scenarios. 

The ASSAP **shall** (2255) indicate alert status for traffic within 500 ft horizontally and 
200 ft vertically of ownship. 

1.
The detection of traffic can include the effects of common time extrapolation of traffic and ownship state vectors.
2.
The dimensions referenced above are a minimum size for triggering or maintaining an alert but manufacturers are free to increase the size of the zone so long that other alerting requirements are met.
If an optional automatic update feature is not present, the ASSAP **shall** (2244) produce a single alert for each threatening encounter. 

If an optional automatic update feature is present, the ASSAP **shall** (2256) produce no more than two alerts for each threatening encounter. 

The ASSAP **shall** (2245) discontinue the alert status when the traffic no longer poses a threat. An acceptable means of compliance is to discontinue the alert status when: 

a.
ownship and traffic are not converging vertically or horizontally
AND b.
Horizontal Separation >750 ft OR Vertical Separation > 450 ft

## 2.2.4.5.3.1.2 Must Not Alert Tracks

A specific algorithm is not required for TSAA. The following Must Not Alert Tracks requirements are meant to bound the performance of the system while not prescribing any specific algorithm.  
The ASSAP **shall** (2220) generate no alerts when CPA with TSAA traffic will be greater than 0.5 NM horizontally or 500 ft vertically from the ownship and the ownship is operating in the airport environment. 

The ASSAP **shall** (2246) generate no alerts when (1) CPA with TSAA traffic will be greater than 2 NM horizontally or 850 ft vertically from the ownship, (2) the ownship is below 10,000 ft, and (3) the ownship is operating in the en route environment. 

The ASSAP **shall** (2247) generate no alerts when (1) CPA with TSAA traffic will be greater than 3 NM horizontally or 850 ft vertically from the ownship, (2) the ownship is at or above 10,000 ft, and (3) the ownship is operating in the en route environment. The ASSAP should generate no traffic alerts on normal safe traffic pattern operations (e.g., steep 90° turns). 

1.
There is no requirement to detect the airport environment.  A system suppressing
alerts at 0.5 NM horizontally and 500 ft vertically both nearby and away from airports and above and below 10,000 ft will meet the three requirements above. However, systems should be designed to accommodate smaller horizontal and vertical separations in the airport environment than in the en route environment.
This document does not state how the airport environment may be determined or inferred (e.g., radio altitude, gear position, airport database).  There is also no requirement to calculate the predicted CPA either horizontally or vertically.  The predicted separation at CPA is one of many ways to determine the threat level of the encounter. 

2. The source of the 10,000 ft altitude used for transition, if implemented, is left up to 
the manufacturer. 

## 2.2.4.5.3.2 Concurrent Tsaa Traffic Caution Alerts

ASSAP **shall** (2221) provide a means to prioritize concurrent TSAA Traffic Caution Alerts.  
Prioritizing alerts by smallest to largest estimated time to closest approach (e.g., tau) is an acceptable means of compliance. 

Note:  Traffic alert prioritization is used for assigning traffic priority per §2.2.2.1.5.1.2 
and generating/queuing concurrent TSAA aural alerts. 

## 2.2.4.5.3.3 Tsaa Traffic Caution Alerts On Correlated Tcas Tracks

The TSAA application may be integrated with TCAS I or TAS systems. It must not be integrated with TCAS II. 

If an ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track is correlated with a TCAS track, then the alerts **shall** 
(2223) only be presented from either the TSAA application or the TCAS system (i.e., not both). TSAA alerts should take precedence over TCAS alerts when the TCAS track is correlated with an ADS-B or ADS-R track; but, TCAS alerts should take precedence over TSAA 
alerts when the TCAS track is correlated with a TIS-B track. 

## 2.2.4.5.4 Tsaa Aural Alerts

The ASSAP function will generate aural alert messages for annunciation according to the requirements in the following subsections. 

## 2.2.4.5.4.1 Tsaa Traffic Caution Alert Acknowledge

For systems where the aural annunciation contains relative traffic position, the ASSAP 
shall (2224) discontinue the aural annunciation of the current TSAA Traffic Caution Alert when it receives a TSAA Traffic Caution Alert Acknowledge from the pilot via the CDTI.  
Note: This discontinues the aural annunciation of the current alert; this does not inhibit alert updates on the traffic. 

## 2.2.4.5.4.2 Aural Alert Components

The aural portion of the TSAA Traffic Caution Alert generated by the ASSAP **shall** 
(2225) contain components a. and b. in the order indicated.  

a.
"Traffic"
b.
Relative traffic bearing expressed as clock position, (e.g., "Two O'Clock")
Note: Relative traffic bearing can be computed using ownship track angle or ownship heading, if available.  It is recommended that heading be used. 

For TSAA without a Traffic Display, the aural portion of the TSAA Traffic Caution Alert shall (3176) also contain components c. and d.   For TSAA with a Traffic Display, the aural portion of the TSAA Traffic Caution Alert should also contain components c. and d. The order of c. and d. may be interchanged. 

c.
Relative altitude (e.g., "High")
d.
Range (e.g., "two miles")
The aural portion of the TSAA traffic Caution Alert should include: 

e.
Vertical Tendency (e.g., "descending")
Note: For example, "Traffic, two o'clock, high, two miles, descending."   

## 2.2.4.5.4.3 Updated Aural Alert Components

When implemented, the aural portion of the updated TSAA Traffic Caution Alert generated by ASSAP **shall** (2226) contain the most recent traffic information components in Section §2.2.4.5.4.2.    

1.
It is envisioned that the system will choose the most threatening encounter to annunciate first in a multiple intruder encounter. However, this does not preclude
features that allow a pilot to choose which traffic alert to update.
2.
The Updated TSAA Traffic Caution Alert is manually initiated as described in
Section §2.4.1.3.  The TSAA sample algorithm described in Appendix T contains the
optional function to automatically update alerts.

## 2.2.4.5.5 Tsaa Alert Status Duration

The duration of the TSAA Traffic Caution Alert status **shall** (2227) be the greatest of the following: 

•
8 seconds
•
Duration of the active aural message(s)
•
Duration that the TSAA Traffic Caution Alert criteria is met

## 2.2.4.5.6 Tsaa Alert Suppression

TSAA alerts will be inhibited under the following conditions: 

1. ASSAP **shall** (2228) inhibit all TSAA Traffic Caution Alerts when ownship's 
airborne / on ground status is "on ground". 
2. ASSAP **shall** (2229) inhibit TSAA Traffic Caution Alerts for traffic that has an 
airborne / on ground status indicated as "on ground". 

## 2.2.4.5.7 Nearby Airborne Traffic

For systems with a Traffic Display, the ASSAP **shall** (2230) indicate Nearby Airborne Traffic to the CDTI interface for traffic that is less than 6 NM in range and ±1200 feet vertically from ownship. 

## 2.2.4.6 Cdti Assisted Visual Separation (Cavs)

All existing versions of the 1090ES, UAT and VDL4 ADS-B links are capable of producing CAVS traffic data (e.g., DO-260 / ED-102 Version 0), and all future versions are expected to be developed to be capable of producing CAVS traffic data.  At this point there is insufficient data to show whether the reported TIS-B velocity has the quality required during in-trail acceleration/deceleration in order to display traffic ground speed and to compute differential ground speed when sourced by terminal radars or multilateration.  Until data collection and analysis is completed TIS-B is not approved for use with CAVS.  Investigation is also under way for using TCAS range rate to validate or possibly substitute for TIS-B velocity.  That possibility is not discussed in this document.  
Manufacturers have the option of using an issue paper if they have sufficient data to show that TIS-B and/or other data sources can be safely used to provide velocity for CAVS until the next version of this document is published. 

ASSAP's contribution to this application includes the tracking and traffic correlation requirements that are applicable to all applications.  In the following subsections, ASSAP determines whether the quality of Traffic and Ownship information satisfies the CAVS requirements, and notifies the CDTI if CAVS is available.  ASSAP also provides a CAVS Range Alert aural when the designated traffic is closer than a minimum distance threshold. 

## 2.2.4.6.1 Ownship Requirements

ASSAP can only perform the CAVS application when ownship horizontal and vertical positions are valid and of sufficient quality.  Vertical position is satisfied by geometric altitude (optional) or pressure altitude.  

a. When ownship horizontal or vertical position is invalid, ASSAP **shall** (2231) signal 
that CAVS is Unavailable (fail) via the CDTI interface.  
b. When ownship horizontal position uncertainty (95%) is greater than or equal to 0.1 
NM, ASSAP **shall** (2232) signal that CAVS is Unavailable (fail) via the CDTI 
interface.  
c.
When the ownship SIL is less than 3 (1E-7/hr) or the horizontal position integrity
bound is greater than or equal to 0.6 NM, ASSAP **shall** (2233) signal that CAVS is
Unavailable (fail) via the CDTI interface.
d.
When geometric altitude is used for vertical position (optional) and own aircraft
vertical position uncertainty (95%) is greater than 45 m, ASSAP **shall** (2234) signal
that CAVS is Unavailable (fail) via the CDTI interface.
ASSAP can only perform the CAVS application when ownship horizontal velocity is of sufficient quality.  

e.
When ownship horizontal velocity uncertainty (95%) is greater than or equal to 10
m/s, ASSAP **shall** (2235) signal that CAVS is Unavailable (fail) via the CDTI
interface.

## 2.2.4.6.2 Cavs Traffic Requirements

For use with the CAVS application, traffic must be derived from valid horizontal and vertical position and valid horizontal velocity data.  Vertical position can be satisfied by pressure altitude or if unavailable, geometric altitude (optional).  
When traffic meets the following criteria, ASSAP **shall** (2236) mark the CAVS Traffic Application Capability as valid on the CDTI interface: 

a.
Traffic is an ADS-B or ADS-R source track (not TIS-B).
AND 

b1. 
Traffic is reporting valid horizontal position and has a NACP of 7 or greater 
(< 0.1 NM). 
OR 

b2. 
(Optional) Traffic is reporting valid horizontal position, has a NACP of 6 or 5, 
successfully passes TCAS validation, and b1 was previously met. 

## Or

b3. 
(Optional) Traffic is reporting valid horizontal position, has a NACP of 6 or 5, 
TCAS measurements for validation is unavailable, and b1 was previously met within the last 60 seconds. 
Note: This option prevents momentary accuracy drops from erroneously disqualifying traffic. 

AND 

c1. 
Traffic is reporting valid pressure altitude. 
OR 

c2. 
(Optional) Version 2 traffic is reporting valid geometric altitude and has a 
GVA of 2 or greater (≤ 45 m). 
Note: Geometric altitude from Version 0 or Version 1 may not be used to determine CAVS validity. 

AND 

d. Version 2 traffic is reporting valid velocity and has a NACV of 1 or greater  
(< 10 m/s). 

Note: Many existing version 0 and version 1 ADS-B systems do not 
       appropriately output their velocity quality.  It is therefore required to 
       validate velocity information from version 0 and 1 traffic.  See Section 
       2.2.4.6.2.2.   

AND 

e1. 
Traffic has a NIC of 6 or greater (< 0.6 NM). 
OR 

e2. 
(Optional) Traffic has a NIC of 5, successfully passes TCAS validation, and e1 was previously met. 
OR 

e3. 
(Optional) Traffic has a NIC of 5, TCAS measurements for validation is unavailable, and e1 was previously met within the last 60 seconds. 
Note: This option prevents momentary integrity drops from erroneously disqualifying traffic. 

AND 

f. 
Traffic's State Data is updated within the maximum data age of 11 seconds. 
AND 

g. 
Version 2 traffic has an SDA of 2 or greater (≤ 1E-5). 
AND

Version 2 (or higher) traffic has a SIL of 3 encoded per hour (≤ 1E-7 / hr). 
OR 

h2. 
Version 1 traffic has a SIL of 2 (≤ 1E-5) or greater. 

## 2.2.4.6.2.1 Validation Of Traffic Position With Tcas Data

For use with the CAVS application, traffic position must be validated with active TCAS 
data.  The specific requirements (e.g., validation thresholds) for the CAVS application are defined in this section; the general validation requirements are defined in Section §2.2.3.1.3.5, "*Additional Validation of Traffic Position with TCAS Data*."    
Note: The validation of traffic position with active TCAS data should be performed on all traffic if possible, but may be performed only on the designated traffic. 

ASSAP **shall** (2251) perform ADS-B/ADS-R position data validation for CAVS traffic at ranges less than 5 NM from ownship and is only required at ranges greater than or equal to 5 NM if TCAS measurements are available.   

Note:  In high density environments near the terminal area, TCAS tracking range may 
be limited, but ADS-B/ADS-R position data validation for CAVS must be 
performed at ranges less than 5 NM from ownship. 
ASSAP **shall** (2252) pass the validation test if: 
|slant range difference| < 0.25 NM; and 

|bearing difference| ≤ 45 degrees; and |altitude difference| < 200 feet. 
The absolute difference in Time of Applicability between the ADS-B/ADS-R position data with the TCAS data, when used for validation, **shall** (2268) be no more than 250 ms. 

## 2.2.4.6.2.2 Validation Of Traffic Velocity

ADS-B tracks based on version 0 or version 1 messages **shall** (2264) be validated using the requirements in this subparagraph in order to be used as CAVS Traffic.  ADS-B 
tracks based on version 2 messages may be validated using the requirements in this subparagraph in order to qualify valid velocity data. 

ASSAP **shall** (2265) derive velocity accuracy using the ADS-B position messages from candidate CAVS Traffic.  An acceptable means of compliance for deriving velocity accuracy is shown in Appendix E.  
The velocity validation threshold **shall** (2266) be 10 m/s.  If the velocity validation fails, the traffic **shall** (2267) be marked invalid for the CAVS Application. 

## 2.2.4.6.3 Caution "Cavs Minimum Range" Alert

If the horizontal range to the CAVS Designated Traffic is less than 1.4 NM, then ASSAP 
shall (2253) provide a caution level aural alert to the Audio System and signal to the CDTI that the Caution "CAVS Minimum Range" Alert status is active. 

1.
Hysteresis can be applied as long as the requirements are met.
2.
The functional elements used for the caution "CAVS Minimum Range" alert must be
compliant with AC 25.1322-1 [18] and CS-25 [19].
If the CAVS Designated Traffic is on the ground, then ASSAP **shall** (2269) inhibit the Caution "CAVS Minimum Range" Alert aural and set the Caution "CAVS Minimum Range" Alert Status to inactive to the CDTI. 

Note:  If the implementation supports designating traffic on the ground, for CAVS 
departure operations as an example, the Caution "CAVS Minimum Range" Alert must not be generated when the designated traffic is on the ground. 

## 2.2.4.6.4 Cavs Differential Ground Speed

ASSAP **shall** (2260) calculate Differential Ground Speed within a ±1 knot tolerance. 

Differential Ground Speed = Horizontal Velocity of Ownship - Horizontal Velocity of Designated Traffic. 

Note:  It is acceptable for the CDTI to calculate Differential Ground Speed instead of 
ASSAP. 

## 2.2.5 Assap Monitor Function

A means **shall** (2176) be provided for monitoring of the ASSAP function's ability to perform its intended function.  Detections of any fault condition resulting in the inability of ASSAP to perform its intended function **shall** (2177) result in an indication to the flight crew. 

## 2.2.6 Tis-B/Ads-R Service Status 2.2.6.1 Uat And 1090 Es

If a TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status message has been received within the previous 40 
seconds with the ownship's 24-bit Address and an in-service bit the ASSAP **shall** (2202) 
provide an indication to the CDTI that the aircraft is within TIS-B/ADS-R coverage.  
Otherwise the ASSAP **shall** (2203) indicate to the CDTI that the aircraft is not within TIS-B/ADS-R coverage or the traffic picture is incomplete. Aircraft equipped with an operational TCAS system are not required to display TIS-
B/ADS-R Service Status.   

Note: Manufacturers may provide an installation method to disable TIS-B/ADS-R 
Service Status for aircraft operating in countries that do not provide TIS-B or ADS-R services. 

## 2.2.6.2 Vdl4

If a DoS message with the TIS-B service available bit set has been received within the previous 40 seconds the ASSAP **shall** (2380) provide an indication to the CDTI that the aircraft is within TIS-B coverage.  Otherwise the ASSAP **shall** (2381) indicate to the CDTI that the aircraft is not within TIS-B coverage or the traffic picture is incomplete. 

Aircraft equipped with an operational TCAS system are not required to display TIS-B 
Service Status.  

Note: Manufacturers may provide an installation method to disable TIS-B/ADS-R 
Service Status for aircraft operating in countries that do not provide TIS-B or ADS-R services.  

## 2.3 Cockpit Display Of Traffic Information (Cdti) Subsystem Requirements 2.3.1 General Cdti Requirements

The CDTI is defined as the displays and controls necessary to support the applications included in this document.  The CDTI functions may be integrated into a number of display and control sub-elements.  At a minimum, CDTI includes a graphical plan-view 
(top down) traffic display, hereafter referred to as the Traffic Display, and the controls for the display and applications (as required). 

The Traffic Display is required (in Section 2.3.4.1) to indicate ownship position and (in Section §2.3.1.2), to show the positions, relative to the ownship, of traffic.  The Traffic Display is also required to provide specific traffic information elements in associated data tag and traffic symbology.   
The Traffic Display may be a stand-alone display or displays (dedicated display(s)) or the CDTI information may be present on an existing display(s) (e.g., multi-function display) 
or an EFB.  The controls may be a dedicated CDTI control panel or it may be incorporated into other controls (e.g., MCDU or EFB).  Additional display surfaces and controls may be used. Depending on implementation (refer to Section 1.3.1), the basic (minimal) application of the CDTI is Enhanced Visual Acquisition (EVAcq) or Basic Airborne Situation Awareness (AIRB).  CDTI **shall** (3000) support the EVAcq or AIRB requirements.  
The following applications may also be implemented.  When implemented, they must be based on the AIRB CDTI requirements:   

1.
Basic Surface Situation Awareness (SURF)
2.
Visual Separation on Approach (VSA)
3.
In Trail Procedures (ITP)
4.
CDTI Assisted Visual Separation (CAVS)
The minimum CDTI requirements specified in this version of the MOPS are based on these operational applications.  For each application that is implemented, all of the application's requirements must be met. CDTI may also support integration with TCAS.  Requirements for TCAS support are only applicable in such installations. 

TSAA may be based on either the EVAcq or AIRB CDTI requirements when installed with a CDTI.  TSAA may also be implemented without a Traffic Display by using only an annunciator panel and audio output.   

## 2.3.1.1 Traffic Display Criteria (Tdc)

The surveillance range of the ASA system will frequently include more traffic than is of interest to the flight crew.  Displaying too many traffic elements on the Traffic Display may result in clutter, and compromise the intended function of the CDTI.  To determine the traffic of interest to the flight crew, a set of TDC is used to filter the traffic.  Criteria generally include range and altitude.  Additional criteria may also be used.  The flight crew may change the TDC. 

Note: The traffic elements shown on the Traffic Display are subject to the traffic 
priorities specified in the document (see Section §2.2.2.1.5.1.2), the maximum 
number of traffic elements that can be shown on the display (see Section §2.3.4.3) and the TDC.
a.
All traffic causing TCAS Resolution Advisories (RA) or TCAS Traffic Advisories
(TA) **shall** (3001) be displayed on the Traffic Display.
b. When a TCAS TA or RA is present, all airborne traffic within ±1200 ft altitude and 6 
NM range **shall** (3002) be displayed on the Traffic Display, subject to the selected 
display range, the maximum number of traffic that can be displayed, and the priority 
scheme in Section §2.2.2.1.5.1.2. 
c. The minimum altitude band **shall** (3003) be ±2700 ft altitude ownship. 

## 2.3.1.1.1 Default Traffic Display Criteria

The default range at power-up is defined by the manufacturer.  The flight crew normally alters the range to suit their preference.  The default TDC is dynamic with respect to range, but uses a static altitude band. It is desired that the supported altitude bands are consistent between all cockpit displays; 
that the same altitude bands be used for TCAS-only and CDTI displays.  The standard for TCAS displays is ±2700 ft, however the ASA MASPS recommends that the altitude band be ±3500 ft. 

All non-default TDC **shall** (3005) be annunciated. 

Note:  For example, if the non-default TDC uses an altitude band of +9900 ft and 
-3500 ft, display 'ALT +99/-35' at a place reserved for indicating the non-default TDC on the display.    

## 2.3.1.1.2 Alternate Traffic Display Criteria

An alternate set of traffic display criteria may be used.   

1. Unless there is strong rationale to remove traffic that meets the default TDC, the 
traffic is expected to be retained on the display.   
2. The default TDC and all alternate TDC are expected to be clearly documented and 
the flight crew is expected to be trained accordingly.   

## 2.3.1.2 Required Information

At a minimum, all CDTI installations provide information needed to support the Enhanced Visual Acquisition (EVAcq) or Basic Airborne Situation Awareness (AIRB) 
application.  AIRB and other applications require additional information (see Section 
2.3.9).   

a. The CDTI **shall** (3006) display the following information on the Traffic Display: 
- 
Display range/map scale (see Section §2.3.5.12).   
- 
Ownship Position 
- 
Altitude band 
1. The default altitude band need not be displayed. 
2. Altitude band can be indicated by a selector knob. 
b.
If the CDTI supports more than one directional reference (e.g., heading and track),
then the directional reference **shall** (3007) be indicated on the Traffic Display.
c.
The CDTI **shall** (3008) be capable of displaying traffic within a minimum of ± 9900
feet altitude of ownship on the Traffic Display.
Note:  An installer may tailor the maximum altitude volume as appropriate for the installed applications.   

d.
The CDTI **shall** (3009) have the capability to provide the following traffic
information on the Traffic Display for each displayed traffic element.  Unless
specifically noted elsewhere (e.g., see Sections §2.3.5 and §2.3.4.2.3), the
information can be conveyed graphically (e.g., in the traffic symbol), or as part of a data tag, or a data block.
•
Horizontal position (range and azimuth of traffic symbol on display).
•
Traffic directionality.
•
Traffic altitude (see §2.3.5.5).
•
Air/Ground status.
•
Traffic Vertical Direction Indicator.
•
Traffic Application Capability (see §2.3.5.2).

## 2.3.2 Interfaces 2.3.2.1 Cdti Latency Requirements

Note: Refer to Figure 1-1.  

a.
Maximum Total Latency between interfaces F and G **shall** (3010) be 0.5 seconds.
Note: The F→G latency is applicable to a CDTI system that is operating in normal mode (all processing components operational). 

b.
Human Interface Latency:  The ASA system latency from activation of a control input to the appearance of the response on the CDTI should be fast enough to prevent
undue concentration being required by the flight crew (see AC 20-175).  The specific
acceptable response times depend on the intended function.  Generally, if this value
exceeds 0.25 seconds, an indication that the system has recognized the input should be provided until the response appears on the CDTI.

## 2.3.2.2 Time Of Applicability Of Traffic State Vector (Sv) Data

a.
The CDTI **shall** (3013) update the traffic data at a minimum of once per second.
Notes:

1.
ASSAP provides CDTI an updated traffic state file at least once per second.
2.
Latency requirements in these MOPS may impose higher update rates depending on architecture.
b.
The CDTI **shall** (3014) show the position of all displayed traffic and ownship
position at a common time of applicability within tolerances specified in Section
§2.2.3.6.
Note: The ASSAP subsystem will assure that the position of traffic is extrapolated to a common time of applicability when the system sends the traffic positions to the CDTI function.  If the display update is performed more than once per second, the time of applicability requirement still applies. 

## 2.3.2.3 Cdti Input Requirements From Assap

The CDTI input requirements from the ASSAP are defined in Sections §2.2.2.1.5, 
§2.2.2.3.3, §2.2.2.4.3, §2.2.2.4.4.3, §2.2.2.5.3, §2.2.2.6.2, §2.2.2.7.3, and §2.2.2.8.3.

The CDTI function **shall** (3015) be capable of receiving and processing the ASSAP 
outputs to the CDTI.  

## 2.3.2.3.1 Ownship Pvt Requirements To Cdti

The following ownship position and velocity (PVT) data is received either from ASSAP or from the ownship position source directly (e.g., GNSS Receiver). 

## 2.3.2.3.1.1 Ownship Horizontal Position

a.
When used to position traffic on the display, the CDTI function **shall** (3200) receive 
the Horizontal Position based on referenced to WGS 84 latitude/longitude from the 
ownship position sources.
Note: Depending on implementation, horizontal position inputs could be received
directly from the position source or from ASSAP, see Section §2.2.2.1.3.   
b.
The position received **shall** (3201) meet the requirements defined in Section §2.2.4.

## 2.3.2.3.1.2 Ownship N/S And E/W Velocities

a.
When used for ownship ground speed on the display, the CDTI function **shall** (3203)
receive the N/S and E/W Velocities from the ownship position sources.
Note: The magnitude of velocity from ownship should be used for any computations with traffic velocities (i.e., do not use ownship ground speed since it is ground referenced). 

b.
The velocity received **shall** (3204) meet the requirements defined in Section §2.2.4.

## 2.3.2.3.1.3 Ownship Directionality (Track Angle/Heading)

a.
The CDTI function **shall** (3205) receive the Ownship track angle/heading from the
ownship position sources.
b.
Ownship Track Angle/heading **shall** (3206) be received as, or converted to, true
reference.
c.
When ownship track angle is to be used to orient the display, Ownship Track Angle
shall (3207) be considered invalid when the ownship track angle uncertainty (95%) is
greater than ±5 degrees.
d.
When ownship track angle is to be used to orient the ownship symbol, the Ownship
Track Angle **shall** (3208) be considered invalid when the ownship track angle
uncertainty (95%) is greater than ±30 degrees.
1.
Track angle may be invalidated below a certain speed as a means of compliance based on installed performance.
2.
On the surface, heading is preferred when available.

## 2.3.2.3.1.4 Ownship Pressure Altitude

When Ownship Pressure Altitude is used by the CDTI to determine Traffic Actual Altitude (optional), the CDTI function **shall** (3209) receive the Ownship Pressure Altitude from the ownship position sources.  
When used to display Traffic Actual Altitude (optional), the CDTI function **shall** (3210) 
receive the ownship barometric correction or corrected altitude from the ownship position sources. 

## 2.3.2.3.2 Ownship Length/Width

When used to display the physical extent of the aircraft (optional), the CDTI function shall (3202) receive the A/V Length and Width Code from ownship sources. 

## 2.3.2.4 Outputs From Cdti To Assap

The CDTI provides the flight crew interface for the ASA system.  The flight crew inputs are provided to ASSAP as outputs from CDTI.  The following subsections contain output requirements from the CDTI to ASSAP. 

## 2.3.2.4.1 Application Selection

If the capability for application selection exists within the CDTI, the CDTI **shall** (3016) 
output the application selection status of each selectable application to ASSAP.   
Note: See Section §1.7.1.  

## 2.3.2.4.2 Designated Traffic

If the flight crew has the ability to designate traffic, the CDTI **shall** (3017) output to ASSAP the Track ID of the designated traffic, and an identifier for the associated application.   

1.
Designating involves specifying traffic elements to be operated on using a specific
application.  Both the traffic elements and the application are specified.  Designated
status is used for prioritization by ASSAP.
2.
See Section §1.7.1.
3. For systems supporting ACAS traffic designation, the CDTI will output the Traffic 
ACAS Alternative Logic Designation to ASSAP when available.  (See Section 
§2.2.2.4.4) 

## 2.3.2.4.3 Selected Traffic

In installations where ASSAP performs the traffic prioritization and the flight crew has the ability to select traffic, the CDTI **shall** (3018) output the selected traffic Track ID(s) 
to ASSAP. 

1. Selection status is used for prioritization by ASSAP. 
2. See Section §1.7.1.    

## 2.3.2.4.4 Map Data

The following requirements apply when airport map data resides within the CDTI. 

## 2.3.2.4.4.1 Surface Volume Determination

output data, such as the Field Elevation for the relevant airport to ASSAP.  

## 2.3.2.4.4.2 Airport Runway Information

When used for the SURF application (e.g., to filter relevant SURF traffic), CDTI **shall** 
(3212) output the runway location data for all runways of the relevant airport to ASSAP.   

## 2.3.2.4.5 Tsaa Alert Acknowledge

There are situations where the pilot may choose to silence the aural annunciation of the TSAA Traffic Caution Alert, such as when other high priority tasks demand attention or when the pilot is already aware of the alerted traffic. If the TSAA application is implemented and the aural annunciation contains relative traffic position, the CDTI **shall** (3012) output a TSAA Alert Acknowledge indication to ASSAP, when activated by the flight crew. 

## 2.3.2.4.6 Traffic Display Criteria

The CDTI may output the Traffic Display Criteria (TDC) to ASSAP.  
Note: The TDC could be used to filter the traffic sent across the ASSAP to CDTI 
interface in some implementations.  TDC is described in Section §2.3.1.1. 

## 2.3.2.4.7 Tsaa Alert Update

If the TSAA application is implemented with a feature that allows updating the alert, the CDTI **shall** (3019) output an update request to ASSAP, when activated by the flight crew. 

Note:  
The TSAA aural alert update is optional for TSAA with a Traffic Display.

## 2.3.2.4.8 Additional Crew Input

The CDTI may output additional crew input to ASSAP.  

## 2.3.3 Display Design - General 2.3.3.1 Display Characteristics

CDTI information should be discernable, legible, and unambiguous within all flight environments (e.g., ambient illumination), even when displayed in combination with other information (e.g., electronic map).   
The operating range of display luminance and contrast **shall** (3021) be sufficient to ensure display readability through the full range of normally expected flight deck illumination conditions (Reference Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) ARP4256A). 

## 2.3.3.2 Dynamics

a.
Movement of CDTI information should not result in objectionable jitter, jerkiness, or ratcheting effects.
b.
Movement of CDTI information should not blur, shimmer, or produce unintended
dynamic effects such that the information becomes distracting or difficult to interpret.
c.
Filtering or coasting of CDTI data intended to smooth the movement of CDTI information should not introduce significant positioning errors or create system lag that makes it difficult to perform the intended task.

## 2.3.3.3 Labels

Labels are descriptions of information elements or controls.  Labels include text such as "NM" for nautical miles, and icons such as  
 for on/off. Standard or unambiguous abbreviations, symbols and nomenclature should be used for labeling.  (Reference ICAO Doc 8400 "*ICAO Abbreviations and Codes, eight edition*" 2010) 

a.
Data fields should include a clear identifier.  Example identifiers include a
descriptive label, dedicated field location, or unit of measurement.
b.
When a label occurs in multiple places, its meaning should be consistent across all occurrences.
c.
Labels should be consistent with related labels located elsewhere in the flight deck.
d.
The spatial relationships between labels and the objects they reference should be clear.
e.
Labels should be oriented to facilitate readability.  For example, the labels can
continuously maintain an upright orientation when associated with a rotated traffic
symbol.

## 2.3.3.4 Symbols

a.
Each CDTI symbol **shall** (3022) be identifiable and distinguishable from other CDTI
symbols.
b. The shape, color, dynamics, and other symbol characteristics should have the same 
meaning within the CDTI. 
c. CDTI symbol modifiers should follow rules that are consistent across the symbol set.  

## 2.3.4 Display Elements

This section describes and includes requirements for the ownship symbol and traffic symbols and their variations, data tags and data blocks.   
Note: Specific symbols, controls, and alerting are expected to be consistent with cockpit design philosophy.   

## 2.3.4.1 Ownship Symbol

a. The Traffic Display **shall** (3023) display a symbol indicating the location of the 
ownship. 
b. If valid ownship position is not available, the CDTI **shall** (3024) display an 
indication of CDTI failure (e.g., CDTI displays an "ownship data quality failure" message).  
Note: Systems integrated with TCAS may revert to a TCAS-only display. 

c. The ownship symbol **shall** (3026) be distinctive from all other symbols on the Traffic 
Display. 
d. The ownship symbol should be unobstructed. 
e. If ownship directionality is valid, the ownship symbol **shall** (3027) be directional 
(e.g., not a circle or square). 
f. The manufacturer must specify (e.g., in the system manual) the ownship horizontal 
position reference point location on the ownship symbol (i.e., the point on the ownship symbol that represents the reported ownship horizontal position).  
1. The location of the ownship with reference to the ownship symbol is expected to 
be consistent with the flight deck philosophy. 
2. The ownship symbol is an abstract representation and does not reflect the 
physical extent of the aircraft.  This is an important consideration when correlating the aircraft symbol with a highly magnified/zoomed-in (small range on a large display) airport surface map.  The length and width codes, if available, can be used to display the physical extent of the aircraft.   
g. The position of the ownship symbol should allow the display of traffic in all 
directions around the ownship.  
h. If ownship directionality (heading or track) is invalid, then: 
- 
In installations supporting the SURF application, if ownship is on the surface 
and the SURF application is ON, then traffic and ownship may be displayed 
relative to the displayed map orientation (i.e., North-up orientation).  In this 
situation, the ownship symbol **shall** (3028) be non-directional, and the 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
ownship horizontal position reference point **shall** (3213) be the center of the symbol.  

Note: This allows continued use of the SURF application at low speeds for 
systems using ownship track information as the source for directionality. The out-the-window view may be used to correlate ownship orientation 
to the map and Traffic Display orientation.  Traffic Display on nontrack-up maps needs to be evaluated. 
•
Otherwise, the CDTI **shall** (3029) display an indication of CDTI failure.
(e.g., CDTI displays an "ownship data quality failure" message.)
Note: Ownship directionality is required for traffic situation awareness. 
TCAS/ASA integrated systems will be unable to correlate ASA system 
and TCAS traffic without ownship directionality. 

## 2.3.4.2 Traffic Information Formats

The primary purpose of the CDTI is to display traffic information.  Traffic information can be displayed in one or more of these formats:  

•
Data tags.
•
Data block.
•
Traffic symbology.
Traffic symbols provide a graphical representation of traffic information.  The position of traffic symbols on the Traffic Display represents horizontal position of traffic relative to ownship.  The traffic symbology may also indicate other traffic information, such as traffic directionality, air/ground status, or vehicle category or type.  Traffic symbology can also be used to indicate status information, such as indicating selected traffic, or indicating traffic designated to a particular application. Additional information about individual traffic may be contained in either data tags or data blocks that are displayed on the same display unit as the traffic symbols.  Data blocks typically reside in a fixed location on the Traffic Display (or other displays), independent of the traffic symbol location.  In contrast, data tags are always located on the Traffic Display near the traffic symbol or somehow linked to the traffic symbol.  

## 2.3.4.2.1 Data Tags

Data tags are implemented with the traffic symbol to provide additional information, such as altitude, vertical direction, and Traffic ID.  Data tags are generally associated with all traffic symbols. 

If data tag information is available, then: 

a.
A data tag **shall** (3030) be provided for all displayed airborne traffic.
b.
A means **shall** (3031) be provided to associate the data tag with the traffic symbol.
Note: For example - association can be achieved by consistently positioning the
data tag in proximity to the traffic symbol. 
c. A data tag for airborne traffic **shall** (3032) include: 
- 
Traffic altitude. 
- 
Traffic vertical direction indicator (an indication of climb or descent) when vertical rate is available and is equal to or more than 500 fpm. 
Note: A smaller vertical rate threshold (e.g., 300 fpm) may be used. 

d. The color of the traffic altitude and traffic vertical direction indicator **shall** (3214) 
match the associated traffic symbol.   
e. Data tag information that is invalid or unavailable should be indicated in the 
respective field of the data tag. 
f. A data tag may optionally include additional elements, for example: 
- 
Traffic ID. 
- 
Traffic Ground Speed. 
- 
Traffic Category. 
- 
Whether tracked by TCAS. 
- 
Air/ground status.  

## 2.3.4.2.2 Data Blocks

A data block is associated with a traffic symbol to provide more detailed information on selected aircraft, such as ground speed, range, category, traffic ID, and differential ground speed.  Data blocks may also be used to persistently display application-specific information.  More than one data block may be displayed.  Data block(s) should be displayed at a fixed location on the Traffic Display or other display unit, and should not move with the traffic symbol.  

a. A means **shall** (3033) be provided to associate the data block with corresponding 
traffic symbol (e.g., association may be achieved by use of the same border, color, or a line). 
b. If traffic selection is implemented, the CDTI **shall** (3034) have the capability to 
display all additional traffic information required by the installed applications.   

## 2.3.4.2.3 Traffic Symbols

a. The Traffic Display **shall** (3035) display one traffic symbol for each traffic report 
received from ASSAP that meets the traffic display criteria subject to the maximum number of traffic elements.   
Note: ASSAP normally provides a single traffic report for each aircraft, based on data from multiple surveillance sources.  If ASSAP is unable to correlate the data from these sources, it will create more than one traffic report.  CDTI assumes these are different traffic elements.   

b. If displayed, ground vehicles **shall** (3215) be distinguishable from aircraft.  (see 
Section §2.3.4.2.3.2.6)  

## 2.3.4.2.3.1 Traffic Symbol Location

a.
The Traffic Display **shall** (3036) position each traffic symbol at a location
representing its relative position with respect to ownship.
b.
The manufacturer must specify (e.g., in the system manual) the traffic horizontal position reference point location on the traffic symbol (i.e., the point on the traffic symbol that represents the reported traffic horizontal position).
c.
The traffic horizontal position reference point, when using non-directional symbols,
should be the center of the symbol.
Note: A traffic symbol is an abstract representation and does not reflect the physical extent of the aircraft.  This is an important consideration when correlating the aircraft symbol with a highly magnified/zoomed-in (small range on a large display) airport surface map.  The length and width codes, if available, can be used to display the physical extent of the aircraft.   

## 2.3.4.2.3.2 Traffic Symbols And Variations

The "basic" traffic symbol is used to depict general airborne traffic, including TCAS Other traffic (i.e., non-alert, non-proximate).  Traffic symbols can be modified from the basic symbols to provide special status information, such as on ground, selected, designated and alerted.   
The notional symbology in the following subparagraphs is intended to limit the symbol variations across aircraft platforms.  It is desirable to limit this variation to foster comprehension of the information conveyed by the symbols to the flight crews. However, manufacturers may propose alternate symbols in order to integrate ADS-B with existing flight deck symbology.  These alternate symbols will need to be justified by human factors analysis as part of the certification process.  Alternate symbol sets are not allowed without additional justification. 

## 2.3.4.2.3.2.1 Basic Directional Traffic

a.
If directionality is valid, the basic directional traffic symbol **shall** (3216) be depicted
with an arrowhead shape oriented by the directionality
b.
The color **shall** (3217) be cyan or white.
c.
The color **shall** (3218) be the same color as the basic non-directional symbol.
d.
The color should not be the same color as the ownship symbol.
e.
For displays that do not integrate the ASA system with TCAS, the symbol may be
filled or unfilled.
f.
For TCAS/ASA integrated systems, the symbol **shall** (3219) be unfilled.
Figure 2-14 provides an example notional depiction.  

## 2.3.4.2.3.2.2 Basic Non-Directional Traffic

a. If directionality is invalid, the basic non-directional traffic symbol **shall** (3220) be 
depicted with a diamond shape.   
Note: Non-directional symbols should not rotate with the display orientation. 
b. The color **shall** (3221) be cyan or white.   
c. The color **shall** (3222) be the same color as the basic directional symbol.   
d. The color should not be the same color as the ownship symbol. e. For displays that do not integrate the ASA system with TCAS, the symbol may be 
filled or unfilled.   
f. For TCAS/ASA integrated systems, the symbol **shall** (3223) be unfilled.   
Figure 2-15 provides an example notional depiction.   

## Figure 2-15  Basic Non-Directional Traffic Symbol (Example) 2.3.4.2.3.2.3 Traffic Directionality

a. If the traffic symbol indicates directionality, the directionality of the traffic symbol 
shall (3039) be displayed relative to the display orientation.  
Note: Non-directional symbols should not rotate with the display orientation.  
b. Traffic directionality **shall** (3224) be displayed with a resolution of 15 degrees or 
better (i.e., maximum of ±7.5º display quantization error).  
Note: The traffic directionality in air is based on traffic ground track angle, and not necessarily traffic heading.  This is important for monitoring traffic such as helicopters that can fly backwards and sidewards to account for winds.   

## 2.3.4.2.3.2.4 Traffic Application Capability

The traffic symbol may provide an indication of traffic application capability.  

## 2.3.4.2.3.2.5 Traffic On-Ground Status

a.
If traffic is on ground, the basic traffic symbol **shall** (3225) be modified by changing
the color.
b.
The color may be brown/tan.
c.
The size of on-ground traffic symbols may be decreased for additional encoding,
and/or to reduce clutter.
d.
The symbol may be filled or unfilled.
Figure 2-16 provides example notional depictions.   
Note: Additionally, altitude information is removed from the data tag.  See §2.3.5.5.f 

## 2.3.4.2.3.2.6 Basic Ground Vehicle

a.
A non-directional ground vehicle symbol **shall** (3226) be depicted as a top-down
wheeled rectangular shape.
b.
If directionality is valid, the directional ground vehicle symbol **shall** (3265) be
depicted with directionality
1. Ground vehicle directionality may be indicated by adding a triangular shape to
one end of the rectangle, and orienting the entire symbol.
2. It is recognized that pilots may mistakenly perceive directionality in the static
symbols where none is intended. However, as soon as directionality is valid, the symbol will change from stationary to directional. This will help mitigate the effects of errors in perceived directionality of stationary symbols.
c.
The color should be the same as that used for the basic Traffic On Ground symbol.
The color may be brown/tan.
d.
The symbol may be filled or unfilled.
                                           

## 2.3.4.2.3.2.7 Alerts

The following requirements apply generally to alerts based on both ASA and TCAS 
systems.  Additional TCAS-specific alert symbol requirements are provided in Section 
§2.3.4.2.3.3.    
Traffic that triggers an alert **shall** (3040) be indicated on the Traffic Display with a symbol variation.  The following requirements only apply to the alerted traffic symbol: 

a. If traffic directionality is valid, directionality information **shall** not (3041) be 
removed during alerts.   
b. The traffic symbol **shall** (3042) change to amber/yellow for caution level alerts. 
c. The traffic symbol **shall** (3043) change to red for warning level alerts. 
d. For traffic without valid directionality: 
- 
If traffic has a caution level alert, the traffic symbol may be modified by changing the shape to a circle.  
- 
If traffic has a warning level alert, the traffic symbol may be modified by changing the shape to a square.  
e. For traffic with valid directionality: 
- 
If traffic has a caution level alert, the traffic symbol may be modified by changing the shape to a circle with a directional inlay. 
- 
If traffic has a warning level alert, the traffic symbol may be modified by changing the shape to a square with a directional inlay.   
Note: Caution and Warning level alerts may use the same traffic symbology as TCAS Traffic Alerts and Resolution Advisories, respectively. (See Sections 
§2.3.4.2.3.3.1 and §2.3.4.2.3.3.2) 

f. Alerting traffic that lies outside the configured traffic display range should be 
positioned at the measured relative bearing, and at the configured display maximum 
range (i.e., edge of display), and with a symbol shape modification that indicates that the traffic is off-scale. 
Note: A half-symbol at the display edge is one acceptable indication method. 

## 2.3.4.2.3.2.8 Proximate And Nearby Airborne Traffic

a.
For TCAS/ASA integrated systems, the traffic symbol **shall** (3227) indicate airborne
TCAS Proximate status.
b.
If TCAS Proximate traffic is displayed, the basic traffic symbol **shall** (3228) be
displayed as filled.  Figure 2-18 provides example notional depictions.
Note:  This requirement is to be consistent with TCAS symbol convention.

c.
For TCAS/ASA integrated systems, and systems with TSAA, Nearby Airborne
Traffic **shall** (3020) be displayed with a filled basic traffic symbol.

## 2.3.4.2.3.2.9 Selected Traffic

Selected Traffic is traffic that is selected by the flight crew.  Traffic selection results in display of additional traffic information beyond what is presented in the minimum data tag, and may enable other functions (e.g., designating traffic).  
Note: See Section §1.7.1.   
If traffic selection is implemented: 

a.
There **shall** (3044) be some means of distinguishing the selected traffic from other
traffic on the Traffic Display.
b.
A border **shall** (3229) not be used to indicate selected traffic.
1.
A border is a discernable line that surrounds an existing symbol.  Border types include fixed-shape or conformal.
2.
Borders are reserved for depicting Designated traffic.
c.
When traffic is selected, additional information on that traffic **shall** (3045) be
displayed in a data block or a data tag.
Note: Generally, selecting traffic will bring up the additional information in a data
block, but a data tag can also be used for this purpose.  
d.
There **shall** (3046) be an indication of off-scale selected traffic.
Note: A Selected half-symbol at the display edge and appropriate bearing is one acceptable method of indication. 

e. The air/ground status of selected traffic **shall** (3177) be discernable.   

## 2.3.4.2.3.2.10 Designated Traffic

Note: See Section §1.7.1.   
If traffic designation is implemented: 

a. There **shall** (3047) be some means of distinguishing the designated traffic from other 
traffic on the Traffic Display. 
b. If traffic is Designated, the basic traffic symbol should be modified by adding a 
shape-conforming border.  Figure 2-19 provides example notional depictions.   

## C. There **Shall** (3048) Be An Indication Of Off-Scale Designated Traffic.

Note: A Designated half-symbol at the display edge and appropriate bearing is one acceptable method of indication.  

d. The loss of "designated" status (e.g., due to signal loss or invalid data) **shall** (3049) 
be indicated with a visual alert to the flight crew.   
1. For the presentation of visual alerts, any color except red or green must be used 
for advisory alert indications based on FAA AC 25.1322-1. 
2. At a minimum, the alert must be advisory level, unless specified differently for a 
given application. 

## 2.3.4.2.3.3 Tcas Alert Symbology For Tcas/Asa Integrated Systems

a. If traffic directionality is valid, directionality information **shall** not (3050) be 
removed during a TCAS Traffic Advisory or Resolution Advisory.   
Note: Directionality information, if available, may assist the flight crew in visual search and identification of the alerted traffic.  

## 2.3.4.2.3.3.1 Traffic Advisories

a. If traffic has a Traffic Advisory (TA), the traffic symbol **shall** (3230) be modified by 
changing the color to amber/yellow, and changing the shape to a circle. 
Note: The requirement applies also for selected or designated traffic.   

b. Traffic with valid directionality **shall** (3231) include a directional inlay.   
c.
The size of TA traffic symbols may be increased to accommodate the shape modification.
d.
Line widths and fill may be changed to improve color interpretation and saliency.
Figure 2-20 provides example notional depictions for TA symbols with directionality.  

## 2.3.4.2.3.3.2 Resolution Advisories

a.
If traffic has a Resolution Advisory (RA), the traffic symbol **shall** (3232) be modified
by changing the color to red, and changing the shape to a square.
Note: The requirement applies also for selected or designated traffic.

b.
Traffic with valid directionality **shall** (3233) include a directional inlay.
c.
The size of RA traffic symbols may be increased to accommodate the shape
modification.
d.
Line widths and fill may be changed to improve color interpretation and saliency.
Figure 2-21 provides example notional depictions for RA symbols with directionality. 

1.
Appendix G describes TCAS/ADS-B symbol integration issues.
2.
TCAS aural alerts and resolution guidance are not affected by these requirements or
recommendations.

## 2.3.4.2.3.4 Other Traffic Symbol Considerations

a.
If circle and square shapes are used to depict alerted traffic, then circle or square shapes should not be used to depict other traffic information.
b.
Additional symbol shapes beyond those included in Section §2.3.4.2.3.2 might
adversely affect display usability.  Data tags (vs. symbols) might be an acceptable
means of indicating traffic information (for example, when that information is not needed at a quick glance).

## 2.3.4.3 Number Of Traffic Elements

A traffic element is an aircraft or vehicle.   

a. When SURF is not active, the Traffic Display **shall** (3038) be capable of displaying 
at least the highest priority (as defined in Section §2.2.2.1.5.1.2) 8 traffic elements. 
b. When SURF is active, the Traffic Display **shall** (3051) be capable of displaying at 
least the highest priority (as defined in Section §2.2.2.1.5.1.2) 8 surface and 8 
airborne traffic elements. 
Note: This requirement is based on providing a minimum capability to display 8 
airborne and 8 ground traffic elements concurrently. 

c. The Traffic Display should provide an indication when the number of traffic 
elements meeting the Traffic Display criteria exceeds the maximum number of traffic elements that can be displayed.   
Note: Traffic will be displayed based on the Traffic Display Criteria (see Section 
§2.3.1.1).  Traffic of interest to the flight crew may not be included within the first 16 traffic in this list.  For example, an aircraft at the other end of the runway may be of interest while 16 aircraft are closer to ownship.  A higher limit of traffic elements may be appropriate.   

## 2.3.5 Information Elements

The following describe requirements associated with the display of information in either data tags, data blocks, or traffic symbols.    

## 2.3.5.1 Traffic Monitored By Tcas

In TCAS/ASA integrated systems, the flight crew may be interested to know if collision avoidance protection is being provided by TCAS against a particular traffic element.  A means may be provided for the flight crew to determine if traffic of interest is monitored by TCAS (i.e., is either a TCAS-only or a TCAS correlated traffic element).  This information may be conveyed as part of the symbol, or in a data tag or data block or by other means, and does not have to be continuously displayed. 

## 2.3.5.2 Traffic Application Capability

Each application specifies minimum requirements for the traffic element to support the application.  The Traffic Application Capability generally has the states: "valid for use by the application," and "invalid for use by the application."   
CDTI provides general traffic situation awareness within the surveillance range.  EVAcq or AIRB are the required minimum application, providing traffic situation awareness. Traffic not meeting the EVAcq or AIRB data quality thresholds is not forwarded to CDTI from ASSAP and therefore is not displayed.   
Note: For systems integrated with TCAS, TCAS traffic is forwarded to the CDTI 
regardless of the Traffic Application Capability. 

Additional applications are optional, and may have different (more strict) data quality thresholds.  If any additional applications are installed (beyond EVAcq or AIRB), there shall (3052) be a means to determine the traffic's application capability with respect to each installed application.  This can be accomplished graphically, by simple crew action for selecting an application, or by other means. Example 1:  An ASA system supports only AIRB application.  As noted above, only traffic that meets the AIRB traffic requirements are sent to the CDTI for display.  No additional means of determining traffic application capability is necessary for this minimum configuration. Example 2:  An ASA system supports the AIRB and VSA applications.  The VSA 
application has stricter data quality thresholds than AIRB.  The CDTI will display all of the traffic (subject to display and system limits), as it is useful for providing enhanced situation awareness at all times.  However, some of the traffic may not support the stricter data quality standards of the VSA application, hence VSA cannot be performed with that traffic.    

## 2.3.5.3 Traffic Air/Ground Status

The Traffic Display **shall** (3053) continuously indicate the air/ground status of all displayed aircraft.  This information may be conveyed as part of the symbol or in a data tag.   

## 2.3.5.4 Differential Ground Speed (Dgs)

Differential ground speed information may be conveyed in a data block or by other means. If Differential Ground Speed is implemented, the following requirements apply:  

a.
A positive differential ground speed (i.e., ownship is faster) **shall** (3054) be
distinguishable from a negative differential ground speed (i.e., traffic is faster).
b.
Differential ground speed information **shall** (3055) be distinguishable from other
information.
c.
The CDTI **shall** (3056) be capable of displaying a differential ground speed value
with a minimum resolution of 1 knot or equivalent.
d.
The CDTI **shall** (3057) be capable of displaying differential ground speeds of at least
±199 knots.
e.
An indication should be displayed when the maximum differential ground speed
display capability of the CDTI is exceeded.
Note: Differential ground speed and relative altitude both have positive and negative 
values, and could be confused with each other if provisions are not made to distinguish between them.  A human factors evaluation should be conducted to ensure that flight crew comprehension is addressed.  Graphical indications of the sign are recommended to be used as a means to convey the meaning more effectively.  Clear labeling of the sense of the value may also be acceptable. 

## 2.3.5.5 Traffic Altitude

Traffic Altitude includes four types of altitudes; Traffic Relative Altitude (see §2.3.5.5.1), Traffic Actual Altitude (see §2.3.5.5.2), Traffic Geometric Altitude (see §2.3.5.5.3) or Traffic Pressure Altitude (see §2.3.5.5.4).  Traffic Altitude must be continuously displayed in the data tag.   

a. The data tag on the Traffic Display **shall** (3058) display Traffic Relative Altitude as 
the nominal case.   
b. Alternately, Traffic Altitude may be displayed on the data tag of the Traffic Display 
as Traffic Actual Altitude or Traffic Pressure Altitude.   
c. Data blocks, or locations other than the Traffic Display, may display Traffic Relative 
Altitude, Traffic Actual Altitude, Traffic Geometric Altitude or Traffic Pressure Altitude.   
d. If the capability exists to display an altitude type other than Traffic Relative Altitude, 
each CDTI display **shall** (3060) indicate which altitude type is displayed.   
e. Traffic Altitude **shall** (3061) not be displayed if Traffic Altitude is unavailable.   
f. Traffic Altitude information shall not (3062) be displayed for on-ground traffic.   
Note: Air/ground status is provided by ASSAP. 

g. Traffic Altitude **shall** (3064) be displayed with a resolution of 100 feet or less.   

## 2.3.5.5.1 Traffic Relative Altitude

Traffic Relative Altitude is the difference between ownship and traffic altitude.  Traffic Relative Altitude is calculated by either (1) using the pressure altitude of both aircraft or 
(2) if valid traffic pressure altitude is unavailable, by using the Geometric Altitude of both aircraft.  The relative altitude shown for traffic is positive when the traffic is higher than ownship and negative when traffic is lower than ownship.  

a. Traffic Relative Altitude **shall** (3234) be calculated using Traffic Pressure Altitude 
and ownship pressure altitude when available. 
b. If Traffic Pressure Altitude is not available, then Traffic Geometric Altitude may be 
utilized to calculate Traffic Relative Altitude, when the geometric altitude accuracy meets the application requirements. 
Note:  No indication needs to be made to the pilot when Traffic Geometric Altitude is used.  However, some applications (such as ITP) require the use of Traffic Pressure Altitude. 

c. For traffic above ownship, the Traffic Relative Altitude value in the data tag **shall** 
(3065) be preceded by a "+" sign and be placed above the traffic symbol. 
d. For traffic below ownship, the Traffic Relative Altitude value in the data tag **shall** 
(3066) be preceded by a "-" sign and be placed below the traffic symbol. 
Note: The "+" or "-" character may be emphasized (e.g., by using a slightly larger character set than that used for digits).  

e.
The Traffic Relative Altitude **shall** (3067) consist of at least two digits indicating the
altitude difference in hundreds of feet.  For example, "+70" would represent 7,000 ft
above ownship and "-01" would represent 100 feet below ownship.
f.
The data tag for co-altitude traffic (traffic at the same altitude as the ownship) shall
(3068) be displayed as the digits "00".
Note: The "+" or "-" tag may be retained with the "00" indication to denote that the system is in the relative altitude mode.  

g.
The "00" characters should be placed above the traffic symbol if the traffic
descended from above; below the symbol if the traffic climbed from below to the ownship altitude.
h.
If ownship climbed to the traffic altitude, the "00" characters should be placed above the traffic symbol, if the ownship descended to the traffic altitude, the "00" characters
should be placed below the traffic symbol.
i.
If traffic is at co-altitude with ownship when initially displayed, the "00" characters should be placed below the traffic symbol.

## 2.3.5.5.2 Traffic Actual Altitude

Traffic Actual Altitude is the altitude reported by the traffic adjusted for local barometric pressure, using the same correction used by ownship.  The following requirements apply if the Traffic Actual Altitude feature is implemented. 

Traffic Actual Altitude tags **shall** (3070) be positioned above or below the traffic symbol in a manner consistent with relative altitude data tags.   
Traffic Actual Altitude **shall** (3071) be displayed as a 3-digit number representing hundreds of feet above MSL (e.g., "007" represents 700 feet MSL and "250" represents 25,000 feet MSL.) 
The display of Traffic Actual Altitude **shall** (3072) be corrected for the local barometric pressure using the same correction used by ownship. 

Traffic Actual Altitude **shall** (3236) be determined in one of the following ways: 

•
Adjusting the Traffic Pressure Altitude from the target aircraft by using the ownship's current barometric pressure setting.
•
Adding the Traffic Relative Altitude to Ownship's barometric corrected altitude.
1.
If the second option is chosen, the relative altitude to the target used in this calculation may be derived from either Traffic Pressure Altitude or Traffic Geometric Altitude.  However, in either case the ownship barometric corrected altitude value must be used.
2.
The calculation of Traffic Actual Altitude does not use the pressure correction above the transition altitude.

## 2.3.5.5.3 Traffic Geometric Altitude

Traffic Geometric Altitude is defined in this document as the height above the WGS 84 
ellipsoid as measured by a GNSS system.  
When used (optional), Traffic Geometric Altitude **shall** (3237) only be displayed in a data block or locations other than the Traffic Display. 

When used (optional), Traffic Geometric Altitude **shall** (3238) be labeled to indicate that it is geometric altitude.  An example of such labeling is "HAE" (3241 ft HAE).    

## 2.3.5.5.4 Traffic Pressure Altitude

Pressure altitude is the (uncorrected) altitude relative to the standard pressure reference (29.92 inHg / 1013.25 hPa).  Traffic Pressure Altitude is the pressure altitude transmitted by a target. Below the transition altitude, Traffic Pressure Altitude may be displayed in a data tag for 
30 seconds or less.  Traffic Pressure Altitude **shall** (3239) only be displayed for greater than 30 seconds in a data tag when above the transition altitude.  Traffic Pressure Altitude may be displayed indefinitely in the data block or locations other than the Traffic Display.   
The display of Traffic Pressure Altitude **shall** (3240) carry a clear altitude reference label to indicate that no correction is being made to this altitude.  Examples of such labeling are "FL" (where FL 007 represents 700 feet pressure altitude) or "Press Alt" (Press Alt: 
200 m).   

## 2.3.5.6 Traffic Vertical Direction

The traffic vertical direction indicator shows that the traffic is climbing or descending at a rate faster than a specified threshold.  This information must be included in the data tag. 

a. Traffic with a climb or descent rate greater than or equal to 500 fpm **shall** (3075) 
include a traffic vertical direction indicator (e.g., indicated using an up or down arrow, as appropriate).  (See Data Tag requirement Section §2.3.4.2.1.c) 
1. A smaller vertical rate threshold (e.g., 300 fpm) may be used. 2. Traffic Vertical Direction is not applicable for on-ground traffic.  
b. The traffic vertical direction indicator **shall** (3264) be a vertical arrow placed to the 
immediate right of the traffic symbol. 

## 2.3.5.7 Traffic Identification

Traffic identification may also be referred to as flight identification or flight ID (e.g., the aircraft flight number or the tail number).  This information may be conveyed in a data tag or data block or by other means, and does not have to be continuously displayed.  The following requirements apply for traffic identification: 

1.
Traffic identification may not be available for all traffic.
2.
ICAO terminology for Traffic Identification is Aircraft Identification.
a.
The traffic identification field **shall** (3076) be capable of displaying eight
alphanumeric characters.
Note: The ICAO standard for aircraft identification is a maximum of eight
alphanumeric characters.  
b.

a.
The CDTI **shall** (3079) be capable of displaying the traffic category.
b.
The traffic category (emitter category), when displayed, should be displayed with sufficient descriptive quality (e.g., "LIGHT", "HEAVY", "ROTOR_CFT", "SPACE_VEH", "EMERG_VEH") for the flight crew to understand without additional cross references.

## 2.3.5.10 Traffic Emergency Priority Status

The CDTI may display the emergency status information on traffic.  The emergency status may be displayed as part of a traffic symbol variation (i.e., some characteristic of the symbol, such as shape, changes), and/or as part of a data tag or data block. 

## 2.3.5.11 Traffic Horizontal Velocity Vector

Horizontal velocity vector is the instantaneous magnitude and direction of the horizontal velocity (see Appendix A).  If traffic horizontal velocity vectors are implemented, the following requirements apply: 

a.
Traffic horizontal velocity vector information should be depicted graphically.
b.
The same scale (e.g., 60 seconds) **shall** (3080) be used for all displayed horizontal
velocity vectors.
c. If the length of the horizontal velocity vector represents a set prediction time (e.g., 60 
seconds), the velocity vector's size **shall** (3081) scale according to a fixed time when 
the display's range is changed. 
d. If the flight crew has the capability to change the scale of the velocity vector, the 
scaling value **shall** (3082) be accessible for display.

## 2.3.5.13 Display Orientation

a. The Traffic Display **shall** (3087) provide the capability for Track-up or Heading-up 
orientation mode. 
Note: Track-up vs. heading-up orientation mode affects the orientation of the earth 
reference (e.g., compass rose) and the bearing of traffic relative to the ownship symbol.  True vs. Magnetic mode affects only the zero point on the compass rose but does not affect where the traffic are displayed (i.e., no 
effect on relative bearing). 
b. If multiple orientations modes are implemented, the Traffic Display **shall** (3088) 
display the current ownship orientation (e.g., heading-up, track-up, north-up). 
c. The Traffic Display **shall** (3089) display all traffic with respect to the display 
orientation.   

## 2.3.5.14 Traffic Coasting Indicator

The coasting indicator is used to show that traffic position data age is sufficient for display but is approaching the maximum data age that would require dropping the target from the display. When implemented, "CST" should be displayed in the data tag when the coasting flag is set.   

## 2.3.5.15 Traffic Range

Traffic Range, the horizontal range between ownship and individual traffic, may be conveyed in a data tag or data block or by other means. When implemented, the following requirements apply for Traffic Range:

for values less than 10 NM and with a resolution of 1 NM or less for values greater than or equal to 10 NM.
b.
An indication should be displayed if traffic range exceeds the indicator limit.

## 2.3.6 Display Design - Other 2.3.6.1 Traffic Display Symbol Prioritization For Overlay

To ensure visibility of the most important symbols and their associated proximate data (i.e., data tags), the following prioritization should be followed for information overlay, from highest to lowest priority:  

1.
Ownship.
2.
Traffic prioritized according to Section §2.2.2.1.5.1.2
3.
Other CDTI features.
Note: Altitude, range, and other information may be used for further prioritization and tie breaking, as appropriate for the application. 

## 2.3.6.2 Decluttering

a.
The capability should be provided for removing all optional Traffic Display information (e.g., traffic identification and horizontal velocity vector) from the
Traffic Display and returning to the basic Traffic Display features.  Intermediate levels of decluttering may remove a subset of the optional CDTI information.
b.
The following basic Traffic Display features **shall** (3091) not be removed by
decluttering:
•
Ownship symbol.
•
Traffic symbols, including symbol variations (e.g., alerted, designated,
selected, air/ground status).

during a traffic alert. 

## 2.3.6.3 Cdti Monitoring Function

The CDTI **shall** (3093) be capable of displaying the health of the ASA system to the flight crew. 

## 2.3.6.4 Display Of Status Indication

Status Indication which the CDTI displays can come from several sources such as ASSAP function, ASSAP Application(s), the CDTI function, or the system self-test and monitoring functions.  Status Indication may be displayed on the same display device showing traffic information, or on a fault page accessible to the user. 

## 2.3.6.4.1 System Status

a. The CDTI **shall** (3094) indicate the absence of power (e.g., blank display).  
b. The CDTI **shall** (3095) indicate any non-normal status from the ASSAP and CDTI 
self-test.  
c. The CDTI **shall** (3096) provide an indication of any non-normal ASSAP status from 
the continuous monitoring function.  
d. The CDTI **shall** (3097) provide an indication of any non-normal CDTI status from 
the continuous monitoring function.  
e. The CDTI **shall** (3098) remove traffic from the display if the following occurs:  
- 
The CDTI monitor (Section §2.3.6.3) indicates CDTI failure.  
- 
The ASSAP monitor (Section §2.2.5) indicates ASSAP failure.  
f. ASSAP will also provide status of its inputs such as ADS-B and TCAS.  The CDTI 
shall (3099) display an appropriate input failure message when ASSAP has indicated 
its input has failed (e.g., ADS-B fail/TCAS input fail).  
Note: System integrators may provide a method and appropriate controls to use the 
same display as a TCAS-only display (without ASSAP/CDTI).  This is outside the 
scope of the MOPS.  See Appendix B.  

## 2.3.6.4.2 Asa Application Status

ASSAP provides application status to the CDTI.  See Section §2.2.2.1.5.3.1 for description of application status.   

a. The equipment **shall** (3100) be capable of indicating any applications that are: 
- 
On. 
- 
Available to run. 
- 
Unavailable to run. 
- 
Unavailable - Fault. 
b.
A CDTI **shall** (3178) continuously display which applications are on.
Note:  The flight crew must be able to easily determine the active applications by
looking at the CDTI.  This does not preclude the flight crew from switching 
away from the CDTI. 
c.
The equipment **shall** (3101) indicate any application that was on, but becomes:
•
Unavailable to run.
•
Unavailable - Fault.
d.

## 2.3.6.4.3 Tis-B/Ads-R Service Status

a.
For systems that are not integrated with TCAS, the CDTI **shall** (3242) display TIS-
B/ADS-R Service Status received from ASSAP.
b.
TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status should be displayed in a manner consistent with the
overall flight deck design philosophy.  An example is included in Appendix H.

## 2.3.6.5 Alerting - General

This subsection provides requirements and guidance that apply if alerting is implemented.  
Note: The requirements in this subsection apply only if the CDTI presents alerts.  
Alerts should be consistent with the flight deck alerting system and philosophy, and should not interfere with higher priority alerts.   
Note: Sections §2.3.4.2.3.2.6, §2.3.4.2.3.3 and §2.3.11 address the use of color for alerts. 

a.
If alerts are disabled by the pilot, the system alert status **shall** (3102) indicate that
alerts are disabled.
b.
Alerts should be consistent with, and capable of being integrated into the flight deck alerting system, giving proper priority to alerts with regard to safety of flight.
c.
A means **shall** (3172) be provided for the flight crew to verify the operation of the
aural alerting path from ASSAP to the flight crew.
Note:  Examples of how this might be accomplished are through a self-test function that outputs to the audio device (i.e., speaker or headphones) a "System OK" or "System Fail" aural, or through a start-up aural that says "System On". 

## 2.3.7 Inputs And Controls - General

This section provides requirements and guidance on the operation and function of flight crew inputs and controls to the ASA system.   

## 2.3.7.1 Display Range

## 2.3.7.2 Altitude Band

A control **shall** (3105) be provided to adjust the altitude band between the minimum and maximum values.  It should be possible to independently control the altitude band above and below the ownship.   

## 2.3.7.3 Traffic Altitude Selection

If the capability to display Traffic Actual Altitude or Traffic Pressure Altitude in the data tag on the Traffic Display is implemented, a control **shall** (3106) be provided to select the altitude type displayed.   

## 2.3.7.4 Traffic Selection

If traffic selection is implemented, a means **shall** (3107) be provided for the flight crew to select at least one traffic element. 

## 2.3.7.5 Traffic Display Criteria Selection

If alternate display criteria (see Section §2.3.1.1.2) are implemented, appropriate control(s) **shall** (3108) be provided.   

## 2.3.7.6 Decluttering

A declutter function is used to remove optional traffic information when display of the information is not desired.  This section identifies input and control requirements necessary to accomplish traffic declutter function.   
If decluttering is implemented: 

a. A means **shall** (3109) be provided for the flight crew to control the decluttering. 
b. The flight crew **shall** (3110) be able to perform the declutter operation by a Simple 
Action. 
c. The flight crew should be able to return to the previous state by a Simple Action. 
If automatic decluttering is implemented, a means **shall** (3111) be provided for the flight crew to control the automated decluttering function.   

Note:   Control of automated decluttering could, for example, be provided through the 
ability turn the automated deculttering on and off.  Automated decluttering, 
without pilot control, may be provided during TCAS and application alerts. When the alerts are cleared, the display reverts to the pre-alert (not 
automatically decluttered) display settings.   

## 2.3.7.7 Application And Designate Traffic Control

This section provides requirements for controlling applications.  This includes enabling and disabling applications, setting application parameters, and designating traffic.  Also see Section §2.3.9 for more description of Application Specific Requirements.  

a.
For installations that support more than the EVAcq, AIRB, SURF and TSAA
applications, a means **shall** (3114) be provided for the flight crew to manually enable
and disable the additional applications.  In addition, automatic enabling/disabling may be provided.
b.
For applications with Designated Traffic, a means **shall** (3115) be provided for the
flight crew to manually designate and undesignate specific traffic elements.
Note: Manually designating/undesignating traffic is one way to manually enable/disable applications that operate on designated traffic. 

c.
Valid traffic application capability is required to designate traffic to the application.
Traffic that is invalid for an application **shall** (3243) not be designated to that
application.
d.
Traffic that becomes invalid while designated to an application **shall** (3244) be
undesignated from the application (see Section §2.3.4.2.3.2.10).
Note: Traffic designated specifically for ACAS may remain designated for some time, to 
be determined by ACAS, after becoming invalid or the track drops.  This allows an acceptable coasting period before ACAS undesignates the traffic for ACAS alternative logic. 

## 2.3.7.8 Brightness Control

A means **shall** (3116) be provided to adjust the brightness of the display.  

## 2.3.8 Flight Deck Integration

The CDTI system should be consistent with the rest of the flight deck in terms of color, standardization, automation, symbology, interaction techniques and operating philosophy. Reference AC 25-11A, AC 23.131L1B, AC 25.1322-1 and AC 20-175.  

## 2.3.8.1 Multi-Function Display

A multi-function display is one in which multiple functions such as traffic, weather and terrain share the same display hardware.  If CDTI is implemented as part of a multifunction display the requirements in this section apply.   

1.
For aircraft displaying an ownship trend vector:  An ownship horizontal velocity vector may not be as useful as the prediction provided by the trend vector, so it is advisable not to display a horizontal velocity vector for ownship while displaying a trend vector.
2.
Airport surface map features and their requirements are described in DO-272C /
ED-99C and are not part of this document.  Any such airport surface map features
will be considered as underlays to depicted traffic (i.e., traffic will always be above the surface map features unless specifically stated in DO-272C / ED-99C).
Appropriate multifunction display requirements are also applicable while surface
map features are depicted along with traffic.
a. If non-traffic information is integrated with the traffic information on the display, the 
directional orientation, range, and ownship position **shall** (3117) be consistent among 
the different information sets. 
Note: For example, heading-up oriented data should not be displayed simultaneously with track-up oriented data.  If an MFD is displaying traffic and weather radar information, the design should not allow the range-scale of the displayed weather data to be different from the range-scale of the traffic data that is simultaneously displayed. 

b. Symbols, colors, and other encoded information that have a certain meaning in the 
traffic display function should not have a different meaning in another MFD function.  
c. The MFD system should provide the capability to enable and disable display of 
traffic information (i.e., to overlay traffic or turn traffic information off). 
d. A means should be provided to select the display of traffic information by Simple 
Action(s) by the pilot.  
e. An indication that the CDTI function is active and included as part of the MFD, other 
than the display of traffic itself, **shall** (3118) be present during normal operation 
(when displaying of traffic is enabled) so that if display of traffic is disabled, it is obvious to the pilot. 
f. CDTI cautions and warnings **shall** (3119) be displayed regardless of the active MFD 
function.  
Note: If TSAA is utilizing a part time Traffic Display for the visual component of TSAA Traffic Caution Alerts, upon identification of a traffic alert, the CDTI 
function may either activate (pop-up) the display mode containing the appropriate traffic symbology or display written text that indicates the TSAA Traffic Caution Alert and make provisions that allow the flight crew to select the display mode containing the appropriate traffic symbology.  Typical implementations involve only a single button press to activate the Traffic Display. 

g. A mechanism may be provided to select the CDTI-only mode of operation. 
h. Traffic and other CDTI information should be easily discernible across all MFD 
functions.  

## 2.3.9 Application-Specific Requirements

At a minimum, the ASA system will support the EVAcq or AIRB application.  
Installations may optionally support the other initial applications as defined in Section §1.3.1.  Additional applications are expected to be developed, and may also have additional display and control requirements.  Application-specific control and display requirements are included in this section. There are no application-specific requirements for EVAcq. 

## 2.3.9.1 Airb

traffic data block.

## 2.3.9.2 Surf

For installations that support the SURF application: 

a.
Traffic directionality **shall** (3246) be displayed with a resolution of 12 degrees or
better (i.e., maximum of ±6º display quantization error).
b.
The Traffic Display **shall** (3247) have the capability for the flight crew to select the
display of additional traffic information.  The selected traffic information includes: 1.
Traffic ID
2.
Traffic Ground Speed
3.
Traffic Category
Note:  The additional information may be provided for all traffic, or in a data tag or 
data block for a specifically selected traffic.   
c.
Ownship and traffic position symbology **shall** (3136) correspond to the same
reference system as the underlying airport map, when displayed.  Ownship and traffic
positions **shall** (3137) not be adjusted to snap to runways or taxiways. (i.e., they
should reflect the received position).
d.
The Traffic Display **shall** (3138) be adjustable to a range of 1.0 NM or less in the
direction of ownship travel as measured from the ownship position to the edge of the
viewable screen (format window).
e.
When the Traffic Display display range is adjusted to 1.0 NM or less, the resolution
of the display should be 3 m/pixel (or equivalent) or better (finer).
f.
When the SURF application is active, a graphical depiction of the airport map shall
(3139) be present as an underlay on the Traffic Display.
Note: If the SURF application is implemented, a graphical depiction of the airport map is expected to be present.  ASSAP will flag the application as unavailable if the map is not available.   

g. The underlying airport map **shall** (3112) include airport identification, all runways, 
and runway identifiers in the database 
h. When implementing SURF with taxiways, the underlying airport map **shall** (3113) 
include all taxiways and taxiway identifiers in the database.  
i. 
The underlying airport map should include helipads and runway holding positions.  
1.  "Runway Holding Position" is a designated position intended to protect a 
runway, an obstacle limitation surface, or an ILS/MLS critical/sensitive area at 
which taxiing aircraft and vehicles are required to stop and hold, unless otherwise authorized by the airport control tower.  It includes hold lines on taxiways as well as Land and Hold Short Operation (LAHSO) lines on intersecting runways.  It does not include hold lines on surface such as Aprons and Taxiways that are non-adjacent to the runway or not associated with runway operations. 
2. In addition, movement areas other than maneuvering area runways and 
taxiways, may be displayed, including those portions of an airport intended to accommodate aircraft purposed for loading or unloading passengers, mail or cargo, fuelling, parking or maintenance.  Also, parking stands, de-icing areas, 
structures, buildings, obstacles, and service roads may be displayed. 
j. 
When implementing the SURF application, CDTI or ASSAP **shall** (3249) determine 
the most relevant airport from an airport database.  This may be the closest airport but might not be if overflying an airport on approach to another nearby airport.   

## 2.3.9.3 Vsa For Installations That Support The Vsa Application:

a. The Traffic Display **shall** (3250)  have the capability for the flight crew to select the 
display of the following additional traffic information for traffic valid for VSA: 
1. Traffic ID  
2. Traffic Ground Speed or Differential Ground Speed 
3. Traffic Range  
Note:  The additional information may be provided for all traffic, or in a data block for a specifically selected traffic.    

b. The Traffic Display should provide this additional information: 
1. Traffic horizontal velocity vector or traffic directionality. 
2. Traffic Category 

## 2.3.9.4 In Trail Procedure (Itp)

For installations supporting the ITP application, the CDTI **shall** (3252) have the capability to display to the flight crew the following additional information: 

a.
Traffic Identification
b.
ITP Distance
c.
Ahead or Behind Status
d.
ITP Geometric Status
1.
The additional information may be provided for all traffic, or in a data block for a specifically selected traffic.
2.
Flight crews may have an operational use for additional information on certain traffic.  For example, flight crews have indicated a desire to be able to view the Rate of Change of ITP Distance on certain targets and/or if aircraft are getting closer to
or pulling away from each other.
The CDTI should display the reason traffic does not meet the ITP quality or geometric criteria.  For example, that the traffic ground speed differential is too great. 

## 2.3.9.4.1 Itp Distance

ITP Distance **shall** (3253) be displayed either graphically or alphanumerically.  ITP 
Distance is the absolute value of the distance between ownship and ITP Traffic as calculated from a common point (Section §2.2.4.5.3.1).  This information may be conveyed in a data tag, data block or by other means. The following requirements apply when displaying ITP Distance:  

a.
The CDTI **shall** (3254) be capable of displaying ITP Distance with a minimum
resolution of 1 NM or equivalent.
b.
The CDTI **shall** (3255) truncate the ITP Distance such that the displayed value does
not contradict the indication of the ITP Geometric Status.  For example, a calculated ITP distance of 14.96 NM should be truncated to 14 NM.

## 2.3.9.4.2 Ahead Or Behind Status

Ahead or Behind Status **shall** (3256) be displayed either graphically or alphanumerically. 

Ahead Status means ownship is ahead of the ITP traffic.  This information may be conveyed in a data tag, data block or by other means. 

Ahead Status **shall** (3257) be distinguishable from Behind Status. 

## 2.3.9.4.3 Itp Geometric Status

ITP Geometric Status **shall** (3258) be displayed either graphically or alphanumerically. 

This information may be conveyed in a data tag, data block or by other means. 

Valid ITP Geometric Status **shall** (3259) be distinguishable from Invalid ITP Geometric Status.   

## 2.3.9.4.4 Rate Of Change Of Itp Distance (Optional)

Rate of Change of ITP Distance may be displayed either graphically or alphanumerically.  
Rate of Change of ITP Distance is defined as the difference between the horizontal velocity of the aircraft that is Behind and the horizontal velocity of the aircraft that is Ahead (Section §2.2.4.4.3.4).  This information may be conveyed in a data tag, data block or by other means. If Rate of Change of ITP Distance is displayed, then the following requirements must be applied:   

a. A positive Rate of Change of ITP Distance (i.e., ITP Distance is decreasing) **shall** 
(3260) be distinguishable from a negative Rate of Change of ITP Distance (i.e., ITP Distance is increasing).  
Note: It is recommended that the sign of the Rate of Change of ITP distance be indicated by a symbol, rather than plus '+' or minus '-' signs.   

b. Rate of Change of ITP Distance **shall** (3261) be distinguishable from other 
information. 
Note: Rate of Change of ITP Distance, Differential Ground Speed and Relative Altitude have positive and negative values, and could be confused with each other if provisions are not made to distinguish between them. 

c. The CDTI **shall** (3262) be capable of displaying Rate of Change of ITP Distance 
with a minimum resolution of 1 knot or equivalent. 
d. The absolute value of the Rate of Change of ITP Distance **shall** (3263) be rounded up 
to the nearest 1 knot such that the displayed value does not contradict the indication 
of the ITP Geometric Status.  For example, a calculated Rate of Change of ITP distance of 20.11 knots should be rounded up to 21 knots. 

## 2.3.9.5 Traffic Situation Awareness With Alerts (Tsaa)

TSAA may be implemented with or without a Traffic Display.  Requirements for TSAA without a Traffic Display are described in Section §2.4.1.   
For TSAA installations with a Traffic Display, the CDTI **shall** (3120) have the capability to display the TSAA Traffic Caution Alert.   

1. See the alert requirements in Section §2.3.4.2.3.2.7.   
2. The traffic alert information includes TSAA Traffic Caution Alerts and updates to 
those alerts that are generated both automatically and by a pilot initiated request.   

## 2.3.9.5.1 Tsaa Alert Control

For TSAA aural annunciations containing relative traffic position, the CDTI **shall** (3121) 
provide a means for the pilot to acknowledge a TSAA alert in progress. 

For TSAA with a Traffic Display, the CDTI may provide a means for the pilot to request a TSAA aural alert update. 

## 2.3.9.5.2 Tsaa Aural Alerts

The Audio System (e.g., speaker or headphones) provides the traffic alert from the ASSAP to the pilot. It may be integrated with the CDTI. Section §2.2.2.1.6 describes the Aural Requirements. 

Note: If the CDTI Traffic Display fails, the TSAA application may continue to operate 
as an audio only system so long as the needed controls comply with the alert requirements.  

## 2.3.9.6 Cavs

For installations that support the CAVS application: 

a.
The CDTI **shall** (3125) have the capability for the flight crew to designate a traffic
and display the following additional traffic information for traffic valid for CAVS: 1.
Traffic Identification
Note:  Traffic Identification is defined in Section 2.3.5.7.  The equipment does not 
require Traffic Identification for traffic to be valid for CAVS but must be capable of displaying Traffic Identification if available.  The requirement for Traffic Identification will be handled as part of the CAVS operational procedures. 
2.
Differential Ground Speed when the aircraft are in-trail of each other, defined
when the relative track angle between ownship and the designated traffic is less
than 20 degrees.
Note:  Differential Ground Speed is defined in Section 2.3.5.4.  Differential Ground 
Speed may be displayed all the times because it may provide an indication of what the over-take will be once the aircraft are in-trail of each other.  
3.
Ownship Ground Speed and Traffic Ground Speed
4.
Traffic Range (see Section §2.3.5.15)
Note:  Differential Ground Speed and Traffic Range must be displayed in the 
primary field of view (see FAA AC 25-11A) to facilitate pilot monitoring. 
b.
If the CAVS Designated Traffic is on the ground, then the CDTI **shall** (3171) remove
Differential Ground Speed from the display.
c.
If the Caution "CAVS Minimum Range" Alert status is active from ASSAP, then the
CDTI **shall** (3133) display a visual alert (caution level).
1.
For the presentation of visual alerts, amber or yellow must be used for caution alert indications based on FAA AC 25.1322-1.
2.
The CDTI will also provide a visual alert (advisory level) if the traffic drops or is
no longer valid for CAVS as required for a loss of "designated" status in Section §2.3.4.2.3.2.10 Designated Traffic.
3.
ASSAP will set the Caution "CAVS Minimum Range" Alert Status to inactive
when the CAVS Designated Traffic is on the ground.
An Advisory "Range Indication" Alert that is modifiable by the flight crew is defined in the following requirements:   

d. The CDTI **shall** (3150) display an Advisory "Range Indication" Alert threshold value 
with a resolution of 0.1 NM (for threshold values up to 10 NM). 
Note:  For implementations that support threshold values above 10 NM, a resolution such as 1 NM is acceptable. 

e. The CDTI **shall** (3151) provide a control to adjust the Advisory "Range Indication" 
Alert threshold value. 
Note:  The controls must be readily accessible to the flight crew from their normally seated positions. 

f. The CDTI **shall** (3152) be capable of displaying Advisory "Range Indication" Alert 
threshold values up to at least 10 NM. 
g. If the horizontal distance to the designated traffic is less than the CAVS Range 
Advisory Alert threshold value, then the CDTI **shall** (3153) display a visual alert 
(advisory level). 
1. For the presentation of visual alerts, any color except red or green must be used 
for advisory alert indications based on FAA AC 25.1322-1. 
2. It is acceptable for ASSAP (instead of the CDTI) to determine when the 
horizontal distance to the designated traffic is less than the threshold value and 
provide the status to the CDTI. 
h. If the CAVS designated traffic is on the ground, the CDTI **shall** (3180) inhibit the 
Advisory "Range Indication" Alert. 

## 2.3.10 Accessibility Of Controls

a. The equipment **shall** (3142) be designed so that controls intended for use during 
ground or flight operations cannot be operated in any position, combination or sequence that would result in a condition detrimental to the operation of the aircraft or the reliability of the equipment. 
b. Controls that are normally operated by the flight crew **shall** (3143) be readily 
accessible. 
c. Controls **shall** (3144) provide feedback (e.g., tactile, visual) when operated. 
d. Controls **shall** (3145) be resistant to inadvertent activation. 
Note: Common and acceptable means of reducing the likelihood of inadvertent operation include the following: 

- 
Physical protections such as guards and flip-locks. 
- 
Slippage resistance. 
- 
Hand and finger stabilization. 
- 
Logical protection with software-related controls. 
•
Appropriate sensory feedback or explicit confirmation of activation.
e.
Controls used in ground and flight operations **shall** (3146) be operable with one
hand.
f.
The function for each control **shall** (3147) be indicated.
g.
If a control can be used for multiple functions, the current and inactive functions should be distinguishable.
h.
Controls / input devices should be organized according to the following principles, when feasible:
•
Controls should be organized in logical groups according to function and frequency of use.
•
Controls should be collocated with the associated displays.
•
Controls used most frequently should be the most accessible.
•
Dedicated controls should be used for frequently used functions.
•
Line select function keys should align with adjacent text.
i.
Control operating force should be appropriate for its intended function.
Note: Low forces might provide insufficient feedback, while high forces might impede intentional rapid use. 

j.
Use of two or more controls simultaneously (e.g., pushing two buttons at once) in flight should not be required to perform a function.
k.
Controls that do not require adjustment by the flight crew (e.g., maintenance functions) should not be readily accessible to the flight crew.
l.
Controls and their labels should be identifiable during all normally expected ambient light conditions, including direct sunlight and nighttime.
m. Control identifiers and other information should not be obstructed by the control
input devices.
Note: Reference AC 20-175 for additional guidance on controls.  

## 2.3.11 Color

Color may be used for many purposes on displays.  A key use of color is to represent/encode information abstractly based on a design rule or philosophy that the flight crew is expected to understand (e.g., a brown symbol may be used to indicate traffic on the ground).  Displayed information represented in this way is known as "colorcoded" information. There may be no coding associated with the other use of colors.  Other uses of color include natural (vs. abstract) representations of physical features (e.g., terrain imagery) or for contrast (e.g., legibility of text), to name a few.   

a.
Color-coded information should be accompanied by another distinguishing characteristic such as shape, location, or text.
b. No more than six colors should be used for color-coded information on the display.  
Note: Color diversity is limited to as few colors as practical to ensure adequate 
color contrast.   
c. For color-coded information, the color **shall** (3148) be discriminable and identifiable 
under the normally expected ambient light conditions.   
d. Color-coding should be consistent across all CDTI displays and controls. e. Any use of color should not adversely affect the flight crew's ability to use colorcoded information.  In particular, the use of red and amber/yellow for functions other 
than crew alerting should be limited, and should not adversely affect crew alerting. 
f. Industry standard colors should be used within the CDTI. 

## 2.4 Alternate Systems

This section provides requirements for systems that deviate from the usual system architecture that includes an ASSAP and CDTI. 

## 2.4.1 Tsaa Without A Traffic Display

The TSAA application may be implemented without a Traffic Display (see Figure 2-22).  
Installations without a Traffic Display must meet the TSAA requirements contained in this section (§2.4.1) and subsections.  Section §2.3 is applicable to installations with a Traffic Display, and therefore do not need to be fulfilled or verified for TSAA installations without a Traffic Display unless specifically referenced in this section and its subsections.  
TSAA installations without a Traffic Display still require visual indications and controls. The visual components may consist of individual display elements that indicate the presence or lack of alert, fault and other conditions.  At a minimum, the installation must include display elements needed to indicate alert status, application status, fault status, and the controls for the application.  

## 2.4.1.1 Tsaa Aural And Control Latency

Maximum Total Latency between interfaces F and G **shall** (3157) be 0.5 seconds. 

Note: The F→G latency is applicable to a system that is operating in normal mode (all processing components operational). 

Human Interface Latency:  The ASA system latency from activation of a control input to the appearance or annunciation of the response should be less than one second. 

Note: Aural output latency is measured from the beginning of the aural message. 

## 2.4.1.2 Outputs From Annunciator Panel To Assap 2.4.1.2.1 Alert Acknowledge

The annunciator panel **shall** (3158) output a TSAA Alert acknowledgement indication to ASSAP, when activated by the flight crew. 

## 2.4.1.2.2 Alert Update

The annunciator panel **shall** (3159) output an update request to ASSAP, when activated by the flight crew. 

## 2.4.1.3 Tsaa Alert Control

The TSAA controls **shall** (3160) provide a means for the pilot to acknowledge a TSAA 
alert in progress. 

The TSAA controls **shall** (3161) provide a means for the pilot to request a TSAA aural alert update. 

## 2.4.1.4 Display Of Status Indication 2.4.1.4.1 System Status

a.
The TSAA annunciator panel **shall** (3162) indicate any status including the
following:
1.
On:  TSAA application is on/running: required ownship input data is
available and meets the TSAA performance criteria
2.
Unavailable to run:  Ownship data that does not meet minimum requirements
(§2.2.4.5.1)
3.
Unavailable - fault:
–
Non-normal status from the ASSAP self-test
- Non-normal status from the ASSAP continuous monitoring function 
- Non-normal status or failure of inputs (e.g., ADS-B receiver failure) 
4.       Loss or lack of power  
b. Status a. may be accomplished by a visual annunciator indicating a system failure 
and an aural annunciation further describing the status.  In such installations, a means 
shall (3169) be provided for the pilot to repeat the aural status annunciation. 
c. When a feature is implemented to allow disabling of aural TSAA Traffic Caution 
Alerts, the annunciator panel **shall** (3163) visually indicate when TSAA System 
Status is set to "Alert Disabled" per pilot action.   
Note: A feature to allow pilots to disable alerting while the system is powered is an 
optional feature and does not constitute a minimum requirement.   

## 2.4.1.4.2 Tis-B/Ads-R Service Status

a. For systems that do not receive alerts from TCAS (e.g., TAS or TCAS I traffic 
alerts), the annunciator panel **shall** (3164) indicate TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status 
received from ASSAP. 
b. TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status should be indicated in a manner consistent with the 
overall flight deck design philosophy.   
Note:  TIS-B/ADS-R service status may be accomplished by visual or aural annunciations.    

## 2.4.1.5 Accessibility Of Controls

The annunciator panel **shall** (3167) meet the CDTI Accessibility of Controls requirements in Section §2.3.10.   

## 2.4.1.6 Visual Traffic Alert Annunciation

The annunciator panel **shall** (3168) have the capability to display an amber/yellow visual annunciation of the TSAA Traffic Caution Alert.   

1. The traffic alert includes TSAA Traffic Caution Alerts and updates to those alerts that 
are generated both automatically and by a pilot initiated request. 
2.  The visual traffic alert annunciation may use the same visual indicator used to 
indicate system status in §2.4.1.4.1a if aural annunciations distinguish the cause for 
illumination. 

## 2.4.1.7 Tsaa Aural Alerts

The Audio System (e.g., speaker or headphones) provides the traffic alert from the ASSAP to the pilot. Section §2.2.2.1.6 describes the Aural Requirements.

## 3 Equipment Test Procedures 3.1 Equipment Performance—Environmental Conditions

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in this section are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under conditions representative of those that may be encountered in actual aeronautical operation. 

Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in DO-160G / 
ED-14G Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment. General information on the use of DO-160G / ED-14G is contained in Sections 1 through 
3 of that document.  Also, a method of identifying which environmental tests were conducted and other amplifying information on the conduct of the tests is contained in Appendix A of DO-160G / ED-14G. 

Some of the performance requirements in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 are not required to be tested to all of the conditions contained in DO-160G / ED-14G.  Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these conditions. 

Review of the requirements provided in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 indicates that such requirements will be satisfied through software implementations which are not normally affected by environmental conditions. Therefore, the environmental test procedures of  
Table 3-2 are established in order to verify only the various interface functions of the Airborne Surveillance Application Processing function under environmental conditions. These test procedures are to be performed only for non-integrated Airborne Surveillance Application Processing implementations.  When the ASA implementation is integrated with a TCAS receiver the environmental tests specified in DO-185B / ED-143 are sufficient to validate the environmental performance of ASA. 

## 3.1.1 Environmental Test Conditions

Table 3-1 lists all of the environmental conditions and test procedures (hereafter referred to as environmental procedures) that are documented in DO-160G / ED-14G. Table 3-1 
lists the sets of ASA performance tests that are specified in detail in this section and which are intended to be performed subject to the various environmental procedures of DO-160G / ED-14G.  Table 3-1 divides the environmental procedures into groups.  The environmental procedures that apply to all of the sets of ASA tests fall into Group 1. 

Group 2 does not include any of the ASA performance tests and only requires that the equipment is powered and functioning normally.  Group 2 is identified for environmental procedures that are intended to determine the effect of the ASA function on rack mounting hardware, compass needles, explosive gases, and other RF hardware.  Group 3 
is indicated when the unit is not required to be powered or operating.  Group 3 is identified for environmental procedures that are intended to determine ASA equipment effects on mechanical aspects or fire safety. 

Table 3-2 indicates which of the groups of environmental procedures is related to each set of ASA performance tests.  Each ASA performance test **shall** (4000) be validated under all of the environmental procedures in the groups required for that test as indicated in Table 3-1.

## 3.2 Assap Equipment Test Procedures 3.2.1 Definition Of Standard Conditions Of Test

Certain ASSAP test procedures require access to internal data streams for verifying track maintenance and correlation. Manufacturers should consider providing a test interface for supporting these test procedures. For TSAA equipment that does not include a Traffic Display, inspection of these internal data streams and/or visualization on a Traffic Display equivalent (e.g., CDTI emulator on a PC) is an acceptable means of complying with ASSAP test procedures that utilize a CDTI to verify requirements. 

The following definitions of terms and conditions of tests are applicable to the equipment tests specified herein commencing at §3.2.2:   

a. Power Input Voltage - Unless otherwise specified, all tests **shall** (5000) be conducted 
with the power input voltage adjusted to design voltage ±2 percent.  The input 
voltage **shall** (5001) be measured at the input terminals of the equipment under test. 
b. Power Input Frequency 
- 
In the case of equipment designed for operation from an alternating current source of essentially constant frequency (e.g., 400 Hz), the input frequency 
shall (5002) be adjusted to design frequency ± 2 percent.   
- 
If the equipment is designed for operation from an AC source of variable 
frequency (e.g., 300 to 1000 Hz), tests **shall** (5003) be conducted with the 
input frequency adjusted to within five percent of a selected frequency and, unless otherwise specified, within the range for which the equipment is designed. 
c. Accuracy of Test Equipment - Throughout this section, the accuracy of the test 
equipment is not addressed in detail, but rather is left to the calibration process prescribed by the agency which certifies the testing facility. 
d. Adjustment of Equipment - The circuits of the equipment under test **shall** (5004) be 
properly aligned and otherwise adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's 
recommended practices prior to application of the specified tests.  Unless otherwise 
specified, adjustments may not be made once the test procedures have started. 
e. Test Instrument Precautions - During the tests, precautions **shall** (5005) be taken to 
prevent the introduction of errors resulting from the connection of voltmeters, oscilloscopes and other test instruments, across the input and output terminals of the equipment under test. 
f. Ambient Conditions - Unless otherwise specified, all tests **shall** (5006) be conducted 
under conditions of ambient room temperature, pressure and humidity.  However, the 
room temperature **shall** (5007) not be lower than 10 degrees C.   
g. Connected Loads - Unless otherwise specified, all tests **shall** (5008) be performed 
with the equipment connected to loads having the impedance values for which it is designed.

The test tracks in Appendix U include the effects of latency from interface A to D and F 
to G. The test tracks in this section are meant to be applied at interface D and measured at interface F.

Verify that the system begins annunciation of an alert greater than 12.5 seconds prior to achieving closest point of approach (CPA) for the ownship and traffic tracks in Section U.2, Must Alert Tracks. 

In order to specify alert times, without being prescriptive in the exact methodology, an average (mean) alert time is required. This ensures that the bulk of alerts are not issued too close to CPA with the understanding that in some geometries the alert may be issued closer to CPA. This mean is based on testing the set of representative encounters in this section. The ASSAP is not expected to calculate and maintain a running average alert time and adjust alerts based on that average. Verify that the average time of alert prior to CPA is greater than 30 seconds for all Must Alert Tracks in Section U.2.2 and U.2.3. For systems that do not contain logic to automatically update traffic caution alerts, verify that the system only annunciates once per encounter. 

For systems that contain logic to automatically update traffic caution alerts, verify that the system annunciates no more than twice per encounter. 

Verify that the ASSAP begins to annunciate alerts at least 35 seconds prior to CPA with TSAA traffic for identified scenarios where ownship and TSAA traffic are not accelerating. Verify that the ASSAP discontinues alert status prior to the end of the test track for the specified test tracks in Section U.2.

Tests may be optimized by designing traffic scenarios that exercise multiple vocabularies concurrently. 
Generate and run a set of Traffic alert scenarios that exercise all vocabulary components that the system can generate, including scenarios that trigger all numeric range and optional aural components supported by the system.  Verify that all expected aural messages are generated as expected in the order defined in section §2.2.4.5.4.2.

This test verifies that ASSAP processes the TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status message and indicates the TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status message when appropriate. 

Note: Aircraft with an installed and operable TCAS do not need to accomplish this test. 

Step 1: No TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status Message 
Ensure no service status message appropriate for the link is being received from the ADS-B/TIS-B receiver.  Verify that the TIS-B/ADS-R service status indication on the CDTI indicates that TIS-B/ADS-R service is not available, or that the traffic picture is incomplete.   

Step 2: TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status Message with No Ownship Address

Step 3: TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status Message with Ownship Address 
Transmit a DF=18, CF=4 message that contains the ownship 24-bit Address with an in-service bit at least every 20 seconds.  Verify that the TIS-B/ADS-R service status indication on the CDTI changes to indicate that TIS-B/ADS-R service is available, or that the traffic picture is as complete as possible.  

Step 4: TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status Message with Ownship Address Dropped during 
Transmission 
Stop including the ownship 24-bit Address but continue transmitting the DF=18, CF=4 message.  Verify that within 40 seconds that the CDTI indicates that TIS-
B/ADS-R service is not available, or that the traffic picture is incomplete.

Repeat Step 3.  After step 3 verification, transmit the DF=18, CF=4 message that contains the ownship 24-bit Address with an out-of-service bit one time.  
Continue transmitting the DF=18, CF=4 message without the ownship 24-bit Address.  Verify that within six seconds that the CDTI indicates that TIS-
B/ADS-R service is not available, or that the traffic picture is incomplete.   

## 3.2.6.2 Verification Of Vdl4 (§2.2.6.2)

Note: Aircraft with an installed and operable TCAS do not need to accomplish this test. 

Step 1: No DoS Message 
Ensure no service status message appropriate for the link is being received from the ADS-B/TIS-B receiver.  Verify that the TIS-B service status indication on the CDTI indicates that TIS-B service is not available, or that the traffic picture is incomplete.   

Step 2: TIS-B Service is Available through the DoS Message 
Transmit a DoS message that contains the TIS-B service available bit in the si field at least every 20 seconds.  Verify that the TIS-B service status indication on the CDTI changes to indicate that TIS-B service is available, or that the traffic picture is as complete as possible.  

Step 3: TIS-B Service becomes Unavailable through the DoS Message 
Keep transmitting the DoS message but set the TIS-B service bit in the si field to 0 to indicate that the TIS-B service is unavailable. Verify that within six seconds that the CDTI indicates that TIS-B/ADS-R service is not available, or that the traffic picture is incomplete.     

Step 4: Stopped Transmitting DoS Message 
Repeat Step 2.  After Step 2 verification stop transmitting the DoS message completely.  Verify that within 40 seconds that the CDTI indicates that TIS-B 
service is not available, or that the traffic picture is incomplete.   

## 3.2.7 Description Of Test Scenarios Used As Assap Test Stimulus

This section describes specific aircraft trajectory sets that are used to provide stimulus scenarios for ASSAP testing.  Five trajectory sets are used, where each trajectory set is designed to stress specific ASSAP requirements.  For each trajectory set, multiple scenarios are created by assigning various sources to each trajectory or modifying trajectory roles and track components.  Each source is simulated by taking the idealized truth trajectory and adding position noise.  For ADS-B and ADS-R this position noise is consistent with a NACP of 5 (the minimum NACP for any application).  For TIS-B and TCAS, applied position noise is appropriate for the source based on flight data.  The final step is to down sample the trajectory to simulate ADS-B media access operation and expected link reception performance (i.e., for 1090ES, UAT or VDL4).  Air-air link performance (for ADS-B and TCAS) is based on recorded or simulated flight data and ground-air link performance (ADS-R and TIS-B) is based on performance requirements in the Surveillance and Broadcast Services (SBS) Specification. The process used for conversion of the idealized truth data to the reports used as stimulus for ASSAP testing is detailed in Appendix I.  The resulting report files associated with each scenario are provided in separate media in individual files with a report format defined in Appendix I.  Each scenario can result in multiple separate stimulus files depending on the installed environment for ASSAP.  This is necessary to accommodate differences in report generation between 1090ES, UAT and VDL4 receivers and to accommodate differences in installations with and without support for TCAS. Additional conditions/assumptions for all scenarios: 

•
TIS-B reports will contain a track number as generated by the ground system unless specifically indicated.  With the exception of TIS-B to TIS-B correlation scenarios, this track number will remain constant throughout each trajectory.
•
ASSAP is being driven by a single link receiver (i.e., ADS-B/ADS-R do not
occur simultaneously for the same traffic element).
•
TCAS track updates do not contain 24-bit Address unless specifically indicated.
•
TCAS source applies only if TCAS is part of the installation.
•
Traffic sources marked as ADS-R or TIS-B are inapplicable to VDL4
installations as there are no known planned operational implementations of TIS- B or ADS-R using VDL4.

## 3.2.7.4 Trajectory Set #4: Check Track Capacity, Track Generation And Track Termination

Trajectory Set #4 is based on about 12 minutes of radar data from the Atlanta Terminal Radar (60 NM radius from Atlanta) recorded in August 2006 around 4:30 pm local time. 

Approaches to 3 simultaneous parallel runways are in use (Runways 08L, 09R, 10).  
Figure 3-4 below shows the main flows evident in the data.  Other traffic due to overflights and operations to nearby airports are also evident but account for a relatively small fraction of the total number of trajectories.   
A single track (identified as track # 227 in the data set) along the center approach path is selected as the ownship.  In order to create the scenario, the 190 individual trajectories in the data are partitioned into groups by the surveillance source applicable as shown in Table 3-6 below.   
Group 1 tracks are equipped with Mode S transponders reporting altitude in 25 foot increments.  These tracks provide ADS-B on 1090 MHz and ADS-R on UAT.  TCAS 
integrated equipment must correlate the TCAS tracks with the 1090 ADS-B tracks. These tracks comprise approximately 75 percent of the total tracks.  Group 1 is used by 1090 MHz or UAT equipment. Group 2a tracks are equipped with UAT transmitters and ATCRBS transponders reporting altitude in 100 foot increments.  These tracks provide ADS-B on UAT and ADS-R on 1090 MHz. TCAS integrated equipment must correlate the TCAS tracks with the 1090 ADS-R tracks.  These tracks comprise approximately 20 percent of the total tracks. Group 2a is used by 1090 MHz or UAT equipment. Group 2b tracks are equipped with VDL4 transmitters and ATCRBS transponders reporting altitude in 100 foot increments.  These tracks provide ADS-B on VDL4.  ADS-
R is not supported on 1090 MHz.  TCAS integrated equipment must correlate the TCAS 
tracks with the VDL4 ADS-B tracks.  These tracks comprise approximately 20 percent of the total tracks.  Group 2b is used by VDL4 equipment. Group 3 tracks are equipped with Mode S transponders reporting altitude in 100 foot increments.  These tracks provide ADS-B on 1090 MHz and ADS-R on UAT.  These tracks also include a TIS-B track to account for cases where the ground system cannot correlate ADS-B and SSR tracks.  ADS-B to TIS-B correlation is optional for ASA 
systems, so these cases may result in duplicate tracks.  Airborne TIS-B traffic is optional for TCAS integrated systems so TIS-B to TCAS correlation is validated when implemented.  These tracks comprise approximately 5 percent of the total tracks.  Group 3 is used by 1090 MHz or UAT equipment.

## 3.2.7.5 Trajectory Set #5: Check For Coexistence Of Multiple Tis-B Tracks Per Aircraft Due To Identifier Changes Across Service Volume Boundaries

Trajectory Set #5 is designed to ensure that TIS-B track identifier changes across service volume boundaries (coexistence of multiple tracks for a single aircraft) do not cause display shadowing.  It uses 3 simultaneous aircraft trajectories as shown in Figure 3-5:  

•
Trajectory 5A is based on operational TIS-B data, observed behaviors, and
hypothetical situations derived from these observations.  It represents an aircraft initially traveling straight at roughly 340 kts and climbing at a rate of roughly 2000 fpm.  The aircraft performs a 30 degree turn as it continues to
climb. Trajectory 5A exits a service volume, enters another, and then reenters the first service volume. The track components of Trajectory 5A are defined differently for two potential scenarios:
i.
Scenario 5-1: a case in which three consecutive TIS-B tracks are
generated, all with unique identifiers.  Due to track extrapolation, the first and second tracks coexist (overlap in time) as do the second and third tracks.  The first track is terminated (due to maximum allowed data age) prior to generation of the third track.  Additionally, this case satisfies testing for a mathematically and logically identical scenario in which the third track is assigned the identifier of the first track after the first track is terminated. 
ii. 
 Scenario 5-2: a case similar to Scenario 5-1, however, after 
establishment of the first and second tracks, upon aircraft reentry into 
the original service volume, the first track begins to update (a third track with a unique identifier is not generated); i.e., the period of 
inactivity is less than the maximum allowed data age and reports with the same identifier as the first track are generated shortly before the first track would be terminated. This case is indistinguishable from one in which a third track inherits the identifier of the first track within the same time frame. 
- 
Trajectory 5B is a straight and level track flying at roughly 340 kts 5 NM intrail of 5A.  Trajectories 5A and 5B are initially at co-altitude but experience 
vertical separation as Trajectory 5A climbs. 
- 
Trajectory 5C is a straight and level track flying at roughly 340 kts, coaltitude with and parallel to 5B with 10 NM of lateral separation.

## 3.2.8 Description Of Test Scenarios Used As Itp Test Stimulus

ITP trajectories are designed to ensure that ITP Distance calculations are performed correctly for various traffic configurations.  It uses 1 ownship trajectory with 10 
simultaneous aircraft trajectories.  Ownship starts at 60.0° latitude, -10.0° longitude flying at 35000 ft with a 480 kt ground speed on a westerly 290° track.  Aircraft trajectories are ADS-B tracks.  Note, some are less than 30NM away so they must be ADS-B Version 2 or have correlating TCAS tracks in order to qualify for ITP.  Figure 
3-6 shows the traffic with respect to ownship and its trajectory (which is depicted as the thin blue line in the figure below).  All aircraft are moving from right to left in the figure.  

## Itp Trajectories Summary

From these trajectories, 10 scenarios are defined.  These scenarios are individually depicted in the following figures and summarized in Table 3-8.   
Scenario ITP-1: In this scenario, aircraft 101 is ahead of ownship flying on a converging intersecting track similar to Figure 2-6, where ITP Distance is calculated as the difference of the horizontal distances of each aircraft to the common point.  When aircraft 101 flies through the common point (directly in front of ownship), the tracks transition to converging intersecting tracks similar to Figure 2-10, where the ownship and aircraft 101 
are on opposite sides of the common point.  The ITP Distance calculation becomes the sum of the horizontal distances of each aircraft to the common point.  
Scenario ITP-2: In this scenario, aircraft 102 is behind ownship flying on a converging intersecting track similar to Figure 2-10, where ownship and aircraft 102 are on opposite sides of the common point.  The ITP distance is calculated as the sum of the horizontal distances of each aircraft to the common point.  When aircraft 102 flies through the common point (directly behind ownship), the tracks transition to diverging intersecting tracks similar to Figure 2-7, where ITP Distance calculation becomes the difference of the horizontal distances of each aircraft to the common point.  
Scenario ITP-3: In this scenario, aircraft 103 is directly in front of ownship flying on an identical track similar to Figure 2-8, where ITP Distance is calculated as the horizontal distance from ownship to aircraft 103.   
Scenario ITP-4: In this scenario, aircraft 104 is directly behind ownship flying on an identical track similar to Figure 2-8, where ITP Distance is calculated as the horizontal distance from ownship to aircraft 104.  
Scenario ITP-5: In this scenario, aircraft 105 is ahead of ownship flying on a parallel track similar to Figure 2-9, where ITP Distance is calculated as the horizontal distance from ownship to the point directly abeam of aircraft 105's position.   
Scenario ITP-6: In this scenario, aircraft 106 is behind ownship flying on a parallel track similar to Figure 2-9, where ITP Distance is calculated as the horizontal distance from ownship to the point directly abeam of aircraft 106's position.  
Scenario ITP-7: In this scenario, aircraft 107 is behind ownship flying on a converging intersecting track similar to Figure 2-6, where ITP Distance is calculated as the difference of the horizontal distance of each aircraft to the common point.   
Scenario ITP-8: In this scenario, aircraft 108 is ahead of ownship flying on a diverging intersecting track similar to Figure 2-7, where ITP Distance is calculated as the difference of the horizontal distances of each aircraft to the common point.  
Scenario ITP-9: In this scenario, aircraft 109 is behind ownship flying on a converging intersecting track similar to Figure 2-6, where ITP Distance is calculated as the difference of the horizontal distances of each aircraft to the common point.  When ownship flies through the common point (directly in front of aircraft 109), the tracks transition to converging intersecting tracks similar to Figure 2-10, where ownship and aircraft 109 are on opposite sides of the common point.  The ITP distance calculation becomes the sum of the horizontal distances of each aircraft to the common point.   
Scenario ITP-10: In this scenario, aircraft 10A is ahead of ownship flying on a converging intersecting track similar to Figure 2-10, where the ownship and aircraft 109 
are on opposite sides of the common point.  The ITP Distance is calculated as the sum of the horizontal distances of each aircraft to the common point.  When ownship flies through the common point (directly behind aircraft 109), the tracks transition to diverging intersecting tracks similar to Figure 2-7, where the ITP Distance calculation becomes the difference of the horizontal distances of each aircraft to the common point.

## 3.3 Cdti Equipment Test Procedures

The test procedures set forth in the following subparagraphs constitute a satisfactory method of verifying the proper implementation of the CDTI requirements.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred. Such alternate methods may be used if the manufacturer can show that they provide at least equivalent information.  Therefore, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. These tests do not require the presence of an ASSAP.  If an ASSAP is not present, the manufacturer is responsible for defining a set of test drivers which are consistent with the type of interface (i.e., hardware and software protocols) designed to interface and control the CDTI. The human machine interface (HMI) to the CDTI may be part of the physical CDTI device or it may be remote with an interface to the CDTI.  If the HMI is remote to the CDTI, the manufacturer is responsible for defining a set of test drivers which are consistent with the type of interface (i.e., hardware and software protocols) designed to interface and control the CDTI. The display drivers and data collection equipment used in these tests should be approved by the appropriate certification authority or a person designated by the certification authority for such approvals (e.g., Designated Engineering Representative or other authorized person), prior to the initiation of these tests.  Separate drivers may be used for different display implementations and to complete the testing defined for controls. 

Figure 3-22 illustrates a functional diagram of a typical test setup.  The manufacturer is responsible for defining the types of instrumentation to be used to collect any quantitative data required to demonstrate compliance with the requirements. 

 

## 3.3.1 Definition Of Terms And Conditions Of Test

The following are definitions of terms and the conditions under which the tests described in this subsection should be conducted. 

Power Input Voltage - Unless otherwise specified, all tests **shall** (6000) be conducted with the power input voltage adjusted to design voltage ±2%.  The input voltage **shall** 
[6001] be measured at the input terminals of the equipment under test. 

Power Input Frequency - In the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC 
power source of essentially constant frequency (e.g., 400 Hz), the input frequency **shall** 
(6002) be adjusted to design frequency ±2%. 

In the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC power source of variable frequency (e.g., 300 to 1,000 Hz), unless otherwise specified, tests **shall** (6003) be conducted with the input frequency adjusted to within ±5% of a selected frequency and within the range for which the equipment is designed. 

Adjustment of Equipment - The circuits of the equipment under test **shall** (6004) be properly aligned and otherwise adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practices prior to application of the specified tests. 

Test Equipment - All equipment used in the performance of the tests should be identified by make, model and serial number where appropriate, and its latest calibration date. When appropriate, all test equipment calibration standards should be traceable to national and/or international standards. 

Test Instrument Precautions - Due precautions **shall** (6005) be taken during tests to prevent the introduction of errors resulting from the connection of voltmeters, oscilloscopes and other test instruments across the input and output impedances of the equipment under test. 

Ambient Conditions - Unless otherwise specified, all tests **shall** (6006) be conducted under the following ambient conditions:  

- 
Temperature:  +15 to +35 degrees C (+59 to +95 degrees F). 
•
Relative Humidity:  Not greater than 85%.
•
Ambient Pressure: 84 to 107 kilo Pascal (kPa) (equivalent to +5,000 to -
1,500 ft) (+1,525 to -460 m).
When tests are conducted at ambient conditions that differ from the above values, allowances **shall** (6007) be made and the differences recorded. 

Connected Loads - Unless otherwise specified, all tests **shall** (6008) be performed with the equipment connected to loads having the impedance values for which it is designed. 

Warm-up - Unless otherwise specified, all tests **shall** (6009) be conducted after the manufacturer's specified warm-up period.  

## Test Methods

Analysis - Analysis is the method of verification which consists of comparing hardware or software design with known scientific and technical principles, technical data, or procedures and practices to validate that the proposed design will meet the specified functional or performance requirements. 

Demonstration - Demonstration is the method of verification where qualitative versus quantitative validation of a requirement is made during a dynamic test of the equipment. In general, software functional requirements are validated by demonstration since the functionality must be observed through some secondary media. 

Inspection - Inspection is the method of verification to determine compliance with specification requirements and consists primarily of visual observations or mechanical measurements of the equipment, physical location, or technical examination of engineering support documentation. 

Test - Test is the method of verification that will measure equipment performance under specific configuration load conditions and after the controlled application of known stimuli.  Quantitative values are measured, compared against previous predicated success criteria and then evaluated to determine the degree of compliance. 

X/Y - Either test method X or test method Y may be used to verify the requirement (i.e., D/A can be tested by Demonstration or Analysis). 

X+Y - Both test methods must be used to verify the requirement (i.e., D+A means the requirement must be verified by both Demonstration and Analysis).

(A/D/I/T) 
If ownship track angle is used to orient ownship, then ownship track angle is invalid when ownship track angle uncertainty magnitude is > 30 degrees. If traffic actual altitude is determined from ownship pressure altitude, then pressure altitude is from ownship sources. If traffic actual altitude is displayed, then baro correction or baro corrected altitude is from ownship sources. Ownship A/V Length and Width code is used from ownship sources if CDTI uses the data to display ownship symbol. If designated traffic is supported, the Track ID of the designated traffic and the associated application are output to ASSAP. If the installation supports the SURF application, data such as Field Elevation for the relevant airport is output to ASSAP. If the installation supports the SURF 
application, the runway position data for all 
runways for the relevant airport is output to ASSAP. If the installation supports the TSAA application and the aural annunciation contains relative traffic position, the alert acknowledge feature suppresses the remaining portion of the current aural alert when activated. If the installation supports the TSAA application and contains a feature that allows updating of the alert, the aural alert is updated when the feature is activated.

## 4.4 Test Procedures For Installed Equipment Performance

The following test procedures provide one means of determining installed equipment performance. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the installing activity. These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information. In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. The equipment **shall** (7020) be tested to determine compliance with the minimum requirements stated in Section §2.2.  In order to meet this requirement, test results supplied by the equipment manufacturer or other proof of conformity may be accepted in lieu of bench tests performed by the installing activity. 

## 4.4.1 Ground Test Procedures 4.4.1.1 Conformity Inspection

Visually inspect the installed equipment to determine the use of acceptable workmanship and engineering practices. Verify that proper mechanical and electrical connections have been made and that the equipment has been located and installed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. 

## 4.4.1.2 Equipment Function

set, TCAS tracks from a real or simulated TCAS LRU, and real or simulated ownship data sources as defined in Section §2.2.2.  
2. The ASSAP/CDTI equipment **shall** (7022) display all required traffic data 
elements on the CDTI per the requirements of Section §2.3.  
3. All traffic data elements **shall** (7023) be displayed per the requirements of 
Table 2-4 for traffic data and Table 2-5 for ownship data for each of the 
supported applications. 

## 4.4.2 Flight Test Procedures 4.4.2.1 Displayed Data Readability

Determine that normal conditions of flight do not significantly affect the readability of displayed data. 

## 4.4.2.2 Assap Installed Flight Test

Flight tests are not necessary for functions that encode, communicate and decode messages, assemble reports, or generate display inputs. A flight test under environmentally stressful conditions is recommended to provide the data for a complete ASA system design validation.  This environment should include the combined effects of 1) high aircraft density, 2) maneuvering aircraft, 3) airborne and ground traffic in each of the quadrants around the aircraft, 4) multiple data sources 
(ADS-B, ADS-R, TIS-B and TCAS), 5) the combined effects of multipath interference, synchronous garbling, and fruit interference, and 6) (for 1090ES systems) ground interrogator interference from multiple ground interrogators.  This may require dedicated test traffic. Previous flight tests (conducted for TCAS validation) have shown that New York and Chicago have been the most stressful environment necessary for evaluation of TCAS Mode S surveillance, and it is expected that this will also hold for ADS-B traffic as equipage rates increase.  The most effective flight paths for these TCAS tests have proven to be orbital flights of 5 NM radius near the major airport terminal, JFK in New York and O'Hare in Chicago.  The flight test should be conducted at an altitude less than 
10,000 feet during peak traffic periods when the ground visibility is greater than 10 NM 
with a ceiling of at least 11,000 feet to ensure the highest peak traffic densities. The recorded data should include as a minimum that necessary to determine if the intersource correlation requirements given in Section §2.2.3.2 have been met.  
Note: Tests should include at least 5000 track seconds each of ADS-B, TIS-B and TCAS 
tracks as appropriate for the installation.

## A.2 Definitions Of Terms

The following are definitions of terms used in this document. Square brackets (e.g., [DO-
242A], refer to entries in the bibliography in Appendix M). 

24-bit Address - Address assigned to each aircraft transponder or ADS-B transmitter.  
For aircraft equipped with Mode S transponders, their replies to interrogations and their ADS-B transmissions should use the same 24-bit Address, allowing correlation 
by ASSAP.  
Accuracy - Within this document, the term accuracy used in conjunction with a quality 
metric (e.g., horizontal position accuracy, horizontal velocity accuracy) is used interchangeably with the term uncertainty (e.g., horizontal position uncertainty).  The usage of the terms was chosen to aid in readability of the requirements and does not imply that there are separate metrics. 
Advisory - The level or category of alert for conditions that require flight crew awareness 
and may require subsequent flight crew response. 
Aircraft Surveillance Applications (ASA) System - An aircraft system based on 
airborne surveillance that provides assistance to the flight crew supporting the separation of their aircraft from other aircraft.  
Airborne Separation Assistance Application - A set of operational procedures for 
controllers and flight crews that makes use of an Aircraft Surveillance Applications System to meet a defined operational goal.  
Alert - A general term that applies to all advisories, cautions, and warning information, 
can include visual, aural, tactile, or other attention-getting methods. 
Annunciator Panel - A device installed on the flight deck that consists of a small 
number of indicator lamps and switches or buttons.  The main purpose of the device is reporting the status of a remote system, but it may include minor control functions (e.g. inhibit alerts, self-test).  In the context of this document, the term annunciator 
panel is used to describe a device which is installed in conjunction with a TSAA system without a Traffic Display.  
Applications - These are the functions for which the ASA system is to be used (§1.3). 
ASA application - A set of operational procedures for controllers and flight crews that 
makes use of the capabilities of ASA to meet a clearly defined operational goal. 
Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) - ADS-B is a function on an 
aircraft or ground vehicle operating within the surface movement area that 
periodically broadcasts its state vector (horizontal and vertical position, horizontal and vertical velocity) and other information. ADS-B is automatic because no external 
stimulus is required to elicit a transmission; it is dependent because it relies on onboard navigation sources and on-board broadcast transmission systems to provide surveillance information to other users.  
Availability - Availability is an indication of the ability of a system or subsystem to 
provide usable service. Availability is expressed in terms of the probability of the 
system or subsystem being available at the beginning of an intended operation.  
Background Application - An application that applies to all surveilled traffic of 
operational interest. One or more background applications may be in use in some or all airspace (or on the ground), but without flight crew input or automated input to select specific traffic. Background applications include: AIRB and SURF  
Basic Airborne Situation Awareness (AIRB) - The basic airborne situation awareness 
application enhances the flight crew's traffic situation awareness through the provision of an on-board graphical display of surrounding traffic that transmits ADS-
B data of a sufficient quality. Pilots will use the *CDTI* to supplement and enhance 
out-the-window visual acquisition and listening to radio communications. The AIRB 
application results from a combination of EVAcq (DO-289) and ATSA-AIRB (DO-
319/ED-164) applications. 
Caution - The level or category of alert for conditions that require immediate flight crew 
awareness and subsequent flight crew response. 
Closest Point of Approach - The smallest distance between two aircraft during an 
encounter. 
Coast Interval - The elapsed time since a report from any source has been correlated 
with the track. 
Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) - The pilot interface portion of the 
Aircraft Surveillance Applications System. This interface includes traffic display(s) 
and all the controls that interact with such a display. At a minimum, CDTI includes a 
graphical plan-view (top down) traffic display.  Additional graphical and nongraphical display surfaces may also be included.  The CDTI receives position information of traffic and Ownship from the airborne surveillance and separation assurance processing (ASSAP) function. The ASSAP receives such information from 
the surveillance sensors and Ownship position sensors.  
Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) Display - A single CDTI display 
format.  A physical display screen may have more than one instance of a CDTI Display on it.  For example, a display with a split screen that has a Traffic Display on one half of the screen and a list of targets on the other half has two instances of CDTI Displays. 
Conformal - A desirable property of map projections. A map projection (a function that 
associate points on the surface of an ellipsoid or sphere representing the earth to points on a flat surface such as the CDTI display) is said to be *conformal* if the angle 
between any two curves on the first surface is preserved in magnitude and sense by the angle between the corresponding curves on the other surface.  
Correlation - The process of determining that a new measurement belongs to an existing 
track.  
Covariance - A two dimensional symmetric matrix representing the uncertainty in a 
track's state. The diagonal entries represent the variance of each state; the offdiagonal terms represent the covariances of the track state.  
Data Block - A block of information about a selected traffic that is displayed somewhere 
around the edge of the CDTI display, rather than mixed in with the symbols 
representing traffic in the main part of the display.  
Data Tag - A block of information about a traffic that is displayed next to symbol 
representing that traffic in the main part of the CDTI display. 
Designation and Designated Traffic - Designated Traffic is traffic specifically 
designated (by the flight crew or automation) upon which a particular application is to be conducted. Some applications are expected to operate only on Designated Traffic, while other applications (such as VSA and ITP) may use Designated Traffic features, depending on the implementation.    
Designated Traffic features include: 

•
Ability to designate and un-designate specific traffic elements for a specific
application
•
Prevents traffic that is invalid for the application from being designated
•
Distinguishes the designated traffic on the traffic display
•
Link the designated traffic to the particular application (for ASSAP)
•
Indication of loss of designated status to the flight crew.
The CAVS application requires the Designate feature.  VSA and ITP may use Designate features, depending on the implementation.   

Desirable - The capability denoted as *Desirable* is not required to perform the procedure 
but would increase the utility of the operation. 
Display Range - The maximum distance from Ownship that is represented on the *CDTI* 
display (§2.3.5.12). If the *CDTI* display is regarded as a map, then longer display ranges correspond to smaller map scales, and short display ranges correspond to larger map scales.  
Domain - Divisions in the current airspace structure that tie separation standards to the 
surveillance and automation capabilities available in the ground infrastructure. Generally there are five domains: surface, terminal, en route, oceanic/remote and uncontrolled. For example, terminal airspace, in most cases comprises airspace 
within 30 miles and 10,000 feet AGL of airports with a terminal automation system and radar capability. Terminal Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) separation standards are normally 3 miles horizontally and 1000 feet vertically.  
Dual Link - Equipment that transmits and/or receives both the 1090ES and UAT ADS-B 
links.  
Estimation - The process of determining a track's state based on new measurement 
information 
Extrapolation - The process of predicting a track's state forward in time based on the 
track's last kinematic state. 
Flight Crew - One or more cockpit crew members required for the operation of the 
aircraft. 
Geometric Altitude - Provided as Height Above Ellipsoid and referenced to WGS 84 
reference datum. 
GNSS Sensor Integrity Risk - The probability of an undetected failure that results in 
NSE (navigation system error) that significantly jeopardizes the total system error (TSE) exceeding the containment limit. [DO-247, §5.2.2.1]  
Ground Speed - The magnitude of the horizontal velocity vector (see *velocity*). In these 
MOPS it is always expressed relative to a frame of reference that is fixed with 
respect to the earth's surface such as the WGS 84 ellipsoid.  
Ground Track Angle - The direction of the horizontal velocity vector (see *velocity*) 
relative to the ground as noted in Ground Speed. 
Ground Traffic - Traffic that is reporting on ground status, including *Ground Vehicles*. 
Ground Vehicle - Vehicles that only operate on the ground (e.g., fire trucks, luggage 
carts).

Horizontal Velocity - Horizontal velocity is the component of velocity in a local 
horizontal plane.  For GPS sensors, that plane is tangent to the WGS 84 ellipsoid and is vertically displaced such that it contains the navigation sensor's reference point. For INS systems, the local plane is tangent to the local gravity vector. 
Height Above Ellipsoid - Height above the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid. 
Integrity Containment Risk (ICR) - The per-flight-hour probability that a parameter 
will exceed its containment bound without being detected and reported within the required time to alert. (See also *Source Integrity Level*.)  
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) - A United Nations organization 
that is responsible for developing international standards, recommended practices, and procedures covering a variety of technical fields of aviation.  
Latency - Latency is the time incurred between two particular interfaces. Total latency is 
the delay between the true time of applicability of a measurement and the time that the measurement is reported at a particular interface (the latter minus the former). Components of the total latency are elements of the total latency allocated between different interfaces. Each latency component will be specified by naming the interfaces between which it applies.  
Mixed Equipage - An environment where all aircraft do not have the same set of 
avionics. For example, some aircraft may transmit ADS-B and others may not, which 
could have implications for ATC and pilots. A mixed equipage environment will exist until all aircraft operating in a system have the same set of avionics.  

Moving - Traffic moving status is determined based on the received Surface Position 
movement data, where traffic (A/V) is considered to be moving when the reported movement data is reported being greater than zero.  See also *Static*. 
Nautical Mile (NM) - A unit of length used in the fields of air and marine navigation. In 
this document, a nautical mile is always the international nautical mile of 1852 m exactly.  
Navigation Accuracy Category Position (NACP**) -** The NACP parameter describes the 
accuracy region about the reported position within which the true position of the surveillance position reference point is assured to lie with a 95% probability at the reported time of applicability.  
Navigation Accuracy Category Velocity (NACV**) -** The NACV parameter describes the 
accuracy about the reported velocity vector within which the true velocity vector is assured to be with a 95% probability at the reported time of applicability.  
Navigation Integrity Category (NIC) - The NIC parameter describes an integrity 
containment region about the reported position, within which the true position of the surveillance position reference point is assured to lie at the reported time of applicability.  For the conditions and probability of assurance associated with the integrity containment region, see the SIL parameter. 
Navigation Sensor Availability - An indication of the ability of the guidance function to 
provide usable service within the specified coverage area, and is defined as the portion of time during which the sensor information is to be used for navigation, 
during which reliable navigation information is presented to the crew, autopilot, or other system managing the movement of the aircraft. Navigation sensor availability is specified in terms of the probability of the sensor information being available at the 
beginning of the intended operation. [DO-247, §5.2.2.3]  
Navigation Sensor Continuity - The capability of the sensor (comprising all elements 
generating the signal in space and airborne reception) to perform the guidance function without non-scheduled interruption during the intended operation. [DO-247, 
§5.2.2.2]  
Navigation Sensor Continuity Risk - The probability that the sensor information will be 
interrupted and not provide navigation information over the period of the intended 
operation. [DO-247, §5.2.2.2]  
Navigation System Integrity - This relates to the trust that can be placed in the 
correctness of the navigation information supplied. Integrity includes the ability to provide timely and valid warnings to the user when the navigation system must not be used for navigation.  
Nearby Airborne Traffic - Airborne traffic that is within a 6 NM range and ±1200 ft 
altitude of ownship.  See also *TCAS Proximate Traffic*. 
Nearby Ground Traffic - Ground traffic that is within a 1000 ft range of ownship.  
No Computed Data (NCD) - NCD indicates that the data is missing or inaccurate for 
some reason other than a failure. For example, autopilot commands will show as 
NCD when the autopilot is not turned on. 
Ownship - From the perspective of a flight crew, or of the ASSAP and CDTI functions 
used by that flight crew, the Ownship is the ASA participant (aircraft or vehicle) that carries that flight crew and those ASSAP and CDTI functions.  
Persistent Error - A persistent error is an error that occurs regularly. Such an error may 
be the absence of data or the presentation of data that is false or misleading. An 
unknown measurement bias may, for example, cause a persistent error.  
Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) - A radar sensor that listens to the echoes of pulses 
that it transmits to illuminate aircraft targets. PSR sensors, in contrast to secondary 
surveillance radar (SSR) sensors, do not depend on the carriage of transponders on board the aircraft targets.  

## Proximate Traffic - See *Tcas Proximate Traffic*.

Range Reference - The CDTI feature of displaying range rings or other range markings 
at specified radii from the Ownship symbol.  
Required - The capability denoted as Required is necessary to perform the desired 
application.  
Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) - A radar sensor that listens to replies sent by 
transponders carried on board airborne targets. SSR sensors, in contrast to primary surveillance radar (PSR) sensors, require the aircraft under surveillance to carry a 
transponder.  
Selected Traffic - A selected traffic is a traffic for which additional information is 
requested by the flight crew.  
Sensor - A measurement device. An air data sensor measures atmospheric pressure and 
temperature, to estimate pressure altitude, and pressure altitude rate, airspeed, etc. A primary surveillance radar (PSR) sensor measures its antenna direction and the times of returns of echoes of pulses that it transmits to determine the ranges and bearings of airborne targets. A *secondary surveillance radar* (SSR) sensor measures its antenna 
direction and the times of returns of replies from airborne transponders to estimate 
the ranges and bearings of airborne targets carrying those transponders.  
Separation - The minimum distance between aircraft/vehicles allowed by regulations. 
Spacing requirements vary by various factors, such as radar coverage (none, single, composite), flight regime (terminal, en route, oceanic), and flight rules (instrument or visual).  
Separation Violation - Violation of appropriate separation requirements. Simple Action - A simple action is one that can be performed with sufficiently low 
amounts of time, attention and workload such that other normal flight crew tasks (e.g., periodic instrument scans) are not compromised.  One example simple action is a single button push. 
Source Integrity Level (SIL) - This field defines the probability of the reported 
horizontal position exceeding the radius of containment (Rc) (integrity bound) 
defined by the NIC, without alerting, assuming no avionics faults.  Although the SIL assumes there are no unannunciated faults in the avionics system, the SIL must consider the effects of a faulted Signal-in-Space, if a Signal-in-Space is used by the 
position source. The probability of an avionics fault causing the reported horizontal position to exceed the radius of containment (integrity bound) defined by the NIC, 
without alerting, is covered by the System Design Assurance (SDA) parameter. 
Source Track 
 - A track that is composed of measurements and state information that are 
derived from a single surveillance source.  
Spacing - A distance maintained from another aircraft for specific operations.  
State Data (vector)  - An aircraft's current horizontal position, vertical position, 
horizontal velocity, vertical velocity, turn indication, and navigational accuracy and integrity.  
Static - Static status is determined based on the received Surface Position movement 
data, where traffic is considered to be static when the reported movement data is reported as Aircraft Stopped (Ground Speed = 0 knots).  See also *Moving.* 
Surface Volume - The volume surrounding an airport, inside which the traffic operating 
is of interest for the SURF application. The Surface Volume is recommended to extend from GND up to 2000 ft AFE. 
Note:  This term is different from the term Surface Service Volume used by the SBS 
program.   
System Design Assurance (SDA) - This field defines the failure condition that the 
position transmission chain is designed to support. The supported failure condition will indicate the probability of a position transmission chain fault causing false or misleading information to be transmitted. The definitions and probabilities associated with the supported failure effect are defined in AC 25.1309-1A, AC 23-1309-1E, and 
AC 29-2C. All relevant system attributes should be considered, including software 
and complex hardware in accordance with DO-178C / ED-12C and DO-254 / ED-80. 
Threatening Encounter - Any encounter where the closest point of approach is within 
the TSAA Must Alert criteria described in Table 2-6. 
 
Traffic Actual Altitude - A target's reported altitude adjusted for local barometric 
pressure.  See Section 2.3.5.5.2. 
Traffic Advisory - A caution-level alert on traffic determined, by TCAS or some other 
alerting application, to be a conflict or collision threat.  These advisories include a traffic symbol change (except for TSAA systems without a Traffic Display) and aural 
alert.  These include both initial and updated traffic alerts. 
Traffic Display - The graphical plan-view (top down) traffic display of the CDTI. Traffic Geometric Altitude - A target's height above the WGS 84 ellipsoid (HAE).  See 
Section 2.3.5.5.3. 
Traffic ID - The aircraft flight number or the tail number. Also called Flight ID or 
Aircraft ID. 
Traffic Pressure Altitude - A target's reported pressure (uncorrected) altitude. See

Traffic Relative Altitude - The difference between ownship and traffic altitude. See 
Section 2.3.5.5.1. 
Traffic Selection - Manual process of flight crew selecting a traffic element. TCAS Potential Threat - Traffic detected by TCAS equipment on board the Ownship 
that has passed the Potential Threat classification criteria for a TCAS TA (traffic advisory) and does not meet the Threat Classification criteria for a TCAS RA (resolution advisory). (DO-185B / ED143, §1.8)  
(If the ASA Ownship CDTI display is also used as a TCAS TA display, then information about TCAS potential threats will be conveyed to the CDTI, possibly via the ASSAP function.)  

TCAS Proximate Traffic - Traffic detected by TCAS equipment on board the Ownship 
that is within 1200 feet and 6 NM of the Ownship. (DO-185B/ED-143, §1.8) (If the 
ASA Ownship CDTI display is also used as a TCAS TA display, then information about TCAS Proximate traffic will be conveyed to the CDTI, possibly via the ASSAP function.)  See also *Nearby Airborne Traffic*. 
TCAS-Only Traffic - A traffic element about which TCAS has provided surveillance 
information, but which the ASSAP function has not correlated with traffic from other 
surveillance sources (such as ADS-B, TIS, or TIS-B).  
Time of Applicability - The time that a particular measurement or parameter is (or was) 
relevant.  
Track - (1) A sequence of reports from the ASSAP function that all pertain to the same 
traffic target. (2) Within the ASSAP function, a sequence of estimates of traffic target state that all pertain to the same traffic element.  
Track Angle  - See *ground track angle*. Track State - The basic kinematic variables that define the state of the aircraft or vehicle 
of a track (e.g., position, velocity, acceleration).  
Traffic - All aircraft/vehicles that are within the operational vicinity of Ownship.  
Traffic Element - A traffic element is an aircraft or vehicle. 
Traffic Information Service - Broadcast - A surveillance service that broadcasts traffic 
information derived from one or more ground surveillance sources to suitably equipped aircraft or ground vehicles, with the intention of supporting ASA 
applications.  
Traffic Symbol - A depiction on the CDTI display of an aircraft or vehicle other than the 
Ownship (§2.3.4.2.3).  
Transponder - A piece of equipment carried on board an aircraft to support the 
surveillance of that aircraft by *secondary surveillance radar* sensors. A transponder 
receives on the 1030 MHz and replies on the 1090 MHz downlink frequency.  
Trajectory Uncertainty - Trajectory uncertainty is a measure of predictability of the 
future trajectory of each aircraft. There are a number of factors involved in trajectory predictability. These include knowledge of a valid future trajectory, capability of the aircraft to adhere to that trajectory, system availability (e.g., ability to maintain its intended trajectory with a system failure in a non-redundant system versus a triple 
redundant system), and others.  
Uncertainty - Within this document, the term uncertainty used in conjunction with a 
quality metric (e.g., horizontal position uncertainty, horizontal velocity uncertainty) 
is used interchangeably with the term accuracy (e.g., horizontal position accuracy).  
The usage of the terms was chosen to aid in readability of the requirements and does 
not imply that there are separate metrics. 
Uncompensated Latency - Uncompensated latency in the delivery of ownship position 
measurements to ASSAP. 
Velocity - The rate of change of position. Horizontal velocity is the horizontal component 
of velocity and vertical velocity is the vertical component of velocity. 
Warning - The level or category of alert for conditions that require immediate flight 
crew awareness and immediate flight crew response. 

## Appendix B Tcas/Asa System Relationship Appendix B Tcas/Asa System  Relationship

The CDTI is a traffic display that includes traffic from ADS-B, TIS-B and TCAS 
sources.  Thus, the CDTI presents a coherent (and as complete as possible) traffic picture to the pilot and provides the required traffic situation awareness.  In this implementation, the ASA System MOPS requirements will be followed. There are situations when the designers may, for whatever reason, choose to use the same display as a TCAS-only display (i.e., without using the ADS-B and TIS-B sources for traffic).  In this case, the TCAS MOPS requirements will be followed.  Figure B-1 shows an EXAMPLE of the system relationship between CDTI (integrated with TCAS) and stand-alone TCAS using the same display.  In this example, normally the display is used by the CDTI function, which integrates the traffic displayed through TCAS as well as through ADS-B and TIS-B receivers. In this case, the system design is expected to provide for the ASSAP and CDTI failure detection (part of which may be provided by the ASSAP and CDTI functions themselves) 
and switch the display to be the TCAS-only display.  The switching itself may be done automatically or manually (with appropriate annunciations to the flight crew).

## Appendix C

# Example Functional Architecture For Airborne Surveillance And Separation Assurance Processing (Assap)

## Appendix C Example Functional Architecture For Airborne Surveillance And Separation Assurance Processing (Assap) C.1 Introduction

This appendix outlines an example functional architecture for the ASSAP component of the Aircraft Surveillance Applications (ASA) system. The ASSAP subsystem performs the surveillance and application-specific processing functions of the ASA system. The architecture presented in this appendix is abbreviated; it does not contain sample algorithms for every function in this document (e.g., duplicate address processing). The modeled functions in this appendix represent a nearly complete implementation and meet or exceed the corresponding requirements in this document. Additionally, this architecture has been tested and validated with real-world and synthesized data sets, including: 

a.
Operational 1090ES ADS-B, UAT TIS-B, and TCAS data obtained from flight tests
performed at the William J. Hughes [FAA] Technical Center in July 2007.
b.
Simulated surveillance data based on Area Navigation (RNAV) approaches to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in August 2006.
c.
TIS-B Type A data for Boston, New York, and Washington Centers collected in
December 2010.

## C.1.1 Functionality In Polar Regions

The algorithms in this appendix are not recommended for use in polar regions (e.g., above 89 degrees latitude) as rotation of a tangential plane for ownship or traffic aircraft may cause improper display of directionality and position. For proper functionality in polar regions it is recommended that ownship and traffic velocities are replaced with velocities derived from tracked changes of position in Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF) 
coordinates as described in appendix S (sample ITP application algorithms). Additionally, storage of magnetic variation tables may be necessary for polar operations to convert true track angles to magnetic track angles. 

## C.1.2 Algorithms For Turn Rate Estimation And Constant Rate Turn Projection

This appendix also contains algorithms for turn rate estimation and constant rate turn projection.  These algorithms were developed for the sample implementation of Traffic Situation Awareness with Alerts (TSAA) in Appendix T of this document.  The algorithms are not limited in scope to the TSAA application, however, there are several subsequently described trade-offs that should be considered prior to implementation of this functionality for other applications.   

## C.2 Assumptions

The functional architecture presented in this appendix is based on the following assumptions: 

a.
ASSAP will receive inputs from a single-link receiver (i.e., ADS-B and ADS-R are
received on the same frequency).
b. The TCAS is a TCAS II system.  If it is not a TCAS II system, some minor 
adjustments must be made based on the characteristics of the TCAS receiver.  
c. Mode S addresses for TCAS targets are available to ASSAP via the TCAS data bus. 
If this is not the case, the processing specified for TCAS-assigned track identifiers 
may be applied to all TCAS tracks. 

## C.3 Surveillance Processing

The ASSAP Surveillance Processing algorithms in this appendix establish tracks from ADS-B and ADS-R traffic reports, correlate TCAS and ADS sources for individual aircraft, identify the highest quality surveillance source for each aircraft if multiple sources are detected, and generate traffic state files for the CDTI.  The algorithms presented in this appendix also establish tracks from TIS-B reports, correlate TCAS and TIS-B sources for individual aircraft, detect TIS-B track identifier changes and mitigate effects on the CDTI, and detect TIS-B shadows of ownship and ADS targets.  Real world implementations will likely contain a subset of these functions (e.g., TIS-B processing is optional for implementations including TCAS; TIS-B and ADS-R processing will likely be inapplicable to initial VDL4 installations).  The Surveillance Processing function has been decomposed into the following subfunctions:  

a. Track Generation and Maintenance. 
b. Intra-Source (TIS-B to TIS-B) Correlation. 
c. Inter-Source Correlation. 
d. Track Termination. 
e. Best Source Selection. 
f. Common Time Track Extrapolation & Traffic State File Generation. 
Figure C-1 contains a block diagram depicting the Surveillance Processing function. 

1. Depending on the implementation or configuration (1090ES, UAT, or VDL4), ASSAP 
will receive varying report formats: split state vector and state uncertainty 
separately, full state vector and state uncertainty, or full state vector and state uncertainty separately. TIS-B processing may be optional, depending on the 
installation. 
2. Correlation tags include TCAS  to ADS correlation tags and  may also pertain to 
TIS-B to TIS-B correlation, TIS-B to ownship correlation, TCAS to TIS-B correlation, 
and TIS-B to ADS correlation (if such functionality is implemented). 
3. TCAS tracks are only merged into the traffic state file when ASSAP determines that 
TCAS represents the sole surveillance source or best surveillance source for a 
particular target. 

## C.3.1 Track Generation And Maintenance

The Track Generation and Maintenance function is responsible for track initiation and subsequent updates. This function is an adaptation of a source-level tracker; ADS-B, ADS-R, and TIS-B tracks are established separately (and categorized by type). An effort was made to define this function independent of implementation type. However, depending on the installation (1090ES, UAT, or VDL4), inputs to ASSAP (traffic reports) are inherently different. The architecture in this appendix contains implementation-specific tracking functions. 

Note: For 1090ES systems, state vector reports are triggered by reception of either a position or velocity message and include both position and velocity with differing times of applicability (TOAs).  Of these two TOAs, the more recent time indicates which message type was just received.  The 1090ES tracking algorithms in this appendix have been designed with these properties in mind.   

## C.3.1.1 Track Generation And Maintenance (1090Es Implementation)

Figure C-2 contains a block diagram depicting the Track Generation and Maintenance function for the 1090ES implementation of ASSAP. 

Note: Reported position is applicable only if a position message triggered report 
generation, if a velocity message triggered report generation, velocity is used by the state assembler. 

## C.3.1.1.1 Track Generation (1090Es Implementation)

Upon reception of a state vector report, ASSAP searches for a track of the same type (ADS-B, ADS-R, TIS-B) and with the same 24-bit address as the report.  If no match is found, ASSAP generates a new track containing the following parameters: 

a.
System time (track time of applicability).
b.
Position time of applicability.
c.
Velocity time of applicability.
d.
Track type (ADS-B, ADS-R, TIS-B).
e.
24-bit address.
f.
Position (latitude, longitude, altitude).
g.
Velocity (East/West velocity, North/South velocity, altitude rate).

1.
Track quality parameters are initially set to the minimum values allowed by the Enhanced Visual Acquisition (EVAcq) and Basic Airborne Situation Awareness
(AIRB) applications or set to 1 for tracker initialization (which requires known uncertainties, excluding SIL) and to prevent immediate invalidation of the track for application processing. Reception of these parameters in subsequent Mode Status reports will overwrite these data.
2.
State covariance matrices are initialized using set or assumed position and velocity uncertainties in the local East/North/Up (ENU) coordinate frame (described below).
3.
Parameters for TIS-B tracks only; for use in a TIS-B to TIS-B correlation function described in section C.3.2. The previous state matrix is initialized with the first reported position and corresponding time then grows to 3 rows with subsequent
updates such that it always contains the three most recent positions and corresponding times.
4.
A turn rate estimation parameter is initialized.
Initial covariance matrix for the x (East) dimension:

where vepu
σ
 (standard deviation of vertical estimated position uncertainty) is an assumed value for pressure altitude (31.11 m = 102 ft) or for geometric altitude (if used), a derivation based on NACP (Version 1 and NACP ≥ 9) or GVA (Version 2, described in Table C-2).

Note: Where σepu and σvepu (if geometric altitude is used) are derived from 95% 
values with assumed conformance to a Gaussian distribution.  For example, 
a NACP of 5 equates to an EPU of 926 m, where σepu = EPU/1.96 = 472 m.

## C.3.1.1.2 Track Maintenance (1090Es Implementation)

Upon reception of a mode status report, ASSAP searches for a track of the same type (ADS-B, ADS-R, TIS-B) and with the same 24-bit address as the report. If a match is found, NACP, NACV, SIL (and for Version 2, GVA and SDA) values in the track are updated with the values in the report. Upon reception of a state vector update, ASSAP searches for a track of the same type (ADS-B, ADS-R, TIS-B) and with the same 24-bit address as the report. If a match is found, the updated (non-repeated) state component (determined with times of applicability in both the report and track) is sent to a state assembly function along with candidate track information.  

## C.3.1.1.2.1 State Assembler

The state assembly function uses three independent, two state Kalman filters. The filter state consists of position and velocity. The state is tracked in each of three orthogonal Cartesian dimensions (local ENU). The filter takes as input the measured position or velocity, the candidate track state, and the candidate track state covariance. The filter also requires as input the time of the measurement. The filter produces an "assembled" state vector and covariance. Regardless of update type (position or velocity), the state assembler temporarily (i.e., in memory) converts track position from WGS 84 to local ENU coordinates. 

If an altitude measurement is a calibrated height above mean sea level (MSL) from a barometric sensor, it should first be converted to a WGS 84 height above ellipsoid 
(HAE) to reduce skewing of calculations for x/y positions (as altitude propagates to these). The following algorithm may be used for this purpose: 

$$\gamma_{s}(\phi)=\gamma_{e}\,\frac{1+k_{s}\,\sin^{2}\phi}{\sqrt{1-e^{2}\sin^{2}\phi}}$$

$$R(\phi)=\frac{a}{1+f+m_{e}-2\,f\,\sin^{2}\phi}$$

$$h(H,\phi)=\frac{R(\phi)H}{\gamma_{s}(\phi)}$$

$$R(\phi)-H$$
where 
γs = normal gravity on the surface of an ellipsoid of revolution (m s-2) 
R = radius of the Earth (m) 
h = geodetic height [above ellipsoid] (m) 
φ = geodetic latitude (radians) 
H = orthometric height [above MSL] (m) 
γe = equatorial gravity = 9.7803253359 m s-2 
ks = Somigliana's Constant = 1.931853 x 10-3 
e = first eccentricity of the Earth = 8.1819190842622 x 10-2 
a = semi-major axis of the Earth = 6.3781370 x 106 m b = semi-minor axis of the Earth = 6.3567523142 x 106 m f = flattening of the Earth = (a - b)/a mr =gravity ratio =  0.003449787 
Track and ownship positions are then converted from WGS 84 to ECEF 

$$\begin{bmatrix}X\\ Y\\ Z\end{bmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\lambda\\ \dfrac{\sigma}{\chi}+h\end{pmatrix}\cos\phi\cos\lambda\\ \begin{pmatrix}\lambda\\ \dfrac{\sigma(1-e^{2})}{\chi}+h\end{pmatrix}\sin\phi\end{pmatrix}\tag{2}$$

where

$$a=semi\text{-}major\ axis\ =\ 6378137.0\ m$$ $$e^{2}=first\ eccentric\ is\ squared\ =\ 6.69437999\ 014\ x\ 10^{-3}$$ $$\phi=geodetic\ latitude\ (radians)$$ $$\lambda=\text{geodetic\ longitude\ (radians)}$$ $$h=\text{geodetic\ height\ [above ellipsoid]}\,(\text{m})$$ $$\chi=\sqrt{1-e^{2}\sin^{2}\phi}$$
Track ENU position is derived from track and ownship ECEF positions: 

(3) $$\normalsize$$
where 

$\phi=$ _geodetic latitude of ownship (radians)_

$\lambda=$ _geodetic longitude of ownship (radians)_

$(X_{o},Y_{o},Z_{o})=$ _ECEF position of ownship_

$(X_{i},Y_{i},Z_{i})=$ _ECEF position of track_
Track state (in local ENU) is then extrapolated to the time of applicability of the state vector report: 

$$\hat{x}=x+\dot{x}(dt)$$ $$\hat{y}=y+\dot{y}(dt)$$ $$\hat{z}=z+\dot{z}(dt)$$ $$\hat{x}=\dot{x}$$ $$\hat{y}=\dot{y}$$ $$\hat{z}=\dot{z}\tag{4}$$

dt is the time difference between the current report and the last track update. 

The next step in the filtering process is the extrapolation of track covariance matrices (note that only formulas for the x/East dimension are shown, as they are identical for all dimensions excluding subscripts): 

$$\sigma_{\dot{x}}^{2}=\sigma_{x}^{2}+\left(dt\right)^{2}\sigma_{\dot{x}}^{2}+2dt\sigma_{xx}+\frac{Q\left(dt\right)^{4}}{4}$$ $$\sigma_{\dot{x}}^{2}=\sigma_{x}^{2}+\left(dt\right)^{2}Q\tag{5}$$ $$\sigma_{\dot{x}\dot{x}}^{2}=\sigma_{xx}+\left(dt\right)\sigma_{\dot{x}}^{2}+\frac{\left(dt\right)^{3}Q}{2}$$
where Q is the process (plant) noise variance (m/s2).  
 
Greater values of the plant noise variance increase smoothing of tracked states.  There is a positive correlation between velocity smoothing and lag in detection of acceleration. For applications that do not employ turn rate estimation and constant rate turn projection a plant noise variance (Q) value of 6.003 is optimal.  This provides a reasonable balance between smoothing of lower quality traffic states and acceleration lag. For applications that use turn rate estimates and constant rate turn projection, extensive simulation testing has shown that a Q value of 1.441 is optimal.  This enables rapid detection of velocity changes and significantly reduced distributions for turn rate and projection errors.  The sample TSAA implementation in Appendix T of this document is linked to this ASSAP configuration.   
It is important to note that these different ASSAP configurations are not mutually exclusive.  For example, traffic application capability may be used to drive plant noise variance.  If a particular traffic aircraft meets quality requirements for an application that employs turn rate estimation and constant rate turn projection, the lower Q value may be used for that case.  Alternatively, the larger Q value may be more appropriate for traffic aircraft only meeting quality requirements for the most basic applications. 

## C.3.1.1.2.1.1 State Assembly With Position Updates

Equations (1), (2), and (3) are used to convert a position update from WGS 84 to local ENU coordinates.  Measurement horizontal position variances are derived from the NACP value stored in the candidate track (σepu = EPU/1.96); measurement vertical position variance is an assumed value for pressure altitude (e.g., σvepu = 31.11 m = 102 ft) 
or derived from NACP (Version 1) or GVA (Version 2) if geometric altitude is used. It is important to note that this is the method used to link state vector and state uncertainty data.  It is possible for a mode status report to update quality parameters in the track milliseconds before the arrival of the state vector update.  First, the residual (or innovation) variances are calculated with extrapolated track position variances and estimated measurement position variances: 

$$\sigma^{2}_{v_{x}}=\sigma^{2}_{\hat{x}}+\sigma^{2}_{cpu}$$ $$\sigma^{2}_{v_{y}}=\sigma^{2}_{\hat{y}}+\sigma^{2}_{cpu}$$ $$\sigma^{2}_{v_{z}}=\sigma^{2}_{\hat{z}}+\sigma^{2}_{vpqu}\tag{6}$$
where are extrapolated track position variances.

The assembled state is generated as follows: 

$$x_{a}=\hat{x}+k_{0,x}\left(x_{m}-\hat{x}\right)$$ $$y_{a}=\hat{y}+k_{0,y}\left(y_{m}-\hat{y}\right)$$ $$\tilde{z}_{a}=\hat{z}+k_{0,z}\left(z_{m}-\hat{z}\right)$$ $$\hat{x}_{a}=\hat{x}+k_{1,x}\left(x_{m}-\hat{x}\right)\tag{8}$$ $$\hat{y}_{a}=\hat{y}+k_{1,y}\left(y_{m}-\hat{y}\right)$$ $$\hat{z}_{a}=\hat{z}+k_{1,z}\left(z_{m}-\hat{z}\right)$$

, It is important to note that in cases where altitude is measured with a barometric sensor, the error characteristics associated with the original measurement (i.e., assumed pressure altitude uncertainty) are used to filter the calculated relative geometric altitude, as these characteristics have not changed. The assembled state covariance matrices are calculated as follows: 

2 ˆ 0 2 ) 1 ( x x x a k σ σ − =   x x a x x x k ˆ ˆ 0 ) 1 (   σ σ − =   x x x x x a k ˆ ˆ 1 2 ˆ 2    σ σ σ − =   2 ˆ 0 2 ) 1 ( y y y a k σ σ − =   y y a y y y k ˆ ˆ 0 ) 1 (   σ σ − =   y y y y y a k ˆ ˆ 1 2 ˆ 2    σ σ σ − =   $$\begin{array}{l}{{\sigma_{z_{a}}^{2}=(1-k_{0_{z}})\sigma_{\hat{z}}^{2}}}\\ {{\sigma_{z\hat{z}a}=(1-k_{0_{z}})\sigma_{\hat{z}\hat{z}}}}\\ {{\sigma_{\hat{z}_{a}}^{2}=\sigma_{\hat{\bar{z}}}^{2}-k_{1_{z}}\sigma_{\hat{z}\hat{z}}}}\end{array}$$
The assembled state and track state (both in local ENU coordinates) are then sent to the correlation window function. 

## C.3.1.1.2.1.2 State Assembly With Velocity Updates

In the case of a velocity update, the residual (or innovation) variances are calculated with extrapolated track velocity variances and estimated measurement velocity variances 
(based on most recent NACV in the track or an assumed value for pressure altitude rate 
[σvva = 7.78 m/s = 25.5 ft/s]): 

$$\sigma^{2}_{{}_{V_{x}}}=\sigma^{2}_{\frac{z}{x}}+\sigma^{2}_{{}_{W\!u}}$$ $$\sigma^{2}_{{}_{V_{y}}}=\sigma^{2}_{\frac{z}{y}}+\sigma^{2}_{{}_{W\!u}}\tag{10}$$ $$\sigma^{2}_{{}_{V_{z}}}=\sigma^{2}_{\frac{z}{z}}+\sigma^{2}_{{}_{W\!u}}$$
where are extrapolated track velocity variances. 

$$\left(\sigma_{\,\,\,\hat{x}}^{2},\sigma_{\,\,\,\hat{y}}^{2},\sigma_{\,\,\,\hat{z}}^{2}\right)$$
 are estimated measurement velocity variances derived from quality 

$$\left({\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_{h v a}^{2}\,,\,{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_{v v a}^{2}\,\right)$$
parameters or assumed values as described above. 

Gain vectors are then calculated with extrapolated track and residual variances: 

$$k_{{}_{0_{x}}}=\frac{\sigma_{{}_{\hat{x}\hat{x}}}}{\sigma_{{}_{v_{x}}}^{2}}\,,k_{{}_{1_{x}}}=\frac{\sigma_{{}_{\hat{x}}}^{2}}{\sigma_{{}_{v_{x}}}^{2}}$$ $$k_{{}_{0_{y}}}=\frac{\sigma_{{}_{\hat{y}\hat{y}}}}{\sigma_{{}_{v_{y}}}^{2}}\,,k_{{}_{1_{y}}}=\frac{\sigma_{{}_{\hat{y}}}^{2}}{\sigma_{{}_{v_{y}}}^{2}}\tag{11}$$ $$k_{{}_{0_{z}}}=\frac{\sigma_{{}_{\hat{z}\hat{z}}}}{\sigma_{{}_{v_{z}}}^{2}}\,,k_{{}_{1_{z}}}=\frac{\sigma_{{}_{\hat{z}}}^{2}}{\sigma_{{}_{v_{z}}}^{2}}$$
The assembled state is generated as follows: 

$$x_{a}=\hat{x}+k_{0_{x}}\left(\hat{x}_{m}-\hat{\hat{x}}\right)$$ $$y_{a}=\hat{y}+k_{0_{y}}\left(\hat{y}_{m}-\hat{\hat{y}}\right)$$ $$z_{a}=\hat{z}+k_{0_{z}}\left(\hat{z}_{m}-\hat{\hat{z}}\right)$$ $$\hat{x}_{a}=\hat{\hat{x}}+k_{1_{x}}\left(\hat{x}_{m}-\hat{\hat{x}}\right)$$ $$\hat{y}_{a}=\hat{y}+k_{1_{y}}\left(\hat{y}_{m}-\hat{\hat{y}}\right)$$ $$\hat{z}_{a}=\hat{\hat{z}}+k_{1_{z}}\left(\hat{z}_{m}-\hat{\hat{z}}\right)$$

The assembled state and track state (both in local ENU coordinates) are then sent to the correlation window function. 

## C.3.1.1.2.2 Correlation Window

In contrast to report validity checks (described in appendix D) the correlation window is used to compare current and previous estimated positions.  This final check is intended to prevent gross measurement errors, potentially not detected with report validity checks, from propagating to tracks.  The correlation window concept is shown in Figure C-3.  
The correlation window is calculated as follows: 

′ + + = σ dt y x r ) 6 ( 2 ) ( 2 2 epu a a h   (14)  ′ + = σ dt z r ) 6 ( 2 vepu a v 

       ,

            are derived from degrading NACP to NACp - 1, an assumed undegraded 
value for vertical pressure altitude uncertainty (as previously defined), or degrading 
GVA to GVA - 1 (Version 2) if GVA > 1 (otherwise GVA is not degraded). 

 h
r

   is an estimated maximum horizontal distance between the assembled and track 
positions. 

v r is estimated maximum vertical distance between the assembled and track positions. 

Note: these estimates assume linear dynamics (no acceleration). 

Next, differences between assembled and track positions are calculated: 

$$d_{{}_{h}}=\sqrt{\left(x_{{}_{a}}-x\right)^{2}+\left(y_{{}_{a}}-y\right)^{2}}$$ $$d_{{}_{v}}=\left|z_{{}_{a}}-z\right.\tag{15}$$

If

## C.3.1.1.2.3 Turn Rate Estimation

After successful spatial correlation, current and previous track angles are computed with the assembled horizontal velocity and the previous horizontal velocity stored in the track file: 

$$\theta=\tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{\dot{\mathbf{y}}_{a,n-1}}{\dot{x}_{a,n-1}}\right)$$
$$\phi=\tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{\dot{\mathbf{y}}_{a,n}}{\dot{x}_{a,n}}\right)$$

Current and previous track angles are then passed through the following logic that corrects opposite signs produced by the four quadrant arctangent function in some cases: 
if(φ/|φ| ≠ θ/|θ|) 
    if(|φ| > π/2 && |θ| > π/2) 

        if(φ < 0) 
            φ = φ + 2π; 
        else 
            θ = θ + 2π; 
        end 
    end 
end 

The change in track angle and track angle (or turn) rate are computed: 

$$\begin{array}{c}{{\alpha=\phi-\theta}}\\ {{\dot{\alpha}=\frac{\alpha}{\Delta t}}}\end{array}$$

where 

α  = change in track angle (radians) 

  t
∆ = time difference between the current report and the last track update. 

α
 = turn rate (radians/s) 

Note: α
is an estimation as it is produced with velocities output by the Kalman filters 
in this sample tracker.  As previously mentioned, its accuracy and rate of change are heavily dependent on the plant noise variance.   
Lastly, a noise filter is applied to estimated turn rate to reduce jitter caused by normal oscillations in flight paths: 
if(|α
|<db) 
    α
= 0; 
end where db = 1.5 degrees/s = 0.02618 radians/s 

Note: α
in this implementation is used for turn projection in surveillance processing 
(common time track extrapolation) and application processing (TSAA) functions. 
The noise filter threshold value, db, was empirically determined to reduce errors 
in these projections. 

## C.3.1.1.2.4 Track Updates

Upon successful correlation of assembled and track states, the assembled state is converted from local ENU to WGS 84 coordinates.  Ownship position is first converted from WGS 84 to ECEF coordinates using equations (1) and (2). The assembled/filtered target position is then converted from ENU to ECEF coordinates: 
where 

$\phi=$_geodetic latitude of ownship_

$\lambda=$_geodetic longitude of ownship_

$(X_{o},Y_{o},Z_{o})=$_ECEF position of ownship_
Assembled/filtered target position in ECEF is then converted to WGS 84 
coordinates through a 15 step process:

Note: If target altitude measurements are derived from a barometric sensor, filtered/assembled height above ellipsoid is converted back to height above MSL. The inverse of (1) may be used for this purpose: 

$$\gamma_{s}(\phi)=\gamma_{r}\,\frac{1+k_{s}\,\sin^{2}\phi}{\sqrt{1-e^{2}\sin^{2}\phi}}$$ $$R(\phi)=\frac{a}{1+f+m_{r}-2f\,\sin^{2}\phi}$$ $$R(\phi)\left(\frac{\gamma_{s}(\phi)}{\gamma_{r}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}\right)$$ $$H(h,\phi)=\frac{\left(\frac{R(\phi)}{h}+1\right)}{\left(\frac{R(\phi)}{h}+1\right)}\tag{18}$$
where 
γs = normal gravity on the surface of an ellipsoid of revolution (m s-2) 
R = radius of the Earth (m) H = orthometric height [above MSL] (m) h = geodetic height [above ellipsoid] (m) 
φ = geodetic latitude (radians) 
γe = equatorial gravity = 9.7803253359 m s-2 
ks = Somigliana's Constant = 1.931853 x 10-3 
e = first eccentricity of the Earth = 8.1819190842622 x 10-2

The track is then updated by modifying following parameters: 

a. Track time of applicability - updated with the report time of applicability (as 
measured internally by the system). 
b. State times of applicability - updated with position and velocity times of applicability 
in the state vector report. 
c. Position - updated with assembled geodetic latitude, geodetic longitude, geodetic

## C.3.1.2 Track Generation And Maintenance (Basic Uat Implementation)

Figure C-4 contains a block diagram depicting the Track Generation and Maintenance function for a basic UAT implementation of ASSAP.  A more advanced implementation that includes a tracker, turn rate estimation, and constant rate turn projection is discussed in section C.3.1.3. 

 

## C.3.1.2.1 Track Generation (Basic Uat Implementation)

Upon reception of a traffic report, ASSAP searches for a track of the same type with a matching 24-bit address. If no match is found, ASSAP generates a new track containing the following parameters: 

a.
System time (track time of applicability)
b.
Track type (ADS-B, ADS-R, TIS-B)
c.
24-bit address
d.
Position (latitude, longitude, altitude)

If quality parameters are not included in the first received traffic report, they are
initially set to the minimum values allowed by the EVAcq and AIRB applications or set to 1 (excluding SIL) to facilitate a future report to track correlation process that involves degradation of some parameters and to prevent immediate invalidation of
the track for application processing. Reception of these parameters in subsequent traffic reports will overwrite these data.
2.
Parameters for TIS-B tracks only; for use in a TIS-B to TIS-B correlation function described in section C.3.2.  The previous state matrix is initialized with the first reported position and corresponding time then grows to 3 rows with subsequent updates such that it always contains the three most recent positions and corresponding times.

## C.3.1.2.2 Track Maintenance (Basic Uat Implementation)

Upon reception of a target report, ASSAP searches for a track of the same type with a matching 24-bit address. If a match is found, the report and candidate track states are converted from WGS 84 to local ENU coordinates with equations (1), (2), and (3).  The original report state (in WGS 84 coordinates) is held in memory.  The candidate track and report states in local ENU coordinates are then transferred to a correlation window function identical to that in the 1090ES implementation, (14) and (15), with the exception that reported state is substituted for assembled state.  If spatial correlation succeeds, impending TIS-B track updates are subject to additional processing described in section C.3.2.  The track is updated by modifying the following parameters: 

a.
Track time of applicability - updated with the report time of applicability
b.
Position - updated with reported WGS 84 coordinates (held in memory)
c.
Velocity - updated with reported velocity components
d.
Quality parameters (NACP, NACV, SIL, GVA & SDA if appropriate) - updated with
reported values (if present)
e.
Previous state matrix (TIS-B tracks only) - updated with reported position and report
time of applicability.  If this matrix contains less than three rows (previous states), previous row numbers increase by one (e.g., row 1 becomes row 2) and the new state information is added to the first row.  If the matrix contains three rows, the third row is deleted, the first and second rows become the second and third rows (respectively), and the new state information is added to the first row.

## C.3.1.3 Track Generation And Maintenance (Advanced Uat Implementation)

A more advanced UAT implementation has been developed for applications that employ turn rate estimation and constant rate turn projection (e.g., TSAA sample algorithms in Appendix T).  The architecture for this implementation is nearly identical to that shown in Figure C-4 but includes: 

a.
A modified track generation function
b.
A state estimation (tracker) subfunction between functions for WGS 84 to local ENU
coordinate conversion and correlation window computation.
c.
A modified track update function
During generation of a new track file, a field for estimated turn rate is initialized and set to a null value.  Covariance matrices are initialized as described in C.3.1.1.1. Upon a report-to-track address match and coordinate conversion, report and track states in local ENU coordinates (relative to ownship) and track covariance matrices are fed into a state assembly function nearly identical to the 1090ES function in C.3.1.1.2.1.  Track state and covariance matrices are extrapolated to the time of applicability of the report with (4) and (5).  A plant noise variance (Q) value of 1.441 is used to enable rapid detection of velocity changes and reduce turn rate and projection errors. Next, the position component of the reported full state vector is used to produce assembled state and covariance matrices with (6)-(9).  Differing from the 1090ES 
implementation, the assembled state and covariance matrices are then fed into (10)-(13) 
producing modified assembled state and covariance matrices based on the velocity component of the reported full state vector.  The final assembled state and track state (both in local ENU coordinates) are then sent to the correlation window function.   
Upon successful correlation the assembled state is converted from local ENU to WGS 
84 coordinates with (1), (2), and (16)-(18).  The track is then updated as described in the previous section but with derived state components replacing measurements, updated covariance matrices, and estimated turn rate per C.3.1.1.2.3. 

The UAT tracker produces a position and velocity based assembled state in one processing cycle at some time t.  In contrast, the 1090ES implementation accomplishes this in two processing cycles: one initiated by a position update at some time t and one initiated subsequently by a velocity update at time t + Δt. 

## C.3.1.4 Track Generation And Maintenance (Vdl4 Implementation)

Figure C-5 contains a block diagram depicting the Track Generation and Maintenance function for the VDL4 implementation of ASSAP. This function is similar to the UAT equivalent with exceptions for configurations that receive separate reports for state vector and quality parameters (assumed to represent a typical installation).  The phrases "state vector" and "mode status" are used to describe VDL4 synchronization bursts to aid comparison with other implementations. The implementation presented in this appendix does not address ADS-R and TIS-B processing. 

## C.3.1.4.1 Track Generation (Vdl4 Implementations)

Upon reception of a state vector report, ASSAP searches for a track with a matching 24- bit address. If no match is found, ASSAP generates a new track containing the following parameters: 

a. 
1System time (track time of applicability) 
b. 24-bit address 
c. Position (latitude, longitude, altitude) 
d. 
2Velocity (East/West velocity, North/South velocity, altitude rate) 
e. NIC f. 
3 NACP = 5 
g. 
3 NACV = 1 
h. 
3SIL = 0 
1. This parameter may be derived from the report latency parameter (data age) 
encoded in the fixed part of the synchronization burst. 
2. This is the ground speed (gs) parameter found either in the basic variable part of the 
synchronization burst or within a variety of other variable parts including (but not limited to) high dynamic, full position and high resolution. 
3. Track quality parameters are initially set to the minimum values allowed by the 
EVAcq and AIRB applications (excluding SIL) to facilitate a future report to track correlation process that involves degradation of some parameters and to prevent 
immediate invalidation of the track for application processing. Reception of these parameters in subsequent traffic reports (appropriate synchronization bursts) will overwrite these data. 

## C.3.1.4.2 Track Maintenance (Vdl4 Implementation)

Upon reception of a mode status report (appropriate synchronization burst), ASSAP 
searches for a track with the same 24-bit address as the report. If a match is found, NACP, NACV, and SIL values in the track are updated with the values in the report. 

Upon reception of a state vector report, ASSAP searches for a track with a matching 24-
bit address. If a match is found, the report and candidate track states are converted from WGS 84 to local ENU coordinates with equations (1), (2), and (3).  The original report state (in WGS 84 coordinates) is held in memory.  The candidate track and report states in local ENU coordinates are then transferred to a correlation window function identical to that in the 1090ES implementation, (14) and (15), with the exception that reported state is substituted for assembled state.  If spatial correlation succeeds, the track is updated by modifying following parameters: 

a.
Track time of applicability - updated with the report time of applicability
b.
Position - updated with reported coordinates (held in memory)
c.
Velocity - updated with reported velocity components
d.
NIC - updated with NIC in the state vector report (if present)

## C.3.1.5 Ownship Tracking

An ownship tracking function has been developed for applications that employ turn rate estimation and constant rate turn projection (e.g., the TSAA sample implementation in Appendix T).  This enables generation of curved projections for ownship and traffic aircraft.  In contrast to traffic tracking functions, ownship tracking is a hybrid method that smoothes measured velocities but accepts measured positions. The ownship track is generated with the same technique as a basic UAT track, per. C.3.1.2.1, but excluding surveillance source type, and traffic-specific correlation parameters.  Similarly to advanced UAT track generation, a field for estimated turn rate is initialized and set to a null value and covariance matrices are initialized as described in C.3.1.1.1.  Differing from traffic tracks, fields for x (East), y (North), and z (Up) positions are generated and each set to zero.  This creates a record of ownship position at the origin of the local ENU coordinate system used to track traffic aircraft. 

Upon an ownship surveillance data update, occurring at 1 Hz in this sample implementation, the track and update velocities (East/West velocity, North/South velocity, and vertical rate) and track covariance matrices are fed into the state assembly function in C.3.1.1.2.1.  Track position in local ENU coordinates is not an input as extrapolation would incorrectly produce nonzero values.  Track velocity and full covariance matrices (including position-based uncertainties) are estimated to the time of applicability of the update with (4) and (5).  A plant noise variance (Q) value of 1.441 is used to enable rapid detection of velocity changes and reduce turn rate and projection errors. 

Position-based state assembly computations in (6)-(9) are not called.  The estimated track velocity, estimated full covariance matrices, and update velocity are then fed into (10)-
(13).  Position derivations are not called.  Smoothed velocity components and the modified covariance matrices are used to update the respective fields in the ownship track file; estimated turn rate is calculated per C.3.1.1.2.3.  Note that as ENU position was not modified it remains constant at (0, 0, 0).  The position measurement in the update, in WG484 coordinates, and data quality parameters replace previous values in the track file. The 1 Hz ownship track updates trigger best source selection and common time track extrapolation functions described in subsequent sections. 

## C.3.2 Intra-Source Tis-B To Tis-B Correlation (1090Es And Uat Implementations)

The Intra-Source TIS-B to TIS-B correlation function detects TIS-B track identifier changes across service volume boundaries and correlates coexisting tracks for a single aircraft to prevent display shadowing.  This function is event-driven by TIS-B track updates. Spatial correlation is necessary for this case as address matching is not possible per the problem definition.  Additionally, subsequently described "multiple hit" spatial correlation techniques are insufficient for this case as three en route TIS-B track updates may require 24 seconds; this defeats the purpose of the function - removal of track shadows that persist for up to 25 seconds (maximum allowed track data age). The algorithms presented in this section correlate a newly formed TIS-B track with an older existing track in one "hit", between updates to the traffic state file (input to CDTI), ensuring that spatial and temporal discontinuities are minimized for the flight crew. 

Upon generation of a TIS-B track, the reported state (1090ES or UAT) is converted from WGS 84 to local ENU coordinates with equations (1), (2), and (3).  If ownship and the newly formed TIS-B track both report pressure altitudes, relative pressure altitude is used in place of "z" derived from (3).  A simple technique to derive relative pressure altitude is as follows: 

$$z=H_{{}_{t}}-H_{{}_{o}}\tag{19}$$
where 
)
,
(
o t H
H
= track and ownship pressure altitudes (respectively). 

TIS-B track velocity vector components are temporarily (e.g., in memory) reversed; $(\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z})=$ -$(\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z})$.

ASSAP searches the track file database for a different active TIS-B track that has not been previously labeled as the first (preceding) TIS-B track in a correlated pair (e.g., field track(i).ID_change in the candidate track is not 1) and contains a history of the three most recent WGS 84 positions and corresponding times stored in a matrix (e.g., *track(i).previous_states*). These candidate track criteria ensure that, in cases of more than two tracks per aircraft (e.g., three tracks), the more recent (i.e., third and second) tracks are compared to maintain proper suppression of shadows (i.e., the third track is not compared to the first track). If a candidate TIS-B track meeting these criteria is found, the three most recent assembled or reported positions (1090ES or UAT) are converted from WGS 84 to local ENU coordinates as previously described. 

Differences between time of applicability (e.g., internal system time) for the newly formed track and times of applicability for the three most recent positions in the candidate track are computed.  The newly formed track position in ENU coordinates is backward extrapolated for each time difference via reversed velocity vector components, e.g., using (4). For each pair of corresponding backward extrapolated and candidate track recent positions, horizontal and vertical ranges are computed: 

$$hr=\sqrt{\left(\hat{x}-x\right)^{2}+\left(\hat{y}-y\right)^{2}}\tag{20}$$ $$yr=\left|\hat{z}-z\right.$$
where 
)
ˆ
,
ˆ
,
ˆ
(
z y x
= ENU coordinates of backward extrapolated position for newly generated TIS-B 
track. 

)
,
,
(
z y x
= ENU coordinates of recent position for candidate TIS-B track. 

Horizontal and vertical ranges are then compared to correlation thresholds, defined as follows: 
=
threshold hr
 275 meters ≈ 900 feet 
=
threshold vr
 50 meters ≈ 160 feet where The horizontal range threshold (hrthreshold) and  vertical range threshold (vrthreshold) 
have been selected through analysis of dozens of operational cases of TIS-B track ID changes across service volume boundaries. 

If hr ≤ hr*threshold*  and  vr ≤ vr*threshold* for all three pairs of newly formed track backward extrapolated position and candidate track recent position, the newly generated track is determined to represent the same aircraft as the candidate track.  Fields in the candidate track are modified as follows: *track(i).ID_change* = 1, *track(i).correlated_TISB_index* = index of newly formed track (e.g., j), *track(i).TISB_ID_change_time* = time of applicability for the newly formed track. It is important to note that the aforementioned fields are not modified in the newly formed track to aid detection of miscorrelation (described in subsequent text) and block (via candidate track criteria) potential future correlation of a third track (second ID change) with the first track, forcing a comparison between the third and second tracks (or the nth and nth - 1 tracks). 

Additionally, to account for the possibility of another ID change within a short period of time (as observed in operational data), the matrix for storage of three most current states (latitudes, longitudes, altitudes, and corresponding times) in the newly generated track is fully populated by appending the two most recent states from the correlated track (e.g., track(j).previous_states= 
[track(j).previous_states; 
track(i).previous_states(1); 
track(i).previous_states(2)] where *track(j).previous_states* is the first reported position and time for the new track,  *track(i).previous_states(1)* is the most recent position and time in the correlated track, and *track(i).previous_states(2)* is the second most recent position and time in the correlated track). 

Upon successful correlation, the candidate track will be suppressed from the CDTI and this function is exited due to the assumption of monogamous correlation and to maximize processor efficiency.  The algorithms presented thus far are capable of processing an indefinite number of TIS-B track ID changes per aircraft subject to the following conditions: all track IDs for a single aircraft are unique or for cases involving identical IDs (e.g., change from 1 to 2 to 1), the period between reports containing identical IDs is greater than 25 seconds (maximum allowed data age). A mitigation algorithm has been developed for report latency differential, miscorrelation, and a potential case where TIS-B track ID changes then reverts while the older track is still active (e.g., aircraft exits then renters a service volume in less than 25 seconds and the TIS-B system assigns the original ID).  This mechanism is called within the track generation and maintenance function between correlation of a new report with an existing track and the track update.  The logical location for description of this algorithm is this section, as multiple track generation and maintenance sections exist for various ASSAP implementations. Upon correlation of an assembled or reported state with an existing TIS-B track (i.e., impending track update), if the track has previously been correlated with another TIS-B 
track (*track(i).ID_change* = 1) and 3 seconds or more has passed since the time of TIS-B 
to TIS-B correlation (e.g., report time of applicability - *track(i).TISB_ID_change_time*) ≥ 
3 seconds, the *ID_change* field in the track is reset to 0 (*track(i).ID_change* = 0).  If the field *track(i).correlated_TISB_index* is not null (i.e., this field references the index of another track), the *ID_change* field in the referenced track is set to 1 
(*track(track(i).correlated_TISB_index).ID_change* = 1) and the *TISB_ID_change_time* 
field in the referenced track is set as the report time of applicability (*track(track(i).correlated_TISB_index).TISB_ID_change_time* 
= 
report time of applicability). This algorithm serves multiple purposes.  First, it protects against incorrect decorrelation due to differences in report latencies.  As observed in operational data, it is possible for the last report for an older track to appear shortly after the first report for a new track.  If the older track in a correlated pair is to update less than 3 seconds after the correlation time (assumed maximum difference in report latencies), correlation and suppression status remains unchanged and the older track simply updates.  
If an update to the older track in a correlated pair is imminent and the difference between report time of applicability and correlation time is greater than or equal to 3 seconds, it is assumed that one of two events has occurred: 

a. The aircraft has exited and reentered a service volume and the TIS-B system has 
reassigned the original ID. 
b. The TIS-B track pair is a miscorrelation. 
The algorithm above offers a solution for the first case (reassignment of original ID) by reversing the "*ID_change*" field in the older track to a value of 0, unsuppressing the track and allowing it to be forwarded to the CDTI.  Additionally, since the field "*correlated_TISB_index"* in the older track is not null (referencing another track), the 
"*ID_change*" field in the newer track in the correlated pair is set to 1 (suppressing the newer track from the CDTI) and the *TISB_ID_change_time* field in the newer track is set to the time of applicability of the report corresponding to the older track.  
The second case (miscorrelation) is detected upon a subsequent call to this mechanism, if the newer track in a correlated pair is to update after the older track has already updated not due to differences in report latencies as described above  In this case, when an update to the newer track is eminent and also not due to differences in report latencies, the ID_change field in the newer track has been set to 1 during a previous call (for the older track update) and these criteria in the algorithm above are satisfied.  However, the newer track in the correlated pair does have a null value in the *correlated_TISB_index* field, thus the only action taken is unsuppression of the newer track (*ID_change* field set to 0). 

The miscorrelation detection process and appropriate decorrelation allows both TIS-B 
tracks to be sent to the CDTI and become candidates for correlation with newly generated tracks.  Any potential future correlations that may occur are subject to any of the aforementioned processes. 

## C.3.3 Inter-Source Correlation

The Inter-Source Correlation function detects when an aircraft is tracked by multiple surveillance sources and prevents shadowing on the CDTI. Inter-Source Correlation (in this sample implementation) consists of the following subfunctions: 

a.
Correlation between an ownship track and TIS-B tracks
b.
Correlation between TCAS tracks and active ADS-B, ADS-R, and TIS-B tracks
c.
Correlation between active ADS-B/ADS-R and TIS-B tracks

## C.3.3.1 Ownship Shadow Detection

The Ownship Shadow Detection subfunction is event-driven by TIS-B track updates. Figure C-6 contains a block diagram depicting the Ownship Shadow Detection function.  

1. If ownship is on the surface, the track must have a matching ICAO address to be a 
shadow; if airborne, an ICAO address is not needed, but must match if present. 
2. A validity flag set in the track file (i.e., 1 = valid, 0 = invalid) to determine whether 
or not a track has previously failed shadow detection. 
3. Ownship must be airborne for a velocity test. 
4. Roaming pattern (i.e., queue), limited to 6 bits. 
5. The shadow tag is both a local (i.e., in the track file) and global (i.e., in a global 
variable) flag used to identify the TIS-B track determined to be an ownship shadow.  
In the rare event that one TIS-B track has been flagged as the shadow and additional 
shadow track(s) are detected, the already-designated ownship shadow flag is 
maintained, unless the newly detected shadow has an ICAO address match with the 
ownship address. In this case, the ICAO address match takes precedence, and the corresponding TIS-B track is labeled as the ownship shadow. 
Upon notification of a TIS-B track update, an ICAO address test is first performed.  If the ownship is on the surface, the track must have a matching ICAO address to be an ownship shadow.  This address matching technique is used for the surface due to the close proximity of aircraft and low (or zero) velocities often encountered, as correlation checks based solely on position and velocity may pose a significant risk of miscorrelation.  If ownship is airborne, the ICAO address is not a necessity, but must have a matching address if present for the TIS-B track to be an ownship shadow. 

Following the ICAO address test, the current validity of the track (for ownship shadow detection) is determined by reading a flag in the track file of interest (e.g., "shadow_valid" = 0 or 1); if "shadow_valid" = 0, the track has previously been determined not to be an ownship shadow (due to disparities in position with ownship), and further examination of the track is not performed. 

If the TIS-B track file is valid for shadow detection, the latest assembled or reported state (1090ES, UAT respectively) is converted from WGS 84 to local ENU coordinates with equations (1), (2), and (3).  If ownship and the track of interest both report pressure altitudes, relative pressure altitude is used in place of "z" derived from (3).  
Formula (19) is used to derive relative pressure altitude. Horizontal and vertical ranges between ownship and the TIS-B track are then calculated as follows: 

$$hr=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\tag{21}$$

$yr=\left|z\right.$
where 

) , , ( z y x = ENU coordinates of TIS-B track. 
Horizontal and vertical ranges are then compared to validity thresholds, defined as follows: 
=
threshold hr
 1852 meters = 1 NM 
=
threshold vr
 152.4 meters = 500 feet where The horizontal range threshold (hrthreshold) is derived from the minimum position accuracy requirements for any ASSAP application and assumes a worst case in which estimated ownship position is 926 meters away from the true position and a TIS-B position for ownship is 926 meters away from the true position (in the opposite direction of estimated ownship position).  The vertical range threshold 
(vrthreshold) has been selected through engineering judgment, under the assumption that pressure altitude measurements for the same aircraft  should not vary by more than 500 feet within a small timeframe . 

If hr > hrthreshold  or  vr > vr*threshold* , the TIS-B track is determined not to be a shadow of ownship and invalidated from future processing by this function 
(e.g., track(i).shadow_tag = 0, *track(i).shadow_valid* = 0).   
If hr ≤ hr*threshold*  and  vr ≤ vr*threshold* and the TIS-B track has an ICAO address, then the TIS-B track must have the same ICAO address as ownship (since the address match test has been passed), and be within close horizontal and vertical proximity.  In this case, the TIS-B track is declared locally and globally to be an ownship shadow (e.g., track(i).shadow_tag = 1, track address and index written into a variable "*ownship_shadow*") and processing is complete.  The track will be suppressed from the CDTI. 

The remaining case is the condition where hr ≤ hr*threshold*  and  vr ≤ vr*threshold* and the TIS-B 
track does not have an ICAO address (note that ownship must be airborne).  In this case, a correlation window is computed using the position accuracies of the (airborne) ownship and TIS-B tracks.  The horizontal correlation window for ownship shadow detection is based on the hypothesis that circles (defined by NACP /EPU) surrounding estimated ownship and TIS-B track positions should overlap if the two sources represent the same aircraft (pictured in Figure C-7). 

 
Similarly, the vertical correlation window for ownship shadow detection is based on the hypothesis that vertical ranges (defined by 95% values for VEPU, GVA, or an assumed value for pressure altitude uncertainty, e.g., 60.98 m) centered on estimated ownship and TIS-B track altitudes should overlap if the two sources represent the same aircraft 
(pictured in Figure C-8). 

If the horizontal position uncertainty circles overlap (i.e., hr ≤ EPUTIS-B + EPU*ownship*), horizontal spatial correlation succeeds.  If the vertical position uncertainty ranges overlap 
(e.g., some  zi ∈ [z - VEPUTIS-B , z + VEPU*TIS-B*] and zi ∈[-VEPUownship ,VEPUownship]), 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
vertical spatial correlation succeeds.  If both horizontal and vertical correlation succeed, spatial correlation occurs; otherwise, spatial correlation fails. 

Upon failed spatial correlation, a "0" is added to the end of a 6-bit FIFO queue stored in the TIS-B track file (e.g., *track(i).shadow_pattern*), removing any value that may exist in the first index if the queue is full.  Shadow patterns are initialized when a TIS-B track is generated and grow to a maximum of six bits.  For example, if a newly generated TIS-B 
track fails spatial correlation (for shadow detection) upon track initiation and five subsequent updates, the shadow detection pattern in the track file will transition as follows: [0], [00],…,[000000]. Upon successful spatial correlation with a valid track, a final correlation test is performed.  ASSAP performs a speed comparison between (airborne) ownship and the TIS-B track of interest (where speed refers to along-track velocity, or horizontal velocity magnitude).  If the difference in speed is less than an adaptable threshold (sthreshold = 
30.6122 m/s = 59.5054 knots), full correlation succeeds and a "1" is added to the shadow detection pattern in the track file.  Otherwise full correlation fails and a "0" is added to the end of the pattern.  Upon three consecutive full correlations (e.g., track(i).shadow_pattern = [111], or track(i).shadow_pattern = [100111]) the TIS-B 
track is determined to be a shadow of ownship and the track file is marked appropriately (e.g.,  *track(i).shadow_tag = 1*).  A shadow tag (of 1) is stripped from a track (set back to 
0) after three consecutive detection failures (spatial correlation failures or full correlation failures); note that in this case, the track is still valid for future shadow detection processing.  However, upon six consecutive detection failures (track(i).shadow_pattern = 
[000000]), the track is determined not to be a shadow of ownship and invalidated from future processing by this function (e.g., *track(i).shadow_tag* = 0, *track(i).shadow_valid* = 0).  

## C.3.3.1.1 Update Of The Ownship Shadow Tag

When a track file has been marked as a shadow (e.g., *track(i).shadow_tag = 1*), the 24-bit address and track index (e.g., "i", index in the track file database) are normally recorded in the global variable, *ownship_shadow* which is used to suppress the track from the CDTI display.  However, in the unlikely event that a different track has already been labeled as an ownship shadow, the existing label is maintained to maximize the stability of the CDTI display (i.e., the label is not updated with the most recently detected shadow track). The shadow detection process continues despite the setting of the shadow tag, so that the correlation pattern and tags are maintained for all TIS-B tracks in the event that the existing shadow tag is removed.  If this maintenance were not performed, then a correlation might be erroneously obtained for a track which should have been labeled as invalid due to a past disparity between the track and ownship position. 

## C.3.3.2 Tcas To Ads-B/Ads-R/Tis-B Correlation

The TCAS to ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B correlation subfunction is event-driven by the reception of TCAS reports (or more precisely, initiated or updated TCAS tracks sent through the TCAS data bus). ASSAP attempts to correlate TCAS tracks with active ADS- B, ADS-R, and (in this sample implementation) TIS-B tracks. Uncorrelated TCAS tracks and TCAS tracks that represent the best surveillance source for a particular target are forwarded to a traffic state file generator that is used to populate the  CDTI traffic display. If Mode S addresses are available to ASSAP over the TCAS data bus (as would likely be the case in an integrated system, i.e., receiver/processor), then - since all Mode S addresses are also ICAO addresses - a check for an ICAO address match is performed.  
With such an address match, only an additional range/altitude check is performed before a full correlation is declared. If Mode S addresses are not available to ASSAP or an address match is not obtained, then a more complex correlation window technique is used. Figure C-9 contains a block diagram depicting the TCAS to ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B 
correlation function. 

 

Note: For non-Mode S Address TCAS tracks (or Mode S TCAS tracks that yield no 
address match), a TCAS correlation tag is added to a track file (e.g., ADS-R) 
after repeated (three) spatial correlations with a "complex" window. For Mode S TCAS tracks, a TCAS correlation tag is added to a track file (e.g., ADS-B) when Mode S/ICAO address matching and spatial correlation with a "simple" window succeed. 
It is important to note that a single architecture for this function is applicable to UAT, VDL4 and 1090ES ASSAP implementations. In all cases there will be track files containing ICAO address identifiers. 

Regardless of Mode S address availability, upon initiation or update of a TCAS track, ASSAP converts TCAS position (range, bearing, altitude) to local ENU coordinates: 

$$z=z_{{}_{\rm conv}}-z_{{}_{\rm conv}}$$ $$r_{{}_{\rm p}}=\sqrt{r^{2}-z^{2}}$$ $$\alpha=\theta-\phi$$ $$x=r_{{}_{\rm p}}\,\cos\alpha$$ $$y=r_{{}_{\rm p}}\,\sin\alpha\tag{22}$$

Next, ASSAP determines the TCAS target type (Mode S or non-Mode S Address) using the presence or absence of a 24-bit address. In the absence of a 24-bit address, ASSAP determines that the TCAS track is a non-Mode S Address target and uses the track number (intruder number [i:n] per ARINC 735B) as the track identifier. Target type then dictates which processing is applied. 

## C.3.3.2.1 Mode S Tcas Track Processing

ASSAP searches the track file database for an ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track which has the same Mode S/ICAO address as the TCAS track and has not been previously labeled as invalid for correlation (e.g., *track(i).TCAS_IDs(j)= current TCAS track ID* and track(i).TCAS_correlation_status(j) has not been set equal to -1). As ASSAP scans the track file database, if an ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track has an ICAO address which does not match that of the TCAS track (e.g., *track(i).address  ≠ current TCAS track ID*), the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B  track is invalidated from future comparisons with this particular TCAS 
track 
(e.g., track(i).TCAS_IDs(j)= 
current TCAS 
track ID 
and track(i).TCAS_correlation_status(j) = -1). If a Mode S address match is obtained with an ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track that is valid for correlation, the candidate ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track position is converted to local ENU coordinates with equations (1), (2), and (3).  Relative geometric altitude ('z') is replaced with relative pressure altitude using (19).  The track ENU position is then predicted to the time of applicability of the TCAS track with equation (4). The TCAS correlation window for tracks with a Mode S address match consists of a simple range and altitude comparison:

If dr ≤ r*threshold* and dz ≤ z*threshold* , the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track is tagged as having a correlated TCAS target (e.g., *track(i).TCAS_correlation_tag = 1*) , the correlation status in the track file is modified (*track(i).TCAS_correlation_status(j) = 1*), and a six bit FIFO 
queue detection pattern is updated (e.g., *track(i).TCAS_correlation_patterns(j) = [1]*) 
upon the first comparison and successful correlation.  Once spatial correlation occurs, the inter-source correlation function will no longer send the TCAS track to the traffic state file generator (and on to the CDTI), unless one of the two following conditions occurs: 

a.
Decorrelation occurs upon six consecutive spatial correlation failures
(e.g., 
track(i).TCAS_correlation_patterns(j) 
= 
[000000] 
and
track(i).TCAS_correlation_status(j) = -1).
b.
TCAS is determined to be the best surveillance source for the target when the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track quality parameters fall below the minimum acceptable values for the EVAcq and AIRB applications.  In this case, a field in the track file (e.g., *track(i).suppress*) is set so that the traffic state file generator
does not forward the track to the CDTI.
If a matching Mode S address cannot be found in the track file database, ASSAP attempts to correlate the Mode S TCAS track with non-Mode S address targets using the technique described in the next subsection.  

## C.3.3.2.2 Non-Mode S Address (Or Unmatched Mode S Address) Tcas Track Processing

For all ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B tracks in the track file database that have not been previously labeled as invalid for correlation with the TCAS track (e.g., track(i).TCAS_IDs(j)= current TCAS track ID and *track(i).TCAS_correlation_status(j)* 
has not been set equal to -1), track position is converted to local ENU coordinates with equations (1), (2), and (3).  Relative geometric altitude ('z') is replaced with relative pressure altitude using (19).  The track ENU position is then predicted to the time of applicability of the TCAS track with equation (4).  Each ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track is compared to the TCAS track with a dynamic correlation window that changes size to account for a number of error sources. The dynamic window consists of horizontal (core and buffer) and vertical components. The horizontal window core (depicted in Figure C-11) is a trapezoid based on potential range and bearing error in the TCAS track and error introduced through the calculation of two-dimensional range. 

The horizontal core of the dynamic TCAS window is defined as follows:

Note: In the case where address matching is not possible, it is important to note that the word optimal does not imply perfection. Large length and width scalars (and hence a large window) will increase the probability of correlation; however, they also increase the potential for miscorrelation. Therefore the window should be large enough to achieve a high correlation rate, but small enough to minimize the probability of miscorrelation. The values listed in Table C-6 produced a very high association rate with operational flight test data involving few aircraft and stressful dynamics, yet these values also produced no miscorrelations with synthesized (dense) terminal traffic data. 

It is extremely important to note that a special case exists in which the dynamic TCAS window will warp if a small algorithm change is not performed.  If the TCAS target is within close proximity of ownship (e.g., 1 NM or less), the origin in the ENU coordinate frame (ownship position) is within the TCAS window - this causes significant warping that will negatively impact performance.  This case can be detected when rxy *– L/2 < 0*.  If this case is detected, the core points p1 and p4 are both set to (0,0) and the width scalar sb is slightly increased to 1.625, resulting in a triangular core. 

The horizontal window's buffer (depicted in Figure C-13) is a 12-sided polygon based on track horizontal position error and prediction error introduced when tracks are extrapolated to the TOA of the TCAS report.  The buffer is an estimate of the shape that would be formed when a circle representing track position uncertainty is moved completely around the core, with the center of the circle remaining on the border of the trapezoid. Buffer widths can change dramatically depending on the track being examined. 

For tracks with poor NACP values (e.g., 5), the buffer will be large due to potential position error. If the time difference between the TCAS update and track update is significant (e.g., 10 seconds), the buffer will be large due to potential prediction error. 

First, the width of the buffer is defined as follows: 

$$w=3\sigma_{{}_{\rm qw}}+v(dt)\tag{25}$$
where epu
σ

 = is standard deviation of track position uncertainty (derived from NACP). 
v
= track speed (along-track horizontal velocity). 
dt
= time difference between the TCAS track TOA and track file TOA. 
The buffer (and hence the horizontal window) is then defined by rotating radii (equal to the buffer width) about the points that make up the core:

) falls within the horizontal window

ˆ ) falls within the range *[z - h, z + h]*, where z is previously computed TCAS relative altitude, spatial correlation succeeds.  
Otherwise, spatial correlation fails. 

The data storage and success/failure criteria for full TCAS correlation are very similar to that used for the ownship shadow detection described previously.  Upon a failed TCAS correlation window test, a "0" is added to the end of a 6-bit FIFO queue stored in the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track file (e.g., *track(i).TCAS_correlation_patterns(j)*), removing any value that may exist in the first index if the queue is full.  TCAS correlation patterns are initialized when an ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track is generated and grow to a maximum of six bits.  For example, if a recently generated ith ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track failed the correlation window test upon initiation of the jth TCAS track and five subsequent updates, the correlation pattern *track(i).TCAS_correlation_patterns(j)* in the appropriate track file would transition as follows: [0], [00],…,[000000]. 

If the TCAS correlation window succeeds, a "1" is added to the appropriate correlation pattern in the track file.  Upon three consecutive full correlations (e.g., track(i).TCAS_correlation_patterns(j) = [111] or track(i).TCAS_correlation_patterns(j) 
= [100111]) the TCAS track is determined to be fully correlated with the ADS-B/ADS-
R/TIS-B track if the following conditions are met: 

a. The ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track is not already fully correlated with another 
TCAS track (reflected in correlation status and TCAS ID fields in the track file). 
b. The TCAS track is not already fully correlated with a different ADS-B/ADS-
R/TIS-B track (reflected in correlation status and TCAS ID fields in a different track file). 
If these conditions are met, the track file is marked appropriately (e.g., track(i).TCAS_correlation_status(j) 
= 
1, track(i).TCAS_correlation_tag 
= 
1).  
Otherwise, only the correlation pattern is updated.  This "monogamous correlation" approach ensures that rampant miscorrelations are not transferred to the CDTI.  If a TCAS track is erroneously correlated with the incorrect ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track file, 
"tentative decorrelation" must occur before full correlation with a different track file can be obtained. Tentative decorrelation occurs after three consecutive correlation window failures (e.g., track(i).TCAS_correlation_patterns(j) = [111000], track(i).TCAS_correlation_status(j) 
= 0) *.*  Note that in this case, the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track is still valid for future correlation with this TCAS track, however, it is also valid for correlation attempts with other TCAS tracks.  However, upon six consecutive correlation window failures (track(i). TCAS_correlation_patterns(j) = [000000]), the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track is invalidated from future comparisons with this TCAS 
track 
(e.g., track(i).TCAS_correlation_status(j) = -1). Once full correlation occurs, the inter-source correlation function will no longer send the TCAS track to the traffic state file generator (and on to the CDTI), unless one of the following conditions occurs: 

a. Tentative decorrelation occurs (e.g., track(i).TCAS_correlation_patterns(j) = 
[111000] and *track(i).TCAS_correlation_status(j) = 0*).  Note that this is 
typically a precursor to full decorrelation. 
b. TCAS is determined to be the best surveillance source for the target when the 
ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track quality parameters fall below the minimum 
acceptable values for the EVAcq and AIRB applications.  In this case, a field in the track file (e.g., *track(i).suppress*) is set so that the traffic state file generator 
does not forward the track to the CDTI. 

## C.3.3.3 Tis-B To Ads-B/Ads-R Correlation

The TIS-B to ADS-B/ADS-R correlation subfunction is event-driven by the reception of TIS-B reports.  ASSAP attempts to correlate TIS-B tracks with active ADS-B and ADS- R tracks.  Uncorrelated TIS-B tracks and TIS-B tracks that represent the best surveillance source for a particular target are forwarded to a traffic state file generator that sends target information to the CDTI. 

If the TIS-B track has an ICAO address, address matching plays a key role in TIS-B to ADS-B/ADS-R correlation; with an address match, only one spatial correlation is required before a full correlation is declared.  If the TIS-B track does not have an ICAO 
address (i.e., it was assigned by the TIS-B service provider), the correlation technique for non-Mode S address targets (described below) must be used to process all ADS-B/ADS-
R tracks. Figure C-15 contains a block diagram depicting the TIS-B to ADS-B/ADS-R 
correlation function. 

1.
For TIS-B tracks with a service provider assigned address, a TIS-B correlation tag is
added to an ADS track file after repeated (three) spatial correlations with a window based on position accuracies of the TIS-B and ADS-B/ADS-R tracks.
2.
For TIS-B tracks with an ICAO address, a TIS-B correlation tag is added to an ADS
track file when ICAO address matching and spatial correlation succeeds once.
Regardless of the address type, upon initiation or update of a TIS-B track, ASSAP converts the TIS-B position to local ENU coordinates with equations (1), (2), and (3). Relative geometric altitude is replaced with relative pressure altitude using (19). Next, ASSAP determines the TIS-B address type (ICAO or SP-Assigned/non-ICAO) using the report Address Qualifier present in both UAT and 1090ES installations.  Address type then dictates which processing is used. 

## C.3.3.3.1 Icao Address Tis-B Track Processing

If the TIS-B track has an ICAO address, ASSAP searches the track file database for an ADS-B/ADS-R track which 1) has the same ICAO address as the TIS-B track, and 2) has not been previously labeled as invalid for correlation (e.g., track(i).TISB_IDs(j)= current TIS-B track ID and *track(i).TISB_correlation_status(j)* has not been set equal to -1). If the ADS-B/ADS-R track has an ICAO address which does not match that of the TIS-B 
track (i.e., *track(i).address ≠ current TIS-B track ID*), the ADS-B/ADS-R track is determined to be not correlated with the TIS-B track and invalidated from future comparisons with this TIS-B track (e.g., track(i).TISB_IDs(j)= current TIS-B track ID 
and *track(i).TISB_correlation_status(j)* = -1). 

If the above conditions are satisfied (i.e., an ICAO address match is obtained with an ADS-B/ADS-R track that is valid for correlation), the ADS-B/ADS-R track position is converted to local ENU coordinates with equations (1), (2) and (3). Relative geometric altitude is replaced with relative pressure altitude using (19). The position is then predicted to the time of applicability of the TIS-B track with equation (4). The candidate ADS-B/ADS-R track is then compared to the TIS-B track using a correlation window based on the position accuracies of the tracks.  In this case, horizontal range between the two targets is computed:

implementations, respectively). 

If hr ≤ hr*threshold* , horizontal spatial correlation succeeds.  The vertical correlation technique is slightly different and is defined as follows: 

$$\begin{array}{l}\mbox{$\nu_{\rm TDB}$}=\left[z-3s,\sigma_{\rm regressor},z+3s,\sigma_{\rm regressor}\right]\\ \mbox{$\nu_{\rm ADS}$}=\left[z-3s,\sigma_{\rm regressor},z+3s,\sigma_{\rm regressor}\right]\end{array}\tag{29}$$

ˆ = predicted vertical ENU position of ADS track. 

TISB
vepu
σ
 = standard deviation of TIS-B track vertical position uncertainty derived from NACP if the original altitude measurement was geometric and NACP ≥ 9(Version 1), from the reported geometric vertical accuracy (Version 2), or an assumed value for pressure altitude uncertainty (31.11 m) otherwise.   

ADS
vepu
σ
= standard deviation of ADS track vertical position uncertainty derived from 
NACP if the original altitude measurement was geometric and NACP ≥ 9 (Version 1), 
from the reported geometric vertical accuracy (Version 2), or an assumed value for 
pressure altitude uncertainty (31.11 m) otherwise.  
The vertical range threshold scalar (sv) compensates for prediction error (with optimal values of 0.91 and 0.20 for 1090ES and UAT implementations, respectively). 

If the vertical ranges overlap (i.e., some zi ∈vrTISB  and  zi ∈vr*ADS*  ), vertical spatial correlation succeeds.  If both horizontal and vertical correlation succeed, full spatial correlation occurs; otherwise, full spatial correlation fails.  If full spatial correlation occurs, the ADS track is tagged as having a correlated TIS-B target (e.g., track(i).TISB_correlation_tag = 1) , the correlation status in the track file is modified (*track(i).TISB_correlation_status(j) = 1*), and a six bit FIFO queue detection pattern is updated (e.g., *track(i).TISB_correlation_patterns(j) = [1])* upon the first comparison and successful correlation. Once full correlation occurs, the inter-source correlation function will no longer send the lower quality track (per Best Source Selection criteria) to the CDTI unless: 

a.
Decorrelation occurs (six consecutive correlation failures).
b.
The higher quality surveillance source exceeds the maximum allowed data age.
If a matching ICAO address cannot be found in the ADS-B/ADS-R track file database, ASSAP attempts to correlate the TIS-B track with any ADS-B/ADS-R targets that have not been marked invalid for correlation as described in the next subsection.  Since all non-matching ICAO address ADS-B/ADS-R tracks will have been marked invalid for correlation, only ADS-B/ADS-R tracks which do not have an ICAO address will be examined further. 

## C.3.3.3.2 Sp-Assigned (Or Unmatched Icao) Address Tis-B Track Processing

For all ADS-B/ADS-R tracks in the track file database that have not been previously labeled as invalid for correlation with the TIS-B track (e.g., track(i).TISB_IDs(j)= 
current TIS-B track ID and *track(i).TISB_correlation_status(j)* has not been set equal to -
1), the ADS-B/ADS-R track position is converted to local ENU coordinates with equations (1), (2) and (3). Relative geometric altitude is replaced with relative pressure altitude using (19). The position is then predicted to the time of applicability of the TIS-B 
track with equation (4). Each ADS-B/ADS-R track is then compared to the TIS-B track using the correlation window described in the previous section.  The data storage and success/failure criteria for full TIS-B correlation are very similar to that used for TCAS correlation.  Upon a failed TIS-B correlation window test, a "0" is added to the end of a 6-bit FIFO queue stored in the ADS-B/ADS-R track file (e.g., *track(i).TISB_correlation_patterns(j)*), removing any value that may exist in the first index if the queue is full.  TIS-B correlation patterns are initialized when an ADS-B/ADS-R track is generated and grow to a maximum of six bits.  For example, if a recently generated ith ADS-B/ADS-R track failed the correlation window test upon track initiation of the jth TIS-B track and five subsequent updates, the correlation pattern *track(i).TISB_correlation_patterns(j)* in the ADS track file would transition as follows: [0], [00],…,[000000]. 

If the TIS-B correlation window succeeds, a "1" is added to the correlation pattern in the ADS 
track file. 

Upon three consecutive full correlations 
(e.g., track(i).TISB_correlation_patterns(j) = [111] or track(i).TISB_correlation_patterns(j) = 
[100111]) the TIS-B track is determined to be fully correlated with the ADS-B/ADS-R 
track if the following conditions are met: 

a. The TIS-B track is not already correlated with a different ADS-B/ADS-R track. 
b. The given ADS-B/ADS-R track is not already correlated with another TIS-B 
track. 
If these conditions are met, the ADS track file is marked appropriately (e.g., track(i).TISB_correlation_status(j) = 1 and track(i).TISB_correlation_tag = 1). Otherwise, only the correlation pattern is updated to ensure a one-to-one relationship between correlated tracks. A TIS-B correlation status and tag (of 1) is stripped from a track (set back to 0) after three consecutive correlation window failures (tentative decorrelation); note that in this case, the ADS-B/ADS-R track is still valid for future correlation with this TIS-B track.  
However, upon six consecutive correlation window failures 
(track(i). 

TISB_correlation_patterns(j) = [000000]), the TIS-B track is determined to be not correlated with the ADS-B/ADS-R track and invalidated from future comparisons (e.g., track(i).TISB_correlation_status = -1). 

Once full correlation occurs, the inter-source correlation function will no longer send the lower quality track (per Best Source Selection criteria) to the CDTI unless: 

a. Tentative decorrelation occurs. 
b. The higher quality surveillance source exceeds the maximum allowed data age. 

## C.3.4 Best Source Selection

Best Source Selection is a time-driven function responsible for determining the best available surveillance source for a target if multiple sources (for that target) have been detected by ASSAP.  Note that if optional TIS-B to ADS-B/ADS-R functionality is not implemented, Best Source Selection simply consists of a choice between TCAS and ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B (depending on the implementation).  In this case, Best Source Selection may be implemented as a subfunction of TCAS correlation. 

This function is called at 1 Hz or greater, scanning through all track files.  If multiple track files are detected for one target, the best quality source track is chosen using the following criteria in priority order, and considering only those tracks with a data age less than that of the most stringent application currently being used: 

1. From the sources that have a non-zero NIC, select the source with the highest 
non-zero SIL. 
2. From sources that have the same highest non-zero SIL value, select the 
source with the highest NIC. 
3. From sources that have the same highest values of SIL and NIC, select the 
source with the highest NACP. 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

4.
From sources that have the same highest values of SIL, NIC, and NACP,
select the one source with the highest NACV.
5.
From sources that have the same highest SIL, NIC, NACP, and NACV values,
select the ADS-B source first, then the ADS-R source, and finally the TIS-B
source.
The source with the poorest quality is marked through a suppression field (e.g., track(i).suppress = 1). TCAS reports do not contain any of these criteria, thus TCAS is only chosen as the best track when all other source position accuracies drop below the minimum threshold for performing the EVAcq and AIRB applications. When the selected source has not been updated and the maximum data age is exceeded, the next highest quality source is selected. 

## C.3.5 Track Termination

A track is terminated (deleted from the track file database) when the maximum data age for all applications has been exceeded.  The data age is the elapsed time since a report has been correlated with the track. 

## C.3.6 Common Time Track Extrapolation & Traffic State File Generation

Common Time Track Extrapolation is a time-driven function that extrapolates all tracks to a common time of applicability.  This function is called at 1 Hz or greater, scanning through all ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track files which have been designated as the best quality source track (i.e., *track(i).suppress = 0*), converting the tracks to local ENU coordinates with equations (1), (2), and (3), replacing relative geometric altitude with relative pressure altitude via (19), and predicting all tracks to the current system time. Track prediction is performed in two ways: 

1.
Linear extrapolation
2.
Constant rate turn projection
Linear extrapolation is performed with (4).  Constant rate turn projection is detailed below.  Computations are first performed for the decimal component of the time difference between the current system time and time of the last track update (e.g., 0.25 
seconds for a time difference of 1.25 seconds): 

$$\begin{array}{l}{{\beta_{n-1}=\tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{\dot{y}}{\dot{x}}\right)}}\\ {{\beta_{n}=\beta_{n-1}+\dot{\alpha}\!\left(t_{rem}\right)}}\\ {{r=\!\left(\sqrt{\dot{x}^{2}+\dot{y}^{2}}\right)\!\left(t_{rem}\right)}}\\ {{\Delta x=r\cos\!\left(\beta_{n}\right)}}\\ {{\Delta y=r\sin\!\left(\beta_{n}\right)}}\\ {{x_{proj}=x+\Delta x}}\end{array}$$ $$y_{_{p r o j}}=y+\Delta y$$
$$\dot{x}_{_{p r o j}}=\frac{\Delta x}{t_{_{r e m}}}$$
$$\dot{y}_{_{p r o j}}=\frac{\Delta y}{t_{_{r e m}}}$$

Note:  Inverse tangent in the formula above refers to the four quadrant arctangent, e.g., 
"atan2" command in many programming languages; altitude is extrapolated linearly per (4) and vertical rate is assumed to be the last tracked value. 

If the difference between current system time and the time of the last track update does not contain an integer component, constant rate turn projection calculations are complete.  
If an integer time component (tint) exists the following algorithm is used to further project an arc for each second within the remaining time interval: 

$\beta_{n}=\beta_{n-1}+\alpha(1)$;

$r=\left(\sqrt{\dot{x}^{2}+\dot{y}^{2}}\right)$

$\Delta x=r\cos(\beta_{n})$

$\Delta y=r\sin(\beta_{n})$

$\chi_{proj_{n}}=\chi_{proj_{n-1}}+\Delta x$

$\chi_{proj_{n}}=\chi_{proj_{n-1}}+\Delta y$ $${\dot{x}}_{p r o j}={\frac{\Delta x}{1}}$$
$${\dot{y}}_{p r o j}={\frac{\Delta y}{1}}$$
Note: Projected horizontal velocity is calculated with the last computed positional change; altitude is further extrapolated linearly per (4) and vertical rate is unchanged. 

Independent of extrapolation method, for each track estimate, two altitude parameters are computed: application altitude (extrapolated until target time out) and display altitude with extrapolation limited to 11 seconds (until a new report is received). Extrapolated tracks are then loaded into the traffic state file along with uncorrelated and best-source TCAS tracks (in local ENU coordinates) forwarded by the inter-source correlation function.  Additionally, if an ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B track has been correlated with TCAS (e.g., *track(i).TCAS_correlation_tag = 1*), a bit in the traffic state file track indicates this correlation, so that the CDTI (in this ASA system architecture) visually depicts the traffic as being TCAS equipped.  Track quality parameters (NACP, NACV, NIC, SIL, GVA and SDA if applicable) are also recorded in the traffic state file (excluding TCAS tracks). 

## C.4 Application Processing

The ASSAP Application Processor determines the validity of tracks for multiple applications (e.g., Enhanced Visual Acquisition, Visual Separation on Approach) and performs application-specific calculations.  Figure C-16 contains a block diagram depicting the Application Processing function. 

The application processor scans through the traffic state file (in transit to the CDTI) and adds traffic application capability bits to individual tracks in the file based on quality parameters.  For example, if a particular track does not meet the data quality requirements for some application 
"A", a bit is modified to reflect this 
(e.g., traffic_state_file(i).track(j).A = 0).  The same technique is used for other applications. 

Additionally, the application processor uses state information in the traffic state file to compute application-specific parameters. 

## C.5 Simulation Results

The sample 1090ES and UAT ASSAP algorithms outlined in this appendix have been implemented in MATLAB, along with a high fidelity representation of the CDTI. The cumulative ASA system simulation has been tested and refined with a number of data sources. The ASA system simulation also demonstrates the feasibility of a VDL4 implementation due to similarities with UAT and 1090ES implementations. 

The results in this section pertain to the scenarios described in sections 3.2.7.1 - 3.2.7.5 
of this document (listed in Table C-7 and Table C-12) and the corresponding bench test data supplement appended to this document.

## Appendix D Example Validation Algorithm For Track Updating D.1 Consecutive Report Method

The Report Validity Checks defined below are one method for validating track updates.  
Analysis presented in D.2 indicates that alternate horizontal position checks may be more appropriate for the TIS-B surveillance source. 

a.
Horizontal Rate:
Let V0 represent the last validated Velocity.  Let V1 represent the report velocity being validated, and let T equal the elapsed time (in seconds) between the two velocity reports.  Verify that |V1 - V0| < 2*Vu + A*T where Vu is the reported Velocity Uncertainty or 20 m/s if unknown and A = 14.7 m/s2 (0.00795 Nm/s2).

1.
ADS-B position sources may compute velocity (ground speed) as a function of successive position updates.  Velocity derived from position measurements will potentially defeat the position validation test given below.  The velocity validation protects against that case.
2.
The value of 14.7 m/s2 (1.5 g) was derived by investigating the horizontal
acceleration of high performance business jets in conjunction with an OEM.
b.
Horizontal Position:
Calculate the horizontal distance (D) between the last validated position (not the existing track position) and the report being validated.  Verify that D is less than 4*K
+ (V + 2*Vu)*T + 0.5 * A * T2 where K is the horizontal position uncertainty (95%), V is the reported magnitude of velocity or 1022 Knots if unavailable,  Vu is the reported velocity uncertainty or 20 m/s when unavailable, T is the difference (in seconds) of the Time of Applicability of the Report and the Time of Applicability of the last validated track position, and A = 14.7 m/s2 (0.00795 NM/s2).

1.
4*K will bound the measurement error of ADS-B position sources (i.e., GNSS, IRS).
2.
The existing track position is updated at least once per second using the last reported velocity.
3.
In most cases, the position uncertainty will not be different in successive measurements.  In the event that the position uncertainty is different, use the larger value.
4.
The Horizontal Rate check should be performed before the Horizontal Position
check.
c. Vertical Position: 
Let A0 represent the last reported altitude.  Let A1 represent the report altitude being validated, and let T equal the elapsed time in seconds between the two altitude reports. Verify that | A1 - A0| < 250 ft + 10,000 fpm * T/60.  
Note: The validation constant of 10,000 fpm is based on TCAS vertical tracker performance.  

## D.2 Alternate Method For Horizontal Position Validation D.2.1 Background

A 2013 analysis of operational TIS-B data found that changes in reported horizontal position will indicate accelerations often in excess of the threshold in D.1.  The TIS-B 
ground system employs multi-sensor trackers (MSTs) that fuse measurements from different sensors.  Positional changes across small times between reports from different sensors (e.g. 0.05 seconds) were identified as the root cause of this issue.  This is hypothesized to occur because of position and time registration errors.  Figure D-1 
contains a plot of position-based accelerations observed for a TIS-B track produced with measurements from four radars.  This track indicated accelerations as great as 33g. Additionally, unusually large indicated accelerations (e.g., 10g) were also observed for link version 0 1090ES ADS-B targets of opportunity.   Link version 1 and 2 tracks were available, but conclusions were not drawn as they did not meet minimum quality requirements for the ASA system.  A Monte Carlo simulation was developed to estimate indicated accelerations from link version 2 1090ES ADS-B in the 2020 environment. 

10,000 flight paths were simulated, each containing 1,000 state vectors.  Velocity for each scenario was pulled at random from a normal distribution fitted to observed TIS-B 
track velocities, bounded by 80 kts and 500 kts (e.g., for GA sport and large+ air transport respectively).  A 2020 update rate of U(0.5, 4) seconds was assumed based on the DO-260B analysis of the LA 24K FRUIT environment with traffic ranges of 40 NM or less. 1090ES timing errors of 100 ms (95%, normally distributed) were modeled independently for each timestamp.  Along-track position jitter of 4.63 m (95%, normally distributed) was modeled independently for each position; note that this is 5% of the rule compliant estimated position uncertainty (92.6 m, NACP = 8).  A constant bias component of position error was not modeled as it would have no impact on computed acceleration.  Calculated position-based accelerations are shown in Figure D-2; as can be seen, several low frequency cases exhibited behavior similar to that of TIS-B with some indicated accelerations in excess of 20g. 

The sample ASSAP algorithms in Appendix C of this document are capable of damping gross state errors by nearly an order of magnitude.  However, as Report Validity Checks occur before potential tracking, an alternate method of horizontal position validation was developed, primarily for TIS-B but also applicable to ADS-B if appropriate. 

## D.2.2 Algorithms

The alternate algorithms in Figure D-3 attempt to minimize the impact of timing errors in position updates by increasing the time window used in the calculation.  The trade-off is that these algorithms require a larger history of reported states (e.g., stored in a track file object per Appendix C).  The variable d denotes (horizontal) distance, t denotes timestamp, v denotes derived velocity, and acc denotes indicated acceleration. 



The operational TIS-B data set was fed into each algorithm.  Table D-1 below contains the Report Validity Check failure rates. 

 

| Algorithm 1 Failure    | Algorithm 2 Failure    |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Rate                   | Rate                   |
| 3.0%                   |                        |
| 0.3%                   |                        |

 Each algorithm was also tested with the modeled 2020 1090ES ADS-B data.  Results in Figure D-4 indicate that both alternative algorithms will produce position-based accelerations less than the 1.5g component of the threshold in D.1, excluding all other factors that increase the threshold.  Results based solely on consecutive changes in horizontal position are also shown as a reference. 

 

## D.3 Conclusions

The specific design of the Report Validity Check is left to the manufacturer.  The methods in this appendix are provided as samples.  If these sample techniques are used, a combination of the algorithms may prove the most useful.  The horizontal position check in D.2 may be most applicable to TIS-B to prevent dropping an unacceptable amount of reports.  The horizontal position check in D.1 is likely adequate for ADS-B and ADS-R 
surveillance sources unless operational data suggests otherwise, in which case the method in D.2 is more appropriate.

## Appendix E Velocity Validation E.1 Background

Version 2 ADS-B Out installations are expected to stabilize the implementation of standards for reporting velocity accuracy.  However, a considerable number of legacy installations are already fielded that either utilize earlier standards or do not adequately address velocity accuracy. While the majority of legacy ADS-B Out installations are expected to provide adequate data quality to support air-to-air applications, the transmitted velocity accuracy may not accurately reflect the actual quality.  This could disqualify them from participating in the application, when the actual reported velocity is sufficiently accurate. Legacy ADS-B standards (e.g., DO260/ED102 and DO260A) make provisions for the reporting of the velocity accuracy through dedicated quality indicators (NUCR and NACV, respectively). However, in a large number of cases, currently fielded ADS-B Out equipment does not provide a certified or meaningful quality indicator. This is partly due to implementation choices (e.g., hard-wired NUCR=0) and due to the fact that existing GNSS-based position and velocity information sources did not provide a velocity accuracy indication that could be mapped to the ADS-B velocity accuracy quality indicator. In the absence of such information from the source, previous ADS-B 
provisions allowed for the use of position related accuracy information for the encoding of the velocity accuracy.  As a consequence, for an extended transition period, the use of the reported velocity accuracy for legacy implementations will be limited. The Version 2 
ADS-B MOPS changed the standards for encoding NACV, since in the interim a new GPS standard was released, which provided more guidance about velocity accuracy.  It is expected that the Version 2 compliant equipment will include a position source that conforms to this guidance. In order to ensure adequate velocity quality of legacy aircraft for a particular airborne application, as well as for all aircraft performing some surface applications, a receiving aircraft must utilize a form of monitoring algorithm that can confirm that available velocity data from all legacy aircraft is of sufficient quality. In addition, the algorithm should also be applied to Version 2 aircraft that are reporting velocity quality which is insufficient for the application being performed.  This algorithm is applied to target aircraft, and for some applications may be applied to ownship as well.  A variety of approaches and algorithms are expected to be available to achieve the qualification of velocity data.  This Appendix presents an example algorithm that provides a means of validating the reported velocity using available position data and position quality information as the basis for performing the velocity monitoring function. Any approach that provides performance equivalent to that shown in Sections E.7 and E.8 for this algorithm would be acceptable. 

## E.2 Analysis Approach

The analysis primarily focused on the performance of a speed calculation algorithm applied to ADS-B recorded field data from EUROCONTROL and the FAA. Several algorithms for calculating speed from position updates were analyzed, and a comparison of the results led to the proposed algorithm. The accuracy of the speed calculation was determined using simulation results, and a maximum threshold was determined for the allowable difference between calculated speed and reported speed. The validation criteria included a requirement that m of n previous speed calculations did not breech the maximum threshold. A sensitivity study was employed to determine the optimal m and n values as well as other optimal parameters in the speed calculation algorithm. The optimal values were judged based on performance metrics which included the difference between calculated and reported speed, the percentage of reports validated for each flight, and the time until the first valid report. Results from the performance metrics were studied for sensitivity to variations in reported speed, accelerations, and NACP. The results of the sensitivity analysis fed back into the algorithm in the form of limits on applying the algorithm, thus reducing incorrect false validations. 

The simulation utilized a velocity error model that was derived from the reported speed errors in the field data during straight and level flight. The simulation results were validated against performance metric results of the field data.  

## E.3 Simulation Overview

A simulation and field data were used to analyze the performance of ground speed calculations that are based on ADS-B position reports. The results of a simulation were compared with EUROCONTROL field data from Toulouse and Frankfurt airports and with FAA Surveillance and Broadcast Services (SBS) field data primarily from Louisville, KY. The calculated ground speed was compared to the reported speed as a measure of the current performance of the reported speed accuracy. This performance is affected by the GPS position and velocity accuracy as well as by the dynamics of the transmit aircraft. The simulation is based on the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) System Level ADS-B Performance (SLAP) simulation, which has been utilized extensively in the SBS Separation Standards Working Group (SSWG). It is a fast-time Monte-Carlo simulation with prescribed aircraft trajectories. The 1090ES 
ADS-B system is modeled, including the ADS-B subsystem, extrapolation of positions, and transmission of the full set of extended squitters as prescribed in the 1090ES MOPS (DO-260B/ED-102A).  Total latency and uncompensated latency are modeled in agreement with DO-318/ED-161 Safety, Performance and Interoperability Requirements Document for Enhanced Air Traffic Services in Radar-Controlled Areas Using ADS-B 
Surveillance (ADS-B-RAD). 

## E.4 Modeling Approach

The position error model is outlined in detail in Annex E of the SURF SPR [ED-165/DO- 322]. It accounts for the correlation between successive GPS position measurements. The modeled velocity jitter and bias values are chosen to achieve the ground speed accuracy that was measured in the EUROCONTROL and SBS field data. The field data was analyzed to determine the actual jitter and bias in the reported ground speed. Flight segments of at least 20 seconds duration (average duration: 38 seconds) were chosen where the reported speed was nearly constant. The jitter was measured for each constant 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
speed segment by calculating the standard deviation of all the reported speeds. The bias was measured by calculating the difference between the average reported speed and the average calculated speed. Conservative estimates of the speed jitter and bias errors are 0.2 m/s standard deviation and < 0.72 m/s 95%, respectively. The velocity error model was tuned to achieve these ground speed jitter and bias measurements. 

Note: GPS position errors will sporadically have somewhat larger position jumps, caused by factors such as rising and setting satellites. While such position jumps will occur, they are envisioned to be infrequent enough that an appropriate validation scheme can accommodate them.  
The transmit ADS-B processing function received the 1 Hz GPS updates and extrapolated the position at 200 ms increments until the position was transmitted. The Time of Applicability of the transmitted position was assumed to be between -100 and +100 ms from the time of transmission. This assumption satisfies the minimum DO-260B/ED-
102A standards for position extrapolation and can have a large effect on the error in the calculated speed. 

## E.5 Validation Algorithms

The validation of a single report requires several steps including: filtering out problematic reports, calculating the aircraft speed, checking the calculated speed against the reported speed, and applying an m of n success criterion. The steps are illustrated in Figure E-1, where the process begins at the point of ADS-B report generation within the receive aircraft. For each position update, the report is dropped if either the NACP is less than 7 
or if the acceleration necessary to propagate the aircraft from the last position to the new position would exceed 1.5g, where g is 9.81 m/s2. Next, the previously calculated acceleration is added to a sliding window average which includes the last 5 acceleration calculations (from the last 6 position updates). If the average acceleration is greater than 
0.5 m/s2, then the report is dropped.  
Once the report passes the filters, a simple algorithm is used to calculate ground speed from position updates. The algorithm calculates the distance between two surface position reports and divides the distance by the time interval between the updates to derive the calculated ground speed (s = distance / time). The two surface position reports are chosen by seeking out 1) the first report that occurs between 2 and 10 seconds before the current report, and 2) the first report that occurs between 2 and 10 seconds after the current report. By choosing a report before and after the current time, the algorithm achieves better speed estimation as opposed to using only reports that occurred in the past. However, this creates a 2 to 10 second lag until the current speed estimate is available. The difference between the calculated speed and reported speed is compared to the maximum allowable threshold. When validating airborne targets, the threshold is set to 7.0 m/s. When validating ground targets, the threshold is set to 2.5 m/s. The result is added to a table containing the previous N results. If the speed difference is less than the threshold, a "1" is added to the table; otherwise, a "0" is added to the table. If the age of each result is less than the corresponding maximum age, then it is added to the other results. If the summed value is greater than or equal to M then the reported speed is considered to be valid.  

## E.6 Speed Difference Threshold

The simulation was used to estimate the error involved when using the speed calculation algorithm. With an estimate of the speed calculation error, a bound can be set on the maximum difference between the calculated speed and reported speed where, if not exceeded, the reported speed error is likely to be less than 3 m/s or 10 m/s 95% of the time when validating ground or airborne targets. The worst case ground scenario was simulated at 25 kts (12.9 m/s) with no acceleration, resulting in a speed calculation error of less than 0.6 m/s 95% of the time. If the difference between the calculated and reported speeds is 2.5 m/s, then given 0.6 m/s of calculation error, the true speed difference is less than 3 m/s 95% of the time. The worst case airborne scenario was simulated at 250 kts (129 m/s) with no acceleration, resulting in a speed calculation error of less than 3.6 m/s 95% of the time. Similar to the derivation of the ground threshold, the airborne difference between calculated speed and reported speed must be less than 7.0 m/s to be confident that the true speed difference is less than 10 m/s 95% of the time. If the true speed is less than 250 kts (129 m/s), then the calculation error decreases and there is a higher likelihood that the reported speed is within 10 m/s. 

## E.7 Performance Results

The validation algorithm was applied to data from EUROCONTROL and the FAA. The percent of reported NACP values and the number of tracks are shown in Table E-1. The majority of aircraft reported a NACP of 8. The EUROCONTROL data consisted of mostly DO-260/ED-102 version 0 aircraft, whereas the FAA data was entirely DO-260A 
version 1 aircraft.

Results were limited to reports where the average time between reports is less than 2 
seconds, and the speed is not exactly 0 (indicating a "stationary target" with low squitter rate). The field data included areas where the update interval is not sufficient for ASA applications. The poor update interval does not allow sufficient number of reports to achieve the m of n criterion. The percent of valid reports was tabulated for each ground track, and the distribution of these results is shown in Figure E-2. On average, 97.7% of reports are validated within each track. 95% of tracks achieved at least 91% report validation. The airborne performance is shown in Figure E-3, where an average of 97% of reports was validated and 95% of tracks had greater than 89% valid reports. 

 
 
A second performance metric is the time to validation, which is defined as the time between the first speed calculation and the first validated report.  The time to validation for ground reports was less than 2.1 seconds 95% of the time, and for airborne reports it was less than 3.1 seconds 95% of the time. These values do not include the time window necessary to calculate speed, which varies between 2 and 10 seconds on either side of the report. Given the maximum average update interval of 2 seconds, the actual time from the 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
first position report to the last position report necessary for validation is approximately 6 
and 7 seconds for ground and airborne tracks, respectively. 

## E.8 Sensitivity Results

The parameters used in the speed calculation algorithm and the m of n criterion were varied in order to determine the optimal balance between percent of valid reports and time to validation. As the minimum time window increases, the success rate (i.e., the percent of valid reports) increases. However, the down side is that time to validation also increases. A subset of the field data was used for the sensitivity study.  
Table E-2 and Table E-3 show the sensitivity of ground and airborne validation performance to the minimum ("tmin") and maximum ("tmax") time windows used in the speed calculation algorithm. The column labeled "Min Time to Speed Calc." is the minimum amount of time to acquire all the necessary reports for the speed calculation algorithm. While the minimum time for a speed calculation increases with tmin, the success rate remains the same for ground reports and increases slightly for airborne reports. 

Table E-4 and Table E-5 show the sensitivity of the performance metrics to the m of n criterion. For ground results, increasing m to 3 and n to 4 or 5 decreases the 95% success rate by 5% while increasing the 95% time to validation by 2.5 seconds. Similarly, the success rate of airborne reports decreases and the time to validation increases as m and n increase.

## E.9 Conclusions

In conclusion, calculated speed, using reported positions, can be compared to the reported speed to provide the required velocity accuracy confidence of ground and airborne ASA applications.  The vast majority of reports would be validated provided that the update interval requirements are met.  Application of the algorithm is limited to portions of flight when the aircraft is not accelerating.

## Appendix F Itp Design Considerations F.1 Background

During the development of ADS-B ITP, a number of ITP design guidelines have been proposed and implemented. Although these design considerations do not constitute minimum requirements and should not be part of the ITP MOPS material, they do represent ideas developers may want to consider in the development of an ITP system.  

## F.2 Itp Profile View Implementation Considerations

The main body of these MOPS specifies what ITP specific traffic information is required to be output to the CDTI (Section 2.2.2.6). This information includes Traffic Identification, ITP distance, Traffic Ahead Of or Behind status, and ITP Traffic Geometric Initiation Pass/Fail status. Section 1.2.2.2 states that the CDTI consists of all displays and controls necessary to support the applications. The controls may be a dedicated CDTI control panel or it may be incorporated into other controls, (e.g., MCDU or EFB). At a minimum, CDTI includes a graphical plan-view (top down) traffic display, in these MOPS referred to as the Traffic Display, and the controls for the display and applications. Since ITP is a vertical maneuver, some developers have indicated that a profile graphical view of the traffic improves situation awareness for flight crews desiring to perform an ITP. This is particularly true for situations where there is a significant angle between the track of the ownship aircraft and the ITP Traffic aircraft (for ITP the angle can be as great as 44 degrees and still be a valid ITP situation). In these cases, relative geometry (ahead of and behind) may not be intuitive and flight crews might question the ITP ahead of or behind indication.  
Figure F-1 is an example of an implementation that contains an ITP profile view. This example combines both a plan and profile display. Other implementations could consist of a stand-alone profile display.  When using a stand-alone profile view, it is assumed there would be a corresponding, separate plan view display.  
The following section provides some considerations for developing vertical or profile view display. If an ITP Profile View (ITP-PV) display is provided, the design considerations in the following subsections should be considered. 

## F.2.1 Traffic Information Formats - Data Tags

The ITP-PV should provide a data tag of information for all displayed traffic in the ITP- PV, with the exception of ownship. This data tag should include traffic ID for all aircraft. The ITP-PV data tags may also include:  

•
ITP Distance
•
Ahead of or behind status
•
ITP Traffic geometric pass/fail status
For implementations that include this data tag, the ITP-PV should have the capability to graphically indicate the specific ITP Traffic geometric pass/fail failing criteria for each displayed traffic aircraft. For the purposes of avoiding clutter on the display, this additional data tag information may be limited by a traffic filter (e.g., limiting expanded data tags to traffic between the ownship altitude and the desired altitude). This can be seen in Figure F-1. In Figure F-1 
the aircraft is considering a climb from FL330 to FL350. The data tags are expanded for FL340 but are limited to traffic identification only at FL360. Flight crews may have an operational use for additional information.  For example, flight crews have indicated a desire to be able to view the Rate of Change of ITP distance and/or if aircraft are getting closer to or pulling away from each other. This could aid flight crews in making strategic decisions regarding their flight. When indicating if aircraft are getting closer or further way from ownship, some designers have chosen to use an arrow pointing toward or away from the ownship aircraft to indicate if ITP Distance is becoming larger or smaller. Some designers have additionally included a solid or hollow arrow to indicate if ITP Distance is growing or reducing. 

## F.2.2 Itp-Pv Display Range

The ITP-PV should use ITP Distance as the unit of measure for the horizontal range scale of the ITP-PV. If ITP Distance is not used as the unit of measure for the horizontal range scale, care must be taken to ensure flight crews are not confused by the horizontal range scale chosen versus a scale based on ITP Distance.  
If ITP Distance is used for the horizontal scale, it should be clearly labeled as an ITP Distance scale. It is recommended that the scale be adjustable. Designers should consider a range of 25 NM to 200 NM as measured from the ownship position to the edge of the viewable screen. In some oceanic regions separation distances can be as large as 120 NM. The ability to see beyond the separation standard being used can be operationally useful.  
Additionally, if an ITP-PV is combined with a top down view on the same screen (as shown in Figure F-1), careful consideration must be taken to ensure flight crews are not confused by potentially different horizontal axes used with the two different views.  

## F.2.3 Additional Display Considerations F.2.3.1 Lateral Filter

Designers of ITP-PV displays should give careful consideration to including a lateral filter on what is shown on the ITP-PV. This is particularly important for use of the system on organized track systems. It could be confusing for flight crews to see aircraft that are on parallel tracks up to 60 miles away on their ITP-PV. These aircraft could appear to be very close to them and may cause the flight crew to not request an ITP maneuver when in fact the traffic would not prevent the ITP maneuver, or the flight crew might include an aircraft on a parallel track in an ITP request which could cause significant confusion when communicating with the controller.  
If a lateral filter is being used on the ITP-PV, there should be an indication on the profile view that a lateral filter is being used. It is also helpful to indicate the extent of the lateral filter on the corresponding plan view. 

## F.2.3.2 Similar Track Aircraft Filter

Generally the ITP-PV is used primarily to aid the flight crew in the determination of making an ITP request. As a result, designers should only show similar track aircraft (aircraft whose tracks are within ± 44 degrees) since they are the only aircraft that can be considered for an ITP request. One benefit for this is that aircraft that cannot be used in the ITP request do not clutter the ITP-PV. Should a design not include a mandatory or user selected similar traffic filter, the ITP-PV should provide a graphical indication of similar track status. These similar track aircraft should still be displayed in the top down view to support AIRB functions.  
ITP procedure guidance - One known implementation included guidance on the steps required to develop an ITP request. The implementation guides the pilot through the selection of reference aircraft and creating the ITP request. 

## F.3 Communication Implications

The objective of the In-Trail Procedure (ITP) is to enable aircraft that desire flight level changes in procedural, non-radar airspace to achieve these changes on a more frequent basis, thus improving flight efficiency and safety. In non-radar airspace, communication between the flight crew and controllers is achieved through a variety of means ranging from third party high-frequency communication to satellite based Controller Pilot Data Link Communication (CPDLC). During development of the ITP procedure, it was determined that ITP requests and clearances can only be granted using Direct Controller Pilot Communication (DCPC). There are a few areas in the world where this can be done by direct voice communication but in most non-radar regions this means requests and clearances must be accomplished using CPDLC.  The following section addresses some of the communication issues. 

Note: DCPC includes both VHF and CPDLC communications, but does not include HF 
communications. 
CPLDC messages sets, both uplink and downlink, have been defined in DO-306/ED-122 
and are included below. Designers of ITP systems should be aware of these message sets. Some developers may choose to design a system that populates these messages automatically and sends the messages to the CPDLC system. Other designers may choose to require the flight crew to enter the information manually using procedural guidance (e.g., a checklist). Others may require the flight crew to enter the information manually but provide the filled in message to the crew on a display.   

## F.3.1 Use Of Downlink Pre-Formatted Free Text Messages

The airborne system will append the vertical request message element with a free text message dM67. When a vertical request for climbing (resp. for descending) has been prepared as part of an In Trail Procedure transaction, the aircraft shall send a downlink message containing dM9 REQUEST CLIMB TO [altitude] (resp. dM10 REQUEST DESCENT TO [altitude]) concatenated with message element dM67 containing the following text: 

dM67 Message Element content 
ITP procedure type (number and relative position of reference aircraft) 
1 reference aircraft (ahead) 
"ITP [Distance] BEHIND [Aircraftflightidentification]" 
1 reference aircraft (behind) 
"ITP [Distance] AHEAD OF [Aircraftflightidentification]" 
2 reference aircraft (both ahead) 
"ITP [Distance] BEHIND[Aircraftflightidentification] AND [Distance] BEHIND [Aircraftflightidentification]" 
2 reference aircraft (both behind) 
"ITP [Distance] AHEAD OF [Aircraftflightidentification] AND [Distance] AHEAD OF [Aircraftflightidentification]" 
2 reference aircraft (one ahead and one behind) 
"ITP [Distance] BEHIND [Aircraftflightidentification] AND [Distance] AHEAD OF [Aircraftflightidentification]" 

Note: Reference aircraft can be co-altitude.  
Example of ITP request message: 
REQUEST CLIMB TO FL360 ITP 25NM BEHIND SIA228 AND 21NM AHEAD OF AFR008 

## F.3.2 Use Of Uplink Pre-Formatted Free Text Messages

The ground system will append the vertical request message element with a free text message uM169. When a vertical clearance for climbing (resp. for descending) has been prepared as part of an In Trail Procedure transaction, the ground system shall send an uplink message containing uM20 CLIMB TO AND MAINTAIN [altitude] (resp. uM23 DESCEND TO AND MAINTAIN [altitude]) concatenated with message element dM169 containing the following text:   

uM169 Message Element content 
ITP procedure type (number and relative position of reference aircraft) 
1 reference aircraft (ahead) 
"ITP BEHIND [Aircraftflightidentification]" 
1 reference aircraft (behind) 
"ITP AHEAD OF [Aircraftflightidentification]" 
2 reference aircraft (both ahead) 
"ITP BEHIND [Aircraftflightidentification] AND BEHIND [Aircraftflightidentification]" 
2 reference aircraft (both behind) 
"ITP AHEAD OF [Aircraftflightidentification] AND AHEAD OF [Aircraftflightidentification]" 
2 reference aircraft (one ahead and one behind) 
"ITP BEHIND [Aircraftflightidentification] AND AHEAD OF [Aircraftflightidentification]"

## Appendix G Tcas/Ads-B Display Symbol Integration

## Appendix G Tcas/Ads-B Display Symbol Integration G.1 Introduction

It is generally agreed that a shared traffic display, including all surveillance sources, is of far more value in developing a situation awareness picture than several displays providing partial data.  However, there are a number of issues relating to the shared display.  In particular, there are questions pertaining to the use of existing TCAS data and symbology on a shared display. During the preparation of the ASA MOPS (DO-317), there was much discussion on this topic.  In general, the TCAS and ADS-B symbol requirements included in the document body are quite similar, and are based on the TCAS symbols.  The main deviation is that the document requires directional symbols to be used for all correlated TCAS traffic with valid directionality.  The document body notes: 

1.
For correlated traffic, ASSAP will provide the CDTI with the best position data available for each traffic element, and will not alter the position source due to the
presence of TCAS TAs and RAs.
2.
Directionality information, if available, may assist the flight crew in visual search
and identification of the alerted traffic.
Research performed in a high fidelity cockpit simulator at the FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in December, 2008, indicated that substituting directional symbology for standard TCAS symbology resulted in no negative impacts on pilot response.  Metrics included pilot compliance to RA guidance, pilot reaction time, vertical and horizontal maneuvering, and pilot visual scan patterns.  As such, the TCAS community was comfortable with this deviation in existing TCAS symbology. This appendix provides some information on the issues and discussions regarding TCAS/ADS-B symbol integration.   

## G.2 Use Of Current Tcas Symbology G.2.1 For Ads-B And Tis-B Non-Directional Traffic Without Alerts

Current TCAS symbols are used to indicate all non-directional ADS-B and TIS-B traffic.  

## G.2.2 For Tcas-Only Traffic

Current TCAS symbols are used to indicate all states (other, proximate, TA and RA) for uncorrelated TCAS traffic.   

## G.3 Alert Symbols

There is no requirement to distinguish traffic symbols of TCAS traffic advisories from ASA caution level alerts, nor is it prohibited.  ASA caution level alerts are required to be amber/yellow, as with TCAS TAs, but the shape may differ. 

Similarly, there is no requirement to distinguish traffic symbols of TCAS resolution advisories from ASA warning level alerts, nor is it prohibited.  ASA warning level alerts are required to be red, as with TCAS RAs, but the shape may differ. On one hand, it is likely beneficial to limit the number of different symbols used.  On the other hand, differentiating ASA alert symbols from TCAS alert symbols can help to ensure the effectiveness of each.   

## G.4 Distinguishing Traffic Based On Source

There is no requirement to indicate the source of traffic data (ADS-B, TCAS, TIS-B).  
There is, however, a requirement to indicate traffic data quality, which is affected by the source.  (See Section 2.3.1.2) The indication of traffic data quality versus source is more operationally relevant for performance-based systems like ASA.   

## G.5 Distinguishing Traffic Tracked By Tcas

It may be of interest to the flight crew to know whether individual traffic elements are being monitored by TCAS or some other alerting system. Section 2.3.5.1 says: "In TCAS/ASA integrated systems, the flight crew may be interested to know if collision avoidance protection is being provided by TCAS against a particular traffic element.  A 
means may be provided for the flight crew to determine if traffic of interest is monitored by TCAS (i.e., is either a TCAS-only or a TCAS correlated traffic element)." Although it is not a CDTI requirement to display the TCAS capability of the traffic, there is an ASSAP requirement in 2.2.2.1.5.1.10 that requires the ASSAP to pass TCAS 
correlation status to the CDTI. 

## G.6 Use Of Selected And Designated Symbol Variations During Alerts

Systems integrated with TCAS will need to address selected and designated traffic symbology and status changes when TAs and RAs occur.  This integration is not currently addressed, but should be addressed in a future version of these MOPS.  Similar assessments should be made for ASA applications that generate alerts. 

## G.7 Proximate / Nearby Airborne Traffic G.7.1 Determination Of Nearby Airborne Traffic

TCAS flags traffic within 6 NM and 1200 ft of ownship as Proximate.  Similarly, this same criteria is used to determine Nearby Airborne Traffic in the ASA MOPS, regardless of the track source.  Nearby Airborne Traffic criteria is used in the track output priority scheme (see Section 2.2.2.1.5.1.2).  

## G.7.2 Proximate Traffic Symbology

On standard TCAS displays, the only effect of Proximate status is to alter the traffic symbols (from an unfilled diamond to a filled diamond).  Section 2.3.4.2.3.2.8 specifies that on TCAS/ASA integrated systems, Proximate and Nearby Airborne Traffic shall be indicated by filling in the traffic symbol, similar to the current TCAS paradigm.  
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Depicting Proximate traffic with symbol fill now applies to both directional and nondirectional traffic symbols. 

## G.7.3 Display Of Proximate Traffic During Tas And Ras

Section 2.3.1.1(b) requires that all airborne traffic within ±1200 ft altitude and 6 NM 
range (including TCAS Proximate Traffic) be displayed in the event of a TCAS TA or RA.  The MOPS requirements were prepared based on the current TCAS DO-185B/ED-
143 requirements.  (That is, subject to the current display range and total number of targets available to display.)

## Appendix H Service Status Indication For Tis-B And Ads-R H.1 Background

The Ground system will provide a TIS-B/ADS-R service status message on the 1090ES, UAT and VDL4 to indicate to clients whether they are receiving TIS-B and ADS-R 
services.  The 1090ES and UAT approaches are similar, while the approach for VDL4 is different.  Both approaches are described below. The service status indication will be designed to indicate to the pilot when a limited traffic picture exists on the CDTI for the EVAcq or AIRB application.  A single message, such as "TIS-B/ADS-R Unavailable" will tell the pilot that TIS-B or ADS-R service has been lost.  The ground system will provide much of the service status functionality.  

## H.2 1090Es And  Uat Tis-B/Ads-R Service Status Message Approach

In 1090ES and UAT, the ground system communicates TIS-B/ADS-R service status to individual aircraft by encoding the aircraft's 24-bit Address onto the service status message.  Each address is preceded by an in-service or out-of-service qualifier.  The inservice qualifier indicates that the 24-bit Address is within TIS-B/ADS-R coverage, the out-of-service qualifier is sent to indicate the aircraft has left the TIS-B or ADS-R service area. When the aircraft is within the service area it will continuously receive TIS-B/ADS-R service status messages with their 24-bit Address at a rate sufficient to ensure receipt at least every 20 seconds (95%).   
When the aircraft leaves the service area it may receive the service status message with its 24-bit Address and the out-of-service designator at a rate sufficient to ensure receipt within 20 seconds (95%).  The out-of-service message does not continue after the initial 
20 seconds.  If an aircraft misses the out-of-service message it will rely on a timeout to determine loss of status.  The out-of-service message could also be considered a loss-ofservice message, the terms are used interchangeably. Aircraft that have been receiving the in-service messages that stop receiving in-service messages and do not receive an out-of-service message will timeout after 40 seconds and indicate a loss of TIS-B/ADS-R. 

Up to three 24-bit Addresses can reside on each 1090ES airborne service status message. 

Over 100 addresses can reside on a UAT airborne service status message.   
Table H-1 provides more details of how to set TIS-B/ADS-R service status.

1. Because the 1090 service status message is limited to three 24-bit Addresses, it is 
likely that multiple service status messages that do not contain the ownship 24-bit 
Address will be received.  This is normal, and should not result in a status change. 
2. Receipt of an out-of-service message supersedes the in-service message.   
3. Aircraft with an operational TCAS are not required to consider TIS-B/ADS-R service 
status 

## H.3 Previous Uat Approach

Initial versions of the UAT ground system implementation provided a TIS-B service status that encoded the 24-bit Address onto the service status message.  The ground system service status indication is being changed to include ADS-R as well as TIS-B 
coverage and add an in-service/out-of-service designator to more quickly identify loss of service.  TIS-B/ADS-R service status will also be provided for both UAT and 1090. 

## H.4 Vdl4 Tis-B Service Status Message Approach

The approach for VDL4 differs from UAT and 1090ES in that the service status message is broadcast to all users in the region served by the ground system.  The VDL4 ground system communicates TIS-B service status through the service information (si) field within the Directory of Services (DoS) message which is periodically broadcast to all participating aircraft on the frequency or frequencies served by the ground system.  The aircraft derives information on the service status from the service information (si) field in the DoS message.  The field contains a flag for each service. If the flag is not set, the respective service is unavailable from the current ground station. The DoS message will be transmitted at a rate to ensure that all aircraft in the TIS-B 
service area can receive the service status message at least every 20 seconds (95%). If the aircraft moves from the coverage of one ground station to another (ie it logs on to a new ground station) which does not support the TIS-B service then the aircraft will receive a DoS message indicating that the TIS-B service is unavailable (from the new ground station). This message will also be received within 20 seconds 95% of the time. 

Aircraft that have been receiving the TIS-B service available messages that stop receiving service available messages and do not receive a TIS-B service unavailable message will timeout after 40 seconds and indicate a loss of TIS-B. In addition, the ground stations also transmit information on the TIS-B service volume as part of the TIS-B messages broadcast to the aircraft. The TIS-B service volume is a set of coordinates defining the area in which the display of TIS-B targets can be expected on the CDTI. This information may be used either to display the service volume on the CDTI or to give a warning to the pilot that they are about to leave a TIS-B service volume and enter an area where no TIS-B service is provided.   
Note that it is currently assumed that VDL4 is only required to support TIS-B services and therefore only a TIS-B service flag has been define in the standards. However, if VDL4 is required to support ADS-R then the standards will be updated to provide for a combined TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status message in a similar manner to UAT and 1090ES. Alternatively, there are service status bits in the DoS message that are as yet undefined and could be used as a dedicated flag for ADS-R service status. 

Table H-2 provides more details of how to set TIS-B/ADS-R service status.

## H.5 General Issues H.5.1 Boundary Awareness

VDL4 transmits information on the TIS-B service volume in the TIS-B messages, so aircraft using the TIS-B service are aware of when they approaching the service boundary. For 1090ES and UAT systems, in order to receive TIS-B service, ownship must have produced valid position data within the last 30 seconds and must be under surveillance of at least one secondary surveillance radar.  The requirement for being under radar coverage is currently the only boundary awareness implemented in the U.S.  
Ideally, the boundary awareness would allow aircraft to know that they are close to a TIS-B/ADS-R service boundary, and thus may not have a complete traffic picture. The ground system would communicate boundary awareness by indicating loss of service before the boundary is exceeded.   
Optimally the ground system would indicate loss of service when the client:  

- 
Is within 15 NM laterally of the service boundary, all altitudes. 
- 
Descends within 500 feet of the service floor while under 3000 feet AGL. 
- 
Descends within 1500 feet of service floor while at or above 3000 feet AGL 

## H.5.2 Tcas Equipped Aircraft

TCAS equipped aircraft will display a target as a TCAS symbol even if ADS-B/ADS-
R/TIS-B are unavailable, thus it is unnecessary for a TCAS equipped aircraft to indicate that the traffic picture is not as complete as possible.     

## H.5.3 Rf Mitigation

The TIS-B ground system sends TIS-B/ADS-R service status to aircraft that indicate they are capable of ADS-B In. 

## H.5.4 Combined Tis-B/Ads-R Service Status

The avionics will display a single "TIS-B/ADS-R Unavailable" message regardless of whether TIS-B or ADS-R is unavailable, thus the ground system only needs to provide one combined TIS-B/ADS-R service status message.  If the client is outside of either TIS-B or ADS-R, the client is considered Out-of-Service.   

## H.5.5 Nuisance Status Changes Near Boundaries

Aircraft flying near boundaries, such as near a vertical boundary in the vicinity of an airport could enter and exit coverage repeatedly.  To avoid nuisance transitions of Traffic Status in the cockpit, transitions from Out-of-Service to In-Service should be inhibited until 30 seconds has elapsed from the previous transition to Out-of-Service. 

## H.5.6 International Harmonization

Most countries will not have ADS-R or TIS-B.  Manufacturers can create an installation method to disable TIS-B/ADS-R service status.  This lock-out will disable the "TIS-
B/ADS-R Unavailable" message generated by the TIS-B/ADS-R service status.  Flight manual supplements would have to address this international option.   

## H.6 Display Concept Example

The following is an example ASA status indication concept.  This concept is not required and does not include application status.  The overarching requirement is for all status indications to be displayed in a manner consistent with the overall flight deck design philosophy.   

CDTI Display 
Meaning 
-  ASSAP and CDTI are functioning

-  Ownship is receiving TIS-B/ADS-R Service 
-  Ownship Position Source information meets the requirements in Table 
2-3 
ADS-B Fail 
-  ADS-B System is Failed (ASSAP or CDTI monitor indicates a failure) -  Ownship position is invalid or does not meet the requirements in Table 2-3 
Or 
ADS-B Inop 
 
TIS-B/ADS-R 
Unavailable 
TIS-B or ADS-R is unavailable.  The traffic picture is not as complete as possible. 
ADS-B TEST 
ADS-B System is in Test Mode 
ADS-B OFF 
The ADS-B System has been turned off or the transponder has been turned to off or to standby in transponder based systems.   

## H.7 Limitations Of Approach

There are several limitations which should be documented in the Flight Manuals: 

- 
Boundary Awareness:  When near boundaries of TIS-B/ADS-R coverage the system may not depict all possible traffic.   
- 
Non Transponder/ADS-B Equipped aircraft:  Aircraft not equipped with a transponder or ADS-B Out system will not be depicted on the ownship's 
CDTI.   
- 
The system won't account for all targets outside of radar coverage or ground station coverage.

## H.9 Uat Tis-B/Ads-R Service Status Management Message

The UAT service status message is part of the FIS-B Ground Uplink message.  When the Frame Type is the binary value "1111", the Frame Data contains TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status data. The UAT TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status is conveyed as a list of target addresses for aircraft/vehicles to which the status pertains. Each TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status is client centric and packed sequentially into the Frame Data portion of the UAT Information Frame. A single Ground Uplink message could convey a maximum of 105 TIS-B/ADS-R client addresses if all payload of the Ground Uplink message is used for this message. The TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status message can pack the TIS-B/ADS-R 
client addresses under a single Information Frame (instead of 1 I-Frame per address). The data frame content is broken down into 32 bit sections outlined in Table H-5.

## Appendix I Assap Test Scenario Generation I.1 Purpose

Section 3.2.7 describes specific aircraft trajectory sets that are used to provide stimulus scenarios for ASSAP testing.  For each trajectory set, multiple scenarios are created by assigning various sources (e.g., ADS-B, TIS-B, etc.) to each trajectory. Each source is simulated by taking an idealized truth trajectory and adding real-world position noise. For ADS-B and ADS-R this position noise is best described as a Gaussian bias plus random 
"jitter" consistent with a NACP = 5 (minimum NACP for any application). For TIS-B and TCAS, modeled position noise is based on flight data (e.g., observed TCAS range and bearing distributions). The final step is to down sample the trajectory to simulate message transmission rate and probability of reception. Air-air link performance (for 1090ES and UAT ADS-B, and TCAS) is based on flight data, air-air link performance for VDL4 is based on accepted models, and ground-air link performance (ADS-R and TIS-B) is based on performance requirements in the SBS Specification. This appendix describes the assumptions and techniques used to generate 1090ES, UAT, VDL4, and TCAS test data for determination of realistic, achievable ASSAP processing performance levels. These levels of performance fed development of requirements for ASSAP surveillance and application processing.   

## I.2 Assumptions

This section describes the assumptions used for generation of ASSAP test data.  The ASSAP function processes data from a number of sources: 

•
ADS-B reports formulated by message transmissions from other aircraft.
•
TIS-B reports formulated by messages transmitted from the ground, based on radar and other sensor information.
•
ADS-R reports formulated by messages transmitted from the ground, based on ground receptions of the ADS-B data link not installed in ownship.
•
TCAS track updates from other nearby aircraft.
Section I.2.1 discusses assumptions governing the ADS-B avionics; Section I.2.2 
describes the TIS-B process assumptions; Section I.2.3 discusses ADS-R; and Section I.2.4 describes the TCAS model used.  Note that many assumptions were made for the first version of this document.  Some of these assumptions may conflict with information observed during the period in between publications of the first and second versions of the document due to avionics and ground system development.  However, it is strongly believed that the original assumptions still provide near worst cases for testing purposes as many assumptions are more pessimistic than reality. For example, observed TIS-B 
update rates in many areas are greater than the assumed value, thus making the test data more challenging to process than real world data. 

## I.2.1 Ads-B Avionics

1090ES and UAT ADS-B avionics are categorized by class, which indicates different transmit/receive capabilities according to the type of aircraft (e.g., General Aviation or Air Transport).  In order to avoid multiple repetitive data sets to accommodate all possible combinations of different types of ADS-B equipage, the data scenarios are characterized by Message Success Rate (MSR).  This allows the scenarios to be equipage-independent (e.g., no need to use different transmit powers or receiver sensitivities), as well as providing a way to perform sensitivity analysis on the algorithm used in the model. It is also assumed that the avionics are equipped with GPS systems that provide updates at a 1 Hz rate. Section I.2.1.1 describes the assumptions governing on-board latency for the ADS-B system components, while Section I.2.1.2 discusses accuracy and integrity of the information transmitted by the system. 

Data synthesis for VDL4 ADS-B systems is based on UAT data generation and described in more detail in Section I.3. 

## I.2.1.1 Latency

It is assumed that 500 ms passes from position Time of Measurement (TOM) to the time the data arrives at the ADS-B system and 1 second for the position information to be transmitted.  The scenario generation assumes that the 500 ms is uncompensated for 1090ES systems.  However, the position at that time is then extrapolated each 200 ms to correspond to a TOA that is within 100 ms of the transmit time. 

## I.2.1.2 Accuracy And Integrity

Minimum values have been assumed for the accuracy and integrity parameters that characterize the quality of the position information being transmitted.  In the scenario data generation there are a number of error sources that are accounted for, including errors on the horizontal position and the altitude. The horizontal position error accounts for GPS uncertainties, extrapolation errors, and the error introduced by uncompensated latency.  The minimum values assumed for accuracy and integrity are NACP = 5, NIC = 
4, and NACV = 1, in order to represent a near worst case. The altitude error is comprised of a standard barometric error model, which is then combined with quantization that results in altitude increments of 25 or 100 feet.   

## I.2.2 Tis-B

The ground system service provider receives radar (and other sensor) data for unequipped aircraft. Section I.2.2.1 describes the assumptions regarding the radar characteristics of the position information.  Section I.2.2.2 discusses the assumptions regarding the TIS-B 
processing that ingests the radar information and prepares messages for uplink.  Section I.2.2.3 describes the transmission assumptions.   
Note: There are currently no plans to provide a TIS-B service using VDL4 ground infrastructure.    

## I.2.2.1 Radar

The TIS-B component of scenario data generation requires realistic radar data that is used to provide input to the TIS-B processor, which then outputs tracked data for uplink.  The radar input data was simulated using a model developed by MIT-LL based on the characteristics of a MSSR radar [Ref MIT1].  The features of this model and other assumptions about the radar are described in Sections I.2.2.1.1 through I.2.2.1.4.

## I.2.2.1.1 Processing Latency

The time that it takes for the radar to process and format the target update is modeled as a Gaussian process that has a mean of 400 ms, with a standard deviation of 40 ms.  This time represents the period from the Time of Measurement (TOM) to delivery of the information to the automation system.  This distribution was derived from Common ARTS (CARTS) Flight Test Data [Ref CARTS1].

## I.2.2.1.2 Error Model

The scenario generation process introduces modifications to the smooth radar tracks in order to simulate real-world radar measurements.  Each of these adjustments will be described in more detail below.  First, random radar error models are used to modify the radar track data to provide normal measurement jitter on position values derived from the smooth radar tracks.  This process treats the errors in the azimuthal and range directions as separate Gaussian distributions.  On top of those random errors, the model superimposes a number of observed biases.  The final range and azimuth values are then subjected to the quantization of values imposed by the CD-2 format used to report the radar measurements. The model adds a jitter on both the range and azimuth values provided by the smooth radar track, based on normal distributions with zero mean and standard deviations of 0.068° for azimuth and 25 feet for range.  In addition to these random errors, both range and azimuth are subject to a bias component, up to 1 ACP in the case of azimuth and up to 200 feet transponder bias for the range value.  The azimuth bias is due to the rotating radar, and is presumed to be the same for aircraft nearby each other; however, the range bias resulting from inaccurate transponder delays will vary from aircraft to aircraft. Finally, the calculated range and azimuth values, which include both the random errors and biases, are quantized to CD-2 restrictions: 1/64 NM for terminal radar range values and 1 ACP for azimuth values. 

## I.2.2.1.3 Range From Targets

The aircraft are assumed to be 40 NM from the radar location for scenario sets 1, 2, and 3.  For scenario 4-1, the aircraft are placed at locations as measured from the actual sensor location.  The distance from the sensor affects the magnitude of the azimuth error in terms of distance around the aircraft. 

## I.2.2.1.4 Update Probability Per Sweep

It is assumed that the radar updates each target on every sweep (i.e., the update probability per sweep is set to 100%). 

## I.2.2.2 Tis-B Processing

The TIS-B processing system receives radar position updates and ADS-B reports received from equipped aircraft.  It then incorporates the radar updates into tracks, and correlates the ADS-B reports with the radar tracks.  The TIS-B processor then prepares messages to be uplinked through the transmitter for radar tracks that do not have associated ADS-B reports. 

## I.2.2.2.1 Latency

The latency for TIS-B processing is assumed to be uniformly distributed between 1.3 seconds and 1.5 seconds from the point where radar updates are received to the Time of Transmission of the uplink messages. This latency includes the transmit latency so that need not be considered separately. 

## I.2.2.2.2 Update Interval

The scenario generator assumes that the TIS-B update interval is six seconds corresponding to a six-second sweep from a single radar.  Every six seconds the scenario generator produces six 1090 ES uplink messages and/or one UAT uplink message for each aircraft unequipped with ADS-B.  The TIS-B uplink messages are characterized by MSR (see Section I.2.1), which is ADS-B link-dependent.  For 1090ES the MSR may be varied from 20% to 40% to determine the effect on the ASSAP processing algorithm performance, while for UAT the limits would be different. 

## I.2.2.2.3 Extrapolation

For 1090ES the TIS-B position is extrapolated to within 100 ms of the TOT, while for UAT the TIS-B position is extrapolated to the beginning of the Universal Time, Coordinated (UTC) second during which the transmission takes place.   

## I.2.3 Ads-R

The ground service receives ADS-B transmissions from equipped aircraft and translates the received ADS-B information into ADS-B messages for uplink on the other ADS-B 
data link (e.g., information in ADS-B messages received on 1090ES are rebroadcast by the ground on UAT).  This service provides ADS-B information on both links to all equipped users, regardless of the ADS-B equipage.  The following subsections discuss the ADS-R latency and uplink message characteristics, including probability of uplink message transmission, update interval, and media access.   
Note:  There are currently no plans to provide an ADS-R service using VDL4 ground infrastructure.    

## I.2.3.1 Ads-R Latency

The data generation assumes a narrow distribution near one second to choose an overall ground latency for ADS-R. 

--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## I.2.3.2 Ads-R Uplink Transmission

The transmission of ADS-R uplink messages is triggered by the reception of a ground report from the other ADS-B link. Thus, the update interval of ADS-R messages depends on the update interval of ground reports. The ground report update interval is assumed to be 3 and 6 seconds 95% of the time for terminal and en route domains respectively. The message reception probabilities necessary to achieve these update intervals are 0.63 for UAT, 0.39 for 1090ES in the terminal area, and 0.22 for 1090ES in the en route domain. The time interval for ADS-R transmissions is 5 seconds in the terminal domain and 10 seconds in the en route domain, 95% of the time.  The data generation assumes probability for the reception of an ADS-R uplink message by the airborne systems (0.9 
for UAT, 0.45 for 1090ES in the terminal area, 0.26 for 1090ES in the en route domain). The number of messages generated for each uplink is then given as 1 for UAT and 3 for 
1090ES with the latter composed of two position and one velocity squitters. For UAT in the terminal area this provides an average of 1 uplink every 3 seconds, or 5/3 uplinks every ADS-R update period of 5 seconds. For 1090ES this provides an average of 3 
uplinks every 3 seconds or 5 uplinks in 5 seconds. The transmitted position is time registered to the TOA required for each data link. 

## I.2.4 Tcas

TCAS data was generated for each Proximate target with respect to the specified ownship target for each scenario.  Proximate targets were interrogated once per second by the ownship aircraft.  The true range and bearing were recorded.  The reports were delayed by 100ms and a 99% message success rate was applied. Receptions of TCAS reports were limited by 4/3 earth line of sight and a maximum range of 60 nautical miles.  The final TCAS output was generated using a MITRE TCAS model.  

## I.3 Data Generation Process

Data generation begins with the calculation of truth waypoints that describe the scenarios as specified in 2.7.5. In the case of Scenario 4-1, the truth waypoints were synthesized from radar data using a smoothing process. For each aircraft in a scenario, 1090ES and UAT ADS-B messages are generated at a link-specific interval and with the characteristics as specified in I.2.1. The ADS-B message is received by the ownship aircraft and ground receivers. VDL4 ADS-B generation involved post-processing of synthetic UAT data.  Assumptions include a transmission rate of 2.5 seconds for state data, 5 seconds for data quality parameters, and independent probabilities of reception of 0.97. The first step in the VDL4 data generation process was upsampling of UAT scenario data to 10 Hz.  Note that applied position errors (e.g., bias) propagate to upsampled positions.  VDL4 messages were then generated by downsampling the 10 Hz positions to 2.5 second update intervals. NIC and SIL values (4 and 0 respectively) were included in state data messages. 

Separate data quality parameter messages (with NACP = 5, NACV = 1) were generated with an update rate of 5 seconds.  Probabilities of reception were then applied to state data and data quality messages to synthesize VDL4 reports. The ground receiver generates reports as specified in I.2.3.1. The ADS-B reports are forwarded to an ADS-R function that applies latency and schedules ADS-R rebroadcasts. 

When rebroadcast, the transmit function extrapolates, if necessary, to the Time of Transmission. In addition to the ADS-R, TIS-B is broadcast from the ground transmitter. 

TIS-B data originates from a radar function which applies error and latency to radar reports as described in 0. The TIS-B function is triggered by the reception of a radar report and schedules a set of TIS-B messages to be transmitted according to 0. 

The ownship function performs three main pieces of functionality, including: 1) provide ownship state vectors, 2) receive ADS-B, ADS-R, and TIS-B data, and 3) generate TCAS 
reports. The ownship state vectors are generated at the rate and with latency and errors as specified in the link specific Section of I.2.1. The ownship reports are recorded in a file named "ownship.csv" per the format in Table I-1. The ADS-B, ADS-R, and TIS-B 
messages are received by the ownship where the message success rate is applied for each surveillance type. Reports are generated and recorded in files named "adsb.csv", 
"adsr.csv", or "tisb.csv" according to the format in Table I-1.  
Note: *Field 17 is only used in ownship reports.*

## Appendix J System  Interface  Boundaries And Latency  Allocation J.1 Introduction

The complete ADS-B Air-to-Air (and Ground-to-Air) system consists of several interfaces (refer to Figure J-1 and Figure J-2).  The existing literature (DO-289, DO-
242(), DO-282(), and DO-260()/ED-102()) defines several names for these interfaces and allocates latency between them. This Appendix will present and amend the terms used and clarify which parts of the latency budget are allocated between the various interfaces. The definitions discussed in this Appendix are meant to aid the reader when interpreting the latency allocation requirements in Table 2-2 and Table 2-3 in the main body of the ASA MOPS. It is important to manage latency at the system integration level to minimize the latency and the uncertainty of the latency (i.e., how the latency differs between position updates). The easiest way to ensure this design goal is met is to provide a direct connection between the position source and the ADS-B equipment. Any other system blocks between them will increase latency and uncertainty. In some cases, this increase in uncertainty can have a more detrimental effect than the latency itself. 

## J.1.1 Latency Definitions

Total Latency: is the total time between the availability of information at an lower interface 'X' to the time of completion of information transfer at an upper interface 'Y'. Total Latency is the sum of Compensated Latency and Latency Compensation Error and is expressed as a single upper value. The related position error is the product of Total Latency and acceleration uncertainty valid for the duration of the Total Latency. 

Compensated Latency: is that part of Total Latency that is compensated for to a new time of applicability, valid at an interface 'Y', through data extrapolation aiming at reducing the effects of latency. Compensated Latency may change for each new received/processed track. The related position error is the product of Compensated Latency and the accuracy error of the A/V velocity used for the extrapolation. 

Latency Compensation Error (formerly referred to as "Uncompensated Latency"): is that part of Total Latency that is not compensated and/or under-/overcompensated for. 

The value is usually positive but overcompensation might produce negative values as well. The Latency Compensation Error may change for each new received/processed track. The related position error is the product of Latency Compensation Error and true A/V velocity. 

Time of applicability (TOA): at an interface 'Y', is the TOA as valid at a lower interface 'X' plus the amount of Compensated Latency applied to and valid at an upper interface 'Y'. Therefore, the Time of Applicability uncertainty is the (sum of) Latency Compensation Errors up to interface 'Y'. Regarding the notion of a "common" TOA, it is noted that the time of applicability uncertainty will generally vary between tracks. 

## J.2 System Interfaces

In the following, the term "system interface" expresses timing reference points. With respect to timing requirements, each interface is associated with the time the last bit of a complete data (or signal) set has been transferred over that interface. Figure J-2 below provides for a detailed end-to-end latency diagram, showing the latency components of both ADS-B Transmit aircraft and ASA aircraft. 

The following Figure J-1 provides for a simple indication of the ASA System latency interfaces with respect to both ownship and traffic position information.

## J.2.1 Interface A1

Interface A1 is defined as the input to the position sensor of an ASA Transmit Participant. The time associated with this physical interface is called the Time of Measurement. The term Time of Measurement has a very specific meaning in the GNSS literature. It is the time that the Satellite Measurements are sampled with the GNSS RF hardware. Depending on the regulatory document and the equipment class that the GNSS is certified to, the time between the Time of Measurement (A1) and the Time of Applicability (A4) can be 300 ms to 1 second. To meet the Latency allocations in these MOPS, the maximum Total Latency between A1 and A4 may not exceed 500 ms.  

## J.2.2 Interface A2

Interface A2 is defined as the input to the position sensor of a TIS-B Participant or the reception of position data of an ADS-R Participant. The time associated with this physical interface is called the Time of Measurement or Time of Reception respectively. 

This interface is not depicted in Figure J-2; refer to Figure 1-1. 

## J.2.3 Interface A3

Interface A3 is identical to A1 but is defined as applicable to the ownship position source. 

This interface is not depicted in Figure J-2; refer to Figure 1-1. 

## J.2.4 Interface A4

Interface A4 is introduced in this appendix and defined as the output of the position sensor of an ASA Transmit Participant. The time associated with this physical interface is called the Time of Applicability. 

The term Time of Applicability has a very specific meaning in the GNSS literature. It is the time that the digital solution transmitted from the sensor is applicable. This Time of Applicability coincides with the leading edge of a pulse known as the Time Mark. A GNSS sensor provides this pulse on a dedicated set of pins; usually as a differential pair to provide better noise immunity. The reported digital solution quality metrics (accuracy, integrity) are also valid at the Time of Applicability. Latency present in the system after Interface A4 is NOT accounted for in the quality metrics provided by the GNSS including the Latency inherent in delivering the data to Host/Link Equipment. The latency between A4 and B1 is to be included when establishing the ADS-B State Data Latency.  

## J.2.5 Interface A5

This interface is identical to A4 but is defined as applicable to the ownship position source. As between A4 and B1, the latency between A5 and B3 resulting from the various system elements that can be included between both interfaces, has to be included when establishing the ownship State Data Latency. This interface is not depicted in Figure J-2. 

## J.2.6 Interface B1

Interface B1 is defined as the input to the ADS-B Transmit Subsystem. The requirements of this function are controlled by DO-260()/ED-102(), DO-282() and ED-108(). In a distributed architecture, there could be various system elements between A4 and B1. For instance, a modern integrated cockpit with a high speed databus may require a block of circuitry on either side of it to transfer PVT data on and off of the bus.  
For GNSS systems, the maximum Total Latency between A4 and B1 may not exceed 400 
ms. This latency is usually not compensated for and, hence, becomes part of the Latency Compensation Error budget. 

## J.2.7 Interface B2

Interface B2 is defined as the input to the TIS-B & ADS-R Surveillance Processing and Distribution system. This interface is not depicted in Figure J-2, refer to Figure 1-1. 

## J.2.8 Interface B3

Interface B3 is defined as the input to the ASSAP function on ownship. This interface is not depicted in Figure J-2, refer to Figure 1-1. 

## J.2.9 Interface D

Interface D is defined as the Time of Transmission (i.e., the RF message leaving the transmit antenna). Depending on which transmit case is implemented in the link equipment, the Transmit Time of Applicability may coincide with the Time of Transmission or be within some specified time tolerance between these (refer to Appendix M).  
For the purposes of latency allocation, Travel Time is not significant. Therefore, Interface D also defines the Time of Reception (i.e., the RF message arriving at the receive antenna). The Link Transmit and Receive Equipment requirements are controlled by DO-260()/ ED- 102(), DO-282() and ED-108(). 

## J.2.10 Interface E

Interface E is defined as the time an ADS-B (or TIS-B/ADS-R) Report is delivered to ASSAP. ASSAP requirements are controlled by this document. The ASSAP function will extrapolate the traffic positions to a common time of applicability, within required tolerances, prior to performing application specific calculations and passing the traffic to the CDTI interface (F). In an integrated architecture, Interface E may not be observable. For example, in an Air Transport installation, it is possible that the ADS-B Receiver will be integrated with the TCAS II equipment that may also implement the ASSAP requirements. 

## J.2.11 Interface F

Interface F is defined as the time the ownship and traffic tracks are delivered to the CDTI. For architectures that do not process ownship and traffic data together, the Time of Delivery at interface F might differ. The latency budget allocated between E and F was relaxed by the ASA MOPS Working Group from the numbers published in DO-289 and the numbers published in DO-322 / 
ED-165. Analysis by the ASA MOPS Working Group established a latency allocation presented in Table 2-2 and Table 2-3 based on a feasibility study of implementing ASSAP in TCAS II equipment and supporting legacy equipment upgrades.  

## J.2.12 Interface G

Interface G is defined as the Time of Display, i.e., the time when the track information appears on the display. The CDTI function may translate and rotate the traffic as needed to maintain a smooth and consistent display. The CDTI function is not required to extrapolate the traffic from the ASSAP Time of Applicability to the Time of Display. However, it may be desirable for the ASSAP Time of Applicability (at interface F) to coincide with the Time of Display by design to minimize display latency. 

1.
The Time Mark is an implementation detail of an ARINC 743A compliant GNSS. Other position sensors may not output a
Time Mark.
2.
Transmit Time of Applicability (TTOA) may occur before, after, or coincide with Time of Transmission (TOT) depending on
the ADS-B link implementation.
3.
GNSS Engine Design Tolerance is dependent on the implementation of the GNSS engine, but typically is on the order of microseconds.
4.
DO-229D requires that the digital solution associated with the Time Mark be delivered in 200 ms.

## J.3 Decomposition Of Asa System Latency Components

To enhance clarity in the definition and application of the ASA MOPS latency requirements, the ASA system latency components are proposed to be first described as follows, see also Figure J-3. For simplicity, interfaces B3/E are not shown. 

CEF: 
compensation error at interface F, i.e., valid between A3/D<=>F 
CLF: 
compensated latency at interface F, i.e., valid between A3/D<=>F 
DL: 
display latency, i.e., DL=TG-TF (F<=>G) 
CLG: 
(forward) compensated latency (within ASSAP or CDTI), valid between F<=>G 
CEG:  
compensation error, valid between F<=>G: CEG = DL - CLG 
TCL/TCE:  total latencies: TCL = CLF + CLG; TCE = CEF + CEG 
+ TCL (= CLF + CLG)
CEF
Thereby, the compensation error is defined as the sum of uncompensated latency, latency compensation uncertainty (e.g., due to time stamp uncertainty) and possible deliberate overcompensation (i.e., forward compensation, by convention expressed as a negative latency value). 

The "Initial" TOA coincides with the time valid at interface A3 or D, respectively. In general, between a lower interface 'X' and an upper 'Y', the TOA at interface 'Y' equals TOA at interface 'X' plus CLX=>Y. The Display TOA is the time valid at interface G. Its difference with the actual display of track information, i.e., the time TG at interface G, is the total compensation error from A3/D to G. It is noted that the Display Latency (DL) can be greater or smaller than the latency compensation valid between F<=>G (CLG). It is further noted that the Display Latency 
(DL) might differ between the individual tracks included in a batch provided by ASSAP 
for display. On a similar token, the TOA at interface F will generally differ between the individual tracks included in an ASSAP batch (refer to requirements 2346 and 2347).

## J.3.1 Application Of Latency Decomposition To Asa Mops Latency Requirements

Total Latency (TL), between initial time of applicability and actual time of display 
('A3/D''G') (applies to both position and velocity): 

•
TL Ownship: TG- TA3 ≤ 3.5 s (requirement 2314)
•
TL Traffic: TG - TD ≤ 3.5 s (requirement 2315)
The Total Latency is a single value and established as the total maximum not-to-exceed end-to-end latency between A3/D and G, as per design of the given architecture. 

## Differential Toa Uncertainty Between Ownship & Any Traffic At 'F', (I.E., Between 'A3/D' And F'):

•
The absolute difference in TOA between ownship and any traffic positions at ASSAP Application processing shall be within 0.5 s  (requirement 2347)
•
Hence, the corresponding ΔTOA-OT at interface F (between ownship 'O and any
traffic 'T') can be described as: ΔCEF-OT = | CEF-O - CEF-T | ≤ 0.5 s
The Differential TOA Uncertainty at interface F spans between two values, i.e., between the difference of the maximum value of CEF-O and the minimum value of CEF-T on the one hand, and the difference of the minimum value of CEF-O and the maximum value of CEF-T on the other. These minimum and maximum values are to be established as per design of the given architecture. 

ΔTOA-F
TA3

## Differential Toa Uncertainty Between Any Traffic At 'F', (I.E., Between 'D' And F'):

•
The absolute difference in TOA between any traffic positions at ASSAP Application
processing shall be within 0.2 s  (requirement 2346)
•
Hence, the corresponding ΔTOA-TT at interface F (between any traffic '1' and '2')
can be described as: ΔCEF-TT = | CEF-T2 - CEF-T1 | ≤ 0.2 s.
The Differential TOA Uncertainty at interface F spans between two values, i.e., between the difference of the maximum value of CEF-T2 and the minimum value of CEF-T1 on the one hand, and the difference of the minimum value of CEF-T2 and the maximum value of CEF-T1 on the other. These minimum and maximum values are to be established as per design of the given architecture. 

ΔTOA-F

## Individual Display Toa Uncertainty, Per Ownship & Traffic ('A3/D''G'):

•
Independently per each ownship and traffic positions, the absolute difference in
display TOA and actual time of display shall be within 1.0 s.
•
Hence, TCE = | CEF + DL - CLG | <= 1.0 s.
•
It is noted that, in line with this requirement, the "Differential Display TOA" between ownship/traffic and traffic/traffic might be up to 2 seconds. This difference of common time of applicability at display can be described by the difference of the
total compensation uncertainty "ΔTCE", i.e., ΔTCE = | ΔCEF + ΔDL - ΔCLG |
| ΔDTOA | up to 2s own x traffic x However, it is noted that not much forward extrapolation beyond TG is expected to be applied by the ASA system. Hence, the individual Display TOA values are expected to be smaller rather than larger than TG. In addition, requirements 2346 and 
2347 (the latter in case ownship position information is routed through ASSAP) 
provide for some considerable bounding of the difference of compensation error at interface 'F'. 

The Individual Display TOA Uncertainty spans between two values and is established as the total not-to-exceed end-to-end latency compensation error between A3/D and G, i.e., the sum of the minimum and maximum values, respectively, of the various contributing latency compensation error components. These minimum and maximum values are to be established as per design of the given architecture. 

## J.3.2 Proposed Allocation Of Asa Mops Total Latency Requirements

System components.

Note: As a consequence of the ownship F-G requirement, an ASA system deploying a 1 
Hz display update rate without some synchronization between ASSAP output and display (i.e., a sufficiently small DL) would not be compliant. 

## J.4 Traceability Between Asa Mops And Spr/Interop Latency Requirements

Table J-2 first summarizes the ownship and traffic Total Latency and Total Compensation Error requirements as established per application in the respective SPR/INTEROP material.

1. EVAcq latency requirements are consistent with AIRB. 2. For VSA and AIRB, the interface G corresponds to the "time of observation by flight 
crew". Assuming a 1 Hz display refresh rate, the corresponding ASA MOPS requirements for Total Compensation Uncertainty would therefore be 1.5s for traffic (interfaces 'D' to 'G') and 0.6s for ownship (interfaces 'B3' to 'G'). 
3.
For ITP, the overarching assumption is that the maximum differential uncompensated latency of 4.575 s is met for worst-case scenario of the applicable
individual compensation uncertainty requirements.
It is further noted that ITP requirements are expressed as 99.999% values, scaled from 95% values (e.g., MASPS 1.5s/95% for ownship uncompensated latency)

4.
Overall, the SURF application establishes the most stringent latency requirements throughout.
Table J-3 summarizes the traceability between the ASA MOPS and the respective SPR/INTEROP requirements as applicable to ownship and traffic.

## Appendix M Time Of Applicability In Existing Link Mops Appendix M Time Of Applicability In Existing Link Mops M.1 Introduction

Each ADS-B state vector message has an associated Time of Applicability. The means of conveying Time of Applicability is not the same in every case. This appendix summarizes the different cases of Time of Applicability for the published link MOPS: DO-260B / ED-102A, DO-282B and ED-108A. 

## M.2 Do-260B / Ed-102A  Transmit Time Of Applicability (Ttoa)

DO-260B / ED-102A defines two choices for Transmit Time of Applicability (TTOA): 
Time of Transmission (TOT) and 200 ms UTC Epochs.  These two choices are referred to in DO-260B / ED-102A as T = 0 and T = 1 respectively. In both cases, the actual Time of Transmission (TOT) and Transmit Time of Applicability (TTOA) are asynchronous processes.  This is because of the nature of the transmit requirements. In general, position messages are broadcast at random intervals uniformly distributed between 400 ms and 600 ms. This 'jitter' is introduced such that no two transmitters continuously interfere with each other. A T = 1 1090 MHz installation must have the 1 Pulse Per Second (1 PPS) Time Mark hardware wired from the GNSS sensor to the ADS-B transmit unit in addition to the digital bus that delivers the position solution. Such an installation is said to be synchronized. A T = 0 installation is not required to have this Time Mark input. It is possible to implement a system that uses the Time Mark to remove Bias Latency from the T = 0 case. That possibility is not discussed below as it is unlikely to be implemented by vendors. 

## M.2.1 Do-260B / Ed-102A  Unsynchronized Case

Refer to Figure M-1 for a graphical depiction of the unsynchronized case.  There are three asynchronous processes operating in this figure: the position updates, the position encoding, and the position transmission.   
Position updates occur at the Time of Delivery (TOD).  They are depicted as large black dots.  In the figure, the TOD is depicted as a perfect 1 second update rate for simplicity. In reality, the position update time period varies. Position encoding consists of extrapolating the position to the TTOA, performing the Compact Position Reporting (CPR) encode, and loading the position registers. Position encoding is required to occur at least once every 200 ms. This time is represented by the Position Encode time slice block in the processing timeline. Note that the Transmit Time of Applicability (TTOA) and the processing time are not the same time in the figure. This represents extrapolation to a future time as part of the encoding process. A 1090 MHz transponder position register may be read out at any time by a ground station or TCAS processor.  If a transmitter encodes the position data every 200 ms it must extrapolate the TTOA to be a time 100 ms in the future from the encoding time, this to ensure that the position state in the register will contribute less than ±100 ms of error.   A second way to minimize the time uncertainty in the position message is to encode the register more often than 200 ms. A design could combine more frequent updates with the future extrapolation technique to minimize the contributed time error. A third way to minimize time error is to choose the Transmit Time of Applicability to be exactly at the Time of Transmission 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
(TOT).  This can only be done during the 200 ms Epoch randomly chosen to Transmit in. For this third case, error due to the asynchronous transmit jitter can be significantly reduced at the cost of an asymmetric error budget during that 200 ms Epoch. So to say that another way, a design can optimize the error budget for accuracy at TOT by extrapolating exactly to TOT. The side effect of this is an asynchronous error budget around TOT. The position encoding for the unsynchronized case is required to contribute less than ±100 ms of error to the PVT data presented at the input to the ADS-B transmitter when measured at the TOT. DO-260B/ED-102A does not bound the bias latency of the PVT 
data presented at the input to the ADS-B transmitter, this is expected to be bound by certification documents are system or aircraft level. The position source types listed in the main body of the document are known to have bias latencies less than 200 ms.  

## M.2.2 Do-260B / Ed-102A Synchronized Case

In order to implement the synchronized case, a 1090 MHz transmitter must accept the GNSS Time Mark and UTC Time associated with the Time Mark.  This implies that the design makes use of a counter (or equivalent means) that software can read to measure how long ago the Time Mark arrived. This measurement combined with the UTC Time reported allows the ADS-B transmit device to encode position messages on exact 200 ms UTC Epochs within the tolerance of the software and hardware design. DO-260B / 
ED-102A requires that this process result in time errors less than ±100 ms of absolute error. The 100 ms requirement applies to any synchronized NIC value as well as for the unsynchronized case. Note that, in the synchronized case, there is really no reason to ever encode the register more often than 200 ms. Since the TTOA is clearly identified, successive encoding would theoretically result in the same answer.  Refer to Figure M-2 
for a graphical depiction of the synchronized case. 


## M.3 Do-282B Transmit Time Of Applicability (Ttoa)

DO-282B defines three cases for Transmit Time of Applicability (TTOA): Non-Precision UTC Coupled, Precision UTC Coupled, and Non-Coupled.  In a DO-282B unit, the term 
"Coupled" means that the GNSS Time Mark hardware is wired to the unit. This is a requirement for UAT. The Non-Coupled case is a degraded mode where the Time Mark hardware has failed. In the first two cases, the Time of Transmission (TOT) and the TTOA are known relative to each other. That is the TOT is identified relative to the TTOA within the ADS-B message. The TOT and TTOA are asynchronous in the Non-
Coupled case.  UAT position messages are broadcast at pseudo-random positions relative to the TTOA once per second.  The random broadcast times are introduced to prevent synchronous interference between transmitters. 

## M.3.1 Do-282B Non-Precision Utc Coupled Case

Refer to Figure M-3 for a graphical depiction of the UAT Non-Precision case.  There are two asynchronous processes operating in this case: the position updates and the position transmission.  Position updates occur at the Time of Delivery (TOD).  They are depicted as large black dots.  In the figure, the TOD is depicted as a perfect 1 second update rate for simplicity.  In reality, the position update time period varies.  Position encoding is required to occur only once per second. This time is represented by the Position Encode time slice block in the processing timeline. Note that the diagram represents position encoding as immediately following the position update. This is not a requirement. Position encoding may be performed at any time prior to the Time of Transmission (TOT).  Transmit Time of Applicability (TTOA) is defined as the absolute 1 second UTC Epoch prior to TOT.  DO-282B specifies TOT relative to the 1 second UTC Epoch. Data that allows the user to infer TOT is transmitted within the mode status payload approximately every fourth position message. This allows a receiver to perform a sanity check on the reported position by computing the range to the target. Travel time is computed by subtracting the TOT from the Time of Reception.  

## M.3.2 Do-282B Precision Utc Coupled Case

Refer to Figure M-4 for a graphical depiction of the UAT Precision case.  In this case, the Transmit Time of Applicability (TTOA) is defined as the beginning of each absolute 200 ms UTC Epoch.  DO-282B urges, but does not require, that a GNSS sensor should put out position updates at 200 ms intervals to be used in this case.  Note that the diagram depicts the position encoding as occurring for each 200 ms Epoch.  That is not a requirement.  Position encoding may only be performed once prior to the TOT as long as the TTOA is the correct 200 ms Epoch. 

## M.3.3 Do-282B Non-Coupled Case

No attempt is made to adjust position to a TTOA known by other observers.   

## Ed-108A Data Age (Da)

The VDL4 data radio interfaces to the surveillance data manager to provide essential data including position, velocity and Time of Applicability (TOA). In VDL4, the TOA of an ADS-B report is represented by a data age (da) parameter included in the ADS-B 
transmission (i.e., synchronization burst). Data age (da) is calculated as the difference between the Time of Transmission (TOT) and TOA. As VDL4 is a TDMA system the TOT is well known by both the transmitter and the receiver as it is the beginning of the time slot in which the transmission was made. The receiver can therefore easily calculate the TOA of the ADS-B data based on the TOT and the data age included with the ADS-B 
message.  
Table M-1 below shows how the latency of the ADS-B data between its TOA and TOT is encoded as the data age (da) parameter and how the da parameter is decoded by the receiver.

The TDMA slot structure, and therefore the TOT assumed when the da parameter is calculated and encoded in the ADS-B message, is derived from the onboard GPS/GNSS 
navigation sensors and is synchronized to UTC. The accuracy of the da parameter is therefore potentially influenced by the accuracy of the on board timing source.  
For the onboard timing source, the default mode of time synchronization for VDL4 station known as primary time. In primary time each superframe is synchronized with the start of any UTC second to within a 2-sigma value of 400 ns. If primary time is not available, a secondary time source is used where each superframe is synchronized with the start of any UTC second to within a 2-sigma value of 15 µs. In both cases, the timing accuracy has minimal impact on the accuracy of the data age parameter. At the worst case, secondary timing yields an uncertainty of 0.03% of the smallest decoded latency in Table M-1.

## Appendix O Basic Surface Situation Awareness In Asa System Mops Appendix O Basic Surface Situation Awareness In Asa System Mops O.1 Introduction

The current ASA MOPS no longer specifies requirements in relation to ASSA (Airport Surface Situation Awareness) and FAROA (Final Approach Runway Occupancy Awareness) applications as they have been superseded by the internationally agreed standards for SURF (Airborne Traffic Situation Awareness on the Surface) application. The SURF application is in these MOPS referred to as *Basic Surface Situation Awareness*. It should however be recognized that Basic Surface Situation Awareness builds upon the SURF and the ASSA and FAROA applications and only differs from the requirements in those applications where justified. The requirements for the SURF application are specified in DO-322/ED-165. However in the translation of those 'isolated application level' requirements into the 'integrated system level' requirements of these MOPS a few areas of divergence have occurred. These divergences are captured and justified in this appendix as 'differences' to the SURF SPR (DO-322/ED-165). This appendix also contains a method for alternative Position Qualification, adopted (with modifications) from the SURF SPR (DO-322/ED-165). 

## O.2 Design Assurance O.2.1 Ownship

The SURF SPR requires an ADS-B IN system integrity of 1x10E-5 i.e., 'MAJOR' criticality to be sufficient for use in all the operational scenarios addressed in the SURF SPR. It is recognized that the SURF analysis was based on the most stringent type of operations in the most stringent scenarios. The ASA MOPS instead decided to divide the operational scenarios into two classes of the SURF application. 'MINOR' criticality is acceptable provided that the use of the application is restricted to ownship operational scenarios below 80kts. Verifications with the SURF SPR shows that this does not exceed the SURF analysis since the more stringent operational scenarios drove the safety requirement are all based on ownship speed above 80kts. Hence allowing 'MINOR' criticality equipment under the given restrictions is formally not a difference but is rather to be seen as a further detailing of the SURF SPR requirements. 

## O.2.2 Traffic

From the ongoing work with building the baseline for ADS-B Out certification it is recognized that there may be a number of small 'recreational' aircraft (e.g., gliders) that will only transmit SDA=1 in their ADS-B messages. The SURF SPR 
required, based on the most stringent type of operations and in the most stringent scenarios,  that traffic need to transmit SDA of 2 or greater to be eligible for the SURF application.  
ASA MOPS identified that displaying SDA=1 traffic would generate large operational benefits in many scenarios (e.g., when operating into remote airports with local glider activity, etc.) 
The ASA MOPS assessed the display of SDA=1 traffic on the SURF traffic display as acceptable based on the rational that (1) in US Airspace traffic transmitting SDA of 1 will not be accepted in the regulated ADS-B airspace, which for example includes all large airports and (2) in European airspace the frequency that small 'recreational' aircraft transmitting SDA=1 will be operating in complex environments and scenarios as applicable to the SURF analysis is very low (in addition there is also the possibility that local airspace mandates for SDA of 2 or higher will be established around major European airports). It is also likely that similar rational will exists around other complex environments including stringent SURF scenarios. In other words, US and European regulations will limit the display of SDA=1 aircraft to airports and traffic densities in which they can be safely displayed. In general it is expected that there will be very few of the lower SDA aircraft at the bigger aerodromes. It was also acknowledged that the SURF SPR analysis did not assess applicable scenarios with SDA=1 traffic under these operational limitations.  
Consequently ASA MOPS requires that SDA=1 (or above) aircraft are displayed on the SURF traffic display.  

## O.3 Operational Concept - Cspa (Closely Spaced Parallel Approach)

The SURF SPR derives requirements for traffic position and velocity for airborne traffic on the basis of the two most driving operational scenarios. The two scenarios involve ownship on the ground (e.g., lined-up on the runway for takeoff) and traffic on approach to a closely spaced parallel runway as pictured in the diagrams below: 
Displayed Traffic Actual Traffic These scenarios reflect the operational capability to assess that aircraft on the traffic display are associated with the correct runway to avoid confusing the flight crew's traffic situation awareness in such situations. They also require lateral position accuracy for airborne traffic of 50m and directionality accuracy of 15º. In non-CSPA (closely spaced parallel approach) scenarios traffic position accuracy requirements can be relaxed to 185m (i.e., NACP =7 or better) when ownship is on the ground. In translating the airborne traffic requirements into the MOPS it was argued that the CSPA scenarios drive too stringent requirements limiting availability and hence operational use.  To increase availability ASA MOPS decided to reduce the operational concept and stress that pilots should not be using the SURF application in such a way as to determine the runway to which an aircraft was approaching, particularly when considering SURF as a situation awareness application. Pilots in particular expressed their concern on the envisaged scenario and agreed that it would be very difficult to tell which runway an aircraft was approaching. On the basis that sufficient pilot training and other operational mitigations (e.g., party-line communications) would be in place it was therefore decided that the CSPA scenarios would be considered outside the scope of the SURF application and therefore that airborne position and velocity requirements would be established on the basis of the next most stressing scenario (i.e., most stressing scenario excluding CSPA) resulting in horizontal position accuracy of 185m and a velocity accuracy of 10 m/s for airborne traffic. 

## O.4 Application Integration

The ATSA-SURF SPR required an accuracy of 0.1 NM for any airborne traffic, apart from the CSPA scenario addressed in Section A.3 above. While the SPR documents addressed each application in its own right the ASA MOPS group identified a need to enable efficient application integration. In order to do so joint scenarios where studied (e.g., when performing VSA operations towards a SURF airport). The ASA MOPS also addressed scenarios which had been out of scope in the SPR assessment, such as airborne traffic outside the Surface Volume. The ASA MOPS application integration work resulted in new requirements for Traffic outside the Surface Volume, aligned with the AIRB 0.5 NM accuracy requirements. The application integration work also modified the requirement for Airborne Traffic inside the Surface Volume when ownship is airborne to align with the VSA 0.3 NM accuracy requirements. The latter change was assessed acceptable as the modified position accuracy support airborne situation awareness scenarios (i.e., both ownship and traffic airborne) together with the fact that no *airborne situation awareness scenario* had been limiting in the SURF 
SPR analysis. The modified requirements are summarized in Table 2-2. 

## O.5 Display Pixel Resolution

In translating the SURF SPR assumption that the traffic display resolution is better (finer) than or equal to 3 m/pixel (when the display is zoomed such that the smallest dimension of the display corresponds to a distance of 1800m or less) it was agreed to make only a recommendation rather than a requirement in the ASA MOPS. 

## O.6 Directionality

This section addresses both Data Accuracy and Display Resolution changes made when translating the SURF SPR directionality requirements in to ASA MOPS.   

## O.6.1 Directionality Data Accuracy

ATSA-SURF specifies (in SPR.45 / PR.17) a data directionality accuracy requirement of 8º (95%) for traffic on the ground. In addition it spells out different display directionality needs depending on scenario (being 10º, 15º or 30º). The directionality requirements address both position extrapolation errors (due to latency compensation error) and the operational need for symbol orientation accuracy on the display.  

## O.6.1.1 Meeting The Directionality Data Accuracy

For traffic providing direction from a heading sensor, the data accuracy is assumed to be readily met. For traffic that provides directionality as track, directionality accuracy will depend upon the source velocity accuracy and ground speed, so there will be a speed below which the accuracy will become worse than 
8º. With the SURF required NACV ≥ 2 (< 3 m/s) velocity accuracy, the 8º data directional accuracy will be breached at speeds below 23 knots (using "midpoint NACV" performance, 2 m/s). A 23 knots directionality cutoff threshold was not deemed appropriate by the ASA MOPS group  

## O.6.1.2 Reassessment Of Surf Spr Scenarios

In re-assessing the SURF SPR operational scenarios that drove the original 10º 
displayed symbol directionality requirement, it was identified that some were high speed scenarios (e.g., rapid exit taxiways), in which track based directionality will be very good anyway. For other lower speed scenarios, where 10º or 15º displayed symbol directionality was originally required, the operational community conceded that a more relaxed (30º) directionality would be acceptable and better than not displaying directionality at all. For latency compensation error, the most demanding situation envisaged in the SURF SPR is for a high speed (50 knot) vehicle a taxiway parallel to a runway. This speed, in combination with an assumed heading error of 8º towards the adjacent runway will produce an across-track velocity accuracy component of 
50×tan(8º) = 7 knots (= 3.6 m/s). Clearly, this across-track velocity accuracy component is larger than would be the case for 3 m/s horizontal velocity accuracy (for 3 m/s overall velocity accuracy, the component in the across taxiway direction will be 2.4 m/s). This shows that traffic reporting directionality as track with an accuracy of 3 m/s or better will always meet the position extrapolation portion of the directionality requirement. 

## O.6.1.3 Symbol Orientation And Speed Threshold Requirements

Based on the results of the re-assessment, the ASA MOPS group concluded that the driving requirement for track based directionality, for ground traffic, is the symbol orientation limit for slow moving targets. A directionality accuracy of 30º was considered to be operationally acceptable for such scenarios. Hence, the remaining directionality data requirement, for track based directionality, are the thresholds when a slow moving target drops below 30º directionality accuracy.  
Based on a "midpoint NACV" numerical simulation it can be determined that this occurs when traffic speed drops below: 

- 
6 knots for traffic reporting a NACV of 2 
- 
2 knots for traffic reporting a NACV of 3 or 
- 
0.5 knots for traffic reporting a NACV of 4 

## O.6.2 Directionality Display Resolution

The SURF SPR requires a directionality display resolution of 12º or better (i.e., maximum of ±6º display quantization error). The ASA MOPS group identified that the ±6º display quantization error, although expected to be exceed by the majority of the displays, may require much more bit map memory for some installations compared to if the requirement would be slightly less stringent, allowing a ±7.5º display quantization error. The performance impact from changing the requirement was deemed small. Consequently, the ASA MOPS requires a maximum of ±7.5º display quantization error. 

## O.7 Latency O.7.1 Ownship Latency

The SURF SPR requires that the total latency of the Ownship horizontal position from the time of applicability at interface B2 to the time of display to the flight crew at interface G must not exceed 2 seconds (SPR.20). On manufacturers request investigations were made on the impact of increasing the latency budget with 0.5 seconds. Based on the estimated effect (see below) it was agreed that it could be increased to 2.5s without any significant safety or performance impact on the SURF application. 

## O.7.2 Traffic Latency

The SURF SPR requires that the total latency of the Traffic horizontal position from the time of applicability at interface D to the time of display to the flight crew at interface G must not exceed 3 seconds (SPR.27). On manufacturers request investigations were made on the impact of increasing the latency budget with 0.5 seconds. Based on the estimated effect (see below) it was agreed that it could be increased to 3.5s without any significant safety or performance impact on the SURF application. 

## O.7.3 Estimated Effect Of Increased Latency

In order to support the acceptability of the increased latency the impact on the position error was estimated. 

For 3 m/s velocity accuracy (95%) the Total (95%) Additional Position Error is bounded by: (0.5 s) * (3 m/s) * 0.8008 (distribution conversion factor) = 1.2 
meters For 10 m/s velocity accuracy (95%) the Total (95%) Additional Position Error is bounded by: (0.5 s) * (10 m/s) * 0.8008 (distribution conversion factor) = 4.0 
meters 

## O.8 Maximum Data Age

The ATSA-SURF SPR required a maximum data age of 11 seconds for moving traffic and 25 seconds for non-moving traffic. The ASA MOPS modified the requirement, making the data age requirement less stringent for airborne moving traffic in situations where the required position accuracy is less stringent than 0.1 NM. The rational for the change was based on that longer extrapolation times (increased uncertainty) is acceptable in situations where the required position accuracy is less stringent. More specifically the modified data age limits were based on simulation results of when a linear extrapolation of the position for an aircraft making a 0.5g turn would exceed the accuracy bound. The modified data age limits are summarized in Table 2-4.  

## O.9 Velocity Qualification

The SURF SPR requires a velocity accuracy of 3 m/s (NACV ≥ 2) for ground traffic. The limited ability for today's avionic configurations to qualify velocity data to a 3 m/s accuracy, despite that GPS receivers report very good velocity accuracy (in the order of 1-2 m/s), was recognized by the ASA MOPS group. ASA MOPS therefore provides an alternative method to qualify traffic velocity accuracy based on the knowledge that the transmitted velocity comes from a GPS receiver. The method targets to ensure a 3 m/s accuracy and hence is the alternative velocity qualification not a difference from the SURF SPR. The method of ensuring GPS velocity data that is valid for use is using the same criteria as used for alternative position qualification, which is derived in O.10. 

Note: SURF SPR also requires the 3 m/s velocity accuracy for airborne traffic but as argued under A.3 the airborne velocity requirements were relaxed in the ASA MOPS by reducing the operational concept. 

## O.10 Position Qualification - Extended Availability Risk Mitigation Plan

This section and its subsections contain a modified version of the Extended Availability Risk Mitigation Plan (RMP) presented as Appendix D in the ATSA-
SURF SPR. The modifications to the RMP relate to three areas 

- 
Removal of NIC criteria to determine that position information is from GPS-based sensors 
- 
Removal of alternative qualification method applicability for airborne traffic 
- 
Editorial changes  
The rational for the removal of the NIC criteria is provided in Section O.10.4. As argued under A.3, ASA MOPS did relax the airborne traffic requirement of 50 m (95%) to 185 m (95%) by reducing the operational concept. This fact removed the need for alterative qualification methods for airborne traffic. Finally, the editorial changes relate to adjustments to align the RMP with the changes mentioned above as well as integrating it as an appendix to this document. 

## O.10.1 Introduction

The ATSA-SURF SPR requires that qualified on-ground ATSA-SURF traffic has a minimum horizontal position uncertainty at the time of measurement (at the position source) of less than or equal to 30 m (95%) (SPR.31) and airborne ATSA-SURF traffic approaching closely spaced parallel runways has a minimum horizontal position uncertainty at the time of measurement (at the position source) of less than or equal to 50 m (95%) (SPR.32) to be able to be displayed on the Traffic Display. These requirements require a NACP ≥ 9, which significantly limits the availability for receiving qualified surveillance data from legacy SA-On GPS avionics sensors. 

Note: ASA MOPS, as argued under A.3, did relax the airborne traffic requirement of 50 m (95%) to 185 m (95%) by reducing the operational concept. 

This annex describes a risk management approach that can be applied by the ATSA-SURF Ownship that significantly extends the availability of traffic surveillance reports and thus provides immediate and early benefits of traffic situation awareness on the airport surface. Specifically, the risk mitigation plan described in this annex allows use of ATSA-SURF traffic surveillance data using 
7 ≤ NACP < 9 under certain conditions. 

Note: The risk management approach described in this Annex provides a 
means for extending the availability of ATSA-SURF traffic surveillance data. The 30 m horizontal position uncertainty bound represents the most stressing case for ATSA-SURF, representing the requirement for onground traffic (SPR.31).  

## O.10.2 Background

The 30 m (95%) horizontal position source accuracy requirement (SPR.30) is the result of the ATSA-SURF OSA analysis (Annex C in the SURF SPR) that provides the safety case for the Operational Hazard (OH1), i.e., "Traffic Display has erroneous information", and resulted in an overall Safety Objective (SO) for ATSA-SURF of 4E-03 / fh (refer to Table C.10 in the ATSA-SURF SPR). The factors that contribute to being able to meet the ATSA-SURF SO are illustrated in the OH1 fault tree. Typically these factors are related to the integrity of the individual system functions that comprise the application. However, the dominant factor that must be managed for ATSA-SURF to meet the SO is the "rare normal" horizontal position accuracy, not related to any equipment integrity failures. The 30 m (95%) horizontal position source accuracy thus sets the driving requirement for GNSS-based position data for ATSA-SURF. Unfortunately, many legacy avionics GPS sensors are unable to qualify their position accuracy to this level of performance; even when their actual position accuracy is much better than the required 30 m [measured demonstrated performance is typically 
~2 to 3 m]1. Due to the legacy of GPS selective availability, SA-ON GPS 
receivers are limited by design to output a 95% Horizontal Figure of Merit 
(HFOM) of typically not less than 60 m (and therefore be encoded in ADS-B 
OUT to NACP = 8 at best). SA-Aware GPS receivers are no longer limited to these artificially very conservative constraints and thus provide much better HFOM values that are within the ATSA-SURF accuracy requirement, but are still considerably more conservative than the demonstrated performance of GPS. The risk mitigation plan summarized in the next section provides a means for extending the availability of utilizing GPS-based legacy ADS-B OUT traffic for use by the ATSA-SURF application. 

## O.10.3 Risk Management Plan (Rmp) Summary

The RMP described in this annex extends the availability of being able to utilize ATSA-SURF traffic surveillance reports to 7 ≤ NACP < 9 based on the following criteria: 

1. Traffic surveillance reports are based on GPS-derived position information. 
2. ATSA-SURF Ownship's GPS-based HDOP is less than or equal to 2.0. 
Based on these two criteria, the risk of accepting ADS-B OUT traffic surveillance reports that may potentially exceed the required 30 m, 95% horizontal position accuracy is maintained at a level below the ATSA-SURF 
Safety Objective of 4E-03. 

The following section provides the rationale for the selection of the Ownship HDOP = 2.0 threshold for the risk management plan. 

## O.10.4 Risk Management Plan Rationale

The Risk Management Plan (RMP) in this annex makes use of the following fundamental GPS performance equation: 

 
HFOM = 95% Horizontal Position Accuracy = 2 * HDOP * σUERE, 
where HDOP is the Horizontal Dilution of Precision, representing the geometric quality factor of the GPS satellites-in-view, and σUERE represents the standard deviation of the User Equivalent Range Error (UERE) effective over all satellites in the constellation. σUERE is further defined as 

 
σUERE = (σURA
2 + σSIS
2 + σRcv
2)1/2: 
where σURA, σSIS, and σRcv represent the standard deviations of the satellite user range accuracy (URA) with respect to the GPS ground and space segments, signal-in-space (SIS) performance, and GPS user receiver equipment performance (Rcv), respectively. 

As reference, legacy SA-ON GPS systems use a minimum, fixed σUERE of 33.3 
m, while SA-Aware GPS systems utilize a conservative minimum σUERE of 6.1 m. 

The SA-ON σUERE of 33.3 m is very conservative and set to an unrealistically high level due to the legacy of selective availability. The minimum SA-Aware 
σUERE of 6.1 m is established using a more realistic, but still conservative level of performance. 

From the HFOM equation above, both HDOP and σUERE can affect the observed horizontal position uncertainty from the GPS sensor. The conservative nature of the minimum σUERE values provides margin in the event of signal-in-space errors due to space weather conditions (e.g., solar flare activities). It is noted that, beyond the nominal ionospheric delay models used in SA-Aware receivers, these receivers do not have specific knowledge of such actual ionospheric conditions. In any case, for the ATSA-SURF environment, the 95% Horizontal Position Accuracy is assumed to remain within the required performance levels over a range of space weather conditions (ASSUMP-OSED.24). It is also assumed that users will be notified of possible impact of adverse space weather to performance as part of navigation related notification means (ASSUMP-OSED.25). 

The basis of the risk management plan thus centers on the characterization of expected HDOP performance and the differences in HDOP (i.e., ∆HDOP) for both the ATSA-SURF Ownship and the ATSA-SURF traffic. The table below illustrates the relationship of HDOP to the resulting 95% horizontal position accuracy (HFOM) and the subsequent NACP values for SA-ON and SA-Aware installations: 

SA-ON Receiver  
(using σUERE of 33.3 m)

From the above table, it can be seen that NACP = 8 from a SA-ON installation can be assumed to always be at least as good an accuracy as given by NACP = 9 
from a SA-Aware installation based on similar satellite performance (URA), signal-in-space (SIS), and receiver performance (RCV), and therefore will always satisfy the ATSA-SURF accuracy requirement. Furthermore, a NACP =7 
value from a SA-ON installation will at most be only slightly outside the 30 m accuracy requirement on rare occasions as bounded by the RMP. 

Consequently, the main risk associated with accepting 7 ≤ NACP < 9 traffic (i.e., accepting NACP ≥ 7) is for traffic with SA-Aware installations. [Unfortunately there is no information transmitted by ADS-B to directly indicate the type of GPS receiver installed.]  The risk will depend upon their HDOP value; in particular their HDOP value has to be greater than 2.46 for it to exceed the nominal 30 m (95%) horizontal position accuracy assuming a σUERE of 6.1 m. 

The risk mitigation plan by Ownship in being able to accept traffic surveillance reports with 7 ≤ NACP < 9 is thus based on the ability to manage the risk of traffic experiencing an HDOP that exceeds an HDOP of 2.46 at a rate (well) 
below the ATSA-SURF Safety Objective. The HDOP region of interest for the RMP is shown by the gray shaded rows of Table O-1. 

As earlier indicated, an Ownship HDOP threshold of 2.0 has been selected as one of the two criteria for the RMP (the other criteria being that the traffic surveillance report is based on GPS-derived position information). Since the ATSA-SURF Ownship and the traffic aircraft / vehicle may potentially experience some differences in their respective HDOPs (e.g., due to slight differences in their respective GPS receiver performance, reception mask angle, or possible satellite line-of-sight obstruction due to nearby aircraft), a ∆HDOP of 0.46 is allocated. Thus, an Ownship HDOP of less than or equal to 2.0, and a ∆HDOP of 0.46 yields a risk managed traffic HDOP that does not exceed 2.46. 

In order to assess the effectiveness of the RMP, Table O-2 and Table O-3 provide statistics and distributions of simulated HDOP and ∆HDOP values for a 24- satellite GPS constellation, using a 5 degree mask angle, analyzed over the Worldwide Analysis Grid as defined in the WAAS MOPS DO-229D (Section 
3.2.9.2)2, sampled every 5 minutes over a 12 hour period.  Table O-2 and Table O-3 provide the distribution of the number of samples and probabilities of achieved HDOP values over 12 bins in steps of 0.25 over the RMP region of interest. ∆HDOP mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, and the distributions of ∆HDOPs over a range of probabilities from 5% to 99.999% are provided in each table. Table O-2 provides the ∆HDOP distributions for the case where the all-in-view HDOPs (such as those achieved by Ownship) are compared to the HDOP values that occur when the lowest elevation satellite is removed, simulating the effect of the ATSA-SURF traffic seeing one less satellite than Ownship, possibly due to an obstruction from another aircraft. Table O-3 repeats these calculations for ∆HDOP values where the lowest 2 satellites are removed, to determine the effects of 2 satellites being obstructed. 

Note: The HDOP and ∆HDOP values in Table O-2 and Table O-3 represent all cases where at least 5 satellites are in view. Fewer than 4 satellites do not support a position solution, and having only 4 satellites-in-view does not support non-zero NIC position reports. 

The Risk Management Plan (RMP) probability is calculated as follows: 
PRMP = PHDOP x P∆HDOP x PSatellite Obstruction Table O-2 and Table O-3 provide the HDOP probabilities for each of 12 bins in steps of 0.25. These numbers represent the PHDOP. The P∆HDOP are obtained from Table O-2 and Table O-3 for the single satellite, and 2 satellite obstruction cases, respectively. The cells within the tables used for the calculation of PHDOP and P∆HDOP are shaded in gray. In all cases these probabilities reflect the cases where 
                                                     
 
HDOP + ∆HDOP are approximately equal to 2.46, which represents the boundary condition of the RMP in accepting surveillance reports with NACP < 9. 

Table O-4 illustrates the computation of PRMP, which represents the sum of the PRMP probabilities computed for each bin, for both the single and two satellite obstruction cases. The contributions for the single and two satellite obstruction cases are then added to represent the total PRMP. By maintaining PRMP below the ATSA-SURF Safety Objective of 4E-3, we effectively manage the risk of accepting surveillance reports with 7 ≤ NACP < 9.

The total RMP probability, PRMP, from Table O-4 is thus approximately 5.8E-4, which falls well below the ATSA-SURF Safety Objective of 4.0E-03.  Additional conservative assumptions not included in this calculation are 1) conservative use of a 5 degree mask angle in modeling the HDOP values, 2) the modeling of satellite obstructions by removing the lowest elevation satellite in Table O-1, which in some cases may represent a satellite exceeding 20 degrees of elevation, and 3) using the maximum value of HDOP 
of each bin in computing the PRMP probabilities when in fact the actual HDOPs are distributed across the range of 0.25 HDOP values represented within each bin. In addition to the Ownship HDOP criteria of HDOP ≤ 2.0, the other criteria for the risk management plan is that the traffic surveillance data must be based on position information from GPS-based sensors. The criteria for assessing whether traffic is based on GPS position information in. 

## Asa Mops Modification Of Gps Source Identification Criteria

The ASA MOPS group modified the criteria to determine that the traffic position information is from GPS-based sensors by removing the criteria for NIC in Table O-5.  
The rational for removing the NIC criteria is based on that version 1 installations with SA-On GPS receivers will have very low availability of a sufficient NIC values due to the limited encoding scheme (i.e., a link limitation rather than a performance limitation).   
In assessing methods to improve the identification of GPS source the ASA MOPS group identified that for version 1 traffic on ground a NACP of 7 can genuinely only be produced by GPS-based sensors. However, it was recognized that in the case of RAIM unavailability (due to too few satellites) it will, in version 1, result in unknown NIC but with a positive NACP. Then if at the same time a satellite failure occurs that would not be reflected in the NACP. However, the risk of satellite failure occurring at the same time as only four satellites are available is 1e-4 (for a satellite failure) times (conservatively) 1e-2 (for the receiver to only observe four satellites). Hence the risk (1e-4 * 1e-2 = 1e-6) is far below the SURF safety objective and is consequently not a safety concern for the SURF application. The group also identified that for version 2 traffic a SIL of or greater 3 (encoded per hour) will also ensure that the position information is from a GPS source. In addition will integrity failures be reflected through a NACP of 0 in version 2 transmissions (as such changes have been incorporated to version 2 of the 1090 link MOPS). Based on this the ASA MOPS removed the NIC criteria from Table O-5.

Note: For surveillance reports from DO-260/ED-102 it is assumed that the percentage of ADS-B OUT from noncompliant DO-260/ED-102 (i.e., reporting HFOM) is sufficiently low to meet safety objectives. 

The above criteria for determining whether or not position data is GPS-based are for 1090 MHz ADS-B OUT. Similar criteria need to be considered for other ADS-B links, e.g., UAT, VDL4. 

1. For surveillance data from ADS-R, the same checks for determining that the sensor 
source is GPS-based must be used. 
2. TIS-B surveillance data with NACP < 9 cannot be used for the risk mitigation plan in 
this annex, as the data is not derived from GPS-based position sensors. Of course TIS-B surveillance reports that meet the ATSA-SURF quality requirements (including 
NACP ≥ 9) can be utilized directly for ATSA-SURF. 
3. The risk mitigation plan in this Annex addresses ADS-B and ADS-R surveillance 
reports based on GPS position sensors. Use of other position sensors for ADS-B and 
ADS-R will require a reassessment of the RMP to ensure it is still applicable. 
4. The risk mitigation plan is only applicable to ATSA-SURF, a non-safety critical, 
traffic situation awareness application. Reuse of this risk management approach for other purposes requires a separate assessment. 

## O.10.5 Risk Management Plan Summary

This annex provides a risk management plan that will significantly extend the availability of legacy GPS-based ADS-B OUT avionics systems. Using the risk management approach of verifying (a) that the source of surveillance data is based on GPS position information and (b) that the ATSA-SURF Ownship HDOP is less than or equal to 2.0, ensures that the risk of accepting a surveillance report with 7 ≤ NACP < 9 is acceptable. 

That is, the system will satisfy the required 30 m (95%) horizontal position accuracy requirement of ATSA-SURF (SPR.30) commensurate with the ATSA-SURF application Safety Objective of 4E-03/fh.

## Appendix Q Applications Integration Q.1 Introduction

This appendix presents an overview of the data quality requirements for the AIRB, SURF, ITP and VSA applications as gathered from different sections in the document, and describes how these ownship and traffic requirements can be integrated  as the ownship transitions from one application to another through different phases of flight. This appendix discusses data quality requirements for integration of the four applications. It also discussed data quality requirements for integration of the AIRB, ITP and VSA applications separately, in case the designer chooses not to implement SURF. The working group evaluated the CAVS application when adding it to this document. The consensus is that the CAVS application should be treated in the same manner as the VSA application is treated in the paragraphs below.    
The TSAA application runs in the background and is compatible with the other applications.   

## Q.2 When Both Airborne And Surf Applications Are Implemented

The SURF application can only be active when an airport map is displayed.  Both ownship and traffic data quality requirements vary depending on the position (airborne or on-ground) and location (inside the Surface Volume or outside the Surface Volume) of ownship and traffic. 

## Q.2.1 When Surf Application Is Active And Ownship Is On Ground.

Ground traffic must meet the SURF application requirements when the airport map is displayed. If any designated traffic application is activated, then only the traffic related to that application and the ownship have to meet that application's data quality requirements. Figure Q-1 depicts the Surface Volume 2000 feet above field elevation and 5 NM from the Airport Reference Point around the airport with the ownship and the traffic at different locations. The data quality requirements for the ownship and the traffic are presented below in Figure Q-1, when the ownship is on the ground.  

## Q.2.2 When Surf Application Is Active And Ownship Is Airborne.

The data quality requirements for the ownship and the traffic are presented below in Figure Q-2, when the ownship is airborne inside the Surface Volume.  When ownship is outside of the Surface Volume, the AIRB data quality requirements apply. 

## Q.2.3 Airb And Itp Applications

When ownship and all traffic is outside the Surface Volume then the AIRB application requirements generally apply. However, if any additional application is activated (e.g., ITP, VSA), that application's data quality requirements apply to the ownship and the traffic related to that application. The data quality requirements for the ownship and the traffic are presented below in Figure Q-3 for AIRB and ITP applications. 

## Q.2.4 Airb And Vsa Applications Outside The Surface Volume

The data quality requirements for the ownship and the traffic are presented below in Figure Q-4 for AIRB and VSA applications.

## Q.2.5 Airb And Vsa Applications Inside The Surface Volume

The data quality requirements for the ownship and the traffic are presented below in Figure Q-5 for AIRB and VSA applications. The VSA application's requirements apply to the ownship and the target aircraft until the target aircraft lands. 

## Q.3 When Only Airborne Applications Are Implemented (Surf Is Not Implemented)

When SURF is not active, there is no airport map nor Surface Volume.  

## Q.3.1 When Airb Application Is Active

The data quality requirements for the ownship and the traffic are presented below in Figure Q-6 for AIRB application when display of ground traffic is implemented and also when display of ground traffic is not installed.  

## Q.3.2 Airb, Itp And Vsa Applications

When airborne applications are active then the AIRB application requirements apply. If any additional application is activated (e.g., ITP, VSA), then only the traffic related to that application and the ownship have to meet that application's data quality requirements. 

The data quality requirements for the ownship and the traffic are presented below in Figure Q-7 for AIRB, ITP and VSA applications.

The following table summarizes all the key assumptions from the SURF SPR used in the analyses of the ATSA-SURF application, found in Section 3 of the SURF SPR. Other assumptions listed in the SURF SPR, in particular in the Operational Services and Environment Definition (OSED) in Annex A, Operational Performance Assessment 
(OPA) and Operational Safety Assessment (OSA), where not considered as key and are therefore omitted in the following table. 

Assump. # SPR Assumption text SURF SPR 
ASA MOPS Assumption Section 
General assumptions ASSUMP-
OSED.1 
All current requirements for surface operations still apply while 
utilising ATSA-SURF such that the roles and responsibilities of flight crews are unchanged over all visibility conditions and continue to be to use visual acquisition or radio communications procedures as the primary basis of surface operations. 
ASSUMP- OSED.3 
The ATSA-SURF application can be used by all properly equipped aircraft and ground vehicles conducting operations on the aerodrome manoeuvring area and by all properly equipped aircraft on approach and landing to the aerodrome. 
ASSUMP- OSED.12 
Functions such as those providing indications and alerting information for surface traffic are outside the scope of this document. 
ASSUMP- OSED.13 
The integration of the ATSA-SURF application with other Airborne Surveillance Applications and in particular ATSA- AIRB is outside the scope of the ATSA-SURF assessment. 
ASSUMP- OPA.3 
The OPA assumes that surface traffic (i.e., aircraft or ground vehicles) typically operate near the centreline of runways or taxiways. The OPA does not analyze or make special provisions in developing requirements for ground vehicles that operate in a non-conventional manner, e.g., grass cutting vehicles, snow ploughs, etc. Surface movements by such vehicles are assumed to be addressed using specific 
procedures. 
ASSUMP- OPA.11 
It is assumed that the analytical models documented in Appendix B of Annex B appropriately characterize the resulting total horizontal position error. In these models, it is 
assumed that the measured positions and velocities are 
uncorrelated and independent in any horizontal orthogonal coordinate system, whereby the position and velocity measurement errors are assumed to be independent and 
identically distributed as normal random variables with zero 
means and standard deviations proportional to the 95% horizontal accuracy radius. 
ASSUMP- OSA.1 
This analysis does not take into account issues regarding transition into service or limitations imposed by local 
exceptions to the ICAO aerodrome codes.

Intentional misuse or abusive use of the information provided to the flight crew during ATSA-SURF is not considered in this 
OSA. 
Security issues are out of the scope of this document. 
N/A 
 
ASSUMP- OSA.3 Environmental assumptions ASSUMP- OSED.4 
The surveillance environment that provides traffic surveillance information for ATSA-SURF consists of ADS-B and may 
include ADS-R and TIS-B. Thus, traffic that is depicted on the 
ATSA-SURF Traffic Display will be represented by the following sources of surveillance information: 
- All aircraft and ground vehicles equipped with ADS-B OUT 
that are operating in the ATSA-SURF coverage region whose 
ADS-B transmissions are determined to be qualified for ATSA-SURF; - ADS-R surveillance reports that are uplinked based on the reception of ADS-B OUT transmissions by the ADS-R ground 
system of mixed-equipage aircraft and ground vehicles (i.e., ADS-B OUT transmissions on an alternate surveillance link / cross-link) operating in the ATSA-SURF coverage region that are determined to be qualified for ATSA-SURF; 
- TIS-B surveillance reports uplinked based on alternate 
surveillance (e.g., multilateration of transponder transmissions / replies) by the TIS-B ground system of non-ADS-B equipped 
aircraft operating in the ATSA-SURF coverage region that are determined to be qualified for ATSA-SURF. 
ASSUMP- OSED.5 
Display of unqualified traffic or unqualified Ownship information is outside the scope of the ATSA-SURF 
application. 
ASSUMP-
OSED.7 
The ATSA-SURF application is applicable for both runway and 
taxiway operations, supporting all phases of operations on the surface and for arriving aircraft on final approach and landing within the ATSA-SURF coverage region. 
ASSUMP- OSED.8 
ATSA-SURF may be utilised at both controlled and uncontrolled aerodromes and in aerodromes of any traffic density. 
ASSUMP-
OSED.9 
The ATSA-SURF application may be utilised in all visibility 
conditions provided that pilot and/or controller responsibilities 
and procedures remain the same as today. 
ASSUMP-
OSED.14 
Typical ATC radio communications are via VHF voice radio. Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) radio communications are via VHF voice radio.

ASSUMP- OSED.15 
Radio communications between traffic and controllers or other traffic using the ATSA-SURF application are the same as today and do not require any changes to current phraseology. 
ASSUMP- OSED.18 
Mixed equipage of ATSA-SURF traffic with different ADS-B 
OUT datalinks is assumed for aerodrome operations where the ATSA-SURF application is being used. 
ASSUMP- OSED.22 
When traffic is equipped with and is utilising ATSA-SURF, air 
traffic control services are conducted as in today's operations. 
Receive Aircraft Domain Assumptions 
ASSUMP- OSED.2 
ATSA-SURF utilizes an aerodrome map database that is current 
ASSUMP- OSED.10 
The flight crew will have an appropriate level of training in the use of ATSA SURF Traffic Display. 
ASSUMP- OSED.23 
Ownship altitude information is available on existing aircraft displays and is therefore not required to be displayed on the ATSA-SURF Traffic Display (although it is required to compute relative altitude of airborne traffic). 
ASSUMP- OPA.12 
It is assumed that the Traffic Display resolution is better (finer) than or equal to 3 meters/pixel when the display is zoomed so that the length of the smallest dimension of the display corresponds to a distance of 1800 meters or less. 
ASSUMP- OPA.42 
Ownship horizontal position is typically used to position the field of view of the Traffic Display with respect to Ownship horizontal position. The Traffic Display is positioned with respect to Ownship horizontal position unless the position is not valid or the optional panning function is implemented. 
ASSUMP- OSA.4 
The climb-out and en route phases of flight are excluded from 
this safety analysis, as the flight crew would generally not use the ATSA-SURF Traffic Display during these phases of flight. 
ASSUMP-
OSA.5 
The percentage of total operation time per phase of ATSA-
SURF is used to normalise each phase to a per flight hour unit. 
Transmit Aircraft/Vehicle Domain Assumptions 
There are no specific requirements or assumptions concerning ground CNS systems, beyond those that are currently 
available and utilised for aerodrome surface operations. 
ASSUMP-

ASA MOPS Req # 
IR # 
SPR text 
IR.19 
In order to be considered a Preceding Aircraft for ATSA-VSA, the Transmit Aircraft Domain shall establish and transmit surveillance quality indicators directly from the outputs of 
onboard aircraft sensors (i.e., NACP, NACV, etc) without 
including latency effects, which are addressed as separate 
requirements. 
IR.20 
In order to be considered a Preceding Aircraft for ATSA-VSA, the Transmit Aircraft Domain shall have software design assurance of at least Level D per DO-178B/ED-12B [12] and 
hardware design assurance of at least Level D per DO-254/ED-
80 [16] associated with all functions that impact the integrity of 
the ADS-B OUT elements required to support the ATSA-VSA 
application. 
 
VSA Assumptions 
ASA MOPS section 
Assump. # 
Assump. text 
ASSUMP- OSED.1 
All current requirements for maintaining own visual separation are still valid while performing an ATSA-VSA procedure. 
ASSUMP- OSED.2 
The ATSA-VSA application can be used by aircraft flying a visual or an instrument approach. 
ASSUMP- OSED.3 
The ATSA-VSA is applicable to single runway, independent parallel runways, dependent parallel runways and closelyspaced parallel runways. 
ASSUMP- OSED.4 
The ATSA-VSA application can only be conducted under VMC as defined by ICAO or as specified by the State. 
ASSUMP- OSED.5 
The ATSA-VSA application can be used by all suitably equipped aircraft during approach to any airports where own visual separation is used. 
ASSUMP- OSED.6 
The ATSA-VSA application does not raise any specific issues related to wake vortex limitations or runway occupancy time 
ASSUMP-
OSED.7 
Abuse or intentional misuse of information provided to the 
flight crew or the controller are out of the scope of the ATSA-VSA assessment. 
ASSUMP- OSED.8 
Functions such as an alerting function detecting excessive closure rate, use of TIS-B to supplement ADS-B ground 
surveillance, use of CPDLC, or provision of information regarding aircraft equipment capabilities to controllers are 
out of the scope of this document. 
ASSUMP-
OSED.9 
For the Basic Procedure there is no specific requirement on 
the ground CNS above what is currently available in airspace where own visual separation on approach is used. 
ASSUMP- OSED.10 
For the Advanced Procedure, an updated aircraft identification is available to the controller to support the comparison of the aircraft identification reported by the 
flight crew of the Succeeding Aircraft and that provided by the surveillance display.

SBR text 
N/A 
FC operational requirement 
SPR 1 
The ITP flight crew shall check that the following criteria are fulfilled before requesting an ITP clearance: - Ownship climb/descend capability criteria as specified in Section 3.6.1. 
- ITP Speed/Distance criteria as specified in Section 3.6.1. 
- Relative altitude criteria as specified in Section 3.6.1  
- Position data quality criteria for both ITP and potential Reference Aircraft as specified in Section 3.6.2. 
- Velocity data quality criteria for both ITP and potential Reference Aircraft as specified in Section 3.6.2. 
- Similar Track criteria as specified in Section 3.6.1. 
Note: This requirement does not imply that an individual 
assessment of each criterion is carried out by the flight crew, but rather that each criterion is assessed by either the flight crew, or by automation (see Section 3.5.1) and although not required for 
all criterion, it is recognized that automation may provide a more predictable solution. 
Note: *all section numbers cited are for DO-312.* 
N/A 
FC operational requirement 
SPR 2 
The ITP flight crew shall include in the ITP request the requested Flight Level and for each Reference Aircraft, its aircraft ID, ITP Distance and relative position (in front or behind). 
N/A 
ATC operational requirement 
SPR 3 
ATC shall check the ITP request for compliance with the following criteria before granting an ITP clearance: - ITP Distance sent in the ITP request equal or greater than 15 nautical miles. - Closing Mach Differential equal or less than 0.06 Mach. 
- Reference Aircraft not manoeuvring and not expected to manoeuvre during ITP. - Maximum vertical distance between the ITP and Reference Aircraft of 2,000 ft . 
- ITP and Reference Aircraft are Same Track aircraft. 
- ITP Request message format is correct, i.e., proper 
phraseology and information is included. 
Note: The Same Track criteria is not the same as the Similar 
Track criteria that is checked by the ITP Aircraft flight crew. Same Track includes the concept of Similar Track but also includes a check on whether or not the aircraft track protection areas overlap (which can only be known by the controller). For more information see the definitions list in 3.2 or Annex A of DO-312. 
Note: The controller is still responsible for ensuring there are no 
other aircraft involved. 
N/A 
ATC operational requirement 
SPR 4 
ATC shall not permit an aircraft to be an ITP Aircraft and a Reference Aircraft for another ITP operation at the same time. ATC may allow an aircraft to be a Reference Aircraft for two 
distinct ITP operations if this aircraft is at the same time leading for one ITP operation and following for another.

SPR 21 For implementations that indicate whether or not the ITP initiation 
criteria (ITP Distance, Ground Speed Differential, Data Quality, 
and Similar Track status) are satisfied, such indication(s) shall be clear and unambiguous. 
Note:  In the requirement above, the term "Clear and 
Unambiguous" refers to the perception of the user, e.g., as verified in line with CS/FAR25-1309 [35], [36] or similar 
assessments. 
SPR 22 The ITP Distance shall be calculated by the ITP Equipment. 
2332, 2376 2391 
SPR 23 The ITP Distance displayed to the flight crew shall indicate a 
passed Initiation Criteria only when the calculated distance also passes the criteria (i.e., rounding or other means do not cause 
displayed data to indicate a passed criteria when it was 
calculated to fail). 
SPR 24 The Ground Speed Differential shall be calculated by the ITP 
Equipment. 
SPR 25 Ground Speed Differential, if displayed to the flight crew, shall 
indicate a passed Initiation Criteria only when the calculated differential also passes the criteria (i.e., rounding or other means 
do not cause displayed data to indicate a passed criteria when it 
was calculated to fail). 
SPR 26 The ITP Equipment shall provide the ability to assess whether 
the accuracy and integrity of the surveillance data provided by the Reference Aircraft as well as the position and velocity data of the ITP Aircraft are of a sufficient level for the execution of an ITP maneuver. 
SPR 27 The relative track angle between the tracks of the Reference 
Aircraft and the ITP Aircraft shall be calculated by the ITP Equipment. 
SPR 28 The likelihood that the ITP Equipment corrupts the information 
used for the ITP Distance or the result of the ITP Distance calculation shall be less than 1E-5 per flight hour. 
SPR 29 The probability that an erroneous ITP Distance provided by the 
ITP Equipment is in an acceptable range, shall be less than 7E-2 
per ITP operation or flight hour. 
SPR 30 The likelihood that the ITP Equipment provides an undetected 
erroneous relative track angle to the flight crew shall be less than 1E-3 per flight hour. 
SPR 31 The likelihood that the ITP Equipment provides an undetected 
erroneous Flight Level of the Reference Aircraft to the flight crew 
shall be less than 1E-3 per flight hour. 
SPR 32 The likelihood that the ITP Equipment provides undetected 
erroneous information about accuracy and integrity levels of own 
data shall be less than 1E-3 per flight hour. 
SPR 33 The likelihood that the ITP Equipment provides undetected 
erroneous accuracy and integrity levels of Reference Aircraft 
shall be less than 1E-3 per flight hour (i.e., an aircraft is indicated 
as a qualified Reference Aircraft, when in fact it is a blocking 
aircraft).

SPR text 
SPR 1 
If the flight crew detects a traffic on the Traffic Display corresponding to the Preceding Aircraft but with ADS-B data not qualified to support CAVS, the flight crew shall not apply CAVS. 
SPR 2 
To perform CAVS, the flight crew shall verify that the relevant Traffic Display, controller, and Out-The-Window information on the Preceding Aircraft are consistent. 
SPR 3 
If the relevant Traffic Display, controller, and Out-The-Window information on the Preceding Aircraft are not consistent, the flight 
crew shall apply the current procedure for maintaining own 
separation from this aircraft without the support of the CDTI. 
SPR 4 
The flight crew shall designate the displayed traffic qualified to support CAVS corresponding to the Preceding Aircraft. 
SPR 5 
The flight crew shall select an advisory "Range Indication" alert threshold value that provides awareness of the range that may require a subsequent flight crew response. 
SPR 6 
As in current operations, the controller shall only issue the clearance for maintaining own separation from the Preceding Aircraft after the flight crew has explicitly reported having the Preceding Aircraft in sight OTW. 
SPR 7 
If OTW visual contact with the Preceding Aircraft is lost while maintaining own separation from it, and if the flight crew wishes to continue maintaining own separation by applying CAVS, the flight crew shall use in substitution the information on the designated traffic provided by the CDTI. 
SPR 8 
The flight crew shall end the CAVS operations when the Preceding Aircraft lands, executes a go-around, or abandons the approach. 
SPR 9 
When an advisory alert is triggered because the designated traffic is no longer qualified to support CAVS, the flight crew shall: 
- 
have OTW visual contact on the Preceding Aircraft to be able 
to continue maintaining own separation at this distance, or 
- 
apply contingency procedures (e.g. go-around or contact 
ATC). 
SPR 10 When an advisory "Range Indication" alert is triggered, the flight 
crew shall evaluate the conditions that led to choosing the advisory "Range Indication" alert threshold value and determine if any subsequent response is required.

## Appendix S Oceanic In-Trail Procedure (Itp) Application Sample Algorithms S.1 Introduction

An aircraft travelling in oceanic airspace is subject to procedure-based separation and minima.  These standards are applied to it and other potentially blocking aircraft when a request for an altitude change is desired.  For safety reasons these standards and minima are conservative since there is no radar coverage in most of this airspace.  The benefits of an altitude change can be significant. The In-Trail Procedure (ITP) was developed to enable ADS-B equipped aircraft to change altitude if they are leading or following aircraft in intervening altitudes which may otherwise preclude such maneuvers.  This procedure is planned as a first step in a sequence of enhanced oceanic operations.  In this first step, there is no delegation to the pilot of any separation authority.   
The ITP maneuver consists of four phases: initiation, instruction, execution, and termination.  This appendix provides sample algorithms for the ADS-B derived parameters provided to the flight crew during the initiation and execution phases of ITP. These parameters are determined onboard ownship and include: ITP distance, Rate of Change of ITP Distance, and ownship ahead or behind status.  Additionally, the algorithms in this appendix compute a common point relative to ownship and reference aircraft tracks. 

## S.2 Itp Parameters

Reference aircraft are valid for ITP when similar track criteria are met; these criteria include a relative track angle between ownship and the reference aircraft of less than 45° 
or greater than 315°.  Figure S-1 depicts the four types of similar track aircraft. 

 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Additional Geometric Status criteria apply.  Reference aircraft are valid for ITP when:  

a. Altitude is within 2500 ft (±) that of ownship. 
b. And ITP Distance is greater than or equal to 15 NM and absolute value of Rate of 
Change of ITP Distance is less than or equal to 20 knots. 
c. Or ITP Distance is greater than or equal to 20 NM and absolute value of Rate of 
Change of ITP Distance is less than or equal to 30 knots. 
It is important to note that determination of reference aircraft validity for ITP will require one processing cycle per the algorithms presented in this appendix.   

## S.2.1 Itp Distance

ITP Distance (dITP) is defined as the absolute value of difference or addition of ownship and reference aircraft distances to a common point along the projection of each aircraft's track. The distance from each aircraft to the common point is a scalar quantity and is always positive. The figures below show how ITP Distance is calculated for various traffic configurations. For cases where aircraft are on the same side of the common point, one distance is subtracted from the other. For situations where aircraft are on opposite sides of the common point, the equation changes and the distances are additive. 

## S.2.2 Ownship Ahead Or Behind Status

When two aircraft are on converging intersecting tracks on the same side of a common point, the aircraft with the shortest distance to the common point is the aircraft ahead and the aircraft with the longest distance to the common point is the aircraft behind. When two aircraft are on diverging intersecting tracks on the same side of a common point, the aircraft with the longest distance to the common point is the aircraft ahead and the aircraft with the shortest distance to the common point is the aircraft behind. When aircraft are on opposite sides of common point with intersecting tracks, the aircraft ahead is the one flying away from the common point and the aircraft behind is the one flying towards the common point. 

## S.2.3 Rate Of Change Of Itp Distance

The Rate of Change of ITP distance is the horizontal velocity of the aircraft behind minus the horizontal velocity of the aircraft ahead. Rate of Change of ITP Distance is positive for decreasing ITP Distance, zero for constant ITP Distance, and negative for increasing ITP Distance. 

## S.3 Algorithms For Ads-B Derived Itp Parameters

For any one cycle of computations it is assumed that the state data (e.g., ownship and reference aircraft positions and velocities) required for computation of ITP parameters have been extrapolated to a common time of applicability.  This task is performed by the Airborne Surveillance and Separation Assurance Processor (ASSAP) functions Common Time Track Extrapolation and Traffic State File Generation. ITP application input is output of the ASSAP surveillance processing function and input to the application processing function.  It is also assumed that application input data is produced (i.e., loaded into a traffic state file) at a rate of 1 Hz and includes the following: 

a.
WGS 84 latitude and longitude
b.
Pressure altitude
c.
East/West and North/South velocities
d.
Vertical rate
The first step in derivation of ITP parameters is ownship and reference aircraft track position conversion from WGS 84 to local East North Up (ENU) coordinates relative to ownship (i.e., ownship position is the origin of the coordinate system).  If an altitude measurement is a calibrated height above mean sea level (MSL) from a barometric sensor, it should first be converted to a WGS 84 height above ellipsoid 
(HAE) to reduce skewing of calculations for local tangential planar positions (as altitude propagates to these); relative geometric altitude is replaced with relative pressure altitude in a later step. The following algorithm may be used for this purpose: 

$$\gamma_{s}(\phi)=\gamma_{s}\,\frac{1+k_{s}\,\sin^{2}\phi}{\sqrt{1-e^{2}\sin^{2}\phi}}$$

$$R(\phi)=\frac{a}{1+f+m_{r}-2f\,\sin^{2}\phi}$$

$$h(H,\phi)=\frac{R(\phi)H}{\frac{\gamma_{s}(\phi)}{\gamma_{s}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}\,R(\phi)-H}\tag{1}$$
where 
γs = normal gravity on the surface of an ellipsoid of revolution (m s-2) 
R = radius of the Earth (m) h = geodetic height [above ellipsoid] (m) 
φ = geodetic latitude (radians) 
H = orthometric height [above MSL] (m) 
γe = equatorial gravity = 9.7803253359 m s-2 
ks = Somigliana's Constant = 1.931853 x 10-3 
e = first eccentricity of the Earth = 8.1819190842622 x 10-2 
a = semi-major axis of the Earth = 6.3781370 x 106 m b = semi-minor axis of the Earth = 6.3567523142 x 106 m f = flattening of the Earth = (a - b)/a mr =gravity ratio =  0.003449787 
Ownship and reference aircraft positions are then converted from WGS 84 to ECEF coordinates: 

$$\begin{bmatrix}X\\ Y\\ Z\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\left(\dfrac{a}{\chi}+h\right)\cos\phi\cos\lambda\\ \left(\dfrac{a}{\chi}+h\right)\cos\phi\sin\lambda\\ \left(\dfrac{a\left(1-e^{2}\right)}{Z}+h\right)\sin\phi\end{bmatrix}\tag{2}$$
where 

$a=semi$ - major axis $=6378137.0$$m$

$e^{\,2}=$ _first eccentricity squared $=6.69437999$$014$$x$$10^{-3}$_

$\phi=$ _geodetic latitude (radians)_

$\lambda=$ _geodetic longitude (radians)_

$h=$ _geodetic height_ [above ellipsoid](m)

$\chi=\sqrt{1-e^{\,2}\,\sin^{\,2}\,\phi}$

$\left(X,Y,Z\right)=$ _ECEF position of aircraft_
Ownship ENU position is simply [0 0 0]' as ownship position is the origin in the local coordinate system.  Traffic (reference aircraft) ENU position is derived from traffic and ownship ECEF positions: 

$$\text{(3)}$$.

Relative pressure altitude replaces "z" derived from (3).  A simple technique to derive

$$z=H_{{}_{I}}-H_{{}_{o}}\tag{4}$$

Next, let: 

$t=$_common time of extrapolated tracks (e.g., 0 seconds) $IO=\left[X_{o}\ Y_{o}\ Z_{o}\right]^{\prime}$ $RO=\left[X_{i}\ Y_{i}\ Z_{i}\right]^{\prime}$ $IO=\left[0\ 0\ 0\right]^{\prime}$ $IO=\left[x\ y\ z\right]^{\prime}$ $Iv=$_ownship velocity vector (m/s) $=$ [E/W velocity, NS velocity, vertical rate]' $Rv=$ reference aircraft velocity vector(m/s) $=$ [E/W velocity, NS velocity, vertical rate]'
Ownship position one second into the future (i.e., t + 1) is computed, relative to the local coordinate system (ownship position) at the current time (i.e., t): 

$$i I=i0+I\nu\Delta t=I\nu$$
Similarly, reference aircraft local position one second into the future (i.e., t + 1) is computed, relative to ownship position at the current time (i.e., t).  However, as reference aircraft GNSS velocity is valid in its local tangential plane (not in the plane corresponding to ownship), additional steps are necessary. First, reference aircraft ECEF position one second into the future (R1) is computed as follows: 

$$R I=R0+\left[\begin{array}{c c c}{{-\sin\lambda}}&{{\cos\lambda}}&{{0}}\\ {{-\sin\phi\cos\lambda}}&{{-\sin\phi\sin\lambda}}&{{\cos\phi}}\\ {{\cos\phi\cos\lambda}}&{{\cos\phi\sin\lambda}}&{{\sin\phi}}\end{array}\right]^{-1}\left(R v\right)$$
where 

      
   =
φ
       geodetic latitude of reference aircraft (radians) 

      
   =
λ
       geodetic longitude of reference aircraft (radians) 

Future reference aircraft position relative to the local coordinate system (r1) at the current 
time is computed by inputting I0, R1, and ownship latitude and longitude into (3). Next, 
parameters necessary for determination of conformance to ITP similar track and 
geometric status criteria are computed. 

Let: 

$a(1)=x$ component of some local position a where $a=\{x\,y\,z\}$' $a(2)=y$ component of some local position a where $a=\{x\,y\,z\}$'
 

$\theta_{\text{ITP}}=\tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{\text{i1}(2)}{\text{i1}(1)}\right)$

$\theta_{\text{REF}}=\tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{\text{r1}(2)\text{-r0}(2)}{\text{r1}(1)\text{-r0}(1)}\right)$

$\Lambda\theta=\frac{\left|\theta_{\text{ITP}}\text{-}\theta_{\text{REF}}\right|}{\left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right)}$

$\theta_{\text{INTERSECT}}=min(\Lambda\theta,\,360\text{-}\Lambda\theta)$

$\mathbb{Z}^{\prime}=\left|\mathbb{Z}^{\ast}3.28\right|$

where

θITP = track angle of ownship (radians) 
θREF = track angle of reference aircraft (radians) 
∆θ = difference in aircraft track angles (degrees) 
θINTERSECT = track intersection angle (degrees) 
z = relative pressure altitude of reference aircraft (m) 
z' = absolute value of relative pressure altitude (ft) 

Note: 
       Inverse tangent in the formulas above refers to four quadrant arctangent.   

If θINTERSECT < 45 degrees and z' ≤ 2500 feet, similar track criteria are satisfied and the 
altitude component of geometric status criteria is satisfied and computations continue.  
Otherwise the reference aircraft is invalid for ITP. The next step is to rotate tracks in the 
local coordinate system and determine ITP distance.  First, altitude components of current 
and future local positions for ownship and reference aircraft are removed from 

appropriate vectors (e.g., i1 = [i1(1) i1(2)]') as additional ITP computations involve the horizontal plane. A rotation angle and rotation matrix are defined as follows: 

$$\begin{array}{l l}{{\beta=2.5\pi\cdot\theta_{T T^{P}}}}\\ {{Q=\left[\begin{array}{l l}{{\cos\beta}}&{{\textrm{-sin}\beta}}\\ {{\sin\beta}}&{{\cos\beta}}\end{array}\right]}}\end{array}$$
where 
β = rotation angle (radians) Q = rotation matrix The rotation matrix Q is applied to current and future horizontal ownship and reference aircraft local positions such that ownship track angle is rotated to the positive y-axis and reference aircraft track angle is rotated to maintain its relative position to ownship. Rotated horizontal local positions are defined as follows: 
xy_i0 = [0 0]' 
xy_i1 = Q*i1/1852 xy_r0 = Q*r0/1852 xy_r1 = Q*r1/1852 
where 

xy_i0 = rotated current ownship horizontal position in local coordinate system  
             (NM) 
xy_i1 = rotated future ownship horizontal position in local coordinate system (NM) 
xy_r0 = rotated current reference aircraft horizontal position in local coordinate     
              system (NM) 
xy_r1 = rotated future reference aircraft horizontal position in local coordinate     
              system (NM) 

ITP Distance is computed based on the case defined by track angles.  Two thresholds are 
defined to identify case type: 

θTHRESH = 2 degrees 
dTHRESH = 0.25 NM 
 

where 

θTHRESH  = angular threshold for determination of parallel tracks 
dTHRESH  = distance threshold for determination of identical tracks 

Note: The values above have been determined empirically.  Smaller thresholds may 
       provide additional accuracy in real world  implementations. 

If  θINTERSECT ≤ θTHRESH  tracks are determined to be parallel.  If this condition holds and 
the absolute value of xy_r0(1) (rotated x position of reference aircraft at current time in 
local coordinate system) is less than or equal to dTHRESH  the tracks are determined to be 
identical. As ownship track angle has been rotated to the positive y-axis and reference 
aircraft track is identical or parallel to ownship track, for these cases ITP Distance is 
simply defined as follows: 

dITP = | xy_r0(2) | 
where xy_r0(2) = the rotated local y position (in NM) of the reference aircraft at the  
                   current time. dITP = ITP distance (NM) 
If ownship and reference aircraft tracks are not parallel (e.g., θINTERSECT > θ*THRESH* ) and thus not identical, a common point between track projections is computed. As the ownship track has been rotated to the positive y-axis and reference aircraft track has been rotated such that relative position to ownship is maintained, the common point between projections will reside on the y-axis.  
Let: 

$$m={\frac{\mathrm{xy\_r1(2)\,\-\,xy\_r0(2)}}{\mathrm{xy\_r1(1)\,\-\,xy\_r0(1)}}}$$
$$C P(1)=0$$
$$C P(2)=x y\_r0(2)\,\-\,m{\mathrm{*}}x y\_r0(1)$$
where 

xy_r0(1) = the rotated local x position (in NM) of the reference aircraft at the  
                   current time. 
xy_r0(2) = the rotated local y position (in NM) of the reference aircraft at the  
                   current time. 
xy_r1(1) = the rotated local x position (in NM) of the reference aircraft at the  
                   future time. 
xy_r1(2) = the rotated local y position (in NM) of the reference aircraft at the  
                   future time. 
m = slope formed by current and future rotated local positions of reference aircraft 
CP(1) = x position of common point (NM) 
CP(2) = y position of common point (NM), intersection of rotated reference aircraft  
              track and y-axis 

 

Note: CP(1) will always equal zero due to rotation scheme. 

Next, current ownship and reference aircraft ranges to the common point are computed: 

rown = |CP(2)|  

$$r_{r e f}={\sqrt{\mathrm{xy\_r0(1)^{2}+\left(x y\_r0(2)\cdot C P(2)\right)^{2}}}}$$
where rown = the distance (in NM) from ownship position to the common point; simply the  
         absolute value of y position of the common point as ownship is located at the origin. 

rref  = the distance (in NM) from reference aircraft position to the common point The ITP Distance computation for non-parallel tracks involves subtraction or addition of ranges to the common point.  If both aircraft are on the same side of the common point 
(e.g., [CP(2) > 0 and CP(2) > xy_r0(2)] or [CP(2) < 0 and CP(2) < xy_r0(2)]) with converging intersecting or diverging intersecting tracks, ITP Distance is defined as follows: 
dITP = | rown - rref | 
Otherwise, aircraft are on different sides of the common point with intersecting tracks.  In this case, ITP Distance is defined as: 
dITP = | rown + rref | 
The next step is determination of ownship ahead or behind status.  This parameter is determined with a simple conditional algorithm.  If current rotated reference aircraft y position in the local coordinate system is less than zero (*xy_r0(2) < 0)*, ownship is ahead of the reference aircraft (as ownship position is the origin).  Otherwise, ownship is behind the reference aircraft.  This conditional statement may be written as follows: 
if(xy_r0(2) < 0) 

            ownship_ahead = 1 
        else 
            ownship_ahead = 0 
        end 

Having defined ownship ahead or behind status, the last remaining ITP parameter, Rate 
of Change of ITP Distance, is computed.  First, ownship and reference aircraft ground 
speeds are computed: 

$$g s_{o u m}={\frac{\sqrt{I v(1)^{2}+I v(2)^{2}}}{0.51444}}$$
$$g s_{r e f}={\frac{\sqrt{R v(1)^{2}+R v(2)^{2}}}{0.51444}}$$
where 

Iv = ownship velocity vector (m/s) 
Rv = reference aircraft velocity vector (m/s) 
gsown = ownship ground speed (knots) 
gsref = reference aircraft ground speed (knots) 

Rate of Change of ITP Distance is dependent on ownship ahead or behind status.  If 
ownship is ahead, Rate of Change of ITP Distance (dITP/dt) is defined as: 

dITP/dt  =  gsref  - gsown 

where 

dITP/dt  = Rate of Change of ITP Distance (knots) 

Otherwise, if ownship is behind: 

dITP/dt  =  gsown  - gsref 

With all ITP parameters computed, reference aircraft validity for the ITP application is 
determined using remaining geometric status criteria for ITP Distance and Rate of 

Change of ITP Distance.  If  *dITP* ≥ 15 NM and |*dITP/dt*| ≤ 20 knots or *dITP* ≥ 20 NM and |*dITP/dt*| ≤ 30 knots, the reference aircraft is valid for ITP. 

Subsequent computations (e.g., for *t = 1, 2, 3, …, n* seconds) occurring when the ASSAP traffic state file reloads are produced using the algorithms in previous steps.  
Additionally, the algorithms in this appendix may be applied to multiple reference aircraft as all computations are relative to a single ownship.   

## S.4 Algorithm Modifications For Operations In Polar Regions

The algorithms presented in the previous section may be modified to provide accurate computations of ITP application parameters during operations in polar regions.  The first modification is a mechanism to store (e.g., in memory) ECEF positions of ownship and reference aircraft computed via (1) and (2).  If a "polar mode" is enabled, it is assumed that at the time of application initiation (e.g., selection of a reference aircraft) previous ownship and reference aircraft positions in ECEF are available.  As in the previous section, it is also assumed that processing cycles occur at 1 Hz. Current and previous ECEF positions are used to compute previous local positions in ENU relative to ownship position at the current time. Velocity vectors are derived from the difference of current and previous local positions in ENU and replace those provided by GNSS.  Additionally, derived velocity vectors provide projections - future positions in ENU relative to ownship position at the current time.  Algorithmic changes are summarized below. Let: 

$$\dot{i}_{prev}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}-\sin\lambda&\cos\lambda&0\\ -\sin\phi\cos\lambda&-\sin\phi\sin\lambda&\cos\phi\\ \cos\phi\cos\lambda&\cos\phi\sin\lambda&\sin\phi\end{array}\right]\left[I_{prev}-I0\right]$$

$$r_{prev}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}-\sin\lambda&\cos\lambda&0\\ -\sin\phi\cos\lambda&-\sin\phi\sin\lambda&\cos\phi\\ \cos\phi\cos\lambda&\cos\phi\sin\lambda&\sin\phi\end{array}\right]\left[R_{prev}-I0\right]$$

$$Iv=\dot{\cdot}_{prev}$$

$$Rv=r0\cdot r_{prev}$$

$$iI=Iv$$

$$rI=r0+Rv$$
where 

      
   =
φ
       geodetic latitude of ownship (radians) 

      
   =
λ
       geodetic longitude of ownship (radians) 

Iprev = previous ECEF position of ownship (meters) 
I0 = current ECEF position of ownship (meters) 
iprev =previous local ENU position of ownship relative to ownship position at  
         current time (meters) 

Rprev = previous ECEF position of reference aircraft (meters) 
rprev =previous local ENU position of reference aircraft relative to ownship position  
         at current time (meters) 
Iv = current ownship velocity vector (m/s) 
r0 = current local ENU position of reference aircraft relative to ownship position  
        at current time (meters) as defined in the previous section per (3) 
Rv = current reference aircraft velocity vector(m/s) 
i1 = future local ENU position of ownship relative to ownship position at the  
       current time (meters) 
r1 = future local ENU position of reference aircraft relative to ownship position at  
        the current time (meters) 

Addition and substitution of the above parameters and corresponding equations into the 
algorithms presented in the previous section provide a nearly complete polar mode for the 
ITP application.  All additional computations will function properly.  The last 
modification is application of a correction factor to computed ITP Distance; this 
parameter corrects for error introduced into ENU position computations near polar 
regions and has been empirically determined through analysis of multiple polar ITP 
scenarios with ITP Distances ranging from roughly 10 to 40 NM.  The correction factor is 
applied to ITP Distance as follows: 

correction_factor = 0.99373 
dITP = dITP*correction_factor 

where 

dITP is ITP Distance computed for any case after addition and substitution of polar 
parameters/equations into the algorithms in the previous section. 

Current ECEF positions for ownship and reference aircraft are appended to the appropriate storage variable for use in the next processing cycle.

## Appendix T Traffic Situation Awareness With Alerting (Tsaa) Application Sample Algorithms T.1 High-Level Functional Flow Diagram Of The Sample Tsaa Algorithm

The functional relationship between the sample TSAA algorithm and the larger ADS-B 
system on-board the ownship is shown in Figure T-1.  [See Kunzi, F. (2013) for more indepth discussion of the material covered in this appendix.] The exemplar TSAA algorithm described here is designed with the intent of operating in the context of a DO-317 avionics architecture.  The major capabilities that the tracker provides are the estimation of the received state information, the extrapolation of that information to a common point in time (in a common reference frame) and the provision of updated state estimates at a 1Hz update rate.  Those capabilities are assumed to be available for the TSAA implementation described here. 

 
TSAA as a larger system also interacts with the flight crew when it issues aural alerts and visual indications of threat aircraft. A set of human factor evaluations specific to the flight crew interface have been conducted for TSAA and have been published in a separate report (Silva, 2012). Figure T-1 was adapted in Figure T-2 to more specifically represent the interaction between TSAA and the DO-317 tracker. Within TSAA, there are two major components: 
The Conflict Detector and the Threat Database. When TSAA is called, the conflict detector evaluates any aircraft in the threat database as to whether it poses a threat to the ownship. If a given target is identified as a threat, TSAA marks that target as such and ultimately passes that information back to the ASSAP tracker as a list of threat aircraft with their alert state. If a target that was passed to TSAA was determined not to be a threat, TSAA does not report it as an output. A subset of the information maintained by the tracker and passed to TSAA for a given target is listed in Table T-1.

## T.2 Conceptual Introduction To The Tsaa Exemplar Algorithm

Fundamentally, the concept of the exemplar TSAA algorithm is to predict discrete, constant turn-rate trajectories for all involved aircraft and alert based on predicted penetrations of protected airspace along those trajectories. As such, the exemplar TSAA 
algorithm has three major components: protected airspace zones around target aircraft, trajectory prediction for ownship and target aircraft and the alerting decision logic. A conceptual overview of each component is provided here; the next section focuses on the mathematical and software implementation of the algorithm. The algorithm performs pair-wise evaluations to determine whether a conflict exists between the ownship and a particular target. Around each target, the algorithm calculates two protected airspace zones denoted as the protected airspace zone (PAZ) and the collision airspace zone (CAZ). In Figure T-3, the PAZ is shown in yellow and the CAZ is shown in red. The size of the PAZ is dependent on the closure rate between the target and the ownship. As a surrogate for the potential danger involved in a given encounter geometry, the size of the PAZ increases as closure rate increases. The CAZ remains fixed in size at a radius of 500ft and a height of ±200ft based on the position uncertainty of two rule compliant ADS-B targets.  
The second component of the algorithm is the trajectory prediction.  For the ownship as well as each target, discrete trajectories are predicted repeatedly at a nominal frequency (e.g., once per second).  TSAA algorithm uses a constant turn rate trajectory propagation 
- as such, the propagated trajectories predict where the aircraft will be if it were to continue its current maneuver.  As shown in Figure T-4, the constant turn rate prediction defaults to a constant heading prediction in the absence of maneuvering.  During the initial design efforts, a constant turn rate trajectory projection was shown to reduce the nuisance alert rate while maintaining the missed alert percentages and the average alert time. 

 
Since the geometry between the two aircraft can change along the trajectories due to the constant turn rate prediction, the closure rate and with it the size of the PAZ between the two aircraft can also change.  For example, as shown in Figure T-5, as the closure rate decreases along the trajectories, the size of the PAZ decreases. 

 
Based on the predicted positions of the aircraft and the sizes of the airspace buffer zones along the trajectory, the alerting logic determines whether or not to issue an alert for a given target. If the ownship is predicted to penetrate the PAZ, an initial alert is issued to the pilot, announcing the location and observed behavior of the target.  A sample alert would be "Traffic, Twelve O'clock, High, Three Miles, Descending." If the situation continues unchanged or deteriorates and the CAZ-penetration is predicted, an alert-
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
update of the same format but with updated position and behavior information is issued to the pilot. In the example geometry shown in Figure T-5, even though the PAZ 
decreases along the predicted trajectory, the ownship is predicted to penetrate the PAZ 30 seconds into the future, resulting in an initial alert being issued to the flight crew.  

## T.3 Mathematical Description Of The Exemplar Tsaa Algorithm

The exemplar TSAA algorithm is described mathematically in this section. Included with this document is a MATLAB implementation of the exemplar algorithm. The description given here, therefore, is specific to this implementation. 

As shown in Figure T-2, TSAA has two main components: A Threat Database and a Conflict Detector. In addition to identifying threat aircraft, therefore, a second task performed by TSAA is the maintaining of the threat database. As a result, the code of the TSAA exemplar algorithm is implemented such that it can be called in two different modes: 

1 
Update Mode: When new state information is available from the DO-317 
tracker, TSAA is called in this mode. TSAA then updates the threat database with this new information. With the minimum update rate of 1 Hz required by the standard, TSAA would be called in this mode at least once per second.  
2 
Detect Mode: TSAA is called in this mode when the currently tracked targets are 
to be evaluated for whether they pose a threat to the ownship. TSAA can be called in this mode independently of whether new target information is available - TSAA uses the most recent data available in the threat database when called in this mode. 
Both modes of the TSAA algorithm are described in detail here from a functional and mathematical perspective. Throughout the description of the algorithm, parameters that define the internal behavior of the algorithm are introduced and defined as variables (identified in italics).  

## T.3.1 Tsaa In Update Mode

When called in the 'Update' mode, TSAA updates the Threat Database with the received state information. Even though the DO-317 tracker maintains a track for all active aircraft, a separate TSAA threat aircraft database is necessary for two reasons. First, it allows for the maintenance of TSAA specific data locally within the TSAA alerting algorithm. Second, it allows for potentially pre-selecting which targets are maintained within TSAA. For example, a manufacturer may elect for computational reasons to only locally maintain targets that are within a predefined distance of the ownship. The data fields that are maintained in the TSAA threat aircraft database are shown in Table T-2. 

When TSAA is called in the update mode, the reports from the DO-317 tracker containing the data fields listed in Table T-1 are used to fill the data fields for each of the active targets.

In addition to updating data for all existing targets in the database, TSAA also adds new targets not currently tracked or removes stale targets for which the data has become too old to be used for reliable conflict alerting. Similar to the DO-317 sample tracker, TSAA 
uses a maximum data age limit (seconds) to determine when a target has become stale - 
if the difference between the time of last information update and the time of last ADS-B message reception is greater than that threshold, the target is discontinued. The threshold is denoted by the variable *TarDiscont*. 

In the case of the exemplar algorithm, the database is implemented as a MATLAB structure that contains one object (an instance of the TSAA aircraft class defined in the tsaa_aircraft_class.m file) for each active target.  

## T.3.2 Tsaa In Detect Mode

When called in the 'Detect' mode, TSAA evaluates each target maintained in the TSAA threat database to determine whether it poses a threat to the ownship. Adjusting the ConflictSearchFreq variable in the exemplar algorithm sets the frequency with which TSAA is called in this mode. A more detailed breakdown of the individual functions necessary to achieve this is shown in Figure T-6.  
Figure T-6 is an enlarged version of the box labeled "Conflict Detector" in Figure T-2. 

 
Each one of the functions shown in Figure T-6 is described in more detail in its own section below. 

## T.3.2.1 Trajectory Propagation

The trajectory generator creates the ownship and target trajectories that define the path that the target or the ownship would follow were it to maintain the current turn rate, horizontal as well as vertical velocities.  

## Inputs:

- 
Historical Track for the ownship and all targets  
- 
Turn and vertical rate 
- 
Look-ahead time (t*look*)  
- 
Trajectory Discretization (dt) 
The trajectory propagation routine creates a trajectory consisting of discrete points in space, dt seconds apart, t*look* seconds into the future.  The number of points (*nPoints*) in the projected trajectory depends on look-ahead time and the trajectory discretization (dt) 
and is calculated by dividing t*look* by dt.  The first point of each trajectory is at the position last received by TSAA (x0, y0, z0).  For each trajectory, the following parameters are calculated and stored for later use: 

## Outputs:

- 
Time vector for the span of the trajectory (contains one entry for each point along 
the trajectory) 
- 
For each time step in the time vector:  
- 
x, y, z coordinates of the trajectory  
- 
North, East and vertical velocities 
The ground track angle (ψ), *x, y* and z positions of the trajectories for the ownship and target are calculated for the length of the trajectory using Equation 1. The subscript k refers to the time step along the trajectory. The velocity v is the magnitude of the horizontal velocity and vz is the vertical velocity. As mentioned, vz is assumed to remain constant along the predicted trajectory. 

$\psi_{k}=\psi_{k-1}+\psi\cdot\mathrm{dt}$

$X_{k}=X_{k-1}+v\cdot\cos(\psi_{k-1})\cdot\mathrm{dt}$

$Y_{k}=Y_{k-1}+v\cdot\sin(\psi_{k-1})\cdot\mathrm{dt}$

$Z_{k}=Z_{k-1}+v_{k}\cdot\mathrm{dt}$
Once the trajectories are generated, they are passed to the conflict search engine. 

## T.3.2.2 Conflict Search Engine

The conflict search engine conducts pairwise comparisons between the ownship trajectory and each target trajectory in order to determine whether any of the targets pose a threat to the ownship. The conflict search engine contains the following subroutines, also described in Figure T-7: 

1. Calculation of PAZ size and physical separation 
2. Evaluation of predicted separation against Collision Airspace Zone (CAZ) and 
Protected Airspace Zone (PAZ) 
3. Determination of alert status of target 
 
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Each one of the routines is described in detail below. 

## T.3.2.2.1 Calculation Of Paz Size And Physical Separation

Using the trajectories generated by the Trajectory Generator, this routine calculates the size of the PAZ around the target for each time step in the trajectory as well as the physical separation between the ownship and target.  To calculate the size of the PAZ, the following input parameters are required: 

## Inputs:

- 
Minimum horizontal PAZ dimension (*rPAZmin*) 
- 
Minimum vertical PAZ dimension (*vPAZmin*) 
- 
Horizontal PAZ scaling factor (*tauPAZr*) 
- 
Vertical PAZ scaling factor (*tauPAZv*) 
For each time step along the trajectories, the following values are calculated: 

## Outputs:

- 
Horizontal size of the PAZ (*rPAZ*) 
- 
Vertical size of the PAZ (*vPAZ*) 
- 
Predicted Horizontal separation between the two aircraft (*hSep*) 
- 
Predicted Vertical separation between the two aircraft (*vSep*) 
The closure rate used by the TSAA exemplar algorithm is the projection of the relative horizontal velocity onto the relative position vector, as shown in Equation 2. d denotes the separation distance in the respective dimension and v denotes the magnitude of velocity. The closure rate has to be calculated for each time step i along the trajectory since it can change due to the constant turn rate prediction for each trajectory. Additionally, the relative vertical velocity (crv) is calculated as the difference in the vertical rates of the two aircraft. Note that the relative vertical position matters when calculating the vertical closure rate. 

$d_{j}=j_{target}-j_{ownship}$_where_$j=x,y$__

$V_{rel,x}=V_{E,target}-V_{E,ownship}$__

$V_{rel,y}=V_{N,target}-V_{N,ownship}$__

$crh_{i}=\max\left(0,\frac{d_{x,i}\cdot V_{rel,x,i}+d_{y,i}\cdot V_{rel,y,i}}{\int_{d_{x,i}}^{2}+d_{y,i}^{2}}\right)$__
Once the closure rate is calculated, the size of the PAZ along the trajectory is calculated using Equation 3. (Note that rPAZmin and vPAZmin must be in the same units as crh and crv.) Figure T-8 shows an example of how the size of the PAZ can change along the predicted trajectory. The solid red or blue line is the historical track of the target and the black dotted line is the predicted trajectory of the respective aircraft. 

 
To calculate the predicted vertical and horizontal separation along the trajectories the formulas in Equation 4 are used. Here, d again denotes distance and z denotes altitude. 

$$\begin{array}{c}{{h S e p_{i}=\sqrt{d_{x,i}{}^{2}+d_{y,i}{}^{2}}}}\\ {{v S e p_{i}=a b s\Big(z_{o w n s i p i p i}-z_{t a r g e t p i}\Big)}}\end{array}$$

## T.3.2.2.2 Evaluation Against Caz And Paz Violation Criteria

This routine compares the predicted separation distances (*hSep* and *vSep*) for each step along the trajectory to determine whether or not they lie within the bounds defined by the PAZ or the CAZ along the length of the trajectories. If both *hSep* and *vSep* are less than rPAZ and *vPAZ* (i.e., there is a PAZ violation), the earliest time along the trajectory where this is predicted is recorded as tPAZ. Similarly, *hSep* and *vSep* are evaluated against rCAZ and *vCAZ*, and if a CAZ violation is predicted, the earliest time along the trajectory where it is predicted is recorded as tCAZ. 

## T.3.2.3 Determination Of Alert Status Of Target

If a violation of the PAZ or the CAZ is predicted, the values of tCAZ and tPAZ are evaluated against the alert logic described in this section. The alert logic determines whether to issue an alert for a given target and has the following main components: 

1. Determine if an alert is necessary due to two consecutive predictions of either a 
PAZ or a CAZ penetration (i.e. during two sequential calls of TSAA) 
2. Determine if an immediate PAZ or CAZ alert is necessary 
3. Determine if the alert occurred within the alert hysteresis and should thus be 
suppressed 
In order to evaluate tCAZ and tPAZ against the three conditions above, the following inputs are necessary: 

## Inputs:

- Threshold value before which two consecutive PAZ or CAZ violations need to be 
predicted (doubleTrigger) 
- Duration of time after an alert during which a second alert cannot be issued for the 
same target (reAlertDelay) 
The output of this final routine is whether or not a target is in PAZ or CAZ alert status. 

## T.3.2.3.1 Determine If An Alert Is Necessary Due To Two Consecutive Predictions Of Violations Of Either The Paz Or The Caz

To reduce nuisance alerts, a "double trigger" value is introduced. If tCAZ and tPAZ are in excess of their double trigger thresholds, a violation of the PAZ or the CAZ has to be predicted by two consecutive conflict searches in order for the target to change into alert state. In other words, the algorithm described here has to be called twice in a row and both times predict for a target to violate the PAZ or the CAZ for that target to be switched into alert state. 

## T.3.2.3.2 Determine If An Immediate Paz Or Caz Alert Is Necessary

For an alert to be issued on a target upon the first prediction of a violation (i.e., the algorithm runs only once), tCAZ and tPAZ have to be below the value of the double trigger threshold. For example, if the PAZ double trigger is set at 15 seconds, a PAZ conflict has to be predicted less than 15 seconds into the future (i.e., tPAZ < 15) for the target to be switched into alert state upon the first prediction of a violation. 

## T.3.2.3.3 Determine If The Alert Occurred Within The Alert Hysteresis And Should Thus Be Suppressed

Once a target is identified as being in conflict with the ownship and an alert is issued, the audio system pronouncing the alert is busy for the length of the pronunciation of the alert. If during that time a maneuver causes the target to go in and out of alert status, a second alert would be issued on the same target, and then announced once the current alert is finished. Though this would be a legitimate alert, it may not be a desired one.  
In order to prevent this queuing of alerts, the hysteresis is set such that once a target switches into alert state it will remain in alert state for the longest possible duration of the aural message. This approach to the hysteresis also prevents the target from visually changing appearance during the duration of the annunciation of the aural alert in class II systems. 

The duration of the hysteresis is set by the value of the *reAlertDelay*. If tnow - t*last alert* < 
reAlertDelay, the alert status of the target is retained - even if the basic algorithm no longer predicts a conflict for that target. 

## T.3.2.4 Conflict Verification

Noise in the turn rate estimation can have a significant effect on the constant turn rate trajectory prediction used by the exemplar algorithm. Specifically, noisy turn rate data may result in a "wagging" of the trajectory, soliciting un-necessary alerts that last for the minimum duration of an alert set by the *reAlertDelay*. Additionally, noisy turn rate data can cause valid alerts to turn on and off during the unfolding of an encounter, resulting in unnecessary re-alerting on the same target. 

A second effect of using a constant turn rate trajectory prediction is that during sharp turns the projected trajectory may curl up and predict a full 360-degree turn over the length of the trajectory ("wrap-around", see Figure T-9). In environments such as the airport pattern, such projections can generate the appearance of an immediate threat where the continuation of current operations will not necessarily lead to an unsafe condition. 

In order to address these sensitivities, secondary checks are performed on any predicted conflict before the alert can be issued. Alerts solicited due to trajectory wagging or a wrap-around exhibit the same state space signature - see insert in Figure T-9. In those cases, the time to closest point of approach (or tau) calculated using the last reported states is frequently large or even infinite. (The horizontal closure tau is calculated by dividing the horizontal separation by the horizontal closure rate and the vertical tau is calculated by dividing the vertical separation by the vertical rate.) Therefore, a "taucheck" is added before an alert is allowed to be issued." 
The second undesirable effect of trajectory wagging is the turning off and on of a valid alert, for which a "tau-check" is not sufficient. Instead, a "closure-check" is added which prevents an alert to be turned off as long as an alerted target is still converging on the ownship. Described in pseudo code, the two checks can be described as follows: 
Wrap-Around and Wag-Solicited Alert Prevention Pseudo Code: Unless the ownship is currently inside the PAZ, don't let an alert be issued if the currently observed states do not indicate that the closest point of approach will be reached within the time that TSAA 
predicts into the future (i.e., CPA is farther out than [look-ahead time + PAZ scaling] 
seconds). 

Re-Alert Prevention Pseudo Code: Do not let an alert be turned off unless the target aircraft is no longer closing on the ownship in either the vertical or the horizontal dimension. 

## T.4 Additional Algorithm Functionalities

The exemplar algorithm described above is one way that TSAA could be implemented. As mentioned, depending on the algorithmic implementation, additional states may need to be calculated or existing states may need to be conditioned. Additionally, heuristics may be introduced to address certain undesirable alerting behaviors. During the development of the exemplar TSAA algorithm, a few such functionalities were investigated and are summarized here. 

## T.4.1 Proximity Function

In light of potential late alerts during encounters with low closure rates, a proximitybased alerting function was evaluated. Given that an aircraft's maneuvering authority from a straight-line course is strongly correlated to its velocity, the TSAA proximity function evaluates whether to increase the horizontal size of the first PAZ ring as a function of the current ownship and target velocities. Conceptually, Equation 5 increases the size of the first PAZ ring to the distance that the ownship or the target could travel over tref seconds, were it to enter into a turn toward the ownship with a bank angle of θref Note that the size of the first PAZ ring is only adjusted if the size calculated by the proximity function is larger than that calculated by Equation 3. The proximity function is analogous but not identical to the Distance Mode (DMod) used by TCAS.  
Inputs: 

- 
Size of first PAZ ring calculated using Equation 3 (𝑟𝑃𝐴𝑍0_𝐸𝑞3) 
- 
Ownship Velocity (Vown) 
- 
Target Velocity (Vtar) 
- 
Reference Time (tref) 
- 
Reference Bank Angle (θref) 
Outputs: 

- 
Size of first PAZ ring 
 

$$V_{ref}=max\{V_{own},V_{tar}\}$$ $$g_{ref}=g*\tan\left(\theta_{ref}\right)$$ $$rPAZ_{0}$$ $$=max\left\{rPAZ_{0,Eq3},\frac{V_{ref}{}^{2}}{g_{ref}}\left(1-\cos\left(g_{ref}*\frac{t_{ref}}{V_{ref}}\right)\right],V_{ref}*t_{ref}\right.\right.$$ $$\left.\left.-\left(\pi-2\right)*\frac{V_{ref}{}^{2}}{2*g_{ref}}\right\}\right.$$
The parameter assumptions used during the OPA analysis were tref at 9 seconds and a θref at 45-degree bank angle. 

## T.4.2 Trajectory Truncation

A different approach to reducing the effects of the trajectory wrapping around during steep turns is to truncate the predicted trajectory once the heading change is predicted to be in excess of a threshold value. As mentioned, predicting a full 360-degree turn is most likely not a realistic prediction of the near-term operations of the aircraft. Algorithmically, the truncation can be implemented as part of the trajectory propagation routine or the alerting logic. If implemented as part of the trajectory propagation routine, the length of the trajectory is adjusted to not extend beyond the maximum heading difference. This is computationally advantageous, as the trajectory propagation routing tends to be the most computationally intensive part of the TSAA algorithm. However, it may introduce complications later on as the lengths of the ownship trajectory and the target can be of different lengths, potentially complicating the comparisons between them. The second approach keeps all trajectories the same length as defined by the *tlook* time and "truncates" them in the alerting logic. In this approach, the PAZ and the CAZ dimensions are compared against the predicted separations along the trajectory (Section T.3.2.2) only up to the point along the trajectory where neither of the aircraft turned more than the heading change limit.  With this approach, even though a conflict may be predicted along the remaining components of the trajectory, it is not taken into account. 

In the sample code, this truncation is most efficiently implemented at the beginning of the alerting logic. Any conflict predicted further into the future than the time at which the maximum allowable delta psi occurs is disregarded.  
When implemented in conjunction with the exemplar TSAA algorithm, this functionality was shown to improve the performance beyond the benefit provided by the alert verification logic introduced in Section T.3.2.4. For the OPA performance analysis, the value used for config.max_delta_hdg was 90 degrees. 

## T.4.3 Turn Rate Dead-Band

A different approach to address trajectory wagging due to noise in the turn rate is to implement a dead-band around 0 where the turn rate defaults to 0. In doing so, only turn rates above a threshold value are considered to be indicative of a turn. This approach is motivated by the fact that during nominal operations flight technical error as well as data noise can result in small oscillations in the turn rate. By introducing a dead-band, the apparent turns generated by this error and noise are eliminated and the projected trajectory is projected not as a turn but rather as straight and level flight. If TSAA calculates its own turn rate estimate, the dead-band should be included as part of the turn rate estimation, as shown in Section T.4.4.  If psidot is passed to TSAA from an external function such as the DO-317 tracker, the turn rate dead-band is most efficiently included in the trajectory_propagation method in the tsaa_aircraft_class.m file. When implemented in conjunction with the exemplar TSAA algorithm for the OPA, this functionality was shown to not significantly improve the performance. The dead-band threshold was set at 1.5 degrees/second. 

## T.4.4 Estimation Of Additional States

The turn and vertical rate for each involved aircraft must be available in order to propagate the respective trajectories. Optimally, the estimation of all states, including turn rate and vertical rate resides in the tracker. During the development of the TSAA 
exemplar algorithm, turn and vertical rate estimators were developed and evaluated and are provided here for reference. Both the turn and the vertical rate must be calculated before the trajectory propagation step shown in Figure T-6. During the OPA, the estimators described here were used as the source of turn and vertical rate.  

Inputs: 
- 
Historical Track for the ownship and all targets  
- 
Number of historical ground track angle and altitude values used in turn and vertical rate estimation (*q, r*) 
Outputs: 
- 
Estimated Turn Rate (ψ
ǚ ) 
- 
Estimated Vertical Rate (vz) 
The turn rate is calculated based on the differences in track angles between consecutive updates received by TSAA. To smooth out noise, a moving window filter averaging the last q track angle differences is used to calculate the turn rate. The vertical velocity (vz) is calculated with a linear regression fit over the r most recent altitude reports. 

To add turn and vertical rate estimation to the sample TSAA code, the following changes must be made: In tsaa_aircraft_class.m, add the following two lines to the propagate trajectory method: 

obj.zdot = [obj.zdot estimate_zdot(obj, config)]; 
obj.psidot = [obj.psidot estimate_psidot(obj, config)]; 
In tsaa_aircraft_class.m, remove the following two lines from the update() method: 
obj.psidot = [obj.psidot state_data.psidot]; 
obj.zdot = [obj.zdot state_data.zdot]; 
In tsaa_aircraft_class.m, add the following two methods to the class: 
function zdot = estimate_zdot(obj, config) 
   % Find the number of data points that are used to calculate 
   % zdot. It's at least the number of reports currently 
   % available or at most the number of data points defined in 
   % config. The -1 is necessary because we're also counting the 
   % current update: 
   points = min(config.numberOfUpdatesVert, length(obj.z))-1; 
 
   % We need a minimum of three altitudes to estimate a vertical 
   % rate using a linear fit approach: 
   if points >= 3 
       time_stamps = obj.tracker_t(end-points:end) - ... 
                     obj.tracker_t(end); 
       altitudes = obj.z(end-points:end); 
       xmean = mean(time_stamps); 
       ymean = mean(altitudes); 
       x_values = time_stamps - xmean; 
       y_values = altitudes - ymean; 
       zdot = dot(x_values, y_values)/dot(x_values, x_values); 
 
   % If not enough data is available for a linear fit, the 
   % instantaneous climb rate is used. 
   elseif points == 2 
       zdot = (obj.z(end) - obj.z(end-1))/(obj.tracker_t(end)-... 

 
              obj.tracker_t(end-1)); 
   else 
       zdot = 0; 
   end 
end 
 
function psidot = estimate_psidot(obj, config) 
   % Find the number of data points that are used to calculate 
   % psidot. It's at least the number of reports currently 
   % available or at most the number of data points defined in 
   % config. The -1 is necessary because we're also counting the 
   % current update: 
   points = min(config.numberOfUpdatesTurn, length(obj.psi))-1; 
 
   % We need a minimum of two headings to estimate a turn rate: 
   if length(obj.psi) >= 2 
       delta_psi = diff(obj.psi(end-points:end)); 
       delta_t = diff(obj.tracker_t(end-points:end)); 
 
       % Check to see that all delta_psi values are between 
       % -pi and +pi: 
       idx = delta_psi < -pi; 
       delta_psi(idx) = delta_psi(idx) + 2*pi; 
 
       idx = delta_psi > pi; 
       delta_psi(idx) = delta_psi(idx) - 2*pi; 
 
       psidot = mean(delta_psi./delta_t); 
 
   else 
       psidot = 0; 
   end 
 
   % If a turn rate dead band is desired, it would be best  
   % included here. Any predicted turn rate with a magnitude less 
   % than that the config.dead_band_width will be set to 0. 
   % The function included here is the function that was included 
   % in OPA Analysis: 
   if config.dead_band_on == 1 
       if abs(psidot) < config.dead_band_width 
           psidot = 0; 
       end 
   end 
end 
 

In TSAA.m, add the following two lines to the tsaa_config() function:  

'numberOfUpdatesTurn', 5, ... 
'numberOfUpdatesVert', 11, ... 

## T.5 Algorithm Implementation Used For Opa And Test Tracks

The behavior of the basic TSAA algorithm described in Section T.3 is controlled by 14 
internal parameters. A summary of all parameters is provided in Table T-3. Also shown are the settings for all parameters that were determined to most optimally meet performance requirements for TSAA (Kunzi, 2013). 

In order to validate the code for the additional functionalities, all three of them were also included with the parameter setting mentioned in the respective sections.

## Appendix U Traffic Situation Awareness With Alerting (Tsaa) Test Tracks U.1 Summary And Assumptions

This appendix describes specific aircraft track sets that are used to provide stimulus scenarios for TSAA testing. The tracks are split into two categories: 1) Must Alert and 2) 
Must Not Alert. Must Alert tracks test the alerting capabilities of a TSAA system for a range of aircraft encounters that have historically occurred in both airport and en route environments. Must Not Alert tracks test similar encounters as the Must Alert tracks except that the closest point of approach is modified to separate aircraft such that no alerting should occur according to pilot and industry experts.  Each track set contains multiple scenarios that test a range of track data sources as well as track state variables. 

## U.1.1 Test Track Framework

The framework for the TSAA test tracks was derived from multiple sources. The most notable of those sources was a study of NTSB Mid-Air Collision (MAC) reports and Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) reports for the years 2000-
2010.3  Through analysis of NTSB report narratives and ASIAS voluntary reports from flight crews, using only the most objective data, the study categorized the encounters using similarities in geometry and location in order to identify the environments where TSAA would need to operate reliably. The TSAA test tracks follow the categories found in this study. The test track framework also pulls on pilot and industry experts as sources for the types of tracks that a TSAA system needs to test. These groups shared their experiences creating and using TCAS I and TAS systems to help frame the types of encounters that TSAA should and should not alert on. The test track framework also uses knowledge gained from prototype TSAA system development, flight tests, sample algorithm development, and a performance analysis to determine the most important encounters for which a TSAA system needs to test its alerting capabilities. 

## U.1.2 Ownship And Target Schematic

Each track set contains or references a schematic that illustrates the encounter. The ownship aircraft will be designated as a solid black line. The target aircraft will be designated as a dotted black line as shown in Figure U-1. 

 
                                                     

## U.1.3 Encounter Parameters

Each Must Alert and Must Not Alert track is defined by the relative state parameters Intersect Angle (IA), Relative Vertical Velocity (RVV), and Relative Horizontal Velocity 
(RHV), as shown in Figure U-2 and Figure U-3. RHV and RVV define relative velocity between the ownship aircraft and the target aircraft. Tracks within a track set will test a range of relative state parameters in order to fully exercise the capabilities of a TSAA implementation. 

## U.1.4 Traffic Sources

Three traffic data sources are examined: ADS-B, ADS-R, TIS-B (single terminal radar or single en route radar depending on encounter environment). Each source is simulated by taking the idealized truth trajectory and adding real-world position and velocity noise. 

Table U-1 gives the error parameters for ownship and targets used in the track data degradation process in Appendix I. The same appendix details the process used for conversion of the idealized truth data to the reports used as stimulus for TSAA testing. 

The report format is given in Table U-2.

## U.1.5 Test Track Verification

All Must Alert test tracks were verified for appropriate alerting when CPA was known to be in the protected zone according to the requirements in Section 2.2.4.5.3.1.1 Must Alert Tracks. All Must Not Alert tracks were verified for appropriate alert suppression when CPA was known to be outside of the protected zone according to the requirements in Section 2.2.4.5.3.1.2 Must Not Alert Tracks. Verification was done using both the TSAA 
sample algorithm and an alternate verification algorithm developed at the US DOT/RITA/Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. Testing with both algorithms ensures independence of the test tracks to different TSAA implementations. 

## U.1.6 Test Track Summary

Table U-3 gives a summary of the number of Must Alert Test Tracks for each encounter type. Table U-4 gives a summary of the number of Must Not Alert Test Tracks for each encounter type. For each track set, the total number of tracks using all scenario types and traffic sources is given as well as the scenario numbers that correspond to fixed-wing aircraft as ownship and rotorcraft as ownship.

Many of the test tracks verify alerting and non-alerting for a TSAA system on a fixedwing aircraft (i.e., fixed-wing as ownship). However, there are also test tracks that verify alerting and non-alerting for a TSAA system specifically for rotorcraft (i.e., rotorcraft as ownship). Table U-5 prescribes the tracks in the following sections that specifically test TSAA with a rotorcraft as the ownship.

## U.2 Must Alert Tracks

This section describes aircraft track sets that are used to provide stimulus to the TSAA application to ensure alerting for aircraft encounters that meet the conditions of Section 2.2.4.5.3.1.1 Must Alert Tracks. As such, Must Alert tracks test the alerting capabilities of a TSAA system for 1) scenarios where ownship and TSAA traffic are not accelerating and for, 2) a range of aircraft encounters that have historically occurred in both airport and en route environments, testing accelerating and non-accelerating ownship and TSAA 
traffic tracks. For all tracks, it is assumed that un-altered flight paths will result in a midair collision or near mid-air collision (NMAC), two aircraft passing within 500 ft of each other, as defined in the aeronautical information manual (AIM). To determine the time before the closest point of approach (CPA) at which an alert begins, the CPA time is provided for each track. 

## U.2.1 Non-Accelerating Ownship And Traffic Encounters

As prescribed in §2.2.4.5.3.1.1 Must Alert Tracks, TSAA will alert at least 35 seconds prior to CPA for scenarios where ownship and TSAA traffic are not accelerating. This section defines 15 non-accelerating encounters that test basic alerting for CPA that occurs at 0 ft horizontal separation and 0 ft vertical over a range of relative vertical and horizontal velocities that would be encountered in both the airport and en route environments. Note that ownship and traffic data for this section will be undegraded. Table U-7 gives the undegraded non-accelerating encounters.

## U.2.2 Airport Environment Encounters

The following set of tracks test TSAA alerting performance for encounters that historically occur in the airport environment.  As prescribed in §2.2.4.5.3.1.1 Must Alert Tracks, TSAA will alert more than 12.5 seconds prior to CPA with TSAA traffic when CPA is within 500 ft horizontally and 200 ft vertically of the ownship.  

## U.2.2.1 Convergence On Same Leg Of Airport Traffic Pattern

The following set of tracks test TSAA alerting performance for encounters where two aircraft are converging on the same leg of an airport pattern.  This includes convergence on final to the same runway and convergence for two aircraft in different flight phases. 

## U.2.2.1.1 Must Alert Track Set #1: Convergence On Final To Same Runway

Must Alert Track Set #1 is designed to evaluate the alerting capabilities of an ownship on final to a runway when a target aircraft is also attempting to land on the runway. In all cases, the ownship pilot has limited out-the-window view of the target because it is either above or behind the ownship. Both aircraft descend on a nominal 3° glideslope with variance depending on RVV. Ownship and target track profiles are similar with small RVV and RHV values. The IA should not be more than ten degrees. This scenario can also occur with switched target and ownship roles. Scenarios marked with (i) occur with ownship in front. Scenarios marked with (ii) occur with ownship as the chasing aircraft. Figure U-4 and Figure U-5 show schematics of the encounter. Table U-8 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.2.2.1.2 Must Alert Track Set #2: Convergence On Same Leg; Different Flight Phases

Must Alert Track Set #2 is designed to evaluate the alerting capabilities of an ownship either departing an airport and climbing through the airport pattern (A) or descending into the airport pattern (B) such that the target is either descending into the airport pattern (A) 
or climbing through the airport pattern on the same leg (B), respectively. Ownship and target track profiles are similar except for altitude. The IA should not be more than ten degrees and RHV is small, but RVV can range from 200 - 3000 ft/min. Figure U-6 and Figure U-7 show schematics of the encounter. Table U-9 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter. Each scenario shall be tested twice such that ownship and target play both the ascending and descending roles.

## U.2.2.2 Entering Airport Traffic Pattern

The following set of tracks test TSAA alerting performance for encounters where the ownship is established in the traffic pattern and the target is entering the traffic pattern. There are tests for both standard and non-standard traffic pattern entrances. 

## U.2.2.2.1 Must Alert Track Set #3: Convergence In Airport Pattern With Target Entering Via Standard Procedure

Must Alert Track Set #3 is designed to evaluate the alerting capabilities of an ownship established in the traffic pattern that encounters a target joining the pattern via a standard procedure. Ownship altitude and speed are constant while either following the traffic pattern downwind leg (A) or turning from crosswind to downwind (B). The target enters the downwind leg from above and behind the ownship. The IA should not be more than sixty degrees. This scenario can also occur with switched target and ownship roles. 

Scenarios marked with (i) occur with ownship already established in the pattern. 

Scenarios marked with (ii) occur with ownship descending into the pattern. Figure U-8 
and Figure U-9 show schematics of the encounter. Table U-10 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.2.2.2.2 Must Alert Track Set #4: Convergence In Airport Pattern With Target Entering Via Non-Standard Procedure

Must Alert Track Set #4 is designed to evaluate the alerting capabilities of an ownship established in the traffic pattern that encounters a target joining the pattern via a nonstandard procedure such as a direct final or opposite turn. Ownship altitude and speed are constant while following the traffic pattern base to final leg or crosswind-to-downwind leg. The ownship continually turns while the target either enters straight from above on direct final (A) or takes an opposite turn into the traffic pattern (B). The range of IAs is tested through the target and/or ownship turns. The range of RHVs is also tested through the turns with RHV decreasing to zero as the ownship and target meet. This scenario can also occur with switched target and ownship roles. Scenarios marked with (i) occur with ownship already established in the pattern. Scenarios marked with (ii) occur with ownship entering into the pattern. Figure U-10 and Figure U-11 show schematics of the encounter. Table U-11 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.2.2.3 Departing Airport Traffic Pattern

The following set of tracks test TSAA alerting performance for encounters that occur with departing aircraft. There are tests both for encounters where the ownship is departing and where the target is departing. 

## U.2.2.3.1 Must Alert Track Set #5: Convergence With Departing Target Jet

Must Alert Track Set #5 is designed to evaluate the alerting capabilities of a VFR ownship cruising above the traffic pattern altitude that encounters a target jet aircraft departing from a nearby airport. Ownship altitude and speed are constant. The target departs a nearby airport, ascending at 3000 ft/min. The IA can be any angle. The RHV can vary from zero to 500 knots depending on the IA.  
Figure U-12 and Figure U-13 show schematics of the encounter. gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.2.2.3.2 Must Alert Track Set #6: Convergence With Approaching Target Jet

Must Alert Track Set #6 is designed to evaluate the alerting capabilities of a departing ownship that encounters a target jet on an IFR approach to the same airport. The ownship climbs on the upwind leg while a target jet on IFR approaches a different runway. The RVV is greater than 3000 ft/min as the aircraft move quickly vertically towards each other. IA is anything but zero degrees. RHV varies from 250 to 500 knots. Figure U-14 
and Figure U-15 show schematics of the encounter. Table U-13 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter. 

Verify alerts when ownship cruises parallel over runway and target departs at same ground speed, but vertically chases ownship. Verify alerts when ownship cruises parallel over runway and target departs 
at faster ground speed than ownship, overtaking both vertically and 
horizontally. Verify alerts when ownship cruises perpendicularly towards runway and target departs and meets ownship head on through ascent. Verify alerts when ownship cruises parallel towards runway and target departs and meets ownship head on through ascent with maximum relative horizontal speed closure.

## U.2.2.4 Rotorcraft Encounters In Airport Pattern

The following set of tracks test TSAA alerting performance for ownship and rotorcraft target encounters in the airport environment. 

## U.2.2.4.1 Must Alert Track Set #7: Touch-And-Go Convergence

Must Alert Track Set #7 is designed to evaluate the alerting capabilities of an ownship performing a touch-and-go at a non-towered airport that encounters a target rotorcraft on the upwind leg. The target rotorcraft expects the ownship to do a full stop landing and departs on ownship touchdown. Ownship climbs on the upwind leg after the touch-andgo at a normal ascent rate with the target rotorcraft moving across the runway and climbing more slowly than the ownship. RVV is less than 200 ft/min and RHV is less than 50 knots. The IA has no constraints. This scenario can also occur with switched target and ownship roles. Scenarios marked with (i) occur with ownship as the fixed-wing doing the touch-and-go. Scenarios marked with (ii) occur with ownship as the rotorcraft. 

Figure U-16 and Figure U-17 show schematics of the encounter. Table U-14 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.2.2.4.2 Must Alert Track Set #8: Rotorcraft Convergence On Final Approach

Must Alert Track Set #8 is designed to evaluate the alerting capabilities of an ownship on final to a non-towered airport that encounters a target rotorcraft approaching via a nonstandard procedure. The ownship and target rotorcraft encounter each other on short final. The target can approach from all angles, likely during an autorotation maneuver. This scenario can also occur with switched target and ownship roles. Scenarios marked with (i) occur with ownship as the fixed-wing on final. Scenarios marked with (ii) occur with ownship as the rotorcraft doing the autorotation.  Figure U-18 and Figure U-19 show schematics of the encounter. Table U-15 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.2.2.4.3 Must Alert Track Set #9: News Or Firefighting Rotorcraft Operating In Same Area

Must Alert Track Set #9 is designed to evaluate the alerting capabilities of an ownship in a swarming situation where multiple fixed-wing aircraft or rotorcraft hover or circle around an event. These types of operations include, but are not limited to electronic news gathering (ENG), search and rescue (SAR), helicopter emergency medical service 
(HEMS), law enforcement, forestry, and fire-fighting4. While these types of operations do not traditionally occur near airport environments, rotorcraft in these situations usually maintain altitudes below 3000 ft AGL and low airspeeds such that their protected zones should be consistent with the airport environment definition for Must Alert. 

                                                     
--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
The tracks test maneuvers where ownship and target perform fixed radius orbits (A), target drifts or maneuvers vertically into the ownship (B), target drifts or maneuvers horizontally into the ownship (C), target drifts or maneuvers horizontally into ownship while ownship does a 360° pedal turn (D), and where target re-positions 180° around the ownship (E). The scenarios will also test alerting for switched target and ownship roles. Scenarios marked with (i) occur with ownship being intruded upon and scenarios marked with (ii) occur with ownship as the intruder. Figure U-20 shows schematics of the encounters. Table U-16 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for the encounters.

## U.2.3 En Route Environment Encounters

The following set of tracks test TSAA alerting performance for encounters that historically occur in the en route environment. Note that the definition of the en route environment differs from the traditional definition and is defined by any encounters that occur away from the airport vicinity. As prescribed in Section 2.2.4.5.3.1.1, Must Alert Tracks, TSAA will alert more than 12.5 seconds prior to closest point of approach (CPA) with TSAA traffic when CPA is within 500 ft horizontally and 450 ft vertically of the ownship.

Verify alert in ownship for target reposition 180° around ownship. Verify alert in ownship for ownship reposition 180° around target. 

## U.2.3.1 Convergence On Fix

The following set of tracks test TSAA alerting performance for encounters where two aircraft are converging on the same fix. The ownship and target can approach at any angle and be ascending or descending. In general, ground speeds are higher than the airport environment, though relative speeds can still go to zero depending on encounter geometry. For all tracks, it is assumed that un-altered flight paths will result in a mid-air collision. 

## U.2.3.1.1 Must Alert Track Set #10: Convergence With Ia ≤ 60°

Must Alert Track Set #10 is designed to evaluate the alerting capability of an ownship in an en route environment that converges with target aircraft at angles greater than zero degrees and less than or equal to 60 degrees. Both the ownship and target can be cruising, descending, or ascending. Figure U-21 shows a schematic of the encounter. Table U-17

## U.3 Must Not Alert Tracks

As prescribed in §2.2.4.5.3.1.1 Must Not Alert Tracks, this section describes aircraft track sets that will generate no alerts when provided as stimulus to the TSAA application. For all tracks, it is assumed that the aircraft will pass either no less than 0.5 NM horizontally or 500 ft vertically of each other in the airport environment, and will pass either no less than 2-3 NM horizontally or 850 ft vertically of each other in the en route environment. 

## U.3.1 Airport Environment Encounters

The following set of tracks test TSAA non-alerting performance for maneuvers that historically occur in the airport environment. As prescribed in §2.2.4.5.3.1.2 Must Not Alert Tracks, TSAA will not alert when CPA with TSAA traffic is greater than 0.5 NM horizontally or 500 ft vertically from the ownship. 

## U.3.1.1 Convergence On Same Leg Of Airport Traffic Pattern

The following set of tracks test TSAA non-alerting performance for encounters where two aircraft are converging on the same leg of an airport pattern. This includes convergence on final to the same runway and convergence for two aircraft in different flight phases. 

## U.3.1.1.1 Must Not Alert Track Set #1: Convergence On Final To Parallel Runways

Must Not Alert Track Set #1 is designed to verify that there are no alerts in ownship for a parallel runway approach with incoming target at initial specified RVV, RHV, and IA encounter parameters. The encounter can occur on either a base to final turn and approach (A) or direct final approach (B). The target decreases speed and changes trajectory to a parallel course with respect to the ownship as it approaches 0.5 NM 
horizontal separation with the ownship. Figure U-28 and Figure U-29 show schematics of the encounter. Table U-23 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.3.1.2 Entering Airport Traffic Pattern

The following set of tracks test TSAA non-alerting performance for encounters where the ownship is established in the traffic pattern and the target is entering the traffic pattern. There are tests for both standard and non-standard traffic pattern entrances. 

## U.3.1.3 Must Not Alert Track Set #4: Convergence In Airport Pattern With Target Entering Via Standard Procedure

Must Not Alert Track Set #4 is designed to verify that there are no alerts in ownship for incoming target at specified RVV, RHV, and IA encounter parameters such that the ownship-target horizontal separation reduces to 0.5 NM.  The scenarios will test cases where the target descends into the traffic pattern from the en route environment and meets the ownship either as it turns from the crosswind to downwind leg (B) or while it's on the downwind leg (A). Both cases test situations where the target passes in front or behind the ownship. In scenarios where the ownship turns from crosswind to downwind leg, the RHV and IA parameters vary as the ownship changes heading.  This scenario can also occur with switched target and ownship roles.  Scenarios marked with (i) occur with ownship already established in the pattern.  Scenarios marked with (ii) occur with ownship descending into the pattern.  See Section U.2.2.2.1 for schematic that demonstrates the encounters.  Table U-26 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.3.1.3.1 Must Not Alert Track Set #5: Convergence In Airport Pattern With Target Entering Via Non-Standard Procedure

Must Not Alert Track Set #5 is designed to verify that there are no alerts in ownship for incoming target at specified RVV, RHV, and IA encounter parameters such that the ownship-target horizontal separation reduces to 0.5 NM. The scenarios will test two cases: 1) the target descends into the pattern on direct final, meeting the ownship turning from the downwind leg to final; 2) the target makes an opposite turn into the pattern, meeting the ownship turning from the crosswind to downwind leg. Both cases test situations where the target passes in front or behind the ownship. The RHV and IA parameters vary as the ownship changes heading. This scenario can also occur with switched target and ownship roles. Scenarios marked with (i) occur with ownship already established in the pattern. Scenarios marked with (ii) occur with ownship entering into the pattern. See Section U.2.2.2.2 for schematic that demonstrates the encounter. Table U-27 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.3.1.5 Rotorcraft Encounters In Airport Pattern

The following set of tracks test TSAA non-alerting performance for ownship and rotorcraft target encounters in the airport environment. 

## U.3.1.5.1 Must Not Alert Track Set #8: Touch-And-Go Convergence

Must Not Alert Track Set #8 is designed to verify that there are no alerts in an ownship for incoming target at specified RVV, RHV, and IA encounter parameters such that the ownship-target horizontal separation reduces to 0.5 NM. The scenarios will test cases where an ownship performs a touch-and-go at a non-towered airport and encounters a target rotorcraft on the upwind leg. The target rotorcraft expects the ownship to do a full stop landing and departs on ownship touchdown. The scenarios will test cases where the target passes either in front or behind the ownship. This scenario can also occur with switched target and ownship roles. Scenarios marked with (i) occur with ownship as the fixed-wing doing the touch-and-go. Scenarios marked with (ii) occur with ownship as the rotorcraft. See Section U.2.2.4.1 for schematic that demonstrates the encounter.  
Table U-30 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.3.1.5.2 Must Not Alert Track Set #9: Rotorcraft Convergence On Final Approach

Must Not Alert Track Set #9 is designed to verify that there are no alerts in an ownship for incoming target at specified RVV, RHV, and IA encounter parameters such that the ownship-target horizontal separation reduces to 0.5 NM. The scenarios will test cases where an ownship on final to a non-towered airport encounters a target rotorcraft approaching via a non-standard procedure. The ownship and target rotorcraft encounter each other on short final. The target can approach from all angles, likely during an autorotation maneuver. The scenarios will test cases where the target passes either in front or behind the ownship. See Section U.2.2.4.2 for schematic that demonstrates the encounter. Table U-31 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.3.1.5.3 Must Not Alert Track Set #10: News Or Firefighting Rotorcraft Operating In Same Area

Must Not Alert Track Set #10 is designed to verify that there are no alerts in an ownship in a swarming situation where multiple fixed-wing aircraft or rotorcraft hover or circle around an event. These types of operations include, but are not limited to electronic news gathering (ENG), search and rescue (SAR), helicopter emergency medical service 
(HEMS), law enforcement, forestry, and fire-fighting.5 While these types of operations do not traditionally occur near airport environments, rotorcraft in these situations usually maintain altitudes below 3000 ft AGL and low airspeeds such that no alerts should occur as prescribed for the airport environment definition for Must Not Alert tracks. See Section U.2.2.4.3 for schematic that demonstrates the encounter. Table U-32 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## U.3.2 En Route Environment Encounters

The following set of tracks test TSAA non-alerting performance for maneuvers that historically occur in the en route environment. Note that the definition of the en route environment differs from the traditional definition and is defined by any encounters that occur away from the airport vicinity. As prescribed in Section 2.2.4.5.3.1.2 Must Not Alert Tracks, TSAA will not alert when CPA with TSAA traffic is greater than 2 NM 
horizontally or 850 ft vertically from the ownship. Tracks created for this case follow the definition in §2.2.4.5.3.1 TSAA Traffic Caution Alert Performance Requirements that the encounter occurs below 10,000 ft mean sea level. Similarly, TSAA will not alert when CPA with TSAA traffic is greater than 3 NM horizontally or 850 ft vertically from the ownship. Tracks created for this case follow the definition in §2.2.4.5.3.1 TSAA Traffic Caution Alert Performance Requirements that the encounter occurs above or at 10,000 ft mean sea level. 

## U.3.2.1 Convergence On Fix

The following set of tracks test TSAA non-alerting performance for encounters where two aircraft are converging on the same fix. The ownship and target can approach at any angle and be ascending or descending. In general, ground speeds are higher than the airport environment, though relative speeds can still go to zero depending on encounter geometry. 

## U.3.2.1.1 Must Not Alert Track Set #11: Convergence With Ia ≤ 60°

Must Not Alert Track Set #11 is designed to verify that there are no alerts in an ownship for incoming target at specified RVV, RHV, and IA encounter parameters such that the ownship-target horizontal separation reduces to 2 NM when altitude is less than 10,000 ft MSL and 3 NM when altitude is greater than 10,000 ft MSL. The scenarios will test cases where an ownship in an en route environment converges with target aircraft at angles of 
60 degrees or less. The zero degree angle is considered in a separate section as an overtake scenario. The ownship is cruising while the target can be cruising, descending, or ascending. The scenarios will test cases where the target passes either in front or behind the ownship. See Section U.2.3.1.1 for schematic that demonstrates the encounter. Table U-33 gives the range of scenarios to be tested for this encounter.

## Appendix V Cavs Ads-B / Tcas Validation Function Analysis V.1 Introduction

ADS-B / TCAS validation at surveillance information level is a general requirement for new generation ADS-B In applications, including CAVS, targeting at the detection of potentially misleading ADS-B Out information from "rogue" aircraft. Thereby, the requirement primarily targets at mitigating security threats that are associated with erroneous ADS-B position information that deliberately masks the actual position of real aircraft in the airspace or places fake aircraft into the airspace ("spoofing"). The ADS-B / 
TCAS validation function relies on comparing passive ADS-B position reports (and derived aircraft slant range) with active TCAS slant range measurements. 

Whilst the function is primarily defined for Security threat mitigation reasons, it also supports the identification of "rogue" aircraft that, without intention, incorrectly encode ADS-B horizontal position quality indications. The term "rogue" ADS-B Out aircraft is used in a general sense to describe the target of the ADS-B / TCAS validation function. 

In the following, reference is made to the CAVS application and its related SPR material (DO-354/ED-233). However, the key requirements are generally applicable to other Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) ADS-B In applications such as FIM as well. 

## V.2 Approach

The ADS-B / TCAS (surveillance) validation function aims at protecting against misleading horizontal position quality information (as associated with the actual position information) that might be encountered, amongst others, from some legacy ADS-B Out installations (in particular from Version 0 ones). In effect, in such cases, the function protects against horizontal measurement integrity failures that are not related to the actual measurement of the information but the encoding of the quality information thereof. 

As a consequence, the CAVS spacing error analysis (as described in Annex D to the CAVS SPR) offers a suitable tool for determining the respective requirements of the ADS-B / TCAS validation function. In particular, the method can be used to establish a safety-driven allowable rate of encountering "rogue" ADS-B Out installations. This includes the consideration of an operational false-alert rate in the determination of the requirements for the underlying ADS-B / TCAS cross-check algorithm. Such false alerts would lead to the undesired and unnecessary "un-designation" of a target aircraft during on-going CAVS operations and its rate of occurrence should therefore be minimized. 

For this, the measurement integrity analysis approach introduced in CAVS SPR Section D.2 is used to determine an allowable spacing loss relative to a defining aircraft spacing value. The latter is established as a function of the minimum cross-check surveillance range of 5.0 NM. The cross-check surveillance range is the range within which a TCAS 
track must be available (which must also coincide with being in ADS-B range).  
The cross-check surveillance range of 5.0 NM is selected so that there is a very high likelihood that a TCAS track will have been established at that range. As the CAVS application is performed in the terminal area with potentially high traffic density, reference is made to statistical data that has been collected in high density TMA airspace, taking into account worst case transponder power output and TCAS receiver sensitivity constraints. Under those conditions, the statistics established a high likelihood of TCAS tracks having been established within a 5 NM to 7 NM range. 

The overall approach considers the following aspects: 

- 
A safety risk derived performance benchmark for comparison against the ADS-B 
/ TCAS cross-check performance and the derivation of the allowable rate of encountering "rogue" ADS-B Out aircraft. In terms of manifestation of the 
horizontal position error produced by these "rogue" aircraft (associated with an incorrect quality indication), a sustained and consistent bias horizontal position error is assumed (as typically experienced with inertial positioning systems). As 
this corresponds to the modeling of a measurement integrity error condition, the spacing error analysis method is applied. Rather than a per-flight hour rate unit, 
the analysis expresses respective rates on a per-CAVS operation basis. 
- 
A defining aircraft spacing minimum based on the TCAS cross-check surveillance range is established, taking into account an erosion of this range as a function of the differential aircraft speed and the duration for executing a single independent cross-validation of the ADS-B and TCAS range measurements. This 
validation duration thereby takes due account of the GNSS position measurement de-correlation time (as considered to be present in the ADS-B measurements). 
- 
The ADS-B / TCAS cross-check performance is expressed by a joint Gaussian 
probability distribution based on the known TCAS measurement performance, 
CAVS required ADS-B NACP performance and latency compensation related 
position errors. 
- 
For the establishment of the joint ADS-B / TCAS spacing measurement error 
distribution, the proposed analysis considers the respective Gaussian mean error 
and standard deviation components as illustrated in Figure V-1Figure . In line 
with the range error domain, single Gaussian errors apply (i.e. along the direct line between the two aircraft). 
 
For the convolution of ADS-B and TCAS distance measurement errors, the following parameters apply: 

- 
ΔμADS-B: differential mean error of ADS-B position measurements of both 
ownship and target aircraft. This error is established as a function of 
uncompensated latency and aircraft speed parameters on the one hand and of compensated latency and aircraft velocity error (NACV) parameters on the other. 

- 
σADS-B: simply described by the convolution of the single dimension Gaussian 
nominal horizontal position error standard deviation as established on the individual aircraft measurement accuracy. In order to have a more reasonable (but still conservative) reflection of reality, whilst for the target aircraft the upper 
bound of the required NACP bound of 0.1 NM is used, for the ownship the lower 
bound value is used (i.e. 0.05 NM). 
- 
μTCAS and σTCAS: the (single dimension) standard TCAS performance values. 
All analysis parameters and their respective (default) values are listed and described in Section V.3. 

As introduced in CAVS SPR Section D.2, the CAVS spacing error analysis uses the following integrity performance benchmark: 

$$\mathrm{IPB}=10\mathrm{E}\;(\mathrm{\boldmath~a1~}+\mathrm{\boldmath~b1~}*\mathrm{\boldmath~x~}/\mathrm{\boldmath~S p a c M i n}\;)$$
Compared to the GPS-RAIM related analysis in CAVS SPR Section D.2, the parameter contained in the generic parameter 'a1' is as follows for the ADS-B / TCAS validation analysis: 

$\rm Pe_{img}=\rm Pe_{base}$${}^{*}$$\rm Pe_{exp}=\rm Pe_{base}$${}^{*}$$\rm(D_{exp}$${}^{*}$$\rm Rs_{cavs})$
Thereby, Pebase is a function of the following safety methodology parameters (see CAVS 
SPR Section D.2 for details): Pebase = PemutualCause * PemutualRole * Pedir / STallocNIC. 

Further, for the given case, the parameters PemutualCause and PemutualRole are both '1'. 

Otherwise, 'Pedir' and 'STallocNIC' are the same as established in CAVS SPR Section D.2. Hence, Pebase amounts to a value of 0.5. 

Further, Peexp is the product of the following two operational parameters: 

- 
 'Dexp' : for the analysis at hand, Dexp is denoted by the value Dval that expresses 
the duration required to obtain an independent ADS-B / TCAS validation sample. 
The value of Dval used in the analysis is 60 seconds. 
- 
'Rscavs': In line with the CAVS SPR analysis, Rscavs is 2/15 per flight hour. It is 
noted that other ADS-B In TMA applications might be exhibited to a higher 
value of 'Rscavs'. However, this is only affecting the acceptable rate of 
encountering "rogue" aircraft but not the key validation function requirements established in these MOPS. 
Therefore, the value of Pe${}_{\rm{utg}}$ amounts to 1.1E-3 for the ADS-B / TCAS validation analysis.

With regards to the respective ADS-B / TCAS validation performance 'ATVP', the following formula applies:

$$\rm{ATVP=RACR\ ^{\star}\ (\ 0.5\ ^{\star}\ \rm{erfc(hpic\ ;\ \mu_{\rm{utg}}+\mu_{\rm{tergr}}\ ;\ \sigma_{\rm{utg}})+0.5)}$$

Thereby:
- 
'erfc' : complementary error function (1 - 2 * integral of Gaussian distribution), 
describing the performance of the ADS-B / TCAS validation function in 
detecting horizontal position measurement integrity failure conditions stemming from "rogue" ADS-B Out installations; 
- 
'RACR': allowable rate of encountering a "rogue" aircraft in a CAVS operation; 
- 
'hpie': size of horizontal position integrity error due to misleading measurement integrity quality information from "rogue" aircraft; 
- 
ADS-B / TCAS validation integrity monitoring test statistic standard deviation σintg, determined on the convolution of the respective ADS-B and TCAS position error parameters introduced in SPR Section V.3. Based on these, a σintg 
value of 0.05 NM is established. 
- 
'μintg': ADS-B / TCAS validation integrity monitoring detection threshold (as 
determined on the allowable false alert probability 'FAR' (see Section V.3). 
Thereby the following formula applies (using the inverse complementary error function erfc-1): 
$\mu_{\rm intg}=$ erfc( (1 - FAR)E(D${}_{\rm lval}$ / D${}_{\rm total,val}$) )${}^{\mbox{\tiny-1}}$ * $\sigma_{\rm intg}$
- 
'μregErr': differential range measurement error due to time registration error 
between the time of applicability of the ADS-B / ADS-B range and the TCAS 
distance measurements. This is described in more detail in the following paragraphs. 
Within the range error domain (expressed in [m]), the ADS-B / TIS-B registration error is the product of distance change rate [m/s] and the actual time registration error [s]. The distance change rate is thereby described by the following parameters, as applicable at a certain point in time: 

- 
Ownship reference ground speed 'v'; 
- 
Differential ground speed between the two aircraft: 'Δv' 
- 
Differential track angle between the two aircraft: 'Δθ' 
The respective range rate 'RR' formula is as follows:

$$\text{RR}=\text{\textasciitil}(\ 2*(\text{v}^{2}+\text{v}*\Delta\text{v})*(\ 1-\cos(\Delta\theta)\ )+\Delta\text{v}^{2}\ )$$

This formula applies to initial aircraft trajectories that would lead to zero separation at the closest point of approach and is a (slightly) over-bounding approximation of aircraft at larger distances, i.e. as applicable under typical TCAS track acquisition with less than peak 1090 MHz frequency loads. The most defining cases are thereby initial head-on encounters (i.e. $\Delta\theta=180^{\circ}$).

Figure V-2 first illustrates the sensitivity of the range rates as a function of differential track angles and differential ground speeds, for a reference ground speed of 350 knots. As shown, for large '$\Delta\theta$', the respective range rates are somewhat increased or decreased for 
negative or positive 'Δv' values, respectively. However, as this is not in a significant way, the analysis uses a zero differential speed as reference value. 

Δv
Δv Δv In line with the above reasoning for the setting of 'Δv' = 0 and 'Δθ' = 180°, Figure V-3 
shows the differential range error 'μregErr' as a function of possible ADS-B / TCAS time registration errors and aircraft reference speeds. Using the related analysis in the "Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II Hybrid Surveillance" MOPS (DO-300A / ED- 221), for the derivation of a time registration error reference is made to the reference aircraft speed of 600 knots and a ADS-B / TCAS time registration error induced range error in the order of 145m (as used in the DO-300A / ED-221 analysis). With respect to Figure V-3, this would lead to a time registration error of 0.25 seconds and a related range error 'μregErr r' of 90 m, using a reference speed 'v' = 350 knots as a conservative upper bound for any TMA application. 

Δv This leads the following requirement: 
 

PR.1 The ADS-B / TCAS Validation Time Registration Error **shall** be 0.25 seconds. 
 
Using a value of 'μregErr ' = 90 m in the above 'ATVP' formula yields the graphical presentation of the outcome of the analysis in Figure V-4, i.e. with respect to the: 
 

- 
TCAS cross-check surveillance range of 5.0 NM (green line); 
- 
Analysis defining spacing value of 4.67 NM, taken into account the erosion of spacing during the time accounted for obtaining a (first) independent validation 
sample (yellow line); 
- 
Integrity performance benchmark 'IPB' (orange curve); and 
- 
ADS-B / TCAS validation performance 'ATVP' (blue curve). 
 The touching point of the 'IPB' and 'ATVP' curves establishes the following validation detection threshold requirement: 
PR.2 The CAVS ADS-B / TCAS Validation Detection Threshold **shall** be 0.25 NM. 

## 

In addition, the analysis establishes an allowable rate of "rogue" aircraft of 1.9E-1 per CAVS operation. This is considered to be much more frequent than any actual occurrence of potentially misleading ADS-B Out installations. In terms of a sensitivity analysis, the following discussion applies: 
 

- 
Altering the NACP bound to 0.05 NM (NACP =8, for both aircraft) would render 
a detection threshold of 0.20 NM, whereas a target aircraft NACP bound of 0.3 
NM (NACP =6, 0.05 NM for ownship) would result in a detection threshold of 
0.48 NM. This is supportive of the conclusion expressed within CAVS SPR 
Section D.2.4 that, whilst a NACP better than 0.1 NM offers a certain 
improvement in performance, a worse NACP leads to a significantly poorer 
performance; 
- 
Varying the TCAS cross-check surveillance range does not affect the size of the 
detection threshold but rather the allowable rate of encountering "rogue" aircraft.  
o 
For a TCAS surveillance range of 6.0 NM, the following rates apply: 2.6E-1 
for NACP =7, 3.2E-1 for NACP =8 and 6.5E-2 for NACP =6;  
o 
For a TCAS surveillance range of 7.0 NM, the following rates apply: 3.2E-1 
for NACP =7, 3.8E-1 for NACP =8 and 1.0E-1 for NACP =6. 
These results show that larger TCAS surveillance range would provide for some higher rates of allowable "rogue" aircraft rates, compared to the 5.0 NM reference case. At the same time, it can be again concluded that the difference between a NACP of 7 and 8 is not much significant whereas the difference with a NACP of 6 is. 

## V.3 Modeling

 The following tables summarize the various parameters that determine the performance requirements of the ADS-B / TCAS validation function. 

 

General Parameters 
Aircraft Speed [kts] 
Aircraft speed as applicable to the point in time at which the two aircraft are spaced by the cross-check surveillance range of 5 NM. 
The analysis uses a value of 200 knots. Aircraft speed as applicable to possible initiation of TCAS tracks and hence earliest point in time at which the validation function might become active (as applicable to TMA applications). The analysis uses a value of 350 knots. 
Dflight [min] 
Average flight duration to convert between per flight-hour and per- CAVS operation rates. The CAVS analysis uses a value of 90 minutes (in line with the CAVS OSA). 
Differential ground  
speed 'Δgs' [kts] 
Differential ground speed between the two aircraft involved in a CAVS operation, as applicable at the time at which the two aircraft are spaced by the cross-check surveillance range. The CAVS analysis uses a value of 20 knots. 
Rs [1 / flight hour] 
Rate of CAVS operations per flight hour as established by the CAVS spacing error analysis (see CAVS SPR). The analysis uses the respective value established in the CAVS OSA, i.e. 2 out of 15 flight hours. 
Safety Methodology Parameters 
FAR [1 / ops] 
Operationally desired false-alert rate of the ADS-B / TCAS crosscheck function. Based on this rate and the joint ADS-B / TCAS range measurement error distribution, the cross-check range threshold (= containment bound) is determined. The CAVS analysis uses a value of 0.01. 
Dval [s] 
Dtotal,val [s] 
Duration needed for executing an independent instance of crossvalidation of the ADS-B and TCAS distance measurements. In particular, this validation duration aims at taking due account of GNSS position measurement de-correlation effects. It is noted that 
"Dval' can be also linked to the "cross-check rate" introduced in 
DO-300A / ED-221 ("Hybrid Surveillance Interval Between 
Revalidation"). 
 
The CAVS analysis uses a value of 60 seconds for Dval. 
 
For Dtotal,val, the CAVS analysis uses a value of 600 seconds. 
TCAS Parameters 
μmeas [m] 
38.1 m in line with the TCAS II MOPS DO-185B / ED-143. By definition, this is a one-dimensional error. 
σmeas [m] 
15.2 m in line with TCAS II MOPS DO-185B / ED-143. By definition, this is a one-dimensional Gaussian error. 
SactTCAS [NM] 
The TCAS cross-check surveillance range 'SactTCAS' is selected so 
that there is a very high likelihood that an active TCAS track will have been established. Respective statistical analysis in very high density TMA environments, taking into account potential worst case transponder power output and TCAS receiver sensitivity characteristics, determined that there would be a high likelihood of active TCAS tracks being established within a 5 NM to 7 NM range The CAVS analysis therefore uses a defining value of 5 NM. 
Latency Modeling (per both Ownship & Target Aircraft) 
Uncompensated Latency 
[s] 
The amount of uncompensated latency, specified as a Gaussian distribution by a mean value and a standard deviation. The below modeling is based on the respective ASA MOPS DO-317A / ED-
194 "not to exceed" uncompensated latency requirements, i.e. 0.6 seconds for ownship and 0.6 seconds (ADS-B Out version 2) or 1.5 
seconds (ADS-B Out version 0/1) for target traffic, plus some possible additional ASSAP / display processing uncompensated latency. 
For ownship, the CAVS analysis therefore uses values of μ=0.2s 
and of σ=0.2s; for the target aircraft of μ=0.5s and of σ=0.2s. For the latter, the mean value of μ=0.5s recognizes that most version 0/1 ADS-B Out systems comply with the version 2 requirement. 
Compensated Latency [s] 
The amount of compensated latency, specified as a Gaussian distribution by a mean value and a standard deviation. The below modeling is based on the respective ASA MOPS DO-317A / ED-
194 "not to exceed" total latency requirements, i.e. 3.5 seconds for ownship and 5.5 seconds for target traffic. 
 
For ownship, the CAVS analysis therefore uses values of μ=2.0s 
and of σ=0.5s; for the target aircraft of μ=4.0s and of σ=0.5s. 
TCAS / GPS Antenna 
offset [m] 
The difference between the location of the TCAS and GPS antenna of the aircraft on which the ADS-B / TCAS surveillance validation is performed. The CAVS analysis uses a value of 10m.
