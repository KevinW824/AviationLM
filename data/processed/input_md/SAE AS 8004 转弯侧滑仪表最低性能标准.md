3.7
Visibility: Turn and slip indications must be visible from any point within the frustum of a cone the side of 
which makes an angle of at least 30 degrees with the perpendicular to the dial and the small diameter of which is the aperture of the instrument case.
    
3.8
Power Malfunction Indication: For Types II and III instruments, means must be incorporated in the 
instrument to indicate the loss of adequate power to the rate-of-turn gyro and primary signal voltages to the pointer in remote instruments. The indicating means must indicate a failure or malfunction in a positive manner. 3.9
Reflectance, Cover Glass: The total reflectance of the instrument cover glass including the integral 
lighting wedge, if applicable, shall not exceed 10% of the incident light. This reflectance applies over the visible light spectrum from 450 milli-microns to 600 milli-microns, and over an incident solid angle of 60º perpendicular to the viewing plane. 4.
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS UNDER STANDARD CONDITIONS
The test conditions applicable to a determination of the performance of turn and slip instruments are set forth in Appendix A of this standard. All instruments shall be tested in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations. The manufacturer shall conduct sufficient tests to prove compliance with these Minimum Performance Standards. 4.1
Turn Indicator Starting: Instrument performance must be achieved within three (3) minutes after 
normal rated power is applied for both air and electric operated instruments. By application of 50% of rated suction of air operated indicators and 80% of rated voltage for electrically operated indicators, the gyro must start, continue to rotate, and provide an adequate indication of turning motions. However, under the reduced power conditions, the turn indicator sensitivity and damping requirements do not apply. If the instrument incorporates a gyro speed monitoring device which provides a positive indication when the gyro speed is below that necessary to meet instrument performance, the starting time may exceed three minutes. 4.2
Turn Indicator Characteristics:
    
(a)
Sensitivity When the instrument is operating under rated power and subjected to the turning rates 
specified about the vertical axis, the turn instrument deflection, in inches or millimetres, must be within the limits of either Column A or B. The indicator movement must be smooth.

Column A values pertain to instruments set to indicate a standard rate of turn (180º per minute) with one indicator unit deflection. Column B provides double this displacement for indicators providing increased sensitivity.
    
For instruments possessing display features such that the dimensional characteristics prescribed by Columns A and B do not apply, the applicant may demonstrate that the indicator can reliably indicate the prescribed rates of turn with clarity and accuracy equivalent to that specified in Column A or B.
(b)
Damping  The time for the turn indicator or index to return to the zero mark without crossing the 
zero mark must be at least two but not more than four seconds, when the instrument is suddenly stopped after being rotated about its vertical axis at a rate that causes full-scale pointer or index 
deflection. 4.3
Slip Indicator Characteristics: The slip indicator must operate freely when the instrument is rotated 
about its longitudinal axis with the dial vertical. The range of slip indicators must be at least 7 degrees either side of vertical. With the instrument in its normal position for mounting, the position of the indicator must be zero (0) ± 1/32 inch (0 ± 0.8 mm).
    
 (a)
Damping. The time for the slip indicator to move from the zero position of the slip indication to the 
test position must not be less than 0.2 seconds following a sudden rotation of the instrument from a position of 12 degrees bank through the vertical to 12 degrees of opposite bank.
    
(b)
Slip Indicator Filling. Instruments using a liquid as a damping medium for the slip indicator must be 
so designed and filled that no part of an air bubble will be visible from a point 12 inches (30.5 cm) directly in front of the instrument when the instrument is rotated to an angle of roll of 45 degrees. 5.
