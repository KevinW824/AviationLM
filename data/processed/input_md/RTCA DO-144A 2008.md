## Foreword

 These Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) were prepared by RTCA Special Committee 209 (SC-209) and approved by the RTCA Program Management Committee (PMC) on October 2, 2008.  This document represents the consolidated performance requirements from two sources; RTCA/DO-144, "Minimum Operational Characteristics for Airborne ATC Transponder Systems," dated March 12, 1970, plus Change 1 to DO-144, posted as RTCA Paper No. 232-70/EC-643, dated November 5, 1970, and the performance standards referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Technical Standard Order (TSO) -C74c, dated February 20, 1973. RTCA, Incorporated is a not-for-profit corporation formed to advance the art and science of aviation and aviation electronic systems for the benefit of the public.  The organization functions as a Federal Advisory Committee and develops consensus-based recommendations on contemporary aviation issues. RTCA's objectives include, but are not limited to: 

 
Coalescing aviation system user and provider technical requirements in a manner that helps government and industry meet their mutual objectives and responsibilities; 
 
 
Analyzing and recommending solutions to the system technical issues that aviation faces as it continues to pursue increased safety, system capacity and efficiency; 
 
 
Developing consensus on the application of pertinent technology to fulfill user and provider requirements, including development of Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for electronic systems and equipment that support aviation; and 
 
 
Assisting in developing the appropriate technical material upon which positions for the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and other appropriate international organizations can be based. 
 The recommendations of RTCA are often used as the basis for government and private sector decisions as well as the foundation for new FAA Technical Standard Orders. Since RTCA is not an official agency of the United States Government, its recommendations may not be regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the United States Government organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations relate.

## 1 Purpose And Scope 1.1 Introduction

This document sets forth Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) airborne equipment.  Incorporated within these standards are system characteristics that will be useful to users of the system as well as designers, manufacturers and installers.  These performance standards represent a consolidation of performance requirements from two sources; RTCA/DO- 144, "*Minimum Operational Characteristics for Airborne ATC Transponder Systems,"* dated March 12, 1970, plus Change 1 to DO-144, posted as RTCA Paper No. 232-70/EC- 643, dated November 5, 1970, and the performance standards referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Technical Standard Order (TSO)-C74c, dated February 20, 1973. Compliance with these MOPS is required to achieve at least that minimum performance, on which control and separation of aircraft is based, and to insure against derogation of service to other users of aviation navigation and communication services.  These MOPS are applicable to all users of airborne ATC transponder systems who are required by regulation to participate in the ATC system, or who voluntarily choose to do so.   

Note: The use of "**shall**" in the body of this document indicates a requirement.  The 
use of "**should**" indicates a characteristic that is highly recommended, but is not 
required. 
It is recognized that any regulatory application of these standards is the responsibility of appropriate government agencies. Because the measured values of equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the measurement method, standard test conditions and methods of test are recommended in this document. This document considers an equipment configuration consisting of:  transponder, control panel, antenna and interconnecting cables.  It should not be inferred that all ATCRBS airborne equipment will necessarily include all of the foregoing components as separate units; this will depend on the design configuration chosen by the manufacturer. If the equipment implementation includes a computer software package, the guidelines contained in the most current issue of RTCA/DO-178, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, should be considered.   

## 1.1.1 International Standards

The performance standards of this document also reflect current International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 10, Volume IV, Amendment 82, Chapter 3 requirements for airborne systems having only Mode A and Mode C capabilities. 

## 1.1.2 Preparation Of Minimum Operational Performance Standards For Airborne Systems

The Federal Aviation Administration is the responsible agency for certain aviation standards.  However, FAA's regulatory effort is vastly improved by intelligent utilization of government/industry working arrangements, by which a variety and wealth of talent may be brought to bear on the development of a particular minimum requirement. Therefore, to implement the concepts that have been outlined, RTCA established Special Committee 209 to update the Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Airborne Transponder System Elements (both ATCRBS and Mode S), together with a method of demonstration of compliance.  However, as pointed out in these concepts, concise statements of system characteristics are a prerequisite to meaningful minimum operational characteristics for airborne systems.  Accordingly, RTCA SC-209 was directed to consider such system characteristics that exist and to include them in its reports.  If none exist, best assumptions were to be formulated by RTCA SC-209 and included in the reports. 

## 1.2 The Atcrbs Secondary Surveillance Radar (Ssr) Environment

Although the trend towards equipage of ATCRBS/Mode Select (S) capable transponders is increasing, a large number of aircraft are still equipped with ATCRBS-only capable transponders.  Since Mode S transponders are required on aircraft with TCAS, Mode S transponders are installed on a large segment of the aircraft population.  However, General Aviation aircraft continue to represent the largest percentage of the aircraft in the airspace and ATCRBS transponders are still the dominant equipage for these aircraft. The primary purpose of the ATCRBS transponder is to support ATC secondary surveillance radar (SSR) requirements. The ATCRBS SSR environment consists of the airborne ATCRBS transponders, ground interrogator-receiver, processing equipment, and an antenna system.  The antenna may or may not be associated with, or slaved to, a primary surveillance radar.  In operation, an interrogation pulse-pair transmitted from the interrogator-transmitter unit, via an antenna assembly, triggers each airborne transponder located in the direction of the main beam, causing a multiple pulse reply group to be transmitted from each transponder.  These replies are received by the ground receiver and, after processing, are displayed to the controller.  Measurement of the round-trip transit time determines the range (rho) to the replying aircraft while the mean direction of the main beam of the interrogator antenna, during the reply, determines the azimuth (theta).  Based on the time spacing of the interrogation pulse-pair transmitted, the airborne transponder provides a multiple-pulse reply that represents either an individualized identity code (Mode A reply) or the aircraft's current pressure altitude 
(Mode C reply). The ATCRBS transponder also replies to airborne Mode A and Mode C interrogators, thereby making its presence known to aircraft that are equipped with Traffic Advisory and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) or Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS). Additional information on ground and airborne interrogator characteristics is contained in §2.1.10. 

## 1.3 Assumptions

This document defines the basic surveillance and link characteristics of ATCRBS transponders.  Adherence to the requirements of this document will meet the needs of the airspace for surveillance of aircraft so equipped.  There is no upgrade path for the ATCRBS system going forward as surveillance needs of the future may rely on different technologies. 

## 1.4 Equipage Classes

Class A equipment is intended for installation in aircraft which operate at altitudes above 15,000 feet.  Additional information on Class A equipment is contained in §2.2.3.2.1. Class B equipment is intended for installation in aircraft which operate at altitudes not exceeding 15,000 feet.  Additional information on Class B equipment is contained in §2.2.3.2.2.   

## 1.5 Test Procedures

The specified test procedures and associated limits are intended as one means of demonstrating compliance with the minimum acceptable performance parameters. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the test organization.  These alternate methods may be used if they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. The order of tests suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of different tests as it moves from design and design qualification into operational use.  For example, the equipment should have demonstrated compliance with the requirements of Section §2.0 as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section §3.0. Three types of test procedures are included which should be used at different stages in the equipment approval cycle. These are discussed in the following paragraphs. 

## 1.5.1 Environmental Tests

Environmental tests are specified in Subsection §2.3.  The procedures and their associated limit requirements are intended to provide a means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations.  Equipment manufacturers may use test results as design guidance in preparation of installation instructions and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture.

## 1.5.2 Detailed Test Procedures

Detailed test procedures are specified in Subsection §2.4.  These tests are conducted at the equipment level and are intended to provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Subsections §2.1 and §2.2. Equipment manufacturers may use test results as design guidance, for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture. 

## 1.5.3 Installed System Tests

The installed system test procedures and their associated requirements are specified in Section §3.0.  Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included in the installed system tests, their successful completion is a precondition to completion of the installed tests.  In certain instances, however, installed system tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from or to other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc.  Installed tests are normally performed under two conditions:   

a. with the aircraft on the ground and using simulated or operational system inputs, 
and/or 
b. with the aircraft in flight using operational system signals appropriate to the 
equipment under test. 
Test results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the intended operational environment. 

In addition, the ground test procedures may be used as an optional check of equipment performance following corrective maintenance. 

## 1.6 Definition Of Terms

ATCRBS - Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System. Desensitization - Temporary reduction of transponder sensitivity after receipt of a signal. This helps to reduce echo (multipath) effects. Interrogation - A ground or airborne signal propagated toward an ATCRBS transponder to elicit a Mode A or Mode C response. Mode A Interrogation - A signal to elicit an ATCRBS transponder reply for identity (4096 code) and surveillance. Mode C Interrogation - A signal to elicit an ATCRBS transponder reply for automatic pressure-altitude transmission and surveillance Multipath - The propagation phenomenon that results in signals reaching the receiving antenna by two or more paths, generally with a time or phase difference between the two. 

National Airspace System (NAS) - The common system of facilities, equipment, regulations, procedures and personnel providing services and standard procedures for the safe and efficient movement of civil and military aircraft within the jurisdiction of the United States. 

PAM - Pulse Amplitude Modulation. The modulation technique utilized in both the interrogation and reply signals. Reply - A signal propagated from the transponder. Side Lobe Suppression (SLS) Transmission - A transmission intended to prevent responses from transponders not in the main beam of the interrogating antenna. Special Position Identification (SPI) - A special pulse used in ATCRBS located 4.35 microseconds following the last framing pulse. When used in Mode S, SPI appears as a code in the flight status (FS) field and in the surveillance status subfield (SSS).

## 2 Atcrbs Transponder Equipment Performance Requirements And Test Procedures 2.1 General Requirements 2.1.1 Airworthiness

In the design and manufacture of the equipment, the manufacturer **shall** provide for installation so as not to impair the airworthiness of the aircraft. 

## 2.1.2 General Performance

The equipment **shall** perform its intended function(s), as defined by the manufacturer, and its proper use **shall not** create a hazard to other users of the National Airspace System. 

## 2.1.3 Federal Communications Commission Rules

All equipment **shall** comply with the applicable rules of the Federal Communication Commission. 

## 2.1.4 Fire Protection

All materials used **shall** be self-extinguishing except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire. 

Note: One means of showing compliance is contained in Federal Aviation Regulations 
(FAR), Part 25, Appendix F. 

## 2.1.5 Operation Of Controls

The equipment **shall** be designed so that controls intended for use during flight cannot be operated in any position, combination or sequence that would result in a condition detrimental to the reliability of the equipment or operation of the aircraft.  In addition, the operation of controls, intended for use during flight, should be designed and evaluated to ensure that they are logical and tolerant to human error. In particular, where transponder functions are integrated with other system controls (e.g., ADS-B, etc.), the equipment manufacturer should ensure that unintentional transponder mode switching (i.e., an operational state to "STANDBY" or "OFF") is minimized.   

## 2.1.6 Accessibility Of Controls

Controls that do not require adjustment during flight **shall not** be readily accessible to flight personnel.   

## 2.1.7 Flight Crew Control Functions

The following functions **shall** be provided. 

a. Means of selecting each of the ATCRBS 4096 (Mode A) reply codes, and of 
indicating the code selected. 
b. Means of selecting the condition in which all transponder functions, other than 
transmission on the reply frequency and associated self-testing, are operational (i.e., 
the Standby condition).  Return to normal operation from this condition **shall** be 
possible within five seconds 
c. Means of selecting ATCRBS Mode A and Mode C combined. d. Means of initiating the IDENT (SPI) feature. 
e. Means of inhibiting the transmission of the altitude information, while retaining the 
ATCRBS framing pulses in ATCRBS Mode C replies.  

## 2.1.8 Optional Functions/Interfaces

With the movement toward an Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) environment, there are various functions/outputs from the ATCRBS transponder that are in common with ADS-B parameter requirements.  For example, the "squawk" or 4096 code, pressure altitude, and an IDENT capability are features used by both ADS-B and ATCRBS in supporting ATC surveillance needs.  Equipment manufacturers should consider the development of an output interface to support these and other ADS-B broadcast requirements (e.g., Flight ID) in their future transponder designs. 

## 2.1.9 Effects Of Test

The equipment **shall** be designed so that the application of specified test procedures shall not be detrimental to equipment performance following the application of the tests, except as specifically allowed.   

## 2.1.10 Interrogation Characteristics

The following subsections describe the signal in space as it can be expected to appear at the transponder's antenna.  Because signals can be corrupted in transmission, tolerances for interrogator performance are more restrictive and should not be derived from this document.  The modulation technique utilized in the interrogation signal is known as pulse amplitude modulation (PAM).   

## 2.1.10.1 Interrogation Carrier Frequency

The carrier frequency of received interrogations is: 

a. 1030 ±0.20 MHz from ATCRBS interrogators. b. 1030 ±0.01 MHz from Mode S interrogators. 

## 2.1.10.2 Measurement Convention

The following definitions are in reference to Figure 2-1. Pulse Amplitude - the peak voltage amplitude (A) of the pulse envelope. 

Pulse Rise Time - the time between 0.1A and 0.9A on the leading edge of the pulse envelope. Pulse Decay Time - the time between 0.9A and 0.1A on the trailing edge of the pulse envelope. Pulse Duration - the time interval between 0.5A points on leading and trailing edges of the pulse envelope. Pulse Interval - the time interval between the 0.5A point on the leading edge of the first pulse and the 0.5A point on the leading edge of the second pulse. 


## Figure 2-1: Pulse Envelope Conventions 2.1.10.3 Received Pam Signals

The following signals are valid PAM interrogations: 

 
ATCRBS Mode A (to elicit transponder replies for identity and surveillance) 
 
ATCRBS Mode C (to elicit transponder replies for automatic pressure-altitude 
transmission and surveillance) 
 
ATCRBS Mode A/C/S All-Call (to elicit replies for surveillance of Mode A/C 
transponders and for the acquisition of Mode S transponders) 
 
ATCRBS Mode A/C-Only All-Call (to elicit replies for surveillance of Mode A/C 
transponders.  Mode S transponders do not reply) 
 All of these interrogations use two or more of the four pulses shown in §2.1.10.3.2.  The pulses are labeled P1, P2, P3 and P4.  

## 2.1.10.3.1 Pulse Shapes

The pulse shapes for PAM interrogations are summarized in Table 2-1 (all values are in microseconds).

## 2.1.10.3.3 Relative Pulse Amplitudes

P2 amplitudes will vary from P1. P3 amplitudes are P1 ±1 dB. 

 

## 2.1.10.4 Suppression

This characteristic is used to prevent replies to interrogations received via the side lobes of the interrogator antenna, and to prevent Mode A/C transponders from replying to Mode S interrogations.  Suppression is in effect when the received amplitude of P2 is equal to or in excess of the received amplitude of P1 and spaced 2 
±0.15 microseconds (see §2.2.5.3).   

## 2.2 Equipment Performance - Standard Conditions 2.2.1 Definition Of Standard Conditions

The signal levels specified in this subsection exist at the antenna end of a transponder-toantenna transmission line of loss equal to the maximum for which the transponder is designed. 

Note:  The transponder will usually be installed with less than the designed maximum 
transmission line loss.  Nevertheless, the standard conditions of this document are based on the maximum design value. 

## 2.2.2 Receiver Characteristics 2.2.2.1 Interrogation Tolerances

Paragraph §2.1.10 and its subparagraphs define tolerances allowed from the nominal interrogation values.  The transponder **shall** be tolerant to all such deviations within the ranges specified in paragraph §2.1.10.   

## 2.2.2.2 Transponder Receiver Operating Frequency And Bandwidth

a. The receiver nominal center frequency **shall** be 1030 MHz. 
b. With an input signal level 3 dB above the minimum triggering level, the receiver 
bandwidth **shall** be such that the receiver accepts pulses as outlined in §2.1.10 with 
an interrogation center frequency drift of ± 0.2 MHz. 
c. The skirt bandwidth **shall** be such that the sensitivity of the receiver is at least 60 dB 
down at ±25 MHz and beyond. 

## 2.2.2.3 Receiver Sensitivity And Dynamic Range Given An Interrogation That Requires A Reply, The Minimum Triggering Level (Mtl) Is Defined As The Minimum Input Power Level That Results In A 90 Percent Reply Ratio If The Interrogation Signal Has All Nominal Pulse Spacings And Widths And If The Replies Are The Correct Replies Assigned To The Interrogation Format.

a. The minimum triggering level (MTL) of the transponder **shall** be such that replies 
are generated to 90 percent of the interrogation signals when: (1) 
The two pulses P1 and P3 constituting an interrogation are of equal amplitude and P2 is not detected; and  
(2) 
The amplitude of these signals received at the antenna end of the transmission line of the transponder is nominally 71 dB below 1 milliwatt with limits between 69 and 77 dB below 1 milliwatt.   
Note: For this MTL requirement, a nominal 3 dB transmission line loss and an antenna performance equivalent to that of a simple quarter wave antenna are assumed.  In the event these assumed conditions do not apply, the MTL of the installed transponder system must be comparable to that of the assumed system. 

b. The variation of the minimum triggering level between modes shall not exceed 1 dB 
for nominal pulse spacings and pulse widths. 
c. The reply characteristics **shall** apply over a received signal amplitude range between 
minimum triggering level and -21 dBm. 
d. The reply ratio **shall** not be more than 10 percent for interrogations at signal levels 
below -81 dBm. 
e. The conditions of "a" through "d" apply when a P4 pulse is present, either long or 
short, regardless of amplitude of the P4 pulse. 

## 2.2.3 Transmitter Characteristics 2.2.3.1 Reply Transmission Frequency

The center frequency of the reply transmission **shall** be 1090 ±3 MHz. 

## 2.2.3.2 Transponder Class And Power Output 2.2.3.2.1 Class A Equipment

For this class of equipment, the peak pulse power available at the antenna end of the transmission line of the transponder **shall** be at least 21 dB and not more than 27 dB 
above 1 watt at any reply rate up to 1,200 per second for a 15-pulse coded reply. 

## 2.2.3.2.2 Class B Equipment

For this class of equipment, the peak pulse power-available at the antenna end of the transmission line of the transponder **shall** be at least 18.5 dB and not more than 27 dB 
above 1 watt at any reply rate up to 1,000 per second for a 15-pulse coded reply. 

Note: For the power output requirement specified in §2.2.3.2.1 and §2.2.3.2.2, a 

nominal 3 dB transmission line loss and an antenna performance equivalent to that of a simple quarter-wave antenna are assumed.  In the event these assumed conditions do not apply, the peak pulse power of the installed transponder system must be comparable to that of the assumed system.   

## 2.2.3.3 Unwanted Output Power

When the transponder transmitter is in the inactive state, the RF output power at 1090 ±3 
MHz at the terminals of the antenna shall not exceed -50 dBm.  The inactive state is defined to include the entire period between ATCRBS transmissions less 10- microsecond transition periods, if necessary, preceding and following the extremes of the transmission. 

## 2.2.3.4 Reply Rate Capability

a. For Class A equipment (see §1.4), the transponder **shall** be capable of at least 1,200 
replies per second for a 15-pulse coded reply.   
b. For Class B equipment (see §1.4),  the transponder **shall** be capable of at least 1,000 
replies per second for a 15-pulse coded reply.   

## 2.2.3.5 Sensitivity Reduction Reply Rate Control

A sensitivity-reduction reply rate limit **shall** be incorporated in the transponder for ATCRBS replies.  The limit **shall** be capable of being adjusted between 500 continuous ATCRBS Mode A and Mode C replies per second and the maximum continuous rate of which the transponder is capable, or 2000 replies per second, whichever is less, without regard to the number of pulses in each reply.   

Note: The reply rate limit control should be set at 1,200 replies per second, or the 
maximum value below 1,200 replies per second of which the transponder is capable. (See §2.2.3.4).   
 

## 2.2.4 Reply Pulse Characteristics (Signals In Space)

The following subsections describe the reply pulse characteristics.  The general format of the reply pulse is shown in Figure 2-3. 

 

## 2.2.4.1 Framing Pulses

The reply function **shall** employ a signal comprising two framing pulses spaced 20.3 
microseconds, as the most elementary code.  

## 2.2.4.2 Information Pulses

Information pulses **shall** be spaced in increments of 1.45 microseconds from the first framing pulse.  The designation and position of these information pulses **shall** be as shown in Table 2-3.

## 2.2.4.3 Special Position Identification (Spi) Pulses

In addition to the information pulses provided, a Special Position Identification (SPI) 
Pulse, which may be transmitted with the information pulses, **shall** occur at a pulse interval of 4.35 microseconds following the last framing pulse.   
The SPI pulse **shall** be initiated by an IDENT switch (see §2.1.7.d).  Upon activation of the IDENT switch, the SPI pulse **shall** be transmitted for a period of between 15 and 30 seconds and must be capable of being reinitiated at any time.  The SPI pulse shall not be included when transmitting Mode C replies.   

## 2.2.4.4 Reply Pulse Shape

All reply pulses **shall** have a pulse duration of 0.45 ±0.10 microsecond, a pulse rise time between 0.05 and 0.1 microsecond, and a pulse decay time between 0.05 and 0.2 microsecond.  The pulse amplitude variation of one pulse with respect to any other pulse in a reply group **shall not** exceed 1 dB.  (See §2.1.10.2) 
Note: The intent of the lower limit of rise and decay times (0.05 microseconds) is to reduce sideband radiation.  Equipment will meet this requirement if the sideband radiation is no greater than that which theoretically would be produced by a trapezoidal wave having 0.05 microsecond rise and decay times and a 0.35 microsecond pulse duration.   

## 2.2.4.5 Reply Pulse Spacing Tolerances

The pulse interval tolerance for each pulse (including the last framing pulse) with respect to the first framing pulse of the reply group **shall** be ±0.10 microsecond.  The pulse interval tolerance of the Special Position Identification Pulse with respect to the last framing pulse of the reply group **shall** be ±0.10 microseconds.  The pulse interval tolerance of any pulse in the reply group with respect to any other pulse (except the first framing pulse) **shall** not exceed ±0.15 microseconds.   
 

## 2.2.4.6 Reply Delay And Jitter

The time delay between the arrival at the transponder of the leading edge of P3, and the transmission of the leading edge of the first pulse of the reply **shall** be 3 ±0.5 
microseconds.  The total jitter of the reply pulse code group with respect to P3 **shall not** 
exceed ±0.1 microseconds.  Delay variations between modes on which the transponder is capable of replying **shall not** exceed 0.2 microseconds.  These requirements apply for receiver input levels between 3 and 50 dB above minimum triggering level.   

## 2.2.5 Decoding Performance

Unless otherwise specified, the following pulse decoder characteristics **shall** apply over the RF input signal level range from MTL +3 dB to MTL +50 dB and interrogation signal characteristics per §2.1.10.3.   

## 2.2.5.1 Pulse Level Tolerances

When selected to reply to a particular interrogation mode (See §2.1.10.3.2), the transponder **shall** reply (not less than 90 percent efficiency) under each of the following conditions: 

a. The received amplitude of P3 is in excess of a level 1 dB below the received 
amplitude of P1 but no greater than 3 dB above the received amplitude of P1.  
b. The received amplitude of a proper interrogation is more than 10 dB above the 
received amplitude of random pulses where the latter are not recognized by the 
transponder as P1, P2, or P3.   
c. The conditions of "a" and "b," apply when a P4 pulse is present, either long or short, 
regardless of amplitude of the P4 pulse. 

## 2.2.5.2 Pulse Position Tolerances

The transponder **shall** accept interrogations as valid if the spacing between P1 and P3 is within plus or minus 0.20 microseconds of the nominal spacing. 

The transponder shall not reply to more than 10 percent of the interrogations under each of the following conditions:    

a. To interrogations when the interval between pulses P1 and P3 differs from that 
defined in §2.1.10.3.2 for the mode selected in the transponder by more than ±1 microsecond.   
b. Upon receipt of any single pulse which has no amplitude variations approximating a 
normal interrogation condition.   

## 2.2.5.3 Suppression

Upon receipt of an interrogation complying with the interrogation modes defined in 
§2.1.10.3, selected manually or automatically, the transponder **shall** be suppressed (not less than 99 percent efficiency) when the received amplitude of P2 is equal to or in excess of the received amplitude of P1 and spaced 2 ±0.15 microseconds.   

## Notes:

1. It is not the intent of this paragraph to require the detection of P3 as a prerequisite 
for initiation of suppression action. 
2. After reception of a valid P3 pulse the transponder should not initiate suppression 
based on the reception of a P4 pulse. 
a. The transponder suppression **shall** be for a period of 35 ±10 microseconds. b. The suppression **shall** be capable of being reinitiated for the full duration within two 
microseconds after the end of any suppression period. 
c. The transponder **shall not** initiate suppression if the level of P1 exceeds the level of 
P2 by 9 dB or more. 
d. The transponder **shall not** initiate suppression if no pulse is received at the position 
2.0 ±0.7 microseconds following P1. 
e. The transponder **shall not** initiate suppression if the duration of P2 is less than 0.3 
microseconds. 

## 2.2.5.4 Pulse Duration Discrimination

a. For all signal levels from MTL to -45 dBm, the transponder **shall** reply to no more 
than 10 percent of ATCRBS, ATCRBS-Only All-Call or ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations if the duration of either the P1 or the P3 pulse is less than 0.3 microseconds.   
b. With the exception of single pulses with amplitude variations approximating an 
interrogation, any single pulse of duration more than 1.5 microseconds shall not 
cause the transponder to initiate reply or suppression action over the signal amplitude range of minimum triggering level to 50 dB above minimum triggering level.   

## 2.2.5.5 Compatibility With Tcas Atcrbs Surveillance

With P1 at MTL and S1 at MTL -6 dB, the transponder **shall** reply to ATCRBS 
interrogations at least 90 % of the time. 

With P1 at MTL and S1 at MTL -3 dB, the transponder **shall** reply to ATCRBS 
interrogations at least 70 % of the time. 

With P1 at MTL and S1 at MTL, the transponder **shall** reply to no more than 10% of ATCRBS interrogations.   
Note: S1 is equal to P1 in duration with the leading edge of S1 being 2.0 microseconds ahead of the leading edge of P1.  Amplitude of S1 is varied relative to P1 as indicated above. 

## 2.2.6 Desensitization And Recovery Characteristics 2.2.6.1 Dead Time

After reception of a valid interrogation, the transponder shall not reply to any other interrogation at least for the duration of the reply pulse train.  This dead time **shall** end no later than 125 microseconds after the transmission of the last reply pulse of the group. 

## 2.2.6.2 Echo Suppression And Recovery

The transponder **shall** contain an echo suppression facility designed to permit normal operation in the presence of echoes of signals-in-space.  The provision of this facility shall be compatible with the requirements for suppression of side lobes given in §2.2.5.3.   

## 2.2.6.2.1 Desensitization

Upon receipt of any pulse more than 0.7 microseconds in duration, the receiver **shall** be desensitized by an amount that is within at least 9 dB of the amplitude of the desensitizing pulse, but **shall** at no time exceed the amplitude of the desensitizing pulse, with the exception of possible overshoot during the first microsecond following the desensitizing pulse.  Single pulses of duration less than 0.7 microseconds are not required to cause the specified desensitization, and **shall not** cause desensitization of duration greater than that permitted herein or by §2.2.6.2.2.   

## 2.2.6.2.2 Recovery

Following desensitization, the receiver **shall** recover sensitivity (within 3 dB of MTL) 
within 15 microseconds after reception of a desensitizing pulse having a signal strength up to 50 dB above MTL.  Recovery **shall** be nominally linear at an average rate not exceeding 4.0 dB per microsecond.   

## 2.2.7 Undesired Replies 2.2.7.1 Random Triggering And Suppression Rate

In the absence of valid interrogation signals, the random triggering rate (squitter) of the transponder **shall not** exceed 30 replies and/or suppressions per second as integrated over an interval equivalent to at least 300 random triggers, or 30 seconds, whichever is less.   

Note: When demonstrating compliance to these requirements, the equipment 
manufacturer should consider possible interference (triggering) caused by equipment typically found in the aircraft of intended installation (e.g., VHF communication, DME, Radio Altimeter, etc.), operating at their maximum interference levels. 

## 2.2.7.2 Random Triggering In The Presence Of Cw

The total random triggering on all Mode A and/or Mode C replies **shall not** exceed 10 
replies or suppressions per second, averaged over a period of 30 seconds, when operated in the presence of non-coherent CW interference at a frequency of 1030 ±0.2 MHz and a signal level of –60 dBm, or less. 

## 2.2.8 Transponder Self Test And Monitor 2.2.8.1 Manual Self-Test

a. When a manual self-test device is provided, it **shall** be limited to intermittent use by 
a spring-loaded return-to-off switch, or equivalent. 
b. The test interrogation rate shall not exceed 450 per second. c. The lowest RF level at the input to the antenna required to accomplish the test **shall** 
be used.  The maximum RF level at the input to the antenna **shall not** exceed 40 dB 
below 1 milliwatt. 

## 2.2.8.2 Automatic Self-Test

a. When an automatic self-test device is provided, it **shall** be limited to use only in the 
absence of a valid interrogation.  (A minimum period of 15 seconds will be sufficient to establish the absence of ground interrogations).  
b. The maximum test time for the automatic self-test **shall not** exceed 0.1 second in any 
given l5-second interval. 
c. The test interrogation rate **shall not** exceed 450 per second. d. The lowest RF level at the input to the antenna required to accomplish the test **shall** 
be used.  The maximum RF level at the input to the antenna **shall not** exceed 40 dB 
below 1 milliwatt. 

## 2.2.9 Response To Mutual Suppression Pulses

The equipment **shall** accept and respond to suppression pulses from other electronic equipment in the aircraft (to disable it while the other equipment is transmitting), the equipment **shall** regain normal sensitivity within 3 dB, not later than 15 microseconds after the end of the applied suppression pulse.   

## 2.2.10 Data Handling And Interfaces 2.2.10.1 Code Nomenclature

The code designations **shall** consist of four digits, each of which lies between 0 and 7 
inclusive, and is determined by the sum of the pulse subscripts given in Table 2-3, employed as shown in Table 2-4: 

| Digit    | Pulse Group    |
|----------|----------------|
| First    | A              |
| Second   | B              |
| Third    | C              |
| Fourth   | D              |

 Examples: 
Code 3615 would consist of information pulses A1, A2 (1 + 2 = 3), B2, B4 (2 + 4 = 6),  
C1 (1 = 1), D1, D4 (1 + 4 = 5).   
Code 3600 would consist of information pulses A1, A2, B2 and B4 Code 2057 would consist of information pulses A2, C1, C4, D1, D2 and D4 
Code 0301 would consist of information pulses B1, B2 and D1 
 

## 2.2.10.2 Identification

The 4096 codes specified in §2.2.10.1 **shall** be manually selectable for reply to interrogations on Mode A.   

## 2.2.10.3 Pressure Altitude Transmissions

a. Independently of the other modes and codes manually selected, the transponder **shall** 
automatically reply to Mode C interrogations. 
b. The reply to Mode C interrogations **shall** consist of the two framing pulses together 
with the information pulses specified in §2.2.4.2. 
c. The transponders **shall** be provided with means to remove the information pulses, 
but to retain the framing pulses when the provision of subparagraph "f" below is not complied with, in reply to Mode C interrogation. 
Note: The information pulses should be capable of being removed either in response to a failure detection system or manually at the request of the controlling agency. 

d. The information pulses **shall** be automatically selected by an analog-to-digital 
converter connected to a pressure-altitude data source in the aircraft referenced to the standard pressure setting of 29.92 inches of mercury.  
e. Pressure altitude **shall** be reported in 100-foot increments by selection of pulses as 
shown in the tables in Appendix A.  If the transponder is capable of accepting altitude sources with better than 100-foot resolution, the pressure altitudeinformation **shall** be reported in the closest 100-foot increment as specified in 
Appendix A.   
f. The digitizer code selected **shall** correspond to within ±125 feet, on a 95 percent 
probability basis with the pressure altitude information (referenced to the standard pressure setting of 29.92 inches of mercury) used on board the aircraft to adhere to the assigned flight profile. 

## 2.2.11 Antenna 2.2.11.1 Frequency

The antenna **shall** be designed to receive and transmit vertically polarized signals in the frequency range of 1030 to 1090 MHz. 

## 2.2.11.2 Impedance And Vswr

The VSWR produced by the antenna when terminated in a 50-ohm transmission line **shall** 
not exceed 1.5:1 over the 1030 to 1090 MHz frequency band. 

## 2.2.11.3 Polarization

The antenna **shall** be vertically polarized. 

## 2.2.11.4 Radiation Pattern

The transponder antenna system when installed on an aircraft **shall** have a radiation pattern that is essentially omni-directional in the horizontal plane and should have a vertical beam-width sufficient to provide system operation during normal maneuvers of the aircraft. 

## 2.2.12 Power Interruption

The transponder equipment **shall** regain operational capability to within its operational limits within two seconds after the restoration of power following a momentary power interruption. 

Note: The transponder equipment is not required to continue operation during 
momentary power interruptions. 
 

## 2.2.13 Diversity

Diversity transponders may be implemented for the purpose of improving surveillance performance.  Such systems **shall** employ two antennas, one mounted on the top and the other on the bottom of the aircraft.  Appropriate switching and signal processing channels to select the best antenna on the basis of the characteristics of the received interrogation signals **shall** also be provided.  Such diversity systems, in their installed configuration, shall not result in degraded performance relative to that which would have been produced by a single system having a bottom-mounted antenna.   

## 2.2.13.1 Diversity Antenna Selection And Selection Threshold

a. 
Diversity Antenna Selection 
Antenna selection **shall** be automatic.  The transponder **shall** select one of the two antennas on the basis of the relative strengths of the detected interrogation signals, provided that both channels simultaneously receive a valid identical interrogation or pulse pair.  Antenna selection and switching may occur after the receipt of the P3 pulse of a P1 - P3 pulse pair, indicating an ATCRBS or ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation. 

The selected antenna **shall** be used, if necessary, to transmit a reply. 

b. 
Selection Threshold 
The transponder **shall** nominally select the antenna connected to the RF port having the stronger signal.  To allow for unbalance in the characteristics of the two channels, a transition zone ±3 dB wide is permitted, in which either antenna may be selected. 

## 2.2.13.2 Received Signal Delay Tolerance

If an interrogation is received at either antenna 0.125 microsecond or less in advance of reception at the other antenna, the interrogations **shall** be considered simultaneous and the reply antenna selection criteria **shall** be applied.  If an interrogation is received at either antenna 0.375 microsecond or more in advance of reception at the other antenna, the antenna selected for the reply **shall** be the one which received the earlier interrogation.  If the relative time of receipt is between 0.125 and 0.375 microsecond, the transponder **shall** select the reply antenna based on either the simultaneous interrogation criteria or the earlier time of arrival. 

## 2.2.13.3 Diversity Transmission Channel Isolation

The peak RF power transmitted from the selected antenna **shall** exceed the power transmitted from the non-selected antenna by at least 20 dB. 

 

## 2.2.13.4 Reply Delay Of Diversity Transponders

The total difference in mean reply delay between the two antenna channels (including the transponder-to-antenna cables) **shall** not exceed 0.08 microsecond for interrogations of equal amplitude.  This requirement is applicable to interrogation signal strengths between MTL +3 dB and MTL +50 dB. 

Note: This requirement limits apparent jitter caused by diversity operation and by cable delay differences.  The jitter requirements on each individual channel remain as specified for non-diversity transponders.  Control of apparent jitter caused by antenna location is specified in §3.1.6. 

## 2.3 Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in this subsection provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under conditions representative of those that may be encountered in actual aeronautical operations. Some of the environmental tests contained in this subsection need not be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition.  These tests are identified by the phrase "When Required."  If the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional environmental conditions, then these "when required" tests **shall** be performed.   
The test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in the most recent version of the RTCA Document entitled "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment," which at the time of publication of these MOPS was in revision "F," and is herein after referenced in these MOPS as RTCA/DO-160(). Some of the performance requirements in §2.1 and §2.2 are not tested by the test procedures herein.  Moreover, not all tests are required to be performed at each of the environmental conditions in RTCA/DO-160().  Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in §2.1 and §2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these environmental conditions. Additional tests may have to be performed in order to determine performance of particular design requirements that are not specified in this document.  It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to determine appropriate tests for these functions. Specific transponder performance tests have been included in this section for use in conjunction with the environmental procedures of DO-160().  These tests have been judiciously chosen as a subset of the transponder performance tests of §2.4.  Normally, a MOPS document does not provide specific equipment performance tests to be used in conjunction with the environmental procedures of DO-160().  However, there is a sufficiently large number of transponder performance tests in §2.4 that it would be impractical to repeat all of those tests in conjunction with all of the appropriate environmental procedures.   

## 2.3.1 Environmental Test Conditions

Table 2-5 lists all of the environmental conditions and test procedures (hereafter referred to as environmental procedures) that are documented in DO-160().  Table 2-6 lists the subset of transponder performance tests from section §2.4 that are intended to be run subject to the various environmental procedures of DO-160().  In order to simplify the process of relating the environmental procedures to the transponder performance tests, Table 2-5 divides the environmental procedures into groups.  All of the procedures in a given group are carried out in conjunction with the same set of transponder performance tests.  Using this approach, the environmental procedures fall into six groups.  The 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
environmental procedures that apply to all of the sets of transponder performance tests fall into group 1.  Group 2 procedures apply to 8 of the sets of transponder performance tests.  Groups 3, 4, and 5 apply to 4, 3 and 3 of the sets of transponder performance tests, respectively.  (Group 6, which applies to none of the transponder performance tests, includes only environmental procedures that are intended to determine the effect of the transponder on rack mounting hardware, compass needles, explosive gasses, and other RF hardware.) Table 2-6 indicates which of the groups of environmental procedures is related to each set of transponder performance tests.  Each transponder performance test **shall** be validated under all of the environmental procedures in the groups required for that test as indicated in Table 2-6.

The transponder's acceptance of the tolerances specified in §2.1.10 is tested in various test procedures throughout §2.4.   

## 2.4.2.2 Verification Of Transponder Receiver Operating Frequency And Bandwidth (§2.2.2.2)

Purpose/Introduction: 

a. The receiver nominal center frequency **shall** be 1030 MHz. 
b. With an input signal level 3 dB above the minimum triggering level, the receiver 
bandwidth **shall** be such that the receiver accepts pulses as outlined in §2.1.10 with 
an interrogation center frequency drift of ± 0.2 MHz.   
c. The skirt bandwidth **shall** be such that the sensitivity of the receiver is at least 60 dB 
down at ±25 MHz and beyond.   
(1) 
Interrogate the transponder at 500 interrogations per second with a Mode A interrogation signal.  Vary the RF signal frequency over the range 1029.8 to 1030.2 MHz Determine the variation in RF signal level required to produce 90 percent transponder reply efficiency.  Also determine the required maximum RF signal level. 
(2) 
Interrogate the transponder at 500 interrogations per second with a Mode A interrogation signal.  Determine the interrogation signal level (MTL) which results in a transponder reply rate of 450.  Set the interrogation frequency to 1055 and 1005 MHz and verify that the transponder sensitivity is at least 60 dB below the MTL level measured at nominal frequency in both cases. 

## 2.4.2.3 Verification Of Receiver Sensitivity And Dynamic Range (§2.2.2.3) Purpose/Introduction:

a. The minimum triggering level (MTL) of the transponder **shall** be such that replies 
are generated to 90 percent of the interrogation signals when: 
(1) 
The two pulses P1 and P3 constituting an interrogation are of equal amplitude and P2 is not detected; and  
(2) 
The amplitude of these signals received at the antenna end of the transmission line of the transponder is nominally 71 dB below 1 milliwatt with limits between 69 and 77 dB below 1 milliwatt. 
Note: For this MTL requirement, a nominal 3 dB transmission line loss and an antenna performance equivalent to that of a simple quarter wave antenna are assumed.  In the event these assumed conditions do not apply, the MTL of the installed transponder system must be comparable to that of the assumed system. 

b. The variation of the minimum triggering level between modes shall not exceed 1 dB 
for nominal pulse spacings and pulse widths. 
c. The reply characteristics **shall** apply over a received signal amplitude range between 
minimum triggering level and 50 dB above minimum triggering level. 
d. The reply ratio **shall** not be more than 10 percent for interrogations at signal levels 
below -81 dBm. 
e. The conditions of "a" through "d" apply when a P4 pulse is present, either long or 
short, regardless of amplitude of the P4 pulse. 
(1) 
Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode A interrogation at a repetition 
rate of 500 interrogations per second.  Adjust P1 and P3 equal in amplitude (no 
P2 pulse) and apply a signal level known to be below minimum triggering level.  
Increase the signal generator output level until the transponder reply rate is 450 replies per second.  This is the transponder minimum triggering level (MTL). The installed system MTL (including transmission line loss) should be between 69 and 77 dB below 1 milliwatt. 
 

| EXAMPLE:    | Transponder MTL        | -74 dBm    |
|-------------|------------------------|------------|
|             | Transmission Line Loss | 3 dB       |
|             | System MTL             | -71 dBm    |
|             |                        |            |

(2) 
Repeat step (1) above using a standard Mode C interrogation.  The variation in MTL between steps (1) and (2) should not exceed 1 dB. 
(3) 
Repeat steps (1) and (2) above and include both a narrow and wide P4 pulse at the nominal position, equal in amplitude to P1 and P3. 
(4) 
Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode A interrogation at a repetition rate of 500 interrogations per second.  Adjust the RF signal level between MTL +3 dB and -21 dBm in 5 dB increments and determine the reply ratio.  Repeat 
with both a narrow and wide P4 pulse at the nominal position, equal in amplitude 
to P1 and P3.  
(5) 
Repeat step (4) with a Mode C interrogation. 
(6) 
Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode A interrogation at an RF level of -81 dBm.  Determine reply ratio and verify that the reply ratio is 10 percent or less.

a) a Mode C interrogation 20 dB above MTL at a continuous rate equal to the reply rate 
limit determined in Step 1, and 
b.) a second unsynchronized Mode A interrogation 3 dB above MTL at a continuous 
rate equal to 50% of the reply rate limit determined in Step 1.   
Verify that the transponder replies to at least 90% of the interrogations at the signal level 
20 dB above MTL and that it does not reply to more than 10% of the interrogations at the signal level 3 dB above MTL. 

## 2.4.4 Verification Of Reply Pulse Characteristics (Signals In Space) (§2.2.4)

The reply transmission characteristics can be determined with a demodulating probe and a wide band oscilloscope comparing the reply pulse group waveform against an accurate timing waveform such as from a crystal oscillator. 

## 2.4.4.1 Verification Of Framing Pulses (§2.2.4.1) Purpose/Introduction:

The reply function **shall** employ a signal comprising two framing pulses spaced 20.3 
microseconds, as the most elementary code. Measurement Procedures: With the transponder interrogated on Mode A and replying on Code 0000, the time interval between the 0.5 amplitude points on the leading edges of the two framing pulses should be within 20.3 ±0.10 microseconds. 

## 2.4.4.2 Verification Of Information Pulses (§2.2.4.2) Purpose/Introduction:

Information pulses **shall** be spaced in increments of 1.45 microseconds from the first framing pulse.  The designation and position of these information pulses **shall** be as shown in Table 2-3. 

Measurement Procedures: With the transponder replying on Code 7777, the time interval between the 0.5 amplitude points on the leading edge of each pulse, including the last framing pulse, with respect to the first framing pulse should be equal to that listed in §2.2.4.2 with a tolerance of ±0.1 microsecond.  Also, the time interval from any pulse, in the reply group, with respect to any other pulse, except the first framing pulse, should not exceed ±0.15 microsecond.   

## 2.4.4.3 Verification Of Special Position Identification (Spi) Pulse (§2.2.4.3) Purpose/Introduction:

In addition to the information pulses provided, a Special Position Identification (SPI) 
Pulse, which may be transmitted with the information pulses, **shall** occur at a pulse interval of 4.35 microseconds following the last framing pulse. 

The SPI pulse **shall** be initiated by an IDENT switch (see §2.1.7.d).  Upon activation of the IDENT switch, the SPI pulse **shall** be transmitted for a period of between 15 and 30 seconds and must be capable of being reinitiated at any time.  The SPI pulse shall not be included when transmitting Mode C replies. 

(1) 
With the transponder replying with the SPI pulse, the time interval between the 0.5 amplitude points on the leading edge of the second framing pulse and the SPI pulse should be 4.35 ±0.10 microseconds. 
(2) 
Interrogate the transponder with a Mode A interrogation signal.  With the transponder operating, manually initiate the SPI pulse and verify that the transmission time of the SPI pulse is between 15 and 30 seconds, and that it can be re-initiated immediately. 
(3) 
While interrogating the transponder with a Mode C interrogation, manually activate the SPI pulse and verify that there is no SPI pulse in the reply. 

## 2.4.4.4 Verification Of Reply Pulse Shape (§2.2.4.4) Purpose/Introduction:

All reply pulses **shall** have pulse duration of 0.45 ±0.10 microseconds, a pulse rise time between 0.05 and 0.1 microseconds, and a pulse decay time between 0.05 and 0.2 microseconds.  The pulse amplitude variation of one pulse with respect to any other pulse in a reply group **shall not** exceed 1 dB. 

With the transponder replying with Code 7777 and the SPI pulse activated, verify the following reply pulse characteristics: The duration of each reply pulse, as measured between the 0.5 amplitude points on the leading and trailing edge, should be between 0.35 and 0.55 microseconds. The rise time of each reply pulse, as measured between the 0.1 amplitude and 0.9 amplitude points on the leading edge should be between 0.05 and 0.10 microseconds. The decay time of each reply pulse, as measured between the 0.9 amplitude and 0.1 amplitude points on the trailing edge should be between 0.05 and 0.20 microseconds. The amplitude variation of anyone pulse as measured with respect to any other pulse in a reply group should not exceed 1 dB. 

Note: The fundamental requirements of sideband radiation can be met either as described above or by determining that the actual sideband radiation is no greater than that which theoretically would be produced by a trapezoidal wave having 0.05 microsecond rise and decay times and a 0.35 microsecond pulse duration. 

## 2.4.4.5 Verification Of Reply Pulse Interval Tolerances (§2.2.4.5) Purpose/Introduction:

The pulse interval tolerance for each pulse (including the last framing pulse) with respect to the first framing pulse of the reply group **shall** be ±0.10 microseconds.  The pulse interval tolerance of the Special Position Identification Pulse with respect to the last framing pulse of the reply group **shall** be ±0.10 microseconds.  The pulse interval tolerance of any pulse in the reply group with respect to any other pulse (except the first framing pulse) shall not exceed ±0.15 microseconds. 

These requirements are tested in test procedures §2.4.4.1, §2.4.4.2 and §2.4.4.3. 

## 2.4.4.6 Verification Of Reply Delay And Jitter (§2.2.4.6) Purpose/Introduction:

The time delay between the arrival at the transponder of the leading edge of P3, and the transmission of the leading edge of the first pulse of the reply **shall** be 3 ±0.5 
microseconds.  The total jitter of the reply pulse code group with respect to P3 **shall not** 
exceed ±0.1 microsecond.  Delay variations between modes on which the transponder is capable of replying **shall not** exceed 0.2 microseconds.  These requirements apply for receiver input levels between 3 and 50 dB above minimum triggering level. 

(1) 
Interrogate the transponder with a Mode A signal.  Measure the time interval 
between the 50% voltage point of the leading edge of P3 and the 50% voltage 
point of the leading edge of the first framing pulse at the antenna terminal.  Vary the interrogation RF level from 3 to 50 dB above MTL.  Verify that the delay is within the limits of 3 ±0.5 microseconds.  Verify that the jitter from the leading 
edge of P3 to the leading edge of the first framing pulse does not exceed ±0.1 
microsecond. 
(2) 
Repeat step (1) using a Mode A-Only All-Call interrogation. 
(3) 
Repeat steps (1) and (2) for Mode C interrogation types.  Verify that the delay variation between all modes does not exceed 0.2 microseconds. 

## 2.4.5 Verification Of Decoding Performance (§2.2.5) 2.4.5.1 Verification Of Pulse Level Tolerances (§2.2.5.1) Purpose/Introduction:

When selected to reply to a particular interrogation mode (See §2.1.10.3.2), the transponder **shall** reply (not less than 90 percent efficiency) under each of the following conditions: 

a. The received amplitude of P3 is in excess of a level 1 dB below the received 
amplitude of P1 but no greater than 3 dB above the received amplitude of P1.  
b. The received amplitude of a proper interrogation is more than 10 dB above the 
received amplitude of random pulses where the latter are not recognized by the 
transponder as P1, P2, or P3.  
c. The conditions of "a" and "b" apply when a P4 pulse is present, either long or short, 
regardless of amplitude of the P4 pulse. 
Measurement Procedures: Interrogate the transponder with a Mode A signal at a repetition rate of 500 interrogations per second and with a level 3 dB above the receiver minimum triggering level.   

(1) 
Using the nominal pulse interval between P1 and P3 for Mode A, vary the amplitude of P3 between 1 dB below and 3 dB above the amplitude of P1.  Note 
the lowest reply rate obtained.  Repeat this step for Mode C. 
(2) 
Repeat step (1) for P1 amplitudes of 10, 25, and 50 dB above the minimum 
triggering level. 
(3) 
Combine the interrogation signal with a non-synchronous 0.8 microsecond 
pulses at 5000 Hz and at an RF level 10 db below that of P1 and P3 and repeat step (1) above. 
The reply rates obtained in each case above should be at least 450 replies per second. 

## 2.4.5.2 Verification Of Pulse Position Tolerance (§2.2.5.2) Purpose/Introduction:

The transponder **shall** accept interrogations as valid if the spacing between P1 and P3 is within ±0.2 microsecond of the nominal spacing. 

The transponder shall not reply to more than 10 percent of the interrogations under each of the following conditions:   

a. To interrogations when the interval between pulses P1 and P3 differs from that 
defined in §2.1.10.3.2 for the mode selected in the transponder by more than ±1 
microsecond. 
b. receipt of any single pulse which has no amplitude variations approximating a 
normal interrogation condition. 
(1)  
Interrogate the transponder with interrogation pulse signals for Mode A and C, at a repetition rate of 500 interrogations per second and with a signal level 3 dB 
above the receiver minimum triggering level.  In the absence of P2 pulses, slowly 
adjust the interval between P1 and P3 from 7.8 microseconds to 8.2 
microseconds and from 20.8 microseconds to 21.2 microseconds, respectively, and note the reply rate in each case. 
(2)  
Adjust the interval between P1 and P3 to 7.0, 9.0, 20.0 and 22.0 microseconds, 
respectively.  Note the reply rate in each case.  The reply rate should be no more than 50 replies per second. 
(3)  
Repeat steps (1) and (2) for amplitudes of 10, 25, and 50 dB above the minimum triggering level. 
Note:  The requirement in §2.2.5.2.b is tested in test procedure §2.4.5.4, Step (2).   

## 2.4.5.3 Verification Of Suppression (§2.2.5.3) Purpose/Introduction:

Upon receipt of an interrogation complying with the interrogation modes defined in 
§2.1.10.3 selected manually or automatically, the transponder **shall** be suppressed (not less than 99% efficiency) when the received amplitude of P2 is equal to or in excess of the received amplitude of P1 and spaced 2 ±0.15 microseconds.   

## Notes:

1. It is not the intent of this paragraph to require the detection of P3 as a prerequisite 
for initiation of suppression action. 
2. After reception of a valid P3 pulse the transponder should not initiate suppression 
based on the reception of a P4 pulse. 
a. The transponder suppression **shall** be for a period of 35 ±10 microseconds. b. The suppression **shall** be capable of being reinitiated for the full duration within two 
microseconds after the end of any suppression period. 
c. The transponder **shall not** initiate suppression if the level of P1 exceeds the level of 
P2 by 9 dB or more. 
d. The transponder **shall not** initiate suppression if no pulse is received at the position 
2.0 ±0.7 microseconds following P1. 
e. The transponder **shall not** initiate suppression if the duration of P2 is less than 0.3 
microseconds. 
Interrogate the transponder with Mode A interrogation at a repetition rate of 500 interrogations per second and at a signal level of 3 dB above receiver MTL. 

(1) 
Adjust P2 equal in amplitude to P1 while varying spacing from 1.85 to 2.15 
microseconds and note the reply rate.  Repeat with P2 adjusted to 10 dB greater than P1 and note the reply rate.  Both rates should be no greater than 5 replies per 
second. 
(2) 
Increase the signal level of P1 and P3 20 dB, with P3 equal in amplitude to P1 
and with P2 set to an amplitude 9 dB below that of P1 and P3.  Vary the interval of P2 from 1.85 to 2.15 microseconds with respect to P1 and verify 90% or more 
reply rate.   
(3) 
With the signal level of P1 and P3 set as in step (2), set the level of P2 equal in amplitude to P1 and P3.  Set the spacing of P2 at 1.3 and 2.7 microseconds respectively with respect to P1 and verify 90% or more reply rate. 
(4) 
With the signal level of P1, P2 and P3 as in step (3), set the width of the P2 pulse to 0.3 microseconds.  With the P2 pulse in the nominal position, and verify 90% 
or more reply rate.   
(5) 
Disable P3 and readjust P2 equal in amplitude to P1 and at nominal spacing.  
Using a second signal source (set to at least 3 dB above the receiver MTL) with the interrogation rate synchronized with the first but delayed more than 50 microseconds, interrogate the transponder on Mode A.  Gradually shorten the delay until no replies are received from the second interrogation source.  Verify 
that the interval between P2 of the first signal source and P1 of the second signal 
source is between 25 and 45 microseconds.   
(6) 
Increase the delay time of the second interrogation source by 2 microseconds from that at which no replies were received in step (1) above.  There should be at 
least 450 replies per second from the second interrogation source.  Insert a P2 
into the second interrogation source equal in amplitude to P1.  Verify that the 
reply rate from the second interrogation source does not exceed 5 replies per second.   

## 2.4.5.4 Verification Of Pulse Duration Discrimination (§2.2.5.4)

Purpose/Introduction: 

a. For all signal levels from MTL to -45 dBm, the transponder **shall** reply to no more 
than 10 percent of ATCRBS, ATCRBS-Only All-Call or ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call 
interrogations if the duration of either the P1 or the P3 pulse is less than 0.3 microseconds.  . 
b. With the exception of single pulses with amplitude variations approximating an 
interrogation, any single pulse of duration more than 1.5 microseconds shall not 
cause the transponder to initiate reply or suppression action over the signal amplitude range of minimum triggering level to 50 dB above minimum triggering level. 
(1) 
Interrogate the transponder with Mode A interrogations at a repetition rate of 
500 interrogations per second.  Adjust P1 and P3 (no P2 pulse) to a width of 0.3 
microseconds and set the RF level to minimum triggering level.  The reply efficiency should not exceed 10%.  Repeat for signal levels between MTL and - 45 dBm in 5 dB steps. 
(2) 
Interrogate the transponder with a single input pulse at 1030 MHz.  Vary the pulse width of the interrogation signal from 1.5 to 22 microseconds at input signal levels of 3, 10, 25, and 50 dB above MTL.  At each input signal, verify that the transponder does not reply to, and/or is not suppressed by, the interrogation signal. 
Note:  Pulse duration discrimination for the P2 pulse is tested in §2.4.5.3 (4). 

## 2.4.5.5 Verification Of Compatibility With Tcas Atcrbs Surveillance (§2.2.5.5) Purpose/Introduction:

With P1 at MTL and S1 at MTL -6 dB, the transponder **shall** reply to ATCRBS 
interrogations at least 90 % of the time. 

With P1 at MTL and S1 at MTL -3 dB, the transponder **shall** reply to ATCRBS 
interrogations at least 70 % of the time. 

With P1 at MTL and S1 at MTL, the transponder **shall** reply to no more than 10% of ATCRBS interrogations. 

a. Interrogate the transponder with a Mode A interrogation, having P1 at MTL.  Inject 
an S1 pulse ahead of a P1 pulse at MTL -6 dB.  Verify at least 90% reply rate 
efficiency. 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

b. Continue the interrogation as in part "a" above.  Set the level of S1 to MTL 
-3 dB and verify at least 70% reply rate efficiency. 
c. Continue the interrogation as in part "a" above.  Set the level of S1 to MTL and 
verify reply rate efficiency of not more than 10%.   

## 2.4.6 Verification Of Desensitization And Recovery Characteristics (§2.2.6) 2.4.6.1 Verification Of Dead Time (§2.2.6.1) Purpose/Introduction:

After reception of a valid interrogation, the transponder shall not reply to any other interrogation at least for the duration of the reply pulse train.  This dead time **shall** end no later than 125 microseconds after the transmission of the last reply pulse of the group. Measurement Procedures: 
In the absence of P2 pulses, interrogate the transponder on Mode A at a repetition rate of 
500 interrogations per second and at a signal level at least 3 dB above the receiver minimum triggering level.  Using a second signal source (set to a comparable output level) with the interrogation rate synchronized with the first but delayed more than 150 microseconds, interrogate the transponder on Mode C.  Gradually shorten the delay until the replies to the Mode C interrogations disappear.  Note the interval between the last pulse of the Mode A reply and the first framing pulse of the Mode C reply.  The interval should be between 0 and 125 microseconds.   

## 2.4.6.2 Verification Of Echo Suppression And Recovery (§2.2.6.2) 2.4.6.2.1 Verification Of Desensitization (§2.2.6.2.1) Purpose/Introduction:

Upon receipt of any pulse more than 0.7 microseconds in duration, the receiver **shall** be desensitized by an amount that is within at least 9 dB of the amplitude of the desensitizing pulse, but **shall** at no time exceed the amplitude of the desensitizing pulse, with the exception of possible overshoot during the first microsecond following the desensitizing pulse.  Single pulses of duration less than 0.7 microseconds are not required to cause the specified desensitization, and **shall not** cause desensitization of duration greater than that permitted herein or by §2.2.6.2.2. 

Interrogate the transponder with Mode A interrogation pulse signals at a repetition rate of 500 interrogations per second.  Precede P1 by 2.8 microseconds with a single 0.8 
microsecond wide pulse at a signal level of 50 dB above the receiver minimum triggering level.  Adjust P1 and P3 equal in amplitude and increase the output to a level causing a reply rate of 450 replies per second.  This level should be between 34 and 43 dB above the receiver minimum triggering level. 

## 2.4.6.2.2 Verification Of Recovery (§2.2.6.2.2)

Purpose/Introduction: 
Following desensitization, the receiver **shall** recover sensitivity (within 3 dB of MTL) 
within 15 microseconds after reception of a desensitizing pulse having a signal strength up to 50 dB above MTL.  Recovery **shall** be nominally linear at an average rate not exceeding 4.0 dB per microsecond.   

Measurement Procedures: Note the signal levels required to just maintain 450 replies per second as the interval between the 0.8 microsecond pulse and P1 is gradually increased.  Also note that the average rate does not exceed 4.0 dB per microsecond as the signal level and interval is changed to just maintain the 450 pulses per second reply rate.  At an interval of 15 microseconds, verify that the sensitivity returns to at least MTL +3 dB.   

Note: An interval corresponding to a normal Mode A interrogation and a side lobe 
interrogation is excluded. 

## 2.4.7 Verification Of Undesired Replies (§2.2.7) 2.4.7.1 Verification Of Random Triggering And Suppression Rate (§2.2.7.1)

Purpose/Introduction: In the absence of valid interrogation signals, the random triggering rate (squitter) of the transponder **shall not** exceed 30 replies and/or suppressions per second as integrated over an interval equivalent to at least 300 random triggers, or 30 seconds, whichever is less. Measurement Procedures: Non-Interference Environment Set up test equipment to count reply transmissions from the transponder.  While not interrogating the transponder, count the number of replies for a minimum of one minute. 

## 2.4.7.2 Verification Of Random Triggering In The Presence Of Cw (§2.2.7.2)

Purpose/Introduction: 
The total random triggering on all Mode A and/or Mode C replies **shall not** exceed 10 
replies or suppressions per second, averaged over a period of 30 seconds, when operated in the presence of non-coherent CW interference at a frequency of 1030 ±0.2 MHz and a signal level of –60 dBm, or less. 

Measurement Procedure: 
Random Trigger Rate Repeat the procedure provided in §2.4.7.1 while injecting non-coherent CW interference at a frequency of 1030 ±0.2 MHz at a signal level of -60 dBm. Count the number of replies for a minimum of one minute and verify that the reply rate does not exceed the specified limits. 

## 2.4.8 Verification Of Transponder Self-Test And Monitor (§2.2.8) 2.4.8.1 Verification Of Manual Self-Test (§2.2.8.1)

Purpose/Introduction: 

a. When a manual self-test device is provided, it **shall** be limited to intermittent use by 
a spring loaded return-to-off switch, or equivalent. 
b. The test interrogation rate **shall** not exceed 450 per second. c. The lowest RF level at the input to the antenna required to accomplish the test **shall** 
be used.  The maximum RF level at the input to the antenna **shall not** exceed 40 dB 
below 1 milliwatt. 
Measurement Procedures: 

(l) 
Self-Test Interrogation/Reply Rate 
 
With equipment connected to the transponder for the purpose of detecting and counting reply rate, activate the self-test function (if provided) of the transponder under test and determine the reply rate to the self-test interrogation. 

 
(2) 
Self-Test Interrogation Level 
 
With equipment connected to the transponder for the purpose of measuring transmit power, activate the self-test function (if provided) of the transponder under test and determine that the transmit power is within the required limits. 

 

## 2.4.8.2 Verification Of Automatic Self-Test (§2.2.8.2)

Purpose/Introduction: 

a. 
When an automatic self-test device is provided, it **shall** be limited to use only in 
the absence of a valid interrogation.  (A minimum period of 15 seconds will be sufficient to establish the absence of ground interrogations).  
b. 
The maximum test time for the automatic self-test **shall** not exceed 0.1 second in 
any given 15-second interval. 
c. 
The test interrogation rate **shall** not exceed 450 per second. 
d. 
The lowest RF level at the input to the antenna required to accomplish the test 
shall be used.  The maximum RF level at the input to the antenna **shall not** 
exceed 40 dB below 1 milliwatt. 
(1) 
Interrogate the transponder at a nominal interrogation rate of 100 interrogations per second.  Stop the interrogations and, using a timing device (such as an oscilloscope) and a suitable RF detector at the transponder output, verify that no test transmissions occur for a period of 15 seconds after the interrogations cease.  
(2) 
With no external interrogations, observe the output of the RF detector and verify that the automatic self-test transmissions do not occur for more than 0.1 second in any given 15 second interval. 
(3) 
The test interrogation rate may be measured on the bench using a suitable detector and counter.  The interrogation rate averaged over a five second interval should not exceed 450 interrogations per second.  
(4) 
The test signal level may be measured at the antenna end of the transmission line in the actual aircraft, or on the bench using a length of transmission line equal to that in the airplane.  One way to measure the level is to adjust a second test transponder to just trigger at the prescribed radiation limit.  Connect this test transponder to the transmission line and determine if it is triggered when the self-testing device of the first transponder is operated. 
Note: Due to the close proximity of the units and because of the high signal 
level, the transmitter of the first transponder should be disabled.  A calibrated attenuator should be placed in the transmission line between the transponders to prevent receiver damage. 

## 2.4.9 Verification Of Response To Mutual Suppression Pulses (§2.2.9) Purpose/Introduction:

The equipment **shall** accept and respond to suppression pulses from other electronic equipment in the aircraft (to disable it while the other equipment is transmitting), the equipment **shall** regain normal sensitivity within 3 dB, not later than 15 microseconds after the end of the applied suppression pulse.   

Interrogate the transponder with a Mode A interrogation at an RF level of 3 dB above minimum triggering level.  Inject a suppression pulse into the transponder with a pulse width of 35 microseconds.  Position the leading edge of the suppression pulse at the 50% 
amplitude point so that it precedes the leading edge of P1 by 2.0 microseconds.  Verify that no reply is generated by the transponder. 

Delay the interrogation so the leading edge of P1 occurs 15 microseconds after the end of the suppression pulse.  Verify that the transponder replies to the interrogation. 

## 2.4.10 Verification Of Data Handling And Interfaces (§2.2.10) 2.4.10.1 Verification Of Code Nomenclature (§2.2.10.1) Purpose/Introduction:

The code designations **shall** consist of four digits, each of which lies between 0 and 7 
inclusive, and is determined by the sum of the pulse subscripts given in Table 2-3, employed as shown in Table 2-4. 

These requirements are tested in the test procedure in §2.4.10.2. 

## 2.4.10.2 Verification Of Identification (§2.2.10.2) Purpose/Introduction:

The 4096 codes specified in §2.1.10.1 **shall** be manually selectable for reply to interrogations on Mode A.   

Interrogate the transponder with a standard ATCRBS Mode A interrogation.  Set identification codes which should result in the setting of each of the identification reply bits one at a time.  Verify proper positioning of these bits in the reply.   

## 2.4.10.3 Verification Of Pressure Altitude Transmissions (§2.2.10.3) Purpose/Introduction:

a. 
Independently of the other modes and codes manually selected, the transponder 
shall automatically reply to Mode C interrogations. 
b. 
The reply to Mode C interrogations **shall** consist of the two framing pulses 
together with the information pulses specified in §2.2.4.2. 
c. 
The transponders **shall** be provided with means to remove the information 
pulses, but to retain the framing pulses when the provision of subparagraph "f" below is not complied with, in reply to Mode C interrogation. 
Note: The information pulses should be capable of being removed either in response to a failure detection system or manually at the request of the controlling agency. 

d. 
The information pulses **shall** be automatically selected by an analog-to-digital 
converter connected to a pressure-altitude data source in the aircraft referenced to the standard pressure setting of 29.92 inches of mercury.  
e. 
Pressure altitude **shall** be reported in 100-foot increments by selection of pulses 
as shown in Appendix A.  If the transponder is capable of accepting altitude 
sources with 25-foot or better resolution, the pressure altitude-information **shall** 
be reported in the closest 100-foot increment as specified in Appendix A. 
f. 
The digitizer code selected **shall** correspond to within ±125 feet, on a 95 percent 
probability basis with the pressure altitude information (referenced to the standard pressure setting of 29.92 inches of mercury) used on board the aircraft to adhere to the assigned flight profile. 
(a) 
Transponder response to Mode C interrogations may be monitored with a demodulator probe and an oscilloscope.  A Mode C reply without the digitizer connected to the transponder should consist of the two framing pulses F1 and F2.   
(b) 
The altitude reporting switch in the "off" position should prevent the transmission of digitizer information pulses but not the transmission of the framing pulses. 
(c) 
If a digitizer is connected to the transponder, the information pulses will appear in accordance with the pattern represented in Appendix A. 

## 2.4.11 Verification Of Antennas (§2.2.11)

No test procedures are provided herein to verify the requirements of §2.2.11. Appropriate test procedures are the responsibility of the manufacturer.   

## 2.4.12 Verification Of Power Interruption (§2.2.12) Purpose/Introduction:

The transponder equipment **shall** regain operational capability to within its operational limits within two seconds after the restoration of power following a momentary power interruption. 

Note: The transponder equipment is not required to continue operation during momentary power interruptions. 

Apply a momentary power interruption to the transponder.  Interrogate the transponder with a standard Mode A interrogation at a power level equal to 3 dB above the minimum triggering level.  Verify that the transponder is able to reply with at least 90% reply efficiency two seconds after power is restored. 

## 2.4.13 Verification Of Diversity (§2.2.13) Purpose/Introduction:

Diversity transponders may be implemented for the purpose of improving surveillance performance.  Such systems **shall** employ two antennas, one mounted on the top and the other on the bottom of the aircraft.  Appropriate switching and signal processing channels to select the best antenna on the basis of the characteristics of the received interrogation signals **shall** also be provided.  Such diversity systems, in their installed configuration, **shall** not result in degraded performance relative to that which would have been produced by a single system having a bottom-mounted antenna.   

## Diversity Antenna Selection And Selection Threshold

a. 
Diversity Antenna Selection 
Antenna selection **shall** be automatic.  The transponder **shall** select one of the two antennas on the basis of the relative strengths of the detected interrogation signals, provided that both channels simultaneously receive a valid identical interrogation or pulse pair.  Antenna selection and switching may occur after the receipt of the P3 pulse of a P1 - P3 pulse pair, indicating an ATCRBS or ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation. 

The selected antenna **shall** be used, if necessary, to transmit a reply. 

b. 
Selection Threshold 
The transponder **shall** nominally select the antenna connected to the RF port having the stronger signal.  To allow for unbalance in the characteristics of the two channels, a transition zone ±3 dB wide is permitted, in which either antenna may be selected. 

## Received Signal Delay Tolerance

If an interrogation is received at either antenna 0.125 microsecond or less in advance of reception at the other antenna, the interrogations **shall** be considered simultaneous and the reply antenna selection criteria **shall** be applied.  If an interrogation is received at either antenna 0.375 microsecond or more in advance of reception at the other antenna, the antenna selected for the reply **shall** be the one which received the earlier interrogation.  If the relative time of receipt is between 0.125 and 0.375 microsecond, the transponder **shall** select the reply antenna based on either the simultaneous interrogation criteria or the earlier time of arrival. 

## Diversity Transmission Channel Isolation

The peak RF power transmitted from the selected antenna **shall** exceed the power transmitted from the non-selected antenna by at least 20 dB.   

## Reply Delay Of Diversity Transponders

The total difference in mean reply delay between the two antenna channels (including the transponder-to-antenna cables) **shall** not exceed 0.08 microsecond for interrogations of equal amplitude.  This requirement is applicable to interrogation signal strengths between MTL +3 dB and MTL +50 dB. 

Note: This requirement limits apparent jitter caused by diversity operation and by cable delay differences.  The jitter requirements on each individual channel remain as specified for non-diversity transponders.  Control of apparent jitter caused by antenna location is specified in §3.1.6. 

## Equipment Required:

Two means of generating identical ATCRBS interrogations that can be delayed from each other from 125 to 375 nanoseconds. These two generators must also have independent control of power level.  

 
Means of determining the antenna terminal that generates the reply.  
 
Means of determining the reply power level on both antennas simultaneously. Means of determining reply delay for each channel and between channels.  
 
Note: Because the specifications for diversity operations are symmetrical in all 
respects, channels are arbitrarily designated A and B. 
 
(1) 
Single Channel Test (See §2.2.13.3 and §2.2.13.4)  
 
When measuring channel A and B parameters take care that any cables used for measurements are of equal length and equal loss. Interrogate channel A only, while monitoring channel A and B. At signal level MTL +3 dB use the following types of interrogations and record the listed observations: 

 
 
ATCRBS Mode A.  
 
 
ATCRBS Mode C. For signal levels of -50 dBm and -21 dBm use an ATCRBS Mode C and record the listed observations. Observe: 
Correct reply ratio.

 Repeat the above test reversing channels. Compare records of reply delays for conformance with §2.2.13.4.

Selection Test (See §2.2.13.1)  
 
Synchronize the interrogations to channels A and B so that they are 0.125 
+0.00/-0.04 microseconds apart where channel A is first. Use an ATCRBS Mode C at a power level on channel A of MTL and a power level on channel B of MTL +3 dB. Observe that 90 percent of the replies are on channel B. Use an ATCRBS Mode C at a power level on channel A of MTL +3 dB and a power level on channel B of MTL.

Observe that 90 percent of the replies are on channel A. Synchronize the interrogations to channels A and B so that they are 0.375 +0.040/-0.00 microseconds apart where channel B is first. Use an ATCRBS Mode C at a power level on channel A of -50 dBm and a power level on channel B of MTL +3. Observe that 90 percent of the replies are on channel B.  
 

## 3 Installed Equipment Performance

This section states the minimum acceptable level of performance for the equipment when installed in the aircraft.  For the most part, installed performance requirements are the same as those contained in Section 2, which were verified through bench and environmental test.

The voltage and voltage tolerance characteristics of the equipment **shall** be compatible with the aircraft power source of appropriate category as specified in RTCA/DO-160(). 

## 3.1.5 Transmission Line(S)

The transmission line(s) connecting antenna(s) and transponder(s) **shall** have impedance, power handling and loss characteristics in accordance with the equipment manufacturer's specifications. 

## 3.1.6 Antenna Location

a. 
Single Antenna 
The antenna **shall** be installed on the bottom of the aircraft as close to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft as possible. 

b.  
Diversity Transponder Installation 
The top and bottom antennas **shall** be mounted as near as possible to the center line of the fuselage.  Antennas **shall** be located so as to minimize obstruction to their fields in the horizontal plane.  

Recommendation: The horizontal distance between the top and bottom antennas should 
not be greater than 7.6 meters.  
Note: This recommendation is intended to support the operation of any diversity transponder (including cables) with any diversity antenna installation and still satisfy the requirement of §3.1.6 c. 

c. 
Reply Delay of Diversity Transponders.  
The total two-way transmission difference in mean reply delay between the two antenna channels (including the differential delay caused by transponder-toantenna cables and the horizontal distance along the aircraft centerline between the two antennas) **shall** not exceed 0.130 microseconds for interrogations of equal amplitude.  This requirement **shall** hold for interrogation signal strengths between MTL +3 dB and -21 dBm.  The jitter requirements on each individual channel **shall** remain as specified for non-diversity transponders (see §2.2.4.6).  
Note: This requirement limits the total apparent jitter caused by antenna switching and by cable and antenna location delay differences.  

## 3.1.7 Mutual Suppression

If other equipment is installed in the aircraft operating at or near 1030 and 1090 MHz, such as DME, the need for mutual suppression **shall** be determined.  When mutual suppression is used, the requirements of §2.2.9 **shall** be met. 

## 3.2 Conditions Of Test

The conditions of test stated in the following subparagraphs are applicable to the equipment tests specified in Subsection §3.3.  Ground tests may be used for all tests specified. 

 

## 3.2.1 Power Input

Tests may be conducted using either the aircraft's electrical power distribution system or an appropriate external power supply. 

 

## 3.2.2 Interference Effects

With the equipment energized from the aircraft's electrical power generating system, individually operate each of the other electrically operated aircraft equipment and systems to determine that no significant conducted or radiated interference exists. Evaluate all reasonable combinations of control settings and operating modes.  Operate communication and navigation equipment on at least the low, high and one mid-band frequencies.  If appropriate, repeat tests using emergency power source(s). 

 

## 3.2.3 Environment

During the tests, the equipment shall not be subjected to environmental conditions that exceed those in RTCA/DO-160() as specified by the equipment manufacturer. 

 

## 3.2.4 Adjustment Of Equipment

Circuits of the equipment under test **shall** be properly aligned and otherwise adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practices prior to application of the specified tests. 

 

## 3.2.5 Warm-Up Period

## 3.3 Test Procedures For Installed Equipment Performance

The test procedures set forth below are considered satisfactory in determining required installed equipment performance.  Testing requirements are stated, in a manner that will make maximum use of bench test data while limiting flight tests to those requirements which cannot be tested conveniently by other means.  Although suggested test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the installing activity.  These alternate procedures may be used if the installing activity can show that they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. Installed equipment performance tests confirm surveillance functions. Current U.S. operating regulations require tests similar to those described herein be performed bi-annually to ensure against deterioration of performance.  Since equipment installation requires initial performance of these tests, they are included herein. 

 

## 3.3.1 Conformity Inspection

Visually inspect the installed equipment to determine the use of acceptable workmanship and engineering practices.  Verify that all mechanical and electrical connections have been made properly and that the equipment has been installed and located in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. 

 

## 3.3.2 Bench Tests

The equipment **shall** have been tested and certified by the equipment manufacturer to demonstrate compliance with the minimum requirements stated in §2.4. The transponder tests required below may be conducted using portable test equipment. 

 

## 3.3.3 Reply Frequency

Interrogate the installed transponder and verify that the reply frequency of the system is 1090 ±3 MHz. 

## 3.3.4 Framing Pulse Spacing

Verify that the time interval between the leading edges of the two framing pulses is 20.3 ±0.10 microseconds. 

 

## 3.3.5 Reply Codes

b. 
Interrogate the transponder a sufficient number of times to verify that the correct 4096 code is transmitted.  Use more than one 4096 code. 

## 3.3.6 Pressure Altitude Transmissions

a. 
Verify that the transponder response to Mode C interrogations consists only of framing pulses F1 and F2.  If complete altitude reporting capability is provided, the altitude digitizer may not be connected to the transponder at the time of the test. 
b. 
Verify that the transponder response to Mode C interrogations consists of only framing pulses F1 and F2 with the altitude switch in the "OFF" position. 

## 3.3.7 Altitude Reporting Test

a. 
A sufficient number of test points **shall** be checked to ensure that the altitude 
reporting equipment and transponder perform their intended function through 
their entire range while ascending or descending.  Tests of each altitude code segment of the encoder (2300, 2500, 3800, 4300, 4800, 6800, 14,800 and 30,800 if available) are sufficient to ensure proper operation of each altitude code segment of the encoder. 
b. 
Verify that the correspondence value of the altimeter system is 125 feet or less. 

## 3.3.8 Reply Pulse Width

Verify that the duration of the F1 and F2 pulses between the 0.5 amplitude points on the leading and trailing edge is 0.45, ±0.10 microsecond with the transponder replying on Mode A, code 0001, and code 7477. 

## 3.3.9 Receiver Sensitivity

a. Verify that for ATCRBS interrogations the receiver sensitivity of the system at the 
antenna end of the transmission line is is nominally 71 dB below 1 milliwatt with limits between 69 and 77 dB below 1 milliwatt. 
b. The minimum triggering level (MTL) of the transponder **shall** be such that replies 
are generated to 90 percent of the interrogation signals when: (1) 
The two pulses P1 and P3 constituting an interrogation are of equal amplitude and P2 is not detected; and  
(2) 
The amplitude of these signals received at the antenna end of the transmission line of the transponder is nominally 71 dB below 1 milliwatt with limits between 69 and 77 dB below 1 milliwatt. 
Note: For this MTL requirement, a nominal 3 dB transmission line loss and an antenna performance equivalent to that of a simple quarter wave antenna are assumed.  In the event these assumed conditions do not apply, the MTL of the installed transponder system must be comparable to that of the assumed system. 

c. The variation of the minimum triggering level between modes **shall** not exceed 1 dB 
for nominal pulse spacings and pulse widths. 
d. The reply characteristics **shall** apply over a received signal amplitude range between 
minimum triggering level and 50 dB above minimum triggering level. 
e. The suppression characteristics **shall** apply over a received, .signal amplitude range 
between 3 dB above minimum triggering level and 50 dB above minimum triggering level. 

## 3.3.10 Transmitter Power Output

a. 
Verify that transponders operating at altitudes above 15,000 feet have a peak pulse power at the antenna end of the transmission line of at least +21 dBW and 
not more than +27 dBW. 
b. 
Verify that transponders intended for operation at altitudes not above 15,000 feet have a peak pulse power at the antenna end of the transmission line of at least +18.5 dBW and not more than +27 dBW. 

## 3.3.11 Diversity Antenna Installations

Verify that the antennas on the aircraft are no more than 7.6 meter (25 feet) apart in the horizontal plane.  The cables **shall** be essentially of equal electrical length. 

## 3.4 Flight Test Procedures

The following test procedures provide one means of determining installed equipment performance.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the installing activity.  These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures.  The equipment **shall** be tested to determine compliance with the minimum requirements stated in §2.2.  In order to meet this requirement, test results supplied by the equipment manufacturer or other proof of conformity may be accepted in lieu of bench tests performed by the installing activity. This guidance material offers examples of flight test procedures for demonstration of selected performance functions.  Flight demonstration of installed performance may be required by the aircraft operator or by airworthiness inspection agencies. A schedule must be arranged with the area air traffic control facility so that a controller is available to observe the transponder reply and communicate with the test aircraft to confirm performance of the transponder. Select a test area such that line-of-sight signal propagation is assured.  Test maneuvers may include standard rate turns through 360 degrees, climbs and descents so that ATC can confirm valid return through normal flight attitudes.  Verification of Ident codes selected and reported altitude response to Mode C should be checked. 

## 3.4.1 Ground Pre-Flight Tests

The following transponder characteristic should be determined and the performance level noted: 

(1) 
Random triggering of the transponder should not exceed 30 replies per second as integrated over an interval equivalent to at least 300 random triggers, or 30 
seconds, whichever is less.  This should be determined with all possible interfering equipments operating in their normal manner on operational channels of maximum interference, but with the absence of bona fide transponder interrogations.  This test can be performed by using an RF detector sufficiently coupled to the antenna to count the rate of non-interrogated replies. 

(2) 
Receiver/Transmitter system characteristics should be assured by determining the attenuation constant of the installed coaxial transmission line and the characteristics of the antenna.  Measure the length of transmission line and refer to suitable handbooks regarding the type of coaxial cable or the transponder 
manufacturer's equipment manual to determine the amount, of attenuation in 
decibels.  Inspect the antenna system and carefully observe that the antenna is 
installed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, and that there 
are no protrusions from the aircraft which will affect the efficiency of the antenna.  The following examples are given to empirically determine the system compliance: 
EXAMPLE #1: Effective radiated power =ERP 
ERP = PT - L + GA 
Where: 
PT 
= 
Power in dBW at the antenna terminal of the transponder.  (Refer to §2.3.2.1.14) 

 
L 
= 
Transmission Line Loss 
 
GA 
= 
Antenna gain above isotropic 
 Assume the following: 

a) The measured transmitter power at the transponder antenna terminal is 
100 watts (+20 dBW).  The measured receiver sensitivity is -71 dBm. 
b) 10 feet of RG-8/U = 0.9 dB. c) Antenna gain is unity with respect to isotropic which results in 0 dB. 
Then: 
Transmitted ERP = 20 - 0.9 + 0 = 19.1 dBW Effective Receiver Sensitivity  = -71 + 0.9 - 0 = -70.1 dBm This example would allow the system to operate in aircraft for altitudes not exceeding 15,000 feet. 

## Example #2:

Assume the following: 

a) The measured transmitter power at the trans- ponder terminal is 29 
dBW.  
b) 33 feet of RG-8/U = 3 dB  
c) Antenna gain is unity with respect to isotropic which results in 0 dB. 
Then: 
Transmitter ERP = 29 - 3 + 0 = 26 dBW Effective Receiver Sensitivity = -74 + 3 - 0 = -71 dBm This example would allow the system to operate in aircraft intended to operate at all altitudes. 

(3) 
Automatic altitude reporting performance should be checked as follows with aircraft on the ground: (a) 
Set the altimeter normally used to maintain flight altitude to 29.92 inches of mercury (1013.2 millibars). 
(b) 
Select 10 or more evenly-spaced altitude test points between zero (sea level) and the maximum operating altitude of the aircraft.  Test each of these test points for increasing altitude and for decreasing altitude. 
(c) 
Apply pressure to the static system.  If separate static systems serve altimeter and digitizer, apply identical pressures simultaneously to each. Approach each test point slowly, decreasing pressure for increasing altitude, and vice versa, until a transition to the test point value occurs in 
the digital output.  Record the pilot's altimeter reading at the instant of 
transition in the digitizer. 
(d) 
The installation is acceptable if the altimeter normally used to maintain flight altitude corresponds with the output of the digitizer within 125 feet at each test point and within ±62 feet at not less than 70 percent of the test points.  
(4) 
The performance characteristics of any equipment(s) functioning external to the 
transponder system **shall** be evaluated to determine that the algebraic cumulative 
effective dead time does not exceed the specified limits. 

## 3.4.2 Operational Flight Tests

(1) 
Perform the flight test using an ATC facility and procedures.  The flight should be conducted from the airport to approximately 25 miles from the ground facility.  Put the aircraft through those maneuvers normally associated with takeoff, climb, holding procedures, descent and final approach.  Determine in the course of these maneuvers that the transponder performs its intended function and is suitable for use in the ATC system. 
--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

(2) 
If the system includes altitude reporting and while performing (1) above, request 
ATC to monitor the altitude being reported by the transponder and compare with the altimeter being used to maintain flight altitude. 
(3) 
Request ATC to verify proper performance while operating on several different 
codes.  Do not use codes 7700 or 7600, unless requested by ATC. 
Note: It should be recognized that some aircraft attitudes with respect to the ground station will cause momentary loss of contact.
