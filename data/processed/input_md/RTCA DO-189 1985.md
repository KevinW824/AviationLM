RTCA is an association of aeronautical organizations of the United States from both government and industry. Dedicated to the advancement of aeronautics, RTCA seeks sound technical solutions to problems involving the application of electronics and telecommunications to aeronautical operations. Its objective is the resolution of such problems by mutual agreement of its member organizations. 

The findings of RTCA are in the nature of recommendations to all organizations concerned. Since RTCA is not an official agency of the United States Government, its recommendations may not be regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the Federal government organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations relate. 

Coordination of these standards was accomplished by RTCA

Section 2.0 contains the minimum performance standards for the equipment. These standards define required performance under standard operating conditions and stressed physical environmental conditions. The document also details recommended bench test procedures necessary to demonstrate compliance. 

Section **3 . 0**  describes the performance required of the installed equipment. Tests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing, Section 
4.0 describes the operational performance characteristics for equipment installations and defines conditions and tests that will assure the user that the equipment will perform safely and reliably in the expected operational environment. 

Compliance with these standards by manufacturers, installers and users is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will satisfactorily perform its intended 
-function(s) under all conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operations. 

I
t is recognized that any regulatory application of this document in whole or in part is the sole responsibility of appropriate governmental agencies. 

Since the measured values of equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the measurement method, standard test conditions and methods of test are recommended in this document. 

This document considers a configuration of airborne equipment encompassing: An antenna system, transmission lines, DME interrogator, interrogator control unit and interfaces with aircraft displays/systems. 

to expanded capabilities are identified as optional features. 

Additional functions and components that refer Features that are beyond the scope of this document may be developed in future RTCA activities. 

It This will depend on the design used The word "equipment" as used in this document includes all components or units necessary, as determined by the equipment manufacturer or installer, for the equipment to properly perform its intended function. For example, DME interrogating "equipment" may include an antenna, an interrogator unit, a control unit, a display, a shock mount, etc. In the case of this example, all of the foregoing components or units comprise the "equipment." 
should not be inferred from this example, however, that all equipment configurations will necessarily include all of the foregoing components or units. 

by the equipment manufacturer. 

Where possible, Other aircraft systems that may be used with DME interrogating equipment are outside the scope of this document. 

reference is made to other documents that describe such systems, equipment or components. 

I
f the equipment implementation includes a computer software package, the guidelines contained in RTCA/DO-l78A, 
"Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification," 
March 22, 1985, should be considered. 

Development and approval of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS) was monitored continually. The DME/N 
was updated and the DME/P 
performance requirements were developed in consonance with the ICAO 
standards current at the time of MOPS publication. 

## System Overview 1.2

DME is an air-derived system in which the airborne equipment interrogates a ground transponder with paired pulses at a specific spacing. The ground transponder receives the interrogation and, after a predetermined time delay, transmits a reply on a different carrier frequency. The airborne equipment receives this reply and measures the time difference between its original interrogation and the ground reply. Based upon this time difference, the airborne equipment computes and displays the range of the ground transponder. 

receive 360 degrees of azimuth coverage. 

Both ground and airborne equipment typically transmit and Airborne transmitter minimum peak power output levels of 50 and 250 
watts have demonstrated satisfactory performance over several decades of operational use. The equipment specified herein is predicated upon these power levels. However, these values may not be satisfactory for some operational requirements applications which need higher output levels. 

The DME channel plan (Appendix A) provides 352 channels between 960 
and 1215 MHz. 

Numerical channels, i.e., 17, 82, etc., have the alphabetical subscripts of X, Y, W and Z 
which denote channelpaired pulse spacing. Although "X" 
channels are most commonly used in 1985, **"Y"** channel assignments are expected to be made starting in the 1980-1990 era. International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO) plans do not envision **"W"** or "Z" channel assignments prior to 1995. 

DME/N interrogator will be in After January 1
,
 1989, FAA will assign DME channels according to the desired-to-undesired protection ratios given in Column B of Table C-4, Attachment C to Part 1 of the ICAO 
Aeronautical Telecommunications Annex 10. 

conformance with these protection ratios if the standard test signal defined in Appendix C of paragraph e. is used to measure the off-frequency performance.

A major source of accuracy degradation encountered in the final phases of approach and landing is multipath interference. 

minimizes these effects in the FA 
mode by referencing elapsed time measurements to an early portion of the received pulse by setting the receiver threshold at a relatively low amplitude. In addition to the low thresholding, DME/P accuracy is achieved by wideband signal processing of pulses having fast rise time leading edges. 

This is in contrast to the 50% level thresholding and slow rise time pulses used in DME/N. 

By restricting the FA mode coverage to 8 nmi, the adjacent channel power constraints on the transponder can be satisfied while maintaining an adequate threshold-to-noise ratio throughout this region. 

Bias The IA mode functions similarly to that of DME/N, The errors do not occur because the DME/P IA mode and DME/N interrogator and transponder thresholds are on the 50% pulse channels. In addition, the 50% threshold and a narrow band interrogator permit an adequate threshold-to-noise ratio as well as a high signal-to-noise ratio at the coverage limits of 22 nmi. 

interrogation mode is determined at the transponder by the interrogation code, with reply delay timing based on the proper threshold point for the type of interrogation received. The reply code remains the same regardless of the type of interrogation. 

Since DME/W is rarely used, this document does not include specifications for DME/W 
equipment. 

As an optional capability, airborne DME can interrogate and simultaneously range on two or more ground transponders which are operating on different channels. Such equipment is known as Scanning DME. 

Many of the performance standards listed in this document,, particularly those relating to rejection of unwanted pulse codes and frequencies, are for the protection of presently proposed DME 
interrogators against other known services but also for protection against services which might be proposed in the future. 

## 1.3 Operational Applications 1.3.1 Genera 1

It DME, when used with other systems such as VHF Omnirange (VOR), Instrument Landing System (
I

S
)
, Microwave Landing System (
M
L
S
)
,
 
etc., can meet the needs of a variety of users in the en route, approach, landing, missed approach and departure phases of flight. 

Typical applications are described in the following paragraphs. 

should be noted that DME/N service is operational in the National Airspace System and that DME/P 
service is planned for initial implementation in **1986.** DME/P is intended primarily for use with the MLS. 

1.3.2 
Typical 
Applications 
En route Operations - DME 
provides range information for navigation during the en route phase of flight. This information can be displayed directly to the flight crew, used as an input for the area navigation **(RNAV)** equipment or aircraft automatic flight control systems (AFCS) and allows manual, semi-automated and automatic en route flight operations. 

Such data can be used manually or with **RNAV** or AFCS to Terminal Operations - DME 
continues-to provide range data for flight transitions from the en route to the terminal phase of flight. 

navigate to, and descend to the initial approach fix altitude. 

From this point, the flight can conduct either a nonprecision or precision approach. 

Approach and Landing Operations - For nonprecision approaches, DME/N can be used in conjunction with other systems such as VOR, nondirectional beacon (NDB) 
, localizer, etc. 

In these operations, DME/N 
can be The higher STOL and VTOL accuracy is Precision approaches can presently be conducted with DME/N 
service in conjunction with ILS 
and MLS. 

used for **AFCS** gain scheduling and as a replacement for the marker beacon portion of the ILS. Implementation of DME/P 
with MLS will be based on two accuracy standards: For conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) aircraft - 30 meters (100 f e e t
)
, for short takeoff and landing (STOL) and vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft 
- 12 meters (40 f e e t
)
.

 
required to permit operations to smaller, more confined landing areas. 

Higher accuracies should be provided for CTOL/VTOL Category II/III 
landings and for helicopter decelerated precision approaches to small or confined landing areas. 

During takeoff and Missed Approach and Departure Operations - DME 
can also be used for missed approach procedures by providing range information needed for navigation to the missed approach fix. 

departure, DME, in conjunction with other systems, can be used for navigation while transitioning from the terminal to the en route phase of flight. 

## 1.4 Operational Goals

These operational goals establish airborne DME 
requirements which are reflected in Section 2.0. 

In general, minimum goals are presented with desired goals identified as options. 

## 1.4.1 Ac Curacy

DME 
accuracy should allow an aircraft using the DME 
output data to fly safe, accurate paths during the en route, terminal, approach, landing, missed approach and departure phases of flight. 

## 1.4.2 Range

DME interrogator characteristics should also assure DME interrogator characteristics (power output and receiver Sensitivity) should assure that flight operations can be conducted throughout the standard service volumes shown in Figures 
1-1 
through 1
-
4
.

 
that flight operations can be conducted throughout expanded service volumes (ESVs) at ranges out to 200 nmi and at altitudes where the path loss is no more severe than what is experienced at the worst case points of the standard service volumes. 

DME/N 
power output and receiver sensitivity should support ILS 
instrument approach procedures from ranges of 25 nmi from the associated ILS/DME 
ground transponder at altitudes down to 1000 
ft above the runway. DME/P should support MLS/ILS instrument approach procedures from ranges of 22 
nmi from the associated ground transponder at altitudes down to 2000 ft at maximum range above the runway. 

## 1.4.3 Data Inputs

The equipment should provide a means for selecting the desired operating channel or alternatively, channel selection should be provided in conjunction with channel selection on associated systems such as: VOR, ILS, MLS, etc. 

## 1.4.4 Outputs

The equipment should provide visual and/or electrical outputs that permit en route, terminal and approach flight operations, Ground facility identification should be provided through audio (morse code) or visual display (digital u p l i n k
)
.

 

## 1.4.5 Warnings

A warning, such as a flag, is required to prevent misinterpretation of DME 
outputs whenever the equipment is no longer tracking a DME 
signal. 

## 1.4.6 Data Display

Dedicated DME 
displays may be used or the information may be The equipment should display unambiguous information to the flight crew. 

incorporated into multipurpose cockpit displays. As a minimum, displays should provide distance information, warning indications and channel selection. As an alternative, the source of channel selection may be displayed. 

## 1.5 Test Procedures

The test procedures and associated limits specified throughout this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the minimum acceptable performance requirements. 

Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred. 

These alternate procedures may be used if they provide equivalent information. In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. 

The order of tests suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of different tests as it moves from design, and design qualification, into operational use. For example, the equipment should have been demonstrated to comply with the requirements of Section 2.0 as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed equipment tests of Section 3.0.

NOTE 1: The intent of paragraph 2.2.7 
is to specify a radiated 
field intensity €or 
a 
DME interrogator that will provide 
sufficient signal for reliable DME 
operation. There 
are 
many factors affecting the radiated field intensity from a 
complete 
DME 
system: 
The radiated power depends on the amount of power lost in the interconnecting cable from the interrogator to the antenna. 

The gain of the antenna will af£ect the radiated power. 

The location of the antenna on the aircraft will affect the radiated power. 

Most antenna installations will provide a radiation pattern that will have relative peaks and nulls which will affect DME 
range if the ground transponder falls in a pattern null. It is difficult to predict the antenna pattern from a DME 
antenna as installed on an aircraft. 

It is possible to characterize an antenna to a certain extent by measuring the radiation pattern with the antenna mounted on a large conducting sheet. This is not a direct relationship to the antenna pattern as mounted on the aircraft, but will identify some of the more serious shortcomings. The measurement of the feedline loss is not difficult, but it is difficult to predict the loss over a period of time. Many coaxial cables tend to degrade with time which implies that a measurement of a new piece of cable will not indicate the loss after a period of years. 

The power output of the interrogator is a relatively easy parameter to measure and although there could be a degradation over a period of years it is not as likely as the deterioration of a coaxial cable. 

It is for these reasons that the power output of the interrogator is the controlling factor in the determination of the radiated field intensity of an installed DME 
system. The radiated power of a DME is: 
In the event that these The power output minus the power lost in the feedline times the gain of the antenna, The power requirements of a DME 
as outlined in this MOPS is based on a loss of 3 dB 
in the transmission feedline and a matched resonant quarterwave vertical antenna working with a large, flat highly conductive ground plane. 

same conditions are not used by the manufacturer, the minimum output power shall be sufficient to provide the equivalent radiated field strength.

output power of the interrogator should not exceed 2.0 kW. 

## 2.2.8 Receiver Sensitivity

When the input signal at the equipment input terminals is the test signal having 70% 
reply efficiency: 

a. 
The equipment 
minimum sensitivity level shall not exceed -83 
dBm with or without TACAN modulation in the absence of all 
interfering signals. 
b. 
The equipment shall acquire the correct range as specified in 
2.2.1 in 2
.
0
 seconds 
80% of the time and maintain track. 
Some 
DME 
NOTE 1: The 
main and auxiliary reference groups of the 
TACAN 
bearing have 
precedence over DME 
replies. Also, there is 
a 
fixed dead time associated with each DME 
reply pulse 
pair and/or random pulse pair (squitter). 
interrogator pulse pairs will normally occur during the 
time of the bearing'reference 
groups and during the dead 
time of the beacon; therefore, replies are not transmitted. When 70% 
of the interrogations are answered, reply 
efficiency is defined as 70%. 
NOTE 2: The 
ultimate receiver sensitivity to radiated signals is a 
function of the antenna, its mounting location on the 
aircraft and the loss in the antenna feedline. As with 
the measurement of transmitter power, the receiver 
sensitivity is based on a feedline loss of 3 dB and a 
quarter wave vertical antenna (2 
dB gain) mounted on a 
large conducting sheet. In 
DME systems 
where the feedline 
Manufacturers must loss is different than 3 dB, the minimum receiver sensitivity requirement may be adjusted. 

take precautions, however, to ensure that feedlines of excessive loss or antennas of lower gain are not employed to the detriment of the system. 

NOTE 3: 
The conversion factor for converting power density 
(dBw/m2) to the 
power received by an isotropic antenna 
(dBm) is Pa 
= Pd + 1
0
 log A2/4.rr + 30 dBm where 
X is wave 
length in meters. The conversion 
used in this document is 
+7, calculated at 1215 MHz. 
NOTE 4: 
The 
minimum sensitivity level does not account for 
airborne antenna lobing and aircraft shadowing effects.

## 2.4 Equipment Performance - Environmental Conditions

The environmental tests and performance requirements described in this subsection are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the equipment under conditions representative of those which may be encountered in actual operations. 

Some of the environmental tests contained in this subsection do not have to be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition. These tests are identified by the phrase "When Required." I
f the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment to these additional environmental conditions, then these "When Required'' 
tests shall be performed. 

Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are set forth in RTCA Document DO-l60B, 
"Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment," July 1984.

## 2.5.5 Detailed Test Procedures For Dme/P

The test procedures set forth below are considered satisfactory for use in determining required performance under standard and stressed conditions. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the testing activity. These alternate procedures may be used if the manufacturer can show that they provide at least equivalent information. 

In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. 

Primary measurements are to be made on that output port which is intended to provide the highest accuracy for the most critical applications.

## Dme Channels, Frequencies And Pairings

The following tables show how DME is paired with VHF navigation and MLS angle frequencies. Across each page are 9 
columns, as follows: 

1. 
Tacan Channel 
Numbers, starting with 1X and ending with 126Y. 
2. 
VHF Navigation Frequencies.

basis with 1

X channels and **100 Y** channels. 
Localizer and VOR frequencies are rigidly 
The 
? VHF frequencies 
are 100 
kHz 
apart, 
while the 
Y frequencies are in 
between, thus calling for 50 kHz 
spacing, and are less used. 
3. 
MLS Angle Frequencies are listed in 
MHz. The 
200 MLS angle frequencies 
are rigidly paired on a one-for-one 
basis with 200 DME 
frequencies (20 X 
channel 
DME 
frequencies, 
80 Y channel 
DME 
frequencies, 20 W channel 
DME 
frequencies 
and 80 Z 
channel 
DME 
frequencies).

with VHF communications 
frequencies. 
NOTE 2: On those DME 
channels that are 
paired with both VHF NAV and MLS 
angle frequencies, 
a 
decision 
must be made in the cockpit as to 
which one is used and displayed.

The International Civil Aviation Organization f **ICAO)** has completed technical standards for the precision distance measuring equipment (D\IE:Pi. The **DRlUP** is an integral element of the microwave landing **system** (hlLS) and will provide the precision ranging function to complement the already standardized azimuth and elevation guidance functions o f the system. 

In 1978 an **ICA0** meeting concluded that the DhlEIP should be integrated into the existing standards for the conventional DhlE 
(DXlEIN) as a compatible service. The motivation for this was economic. It **was** reasoned that a single i.-band airborne unit could satisfy the need for both existing enroule and the **new** precision approach and landing services. thereby avoiding unnecessary duplication of on-board ranging equipment. Furthermore. this approach would permit existing conventional airborne equipment lo obtain service from the new **DME/P** ground facilities at least during the initial stages of AILS 
implementation. These compa!ibility requirements were later incorporated into the **DAIWP** statement of operational requirements which was accepted at an **IC.40** meeting in April **1981.** Further. they have heen a primary incus in the DI\lE/P standardization effort H 
hich ha5 been actively pursued since laie 1980. 

The conceptual design of the DhlE'P that evolved from the I C A 0  process is discussed here. The comptability issues are highlighted. and il is shown how **they** are accommodated in the system synthesis which also treats the obvious need for a guidance function of high integrity and robust performance in the severe rnultipath environment encountered in approach and landing operatinns.

## I. The Dme'P **Systems** Engineering Probleici

   The prccision distance meawringqiiiri'ment i 
                                                DMEIP) 
is based upon the DME principle ùtiintd in I I l  and 
described in IS]. That sytem. callcd DLtE". is a radio 
aid to navigation which provides distance information in 
the aircraft by measuring total round-trip time bctwcen 
interrogations from an airborne trrinsmitter and rcplies 
from a pround transponder (see Fig. I 1. 

The successful integration of DME:P functions tvith 

those of the DM;1E.I is a system engineering problem 
whose solution is the subject of this paper. The first 
priority in approaching this task was to establish the 
DMEIP operational requirements (OR). That is. \\hat are 
the user requirements that the DMGP must satisfy so that 
measured range data in conjunction with the M L S  
                                                    angle 
data can lead to a successful aircraft approach and 
landing? Section Ill briefly summarizes the OR which 
contain an interpretation of the operational need in terms 
of the range accuracy values which must be achicved in 
various regions of the hïLS coverage volume, 

The ICA0 DhlVP technical standards will be 

included in I i I as Standards and Recommended Practices 
(SARPs), They translate the ORs (e.g., performance and 
coverage requirements) into specifications that are 
meanin,oful to ground equipment manufacturers. airport 
operators. and the avionics industry. The intention is to 
provide the minimum specification material necessary to 
assure safety and compatibility among ground and 
airborne equipment manufactured in the various supplying 
countries. This approach also provides maximum 
flexibility to the avionics industv, which is. for a variety 
of reasons. the most dynamic end of the navigation 
systems business. The standards provide sufficient detail. 
however. to permit the development of necessq 
engineering tools such as systeni accuracy budgcts and 
power budgets to assist equipment manufacturers in 
designing their transmitters and receivers and to assure 
compatibility between units of different manufacture. 
   A new pulse waveform had to he defined to permit 
the accurícy specification to be achieved while at the 
same time not requiring the existing DhWN adjacent 
channel interference specification to be altered. Section V 
defines the DMEIP pulse in terms of rise time 
parameters. Section VI defines the technique used to 
estimate the time of arrival of this new pulse in the 
presence of multipath. 

The DMEIP channel plan is described in Section W. 

It is configured to handle estimated aircraft traffic 
densities weil heyond the gear 7000 by minimizing the 
potential for DME self-interference (garble). Garble 
degrades the two major performance parameters: system 
efficiency and accuracy. The subject of system efficiency 
is introduced in Section VIU; it is a new DME concept 
which influences all the elements of the DMWP. In 
Section IX, "Multipath," the single most imponant 
threat to DME'P accuracy performance is treated. It is 
shown that multipath effects are controlled by selecting 

the critical parameters associated with pulse rise time and the time-of-arrival measurement technique so that they match the runway environment. 

Because the range must be measured in the presence 

of intense multipath and DME garble interference. 
Section X discusses recommended ground and airborne 
signal processing techniques, a subject that is not as 
critical to the DME/N. 
   Section XI presents DME/P error measurement 
methods and introduces the error components. Section 
XII then treats the accuracy budgets. Because of their 
importance to system performance, two of the error 
niechanisms, multipath and DME garble interference. are 
treated in separate sections as mentioned earlier. Section 
XII1 treats the power budgets whose values reflect the 
signal coverage necessary for the approach and landing 
application. Section XIV treats one of the elements 
necessary to achieve the vertical coverage, the siting of 
the DME antenna. Section XV provides a functional 
description of the transponder and interrogator equipment. 
Section XVI presents a typical flight-test error trace, and 
Section XVII offers concluding remarks. Finally three 
appendixes provide additional background for Sections II. 

a VII, and VIII. 

## Ii. Historical Background

   The ICA0 Seventh Air Navigation Conference, April 
1972, established the All Weather Operations Panel 
(AWOP) as the designated body to develop SARPs for a 
new nonvisual precision approach and landing guidance 
system (MLS). (See 1181.) While several states included 
proposals for precision DME as part of their submissions 
on MLS, AWOP determined that its initial obligation was 
the preparation of SARPs for the angle and data functions 
of the MLS. This decision recognized that the MLS could 
be implemented, if necessary, utilizing the conventional 
distance measuring equipment (DME) as specified in [i]. 
to satisfy early operational uses. The realization of the 
full benefits of MLS which required standardization of a 
precision DME (DME/P) capability was addressed 
accordingly as a second priority. 
   The eighth meeting of AWOP (AWOP-8) in March 
1980 131 resulted in adoption of SARPs 171 by the panel 
for the angle guidance portion of the MLS which were 

by the group, including revisions to the DME/N 
SARPs and the DME Guidance Material.

## 111. Dmeíp Operational Requirements

   The DME/P is an integral part of the microwave 
landing system (MLS) for aircraft approach, landing. and 
missed approach operations. The DME/P system must be 
capable of providing high accuracy range information in a 
potentially severe multipath environment such as that 
encountered during landing operations. The accuracy 
required (100 ft) for such operations is at least an order 
of magnitude better than that provided by the present 
conventional DME system (DMWN). 
   The OR state the DME/P must provide high quality 
gudiance to a range of 32 nmi and be fully coiiipatible 
and interoperable with conventional DME/N. This implies 
that

P interoperability with DME/N was addressed. The 
original concept described in [SI 
carried with it an 
error component that would be incurred. if a DMEI 
N interrogator were to obtain distance service with a 
DMEiP transponder. The error arose in this concept 
because it was thought that the ground transponder 
could not be made to rcliably differentiate between 
DME/N and DME/P interrogations. and means to 
attempt such a distinction were intentionally 
omitted. Since the pulse time of arrival decision 
threshold for the two applications must be different, 
a bias error will be generated in mixed operations 
because, without prior infomiation. the ground 
transponder zero range time delay can only be 
calibrated with respect to one or the other threshold 
Three new system concepts were informally 
submitted to the Concepts Subgroup for evaluation, 
each with a unique method for resolving the 
interoperability error. All concepts contained the 
notion of a low-threshold precision mode and a -6 
dB threshold nonprecision mode. They were

(3) a precision interrogator may be used with a 
(a) A two-pulse system concept (FranceNnited 
Kingdom) much like the system proposed in [SI, 
except a pulse rise time recognition circuit in the 
transponder was proposed to differentiate 
between DME/N and DME/P interrogators. The 
integrity of the pulse recognition circuit became 
an issue. 
(b) A three-pulse system concept (Federal Republic 
of Germany/United States) using a conventional 
pulse-pair followed 200 p
s
 later by a single 
precision mode pulse; DME/N and nonprecision 
DME/P range measurements were to be made on 
the conventional DME pulse pair; precision 
range measurements would be performed on 
third pulse. This concept was viewed as a large 
departure from the present DME system. 
(c) A two-pulse/two-mode concept (France) which 
was the technique unanimously chosen by the 
subgroup 1141. A complete system description is 
given in Section IV. Josef Hetyei of France was 
the originator of this concept. 
(d) Italy and Japan proposed alternative pulse 
shaping implementations which are applicable to 
the two-pulse two-mode technique. 

in Section IV satisfies these requirements of accuracy, 
compatibility, and interoperability. 
   In addition, the OR states that, when operationally 
required, the DME/P distance information shall permit, in 
combination with the appropriate MLS angle and data 
information, the functions in Table I to be determined. 
   Based upon the accuracy requirement in Table I, two 
accuracy standards were specified in the SARPs with the 
intent of accommodating a variety of applications in an 
economical manner. Standard 1 is intended to satisfy the 
accuracy requirements of CTOL applications where "flare 
hejght" is obtained by radar altimeter. Standard 2 is 
intended to satisfy the accuracy requirements of STOL 
and V/STOL applications as well as operations utilizing 
the MLS flare function. For both standards; accuracy 
degradations with distance and azimuth angle are also 
specified. Table II gives Standards I and 2 which are 
defined on a 95 percent probability basis. No degradation 
is permitted with elevation angle but a 1.5: 
                                             I degradation 
is permitted in azimuth. Between the lateral limits at

       the accuracy is permitted to degrade linearly. The 
revised DME/N SARPs also specifies that the total 
system accuracy of the DMEIN shall not exceed 0.2 nmi. 
With an overall system accuracy of 0.2 nmi, the DME/N 
can be used as a middle marker replacement for 30-m 
decision height determination. Appendix A defines the

        ( I )  DMUP accuracy approximately corresponds to the azimuth function PFE at 
a distance of 20 nmi from the MLS reference datum both along the extended runway 
centerline and at an azimuth angle of 40 deg. Also the DMUN error at the limits of 
MLS coverage is consistent with the DMUN 0.2 nrni system accuracy. The CMN is 
the linear equivalent of the 0.1 deg azimuth angle CMN. 
        (2) PFE corresponds to azimuth angular error; CMN is approximately the linear 
equivalent of the O. 1 deg azimuth angle CMN. 
       (4) Equivalent to radar altimeter performance for 3 deg glide path. The 30 m PFE 
corresponds to a 1.5 m vertical error for a 3 deg elevation angle. 
       ( 5 )  Flare initiation begins in the vicinity of the MLS approach reference datum; 
MLS elevation and DME provide vertical guidance for automatic landing when the 
terrain in front of the runway threshold is uneven. 
       (6) Sensitivity modification or autopilot gain scheduling requirements are not 
strongly dependent on accuracy, 
       (7) it is intended that this specification applies when vertical guidance and sink 
rate for automatic landing are derived from the MLS flare elevation and the DMW 
P. 
       (8) The roll-out accuracy requirement reflects system growth potential. The re- 
quirement is to optimize roll-out deceleration and turn-off so as to decrease runway 
utilization time.

## Iv. Overview O F The Two-Pulsettwo-Mode System

   A major source of accuracy degradation encountered 
in the final phases of the approach and landing operation 
is due to multipath rather than interrogator and 
transponder instrumentation errors. Multipath 
perturbations always occur later in time than the desired 
signal. To minimize these effects, it is desirable to 
threshold the received pulse at a point which has not been 
significantly corrupted by multipath. Therefore, the 
necessary accuracy for DMEíP is achieved by 
thresholding low (about 17 dB below the pulse peak) on 
the leading edge of a fast rise-time pulse. This is in 
contrast to the 50 percent level thresholding and slow 
rise-time pulses used in DME/N. 
   By achieving enhanced accuracy in this manner, 
questions are raised concerning the interoperability 
constraints noted above. First, the use of a low threshold 
level impacts transmitter power in the sense that more 
power is required to obtain an adequate threshold-to-noise 
level throughout the coverage volume.* At the same time, 

a fast rise-time pulse is desired. These two requirements 
are in conflict with the need to satisfy the adjacent 
channel (spillover) specifications. Hence both the pulse 
rise time and the maximum range at which the low 
threshold technique can be used must be restricted. 
Second, conventional interrogators are calibrated 
assuming that transponder reply delay timing is based on 
the 50-percent threshold level. However, transponder 
reply delay initiation based on low-level thresholding of a 
conventional DME pulse will be different from that based 
on the 50-percent points. Thus, if a conventional 
interrogator were to interrogate a DME/P transponder 
which used only the low-level threshold technique. an 
interoperability error (actually a bias) could occuf as 
described in Section II. 
   The two-pulse/two-mode technique solves the 
interoperability problem by providing two modes of 
operation, a wideband final approach (FA) modeand a 
narrowband initial approach (IA) mode. The FA mode 
utilizes the low thresholding technique for ranges to 7 
nmi from the transponder. By reducing the FA mode 
coverage range from 22 to 7 nmi, the adjacent channel 
power constraints on the transponder can be satisfied 
while an adequate threshold-to-noise ratio can be 
maintained throughout this region. Beyond 7 nmi, the IA 
mode is used, and its operation is identical to that of 
DMEIN. (In addition, a transition between the two modes 
is provided in the 7 to 8 nmi region, which is discussed 
below.) Therefore, in the IA mode no DMEIN 
interoperability bias error occurs because both the 
interrogator and the transponder threshold on the 50- 
percent pulse levels. Further, use of the 50-percent 

   2A low threshold-to-noise ratio can cause pulse amval time 
measurement anomalies which induce noisy range error measurements. 
At threshold-to-noise levels of 12 dB or more these effects are 
insignificant when, in addition, a pulse width discriminator is employed. 
When these conditions are satisfied, the magnitude of the receiver noise 
errors is simply inversely proportional to the signal-to-noise voltage 
-alio.

  threshold allows an adequate threshold-to-noise ratio to be 
   inaintaincd to the covcruge limit of 21 nmi. The 
   interrogation niode is determined by the transponder 
  through the interrogation code, with transponder reply 
  delay timing based on the proper threshold point for the 
  type of interrogation received. Within a channel 
  assignment, the reply code remains the same regardless of 
  the type of interrogation. Both the DMEIP and the 
  revised DME/N SARPs require range measurements on 
  the first pulse. This avoids the effects of first pulse 
  multipath echos which can disturb range measurements 
  predicated on second pulse timing. 

DME/P IA and FA mode functions can be included in 

an interrogator package also having the conventional 
enroute capability. On the other hand, some users may 
elect to implement only the IA mode such that the 
combination would yield in effect an enhanced DME/N 
having increased accuracy and all of the additional DME/ 
P channels. 

## Dme Operation With The 2-Pulsei2-Mode Technique

   Operation of DME/P based on the two-pulse/two- 
mode technique can be summarized as in Fig. 2, where 
an X-channel example is shown. An aircraft located 8 to 
22 nmi from the transponder interrogates with the IA 
mode interrogation code ( 
                        12 ks) at a rate of 40 
interrogationh for search and 1
                             6
                              Hz 
                                  for track. 

An aircraft within 7 nmi of a DME/P transponder 

obtains precision range information by using FA mode 
interrogations at 40 Hz. These interrogations are 
identified by the X-channel code of 18 ps. Receipt of this 
code at the transponder causes the incoming waveform to 
be thresholded low. 
   The FA mode replies use the same code as the IA 
mode replies, which is 12 ps for the X-channel example. 
In the FA mode, both the interrogator and the transponder 
process received signals in a 3.5 to 4.5 
                                        MHz bandwidth. 
The wide bandwidth is required to ensure that the pulse 
leading edge is essentially linear in the threshold region. 
   Aircraft control requires on the order of five data 
samples each second. Clearly, with an FA mode 
interrogation rate of 40 Hz, more than enough data are 
available. Thus raw range measurements can be filtered 
to reduce the effects of noise, multipath. instrumentation- 
induced measurement errors, and missing data. 
   In the 7 to 8 nmi region, an ?approaching? 
interrogator transmits in both IA and FA modes to effect 
a smooth transition to?the FA mode by 7 nmi. In the 
event that no FA mode replies are received, the 
interrogator will remain in the IA mode with a warning 
indication to the pilot. Section X provides additional 
details on signal acquisition and ?track.? 

## V. Pulse Shape

The conventional DME uplink waveform .has been designed **for** use in a limited part of the L-band which 

results in a channel separation of 1 MHz. The waveform 
can be approximated by a cos2/ cos? envelope.3 Its 
nominal rise time is 2500 ns. The puise shape must 
satisfy two conditions. it must he sufficiently constrained 
in bandwidth to concentrate the energy within the I MHz 
channel, and it must have an appropriate rise time to 
provide accurate timing measurements to determine range 
as specified by the DME/N SARPs. 
    On the other hand, the DME/N downlink waveform 
rise time is not carefully controlled so that inexpensive 
pulse modulators can be used in the interrogator. 
Therefore the DME/N requires a Ferris Discriminator in 
the ground tran~ponder.~ 
                            This is the reason that the 
downlink adjacent channel specification is a relative 
rather than absolute requirement as is the case for the 
uplink transmissions. For the uplink transmissions, the 
pulse shape is carefully controlled as noted so that Ferris 
Discriminators are not required in the interrogator. 
    In the DME/P, however, wideband signal processing 
is necessary to achieve the uplink and downlink accuracy; 
therefore, Ferris Discriminators or their equivalent are 
required in the interrogator as?well as the ground 
transponder. 

Moreover, in order tq satisfy the OR (Section Ill) the 

selected puise shape for DME/P must satisfy the ICA0 
DME/N adjacent channel interference specification (see 
Table III). 
   The puise shape for DME/P IA mode operation may 
be identical to that used in DME/N if its rise time is 
constrained to be less than 1200 ns. For the FA mode, a 

Cos?/cos? means that the leading pulse edge is shaped as cos? and 

the trailing pulse edge is shaped as cos?. This convention also applies to 
the cos/cos? waveform. 
   Thannel selectivity is achieved by employing a narrowband filter 
(400 kHz) whose output declares the presence of an interrogation in 
concert with a wideband filter whose output is gated only when there is 
also in coincidence a valid output from the narrow bandwidth filter. 
That is, the output of thc narrowband filter must exceed a predetermined 
output level of the wideband filter for an ?on-channel? interrogation to 
be declared. In DME engineering circles. this circuit configuration is 
called the Ferris Discriminator which was named after its originator. Hal

fast, linear rise time is needed in the vicinity of the 
precision thresholding level. A fast rise time is required 
to permit thyeshold as soon as possible after pulse arrival 
while ensuring that the threshold point remains above the 
5-percent points on the leading edge of the pulse. 
    The most severe restriction is the transponder power 
which is limited to an absolute adjacent channel level. On 
the other hand, the transmitted signal power must be such 
that an adequate threshold-to-noise ratio throughout the 
FA mode coverage volume is maintained. 
    A pulse shape which satisfies these requirements for 
the FA mode is the cos/cos2 pulse shown in Fig. 3. This 
shape is used by both the interrogator and the 
transponder. The pulse is specified to have a 10-90 
percent rise time less than or equal to 1200 ns. Between 
the 0.05 and 0.30 amplitude levels, the pulse partial rise 

time is specified to be 250 I 
                                50 ns with an essentially 
constant (linear) slope. The slope in this region is not to 
vary more than 20 percent from its average value which 
is determined by connecting the 5 and 30 percent 
amplitude points. The pulsewidth, as in DME/N is 
nominally 3.5 ps. Detection of an "on" frequency pulse 
is readily achieved by this pulsewidth because 90 percent 
of the pulse energy is confined to within +- 200 kHz of 
the center frequency.

must be detected. Envelope detection is used in DME 
the phase information is discarded. 
  Methods for estimating the pulse time-of-arrival 
(TOA) must satisfy both accuracy specifications and the 
power budget requirements appropriate to the aircraft 
class. Tradeoffs are then necessary for satisfactory 
performance taking the following into account: (a) noise, 
(b) lateral specular multipath, (c) signal amplitude and 
rise-time variations, (d) threshold-to-noise anomalies2, 
and (e) circuit parameter variations. 
  In general, emphasis on noise performance is 
counterproductive to good multipath resistance. However, 
matched filter designs are not necessary because, as 
shown in Table X, the system noise performance is well 
within the system error budgets given in Table VI. 
Therefore, wide bandwidth signal processing is preferred 
so as to obtain the necessary multipath discrimination. 
This means, given the constraints described earlier, the 
TOA measurement must be made on the pulse leading 
edge. Since the operating environment produces high 
levels of ground multipath interference, the leading edge 
threshold technique must not be sensitive to signal 
strength dependent errors (see Table XI). 
  A TOA technique which satisfies these conditions for 
the FA mode is the delay, attenuate, and compare circuit 
(DAC). This circuit compares a delayed version of the 
pulse to an attenuated version of the same pulse. Pulse 
arrival is declared when the delayed signal exceeds the 
attenuated signal. A delay of 100 ns and an attenuation of 
from - 
     5 to - 
          6 dB will result in a nominal threshold 
level 15 to 18 dB below the pulse peak (see Table X). 
These values are a compromise between good multipath 
performance and noise anomalies. Note t5at the delay and 
compare parameters must always be chosen such that the 
threshold crossing occurs during the partial rise time. 
   The key characteristic of the DAC is that for a linear 
leading edge pulse, the threshold time relative to the start 
of the pulse is independent of the pulse rise time and 
amplitude. It is for this reason that the DME/P precision 
pulse shape specification requires that the pulse leading 
edge be linear in the threshold region. Thus rise-time 
variations within the SARPs specification and amplitude 
variations that result from signal power and propagation 
effects do not induce TOA estimation errors when a DAC 
processor is used. General design relations for DAC are 
given in Fig. 4, as is an example design. 

Table IV gives the maximum peak power allowed for 

a coslcos2 pulse by the adjacent channel interference 
specification. The transponder effective radiated power 
(ERP) is determined by the lowest value allowed in the 
table. For example, using a coslcos2 pulse with 100 ns 
rise time, the allowed ERP is 479 W. 

## Vi. Pulse Time Of Arrival Estimation Technique

DAC technique is amazingly straightforward for 
waveforms which are linear in the partial rise-time 
region. To appreciate this, note that the SARPs defines 
the transponder delay using the notion of the "virtual 
origin." It is the point at which the straight line through 
the 30 percent and 5 percent amplitude points on the 
pulse leading edge intersects the O 
                                 percent amplitude axis. 
Thus the delay between the interrogation pulse and the 
reply pulse for a DAC detection circuit is the time 
interval between the virtual origins of the two pulses. 
Most remarkably, the DAC parameters in the

## Vii. Channel Plan

   DME/N utilizes 252 channels (denoted x and y) using 
L-band frequency pairs and two pulse pair spacing codes 
(denoted X and u
               )
                .
                  
                  The frequency allocations are spaced 

1 MHz apart with the uplink and downlink frequency 
pairs of each channel spaced 63 MHz apart. Specific 
channels are presently used for enroute navigation and 
instrument landing system (ILS) operations. 

Additional channels are needed to accommodate the 

pairing of DME/P with the 200 MLS angle channels. 
Since no new frequency allocations are available in L- 
band, the extra channel capability is provided by 
additional pulse code multiplexing. Associated with each 
DME/P channel are two interrogation codes and a single 
reply code. The two interrogation codes allow the 
transponder to discriminate between IA and FA mode 
interrogations as noted previously. These codes are 
summarized in Table V. 

The complete table of channel frequencies and codes 

channel assignment plan was assessed against a worst 
case traffic loading environment. This assessment 
assumed that the system efficiency would never be less 
than 50 percent, given an FA mode transponder reply 
efficiency of 80 percent. Another cónsideration was to 
pair the uplink codes with the uplink frequencies so that 
all codes are spaced at least 12 ps apart. Existing DMEI 
N interrogators with r+ 6 ps decoder apertures can 
therefore successfully operate without interference from 
the new channelseS 
   Several principies govern the design of the DME 
channel plan. Ground facility channel assignments are 
made so that a given uplink free space desired-to- 
undesired (DIU) 
                signal ratio is satisfied at any point in 
the service volume. The specific free space Diu criterion 
is chosen such that an effective DIU of 8 dB is achieved 
in the interrogator when its frequency and code rejection 
capabilities are considered. In this case, the undesired 
signal level is the peak power from another ground 
facility. 
   Frequency assignment rules are based on both the 
spectrum of the ground system transmitted waveform and 
the airborne interrogator receiver frequency rejection 
characteristic as summarized in Figure 6. Ground system 
specifications limit the radiated sidelobe power to an 
absolute levei of 200 mW on the first adjacent channel 
and 2 mW on the second adjacent channel. Thus, for a 
facility with a 43 dBW ERP, the first adjacent channel 
will be 50 dB down with respect to the on channel signal. 
The interrogator frequency rejection characteristics 
(whether achieved by IF filtering or by the use of a Ferris 
Discriminator) are such that the undesired main lobe 
ground transmission is attenuated at least 50 dB. 

is given in [SI. The DMEIP-related additions to the 
existing channel pian are such that they provide an 
optimum pairing between MLS C-band angle and L-band 
range channels. They do not interfere with present DME 
services while minimizing the potential for DME garble 
interference. A major concern was the traffic loading 
effects of candidate channel pians on puise garble 
interference which is directly proportional to the number 
of pulse code-multiplexed channels that are defined on 
each frequency. The selected channel pian minimizes 
these interference effects by spreading the number of 
channels over a larger number of frequencies without 
incurring any meaningful degradation of existing or 
planned DMEIN enroute services. The channel plan was 
designed therefore to ensure that channel assignments 
could be made in extremely dense environments such as 
those that have been postulated for the Northeast and 
Southwest United States. Furthermore, the selected

all signals greater than 900 kHz reiiioved from the desired 
channel nominal frequency, and a (2) decoder which will 
not trigger the transponder for all signals less than 75 dB 
above the minimum receiver sensitivity level with the 
received pulse pair 2 2  
                       microseconds removed from the 
nominal channel code spacing. 

Reference I 
           1 O] specifies that all interrogators satisfy this 
requirement. 
   For undesired ERP levels (Pu) >43 dBW. the 
frequency assignment process is governed by the main 
lobe of the radiated signal. This results from the fact that 
even after the 50 dB rejection by the interrogator 
receiver. the main lobe signal will be larger than the 
sidelobe signal in the interrogator receiver. This dictates 
the need for a free space DtU > -42 dB to achieve the 
required post processing 8 dB Diu protection. For 
undesired ERP levels <43 dBW, it is the sidelobes of the 
radiated signal which dominate in the interrogator 
receiver. in this case, a free space DIU = -(Pu - 1 )  is 
then required to insure the desired 8 dB post processing 
DIU. The code assignment criterion requires a -42 dB 
free space DIU and is based on an interrogator decoder 
specification that requires at least 50 dB rejection of 
received signals with pulse spacings more than 12 ps 
from the nominal code spacing. Reference [ 15) provides 
additional channel assignment details. 
   With these design principles. the uplink assigned 
codes are on an equal footing with respect to the uplink 
frequency assignments. That is. cofrequency off-code 
channels are re.jected as effectively as cocode off- 
frequency assignments. The new SARPs airborne decoder 
tolerances for both the DME/N and DMEíP decoder 
apertures have been tightened to 2 2  
                                    p.s. Because Ferris 
Discriminators are necessary, DME/P interrogators reject 
off-frequency channels at least 50 dB. Therefore, in 
DME/P, the off-frequency channels have the sanie 
rejection characteristics as the off-code channels. 

The above discussion applies only to the first adjacent 

    System efficiency is defined as the percentage ratio of 
valid replies processed by the interrogator in response to 
its own interrogations. It is an important parameter 
because system accuracy must be achieved at the 
interrogator when all of the expected reply samples are 
not present. Therefore. the interrogator output filter must 
be designed such that the effects of the niicsing data are 
minimized. System efficiency is not critical to the DME/ 
N; only the transponder reply efficiency must be 
considered because the DME/N requires narrowband 
signal processing (less than 1 .O MHz). In the DME/P. 
system efficiency is critical because wideband signal 
processing is necessary to achieve thc accuracy. System 
efficiency is the combined effect of downlink garble, 
ground transponder dead time, uplink garble, and 
interrogator signal processor efficiency. Since each of 
these efficiency components are statistically independent. 
they can be computed individually and then combined to 
yield the overall system efficiency. The effect of a single 
component is defined as the percentage ratio of valid 
replies processed by the interrogator in response to its 
own interrogations assuming all other components are not 
present. The system efficiency is then the product of the 
individual components which must exceed the 50-percent 
SARPs requirement. A valid reply is a pulse pair whose 
first pulse range measurement falls within the interrogator 
range gate t, and whose second pulse falls within the 
decoder aperture, Idc.. 
   There are two garble interference mechanisms of 
interest, DME and non-DME. The DME garble is simply 
due to the effects of other DME equipment operating in 
the surrounding environment. Non-DME components are. 
for example, those caused by the joint tactical 
information distribution system (JTIDS). Non-DME 
garble effects are beyond the scope of this paper and are 
not discussed further. 
   The interference rate due to garble is dependent upon 
the channel assignment plan. traffic loading, and the 
ground transponder and interrogator receiver bandwidths. 
Because the FA mode has a wider receiver bandwidth 
than the IA mode, it is more susceptible to interference. 
These factors have been accommodated in the DME/P 
system definition and normally do not require special 
consideration by the using authority. 
   Worst case traffic loading for an interrogator in the 
FA mode occurs at the extremes of coverage (7 to 8 nmi 
transition region at 2000 ft altitude) and the runway 
rollout region. In the 7 nmi region, the loading is over 

channel. For the cocode second adjacent channel, the 
rejection would be - 
                     70 dB, where the additional 20 dB 
arises from the fact that the second adjacent power cannot 
exceed 2 mW. 
   For the downlink transmissions the off-code and off- 
frequency signal rejection requirements are based upon u 
ground transponder equipped with both a (

contributions at this point are not significant when 
combined with the downlink loading on a root-sum-

signal or in TOA measurement errors. The garble can be 
on-channel interference from aircraft in the same service 
volume or it can be interference from aircraft whose 
interrogations are within the bandwith of the serving 
transponder. This undesired air-to-ground loading is a 
function of the number of interrogating aircraft in the 
vicinity of the serving transponder and the corresponding 
distribution of interrogation frequencies and signal 
amplitudes received at the transponder. The downlink

## Uplink Dme Garble

by the Ferris Discriminator when the desired DME signal 
is not present, off-frequency pulse interference will cause 
garble because the desired signal "opens" the wideband 
gate over the time interval for which the desired signai is 
present. 

   Uplink garble occurs when valid replies at the 
interrogator are interfered with by other transponders with 
different service volumes and results in loss of signal or 
pulse in TOA measurement errors./ The garble can be 
interference from any transponder whose frequency is 
within the bandwidth of the interrogator, including those 
on the same frequency, but with different pulse coding. 
This undesired ground-to-air loading is a function of the 
number of transponders in the vicinity of the interrogator 
and the corresponding distribution of reply frequencies 
and signal amplitudes received at the interrogator. The 
uplink garble efficiency can be estimated using the P,!:

## Transponder Reply Efficiency

   The transponder will not respond to interrogations 
following a reply transmission for a period called the 
transponder dead time (nominally, 60 ~ s ) .  
                                           In addition, 
the receiver design may not permit interrogations to be 
received when the transponder is transmitting (typically 
10 p). 
        The ratio of transponder replies to valid 
interrogations is called the transponder reply efficiency,

      Equations for estimating Prrply 
                                     are given in 
Appendix C .  

## Interrogator Processor Efficiency

   The interrogator signal processor efficiency (Pp,w) 
                                                        is 
the ratio of the number of replies processed by the 
interrogator to the number of interrogations in the absence 
of garble and transponder dead time effects. This 
efficiency depends on the reply pulse threshold level and 
the receiver noise level. Reference (81 assumed PprOc 
                                                      = 
0.95. 

## Accuracy Degradation In The Presence Of Garble

The garble error component can be estimated 

experimentally or by computer simulation. If computer 
simulation is used, the actual interrogator signal 
processing design must be modeled. Estimates using 
analytic approximations are, in general. not adequate. 
The DME/P CMN garble error components, using the 
worst case traffic loading defined in Appendix A, is less 
than 2.5 m for the FA mode and 1 m for the 1A mode. 
Values of 6 m were used in Table VI. For the DME/N, 
garble effects are not an important accuracy 
consideration. 

## Ix. Multipath

   The single most important DME/P approach and 
landing performance index is the system's resistance to 
leading edge distortion by multipath. Without a multipath 
solution, the DME/P would not be viable. Interestingly 
enough, using the solution of low thresholding on the

pulse leading edge, the muhipath error component can be 
constrained to a value comparable to the equipment 
instrumentation errors. (See Table Vi.) Multipath was not 
a concern with the DME/N because the accuracy 
allowance is 10 to 50 times that allowed for the DMEíP. 
Moreover, for the enroute application, the multipath has a 
long delay time (which affects principally the second 
pulse) rather than the short delay multipath (less than 1 
ps) encountered in the aircraft approach and landing 
maneuver. 

Specular Multipath (FA Mode) 

   Specular multipath is produced by scatterers which are 
sufficiently large (e.g., a substantial fraction of a Fresnel 
zone) to yield a reflection level within about 10 dB of the 
direct signal. Example sources include sizable buildings, 
wide-body aircraft, and vehicles near the transponder. 
   Specular multipath is characterized by four 
parameters: the relative strength of the reflected to the 
direct signal (MID ratio), the relative delay of the 
reflected to the direct signal, the relative RF phase of the 
reflected and direct signals, and the rate of change of 
relative phase (scalloping frequency). Given these 
parameters and the pulse time of arrival estimation 
technique, the specular multipath effects in the runway 
threshold region can be calculated. Figs. 10 and 11 
estimate the multipath performance for a DAC-trigger 
technique. The results are consistent with the accuracy 
specification in Table V1 for the FA mode. 
   The ground and airborne pulse arrival time 
measurement circuits are designed to prevent large 
specular multipath errors along the extended runway 
center line. This is accomplished in a manner similar to 
the angle components of the MLS [ 181. That is, the puise 

This error component was included in the error budget

a high spatial frequency content, then another rnultipath 
control opportunity is available. When the aircraft flies 
through this field. high frequency temporal error 
components (scalloping rate > 10 radls) may be 
generated which can be reduced by the interrogator output 
data filter. Fig. 11 illustrates, for the given geometry. the 
region where the multipath error components will be 
filtered. Reference [SI 
                         discusses additional multipath 
control techniques which are applicable to those few sites 
where multipath exceeds - 3  dB in the region where the 
scalloping frequency is < 1

                                rad/s. 

## Diffuse Multipath **(Fa** And Ia Modes)

Diffuse multipath is produced by a "collection" of 
smaller objects (i.e., small relative to the Fresnel zone 
radius in at least one dimension) which individually yield 
very low level reflections (e.g.. 30 dB below the direct 
signal level). but which may be significant as a group due 
to the large number and disposition of such scatterers. 
Examples include boulders, posts. approach lights, ocean 
waves, trees, and small buildings or aircraft. As viewed 
by the receiver, diffuse multipath in flight (test) error 
traces appear noiselike and will be reduced by the 
interrogator output filter. 
    Analytical and experimental work I 
                                       I 1. 121 indicates 
that the diffuse multipath component will be satisfactorily 
bounded by the allocation shown in Table VI. Flight test 
traces have shown diffuse multipath error components to 
be less than 3 m [ 131. 

## Specular Multipath **(Ia** Mode)

   Multipath performance for the IA mode may be 
different than that encountered in the FA mode because 
the TOA measurement threshold is much later on the 
pulse and thus the system is more sensitive to long-delay 
muhipath. The critical range is 7 nmi because the error 
allowance is-most stringent at that range. Fortunately. 
however, the approach geometry is such that the aircraft 
is above most of the severe multipath. Studies indicate 
that at most runways along the runway centerline 
extended (<20 degrees), the MID is less than -6 dB. 
More severe conditions may exist on the wide radials (30 
to 40 deg). For these rare cases, special multipath control 
measures are available which will minimize the multipath 
interference at wide angles (see [ 5 ] ) .  

## X. Signal Processing

   Several signal processing techniques are key to the 
implementation of DME/P and are utilized in both the 
interrogator and the transponder. These signal processing 
functions deal with receiver bandwidth, signal 

arrival time decision point is chosen to be less than the 
shortest multipath delay time associated with large 
obstacles around the runway. The multipath delay times 
are determined by the runway obstacle clearance surfaces. 
Obstacles such as hangars which are located so that they 
conform to the obstacle clearance surfaces typically 
generate large multipath reflections having delays in 
excess of 300 ns. Fig. I I is a plot of constant delay 
ellipses over the runway. Such plots can be used to 
estimate the multipath delay. Computer simulations and 
experimental measurements have shown that 
representative signal processors will not be susceptible to 
multipath with delays in excess of 300 ns (see Fig. IO). 
Multipath environment studies and field measurements 
[ I l ,  121 suggest that high-level multipath with delay less 
than 300 ns will occur at less than 1
                                      0
                                        percent of the 
runways. In addition, if the multipath delays are less than 
300 ns. most of these reflections will be less than -3 
dB. Under this - 
                   3 dB multipath assumption, the errors 
will be bounded at about 10M for DAC parameters of 
100-ns delay and - 5  dB to -6 dB attenuation values. 

If the interference field generated by the multipath has 

   Thresholding low in the pulse leading edge with a 
DAC has disadvantages because receiver noise may be 
mistaken for a valid pulse. However, because of the wide 
receiver bandwidth, the average duration of the noise 
bursts are much shorter than the nominal 3.5 ps DME 
pulse width. Therefore, a pulsewidth discriminator is 
employed to reject the noise puise. A pulsewidth criterion 
of 2 PS 
       or more is sufficient to discriminate between 
valid DME and noise pulses. Also. to discriminate 
against non-DME interference, it is suggested that the 
discriminator limit the length of puises accepted for 
processing to less than 6 ps. 

identification and validation. and pulse detection. For 
those familiar with DMEYN range measurement 
techniques, the complexity of the signal processing 
circuits described in this section for DME/P may appear 
to represent one hardware concept among many 
possibilities. It needs to be emphasized that the concepts 
described in this section are fundamental and are 
necessary in one form or another to achieve the required 
accuracy in most approach and landing situations. Fig. 12 
summarizes the DME/P signal processing concepts 
described in this section, and Fig. 13 summarizes the 
pulse interference environment which necessitates the 
signal processing concept addressed in the following 

## Additional Interrogator Signal Processing

Range Dota Processing Algorithm. 

                                 The SARPs 
accuracy specifications, as well as the error budgets 
discussed in Section XI, assume that the higher frequency 
noise contributions are limited by an interrogator output 
data filter as defined in Fig. 12. Depending upon the 
user's application, additional filtering for noise reduction 
can be used provided that the induced phase delay does 
not adversely affect the aircraft flight control system's 
dynamic response. A single pole filter provides 
approximately a 2.8 noise reduction factor at 40 Hz and 
1.8 at 16 Hz. At 1.5 radh and 40 Hz data rate, the phase 
delay is approximately 4.0 deg. The noise reduction 
factor is given by 

## Signal Identification And Validation

For a single-pole filter or an alpha-beta filter, the noise 
bandwidth is 7r/2 x (3 dB bandwidth). The noise 
reduction factor is always valid because the interrogation 
PRF is purposely jittered to convert deterministic errors 
into pseudorandom errors.

   One function of the DMEYP signal processing is to 
identify and validate received DME signals. Three 
charactenstics of the DME signal (RF frequency, puise 
pair code, pulsewidth) are used to perform this function. 
Valid outputs from the Ferris Discriminator and the pulse 
decoder detemine the operating channel. The width of 
the DME pulse is used to discriminate a valid pulse from 
those due to noise which are of short duration.

other functions; prediction of missing data samples and 
limiting of measurement values which would otherwise 
deviate significantly from their predicated value. 
   When the system efficiency is less than 100 percent. 
replies will not be received for all interrogations. To 
"coast" through periods of missing data, the data filter 
algorithm replaces the missing samples with predictions 
based on past velocity data. A filter with velocity 
memory is the alpha-beta filter 15, 161. An alpha-beta 
filter which satisfies CTOL FA mode applications is one 
in which (Y = 0.125 and ß = 0.008. The noise reduction 
factor for this filter is 3.3. This filter will satisfy the 
"not-to-exceed'' aircraft flight control phase delay 
requirement of 6 deg. That is, at i .5 rad/s. the phase 
delay is only -4.6 deg. The filter design assumes a 40 
Hz data rate [ 51. 

The final function of the data processing algorithm is 

   The DME-P system accuracies are specified in terms 
of path following error (PFE) and control motion noise 
(CMN). These parameters describe the interaction of the 
DME/P guidance signal with the aircraft in terms directly 
related to aircraft position errors and flight control system 
design. 
   For the purposes of determining compliance with the 
accuracy standard, the PFE and CMN components are 
evaluated over any 10 s measurement interval of the FA 
mode flight error record taken within the DME/P 
coverage limits. The measurement interval for the IA 
mode is 40 s. The 95 percent probability requirement is 
interpreted to be satisfied if the PFE and CMN 
components do not exceed the specified error limits for a 
total period that is more than 5 percent of the evaluation 
interval. This is illustrated in Fig. 14. 

to limit the raw measurement deviations from the 
predicted values. If it is assumed that the output of the 
data filter is close to the true-range. then significant 
deviations (e.g., 46M for FA mode) from the predicted 
range are physically unrealistic in terms of aircraft 
response and can therefore be removed. This process is 
called data "outlier rejection." If the rejected sample is 
replaced by a predetermined value, the entire algorithm is 
called a "slew-rate limiter. " 
                                    The outlier window width 
and the slew-rate limit value are determined by the error 
budget associated with the user application (Table I) and 
the data filter noise reduction factor. The values chosen 
in Table IX remove the extreme FA mode garble and 
noise error components ( -C 46 meters) and replace them 
with the slew-rate limit values of 6 m. This design 
essentially limits the CMN to the CTOL Standard One 
Accuracy as given in Table VI. The ? 
                                                 6 meter slew-rate 
limit permits the DMUP 
                                to successfully track all CTOL 
maneuvers. 

Interrogation Rate Jitter. 

Signof Acqitisition. 

                                                 It is common practice in 
DME to "jitter" the interrogator PRF to preclude the 
occurrence of synchronous interference between 
interrogating aircraft. This jittering process has the 
additional effect of reducing the aliased spectrum peaks 
such that sampled frequency components outside the filter 
passband are uncorrelated. This means that sinusoidal 
type multipath components appear noiselike to the filter 
and are, therefore, attenuated as prescribed by the filter 
noise reduction factor g. 
      A jitter rate of 6 p s  rms (uniform distribution) for a 
40 Hz 
           average PRF will satisfy the requirement that all 
multipath scalloping frequencies outside the filter 
passband will be equally attenuated. 
                                        For the IA and FA mode the 
interrogator must acquire and validate the reply signal 
within 2 s. After loss of the acquired signal the 
interrogator must provide a warning output within one 
second for the FA mode and IO s for the IA mode. After 
loss of the signal the interrogator must return to the IA 
mode signal acquisition condition in order to reestablish 
track in either mode. 

   To evaluate the PFE and CMN components of the 
DME/P guiäance data, the true aircraft position, as- 
determined by a suitable position reference, is subtracted 
from the guidance data to form an error signal. This error 
signal is then filtered by the PFE and CMN filters, where 
the outputs provide suitable estimates of the PFE and 
CMN components, respectively. These filters are defineá 
in Fig. 14. 
                       Ø
                        -

                                                            \ 

   This technique can also be utilized to determine the 
transponder instrumentation error components where the 
guidance data is replaced with transponder time delay 
measurements. Similarly, the interrogator instrumentation 
error components can also be determined with this 
technique. 

## Xii. Dme Error Budgets

   For the purpose of facility planning and equipment 
procurement specifications. the system PFE and CMN 
can be partitioned into instrumentation errors and site- 
dependent errors. An allowance must be made for each of 
the error sources described earlier. Such error budgets are 
traditionally not readily available for the DMElN. 
Further, no distinction is made between noise (CMN) and 
bias (PFE) and the various multipath components. The 
revised DMEIN SARPs specifies an 0.2 nnii system error 
with instrumentation errors of 0.04 nmi for the 
transponder and 0. 
                   17 nmi for the interrogator. Combining 
the error components on a root sum of squares (rss) basis, 
the site-related errors are allocated 0.09 nmi. Reference 
161 specifies an O. 1 nmi interrogator instrumentation 
error. These numbers are interpreted as 95 percent 
probability values. 
   Table VI is the error budget recommended for 
guidance by ICAO for the DMEIP. The itemized error 
components are to be satisfied on a 95 percent probability 
basis. Since the "site-related" PFE components are 
statistically independent, their combined effect can be 
derived by forming the rss of the error estimates. 
Similarly, the ground airborne instrumentation errors can 
also be rss'd. Howeveï, the site-dependent PFE may not 
be rss'd with the instrumentation errors because, in 
general, they may be partially correlated. In any event, 
the combined instrumentation and site-related error 
components cannot exceed the system accuracy standard. 
All the CMN components can be combined on an rss 
basis because they are statistically independent. 
Moreover, if the specified error components are not 
individually exceeded in practice, it can be expected that 
the overall system performance will be achieved. 
   Table VI is the DME/P error budget provided for 
guidance by ICAO. To be useful, an error budget should 
have a simple procedure for combining the individual 
components. If the error sources are additive independent 
random variables with zero mean, they can be combined 
on an rss basis. Although these conditions are not strictly 
fulfilled at all runways, past experience indicate that 
reasonable estimates can be achieved by rss'ing the site 
related Components and rss'ing the ground and airborne 
instrumentation errors as shown in Table VI. The 
combination of the site related components with the 
instrumentation errors cannot exceed the overall system 
errors given in Table II. In summary, if the specified 
error components are not individually exceeded in 
practice, it can be expected that the overall system 
performance will be achieved. For additional information, 
see [19].

( - 
    89 dBW/m2), thus ensuring interoperability between 
the DME/P and the DME/N. Table X contains an 
estimate of the noise error contribution to the 
instrumentation CMN budget. As seen in Table X, the I A  
mode is not the limiting power budget consideration 
because the -6 dB threshold PAF is used. It is the FA 
mode for which consideration must be given. See Table 
Vil for the roll-out maneuver. For a video SNR = 28 dB 
the CMN component is less than 7 m (95 percent 
probability). The reason for the low SNR on roll-out is 
the 22 dB multipath and antenna pattern attenuation due 
to the minimum aircraft antenna height of 2.4 m. (See 
Table XI.) Reference [5] derives simple noise error 
estimation formulas which are valid for high SNR. 

   Tables VI1 and Vil1 are the DME/P CTOL power 
budgets as defined in [8]. The permitted transponder 
effective radiated power ERP is based upon an 800 
                                                  ns 
cos/cos2 pulse (see Table IV). 
   In the power budget calculations, it is assumed that 
the aircraft antenna will not be shielded by parts of the 
aircraft structure. The receiver sensitivity is the minimum 
signal which satisfies both the reply efficiency and the 
accuracy requirement. In general, however, the sensitivity 
is limited by the receiver CMN error component rather 
than the reply efficiency. Table IX summarizes the 
minimum uplink and downlink power requirements for 
the DME/N and DME/P. As shown, the revised DME/N 
SARPs ERP is equal to that required by the IA mode 

## Xiv. Siting Of Dme

   The DME antenna should be located laterally as close 
                                                                                                5OJJC Dd8V 
to the runway centerline and near the MLS azimuth 
function antenna site as possible, consistent with obstacle 
clearance criteria. The relation of the distance L in back 

of the runway stop where a DME antenna of height H 

must be sited is L = 61 + 50 H, where L and H are in 
meters. Siting of the DME antenna in the vertical 

dimension is dependent on runway length. runway 

profile. and local terrain. These siting factors are 
particularly important when it is necessary to assure that 

threshold region or near the runway surface. Table X
                                                    I

aperture omni antenna, This subject and the antenna 
design are covered in more detail in 151.

## Transponder Monitor

    In DME/P, just as in DME/N, the interrogator and 
transponder are similar in many respects. Both must 
identify valid DME signais using the three discriminators 
of pulsewidth, frequency, and code. 
    The interrogator and transponder differ primarily in 
function. An interrogator must accurately measure a time 
interval. It does so by starting a clock coincident with its 
transmission. The clock is stopped upon reception of the 
reply. The transponder must accurately generate a time 
delay. This is done by starting the time delay clock upon 
receipt of an interrogation. After a fixed time, a reply is 
transmitted. In spite of these functional differences, the 

error mechanisms for both the interrogator and the 
                                                                     Unlike DME/N, DME/P m i i c t  nrnwirlp hioh intporitw

                                                          and secondary. The primary parameters are those which, 
                                                          if in an out-of-tolerance condition, could lead to a

aperture. In the event that a primary parameter exceeds 
its predetermined limits, the transponder is switched off, 
or redundant circuits are switched in, and an appropriate 
indication is provided to the control point. If an FA mode 
primary parameter is exceeded, but an IA mode 
parameter is not, then it is permissible to leave the IA 
mode channel operative. 
   Secondary parameters are those for which a 
maintenance action only is required and are pulse pair 
output rate, partial rise time, and CMN. Since these 
parameters are not critical to flight safety. only an 
indication to the control point need be provided in the 
event that a parameter exceeds its limits. 

## Interrogator

   The functions performed by the interrogator signal 
processing are as follows: (a) identify and validate replies 
to interrogations; (b) derive range measurements from 
synchronous replies; and (c) process data for output to 
displays and the aircraft flight control system. 
   The method used to identify and validate replies to 
interrogations is identical to that used in the transponder. 
In addition to the validation functions, the interrogator 
must perform range correlation of the replies in order to 
determine the range at which synchronous replies are 
received. Once this "search" process is completed and 
the synchronous range is determined, range measurements 
are made using replies received at that range. Finally, as 
discussed in Section IX, the raw measurements are 
filtered to reduce the effects of measurement noise caused 
by instrumentation errors, receiver noise, and multipath. 

Signal acquisition or range correlation can be 

transponder was a modified Cardion conventional 100- 
watt terminal area DME. The airborne interrogator was a 
modified version of a Bendix enroute DME. This 
equipment constituted the range element of the FAA's 
basic wide MLS which was contracted to Bendix. The 
ground station was installed on runway 22 at Wallops 
Station Flight Center, Chincoteague, Va. December 
1979. A laser ground tracker was used within 5 nmi of 
the runway threshold and a beacon tracker was used at 
ranges greater than 5 nmi. The airborne antenna used on 
the FAA's Convair CV-880 was a standard L-band omni 
type. Reference [ 131 describes these field tests in detail. 

## Xvii. Conclusion

accomplished by dividing the covered range into cells. 
Associated with each cell is a counter. Following each 
interrogation. those cells in which replies occur have their 
associated counters incremented. Those cells where no 
reply occurs have the associated counters decremented. 
The counter associared with the cell which corresponds to 
the synchronous range will attain a higher value than the 
others, thereby identifying the synchronous range. 

The major contributor to the interrogator 

instrumentation error is slowly varying circuit parameter 
drifts. These effects are compensated by processing the 
interrogation signal with the same circuitry used to 
process the reply signal. However. as noted in the 
transponder discussion, reply pulse amplitude dependent 
and rise-time dependent delay variations cannot be so 
compensated and therefore must be treated separately.

## Xvi. System **Field** Tests

   Beginning in earnest in iate 1980, ICAO. through 
Working Group M of its All Weather Operations Panel 
(AWOP), has evolved a DME/P system concept around 
which SARPs have been drafted. This work has been 
thorough and was validated at each step by detailed 
system analyses, computer simulations, and bench and 
flight testing. Important considerations, such as the 
effects of intrasystem garbling, have been explored in 
considerable depth, and field measurements at a number 
of operational sites have supported the conclusions 
reached by the working group regarding the robust 
performance to be expected in the airport environment. 
When the AWOP formalized the SARPs activity at its 
ninth meeting, a set of technical standards were available 
with which the international community could continue 
the implementation of a fully integrated MLS capability, 

   The feasibility of the DMBP concept was confirmed 
by a comprehensive FAA field test program.

## Appendix A. Interaction Of Dme/P Signal With Afcs

   In Sections III and XI, the DME/P accuracy 
components are described in terms of PFE and CMN. 
The purpose of this Appendix is to provide the rationale 
for specifying the range measurement in these terms 
rather than the more conventional ones of bias and noise. 
In addition, the development below also explains why the 
CMN tolerance is more restrictive than the PFE 
component. The following discussions are not intended to 
be technically exhaustive, but rather provide general 
insight into the MLS signal/automatic flight control 
system (AFCS) interaction mechanism. 
   The AFCS is a three-axis system having lateral, 
vertical, and longitudinal channels. Inputs to the lateral 
channel are cross-course linear guidance deviations (roll 
axis), which, for coordinated turns deflect the ailerons 
and cause the aircraft to turn left or right. Linear vertical 
deviations are commands to the vertical channel (pitch 
axis) which deflect the aircraft elevators and cause the 
aircraft to fly up or down. Finally, the "along course" 
deviations are longitudinal channel inputs which can 
command the aircraft to speed up or to slow down.6 
   Depending upon the aircraft's orientation with respect 
to the MLS, azimuth, elevation, and DME signals can be 
inputs to any of the channels when properly converted to 
linear path deviations. The precision DME accuracy 
standard must ensure that the DME/P has approximately 
the same operational accuracy as the angle MLS in 
specific portions of the approach path. For example, two 
dimensional (constant altitude) curved and segmented 
approaches may require that the DME/P accuracy be 
equivalent to azimuth guidance cross-course deviations. 
On the other hand, for most straight-in approaches, range 
data will not be required in either the lateral or vertical 
channels of the AFCS. 
   To understand the effect of MLS errors on the landing 
operation, the dynamics of the landing process need to be 
taken into account. Consider the landing operation in the 
context of a sampled data control system, as shown in 
Fig. 17. When specifying the DME/P guidance errors, it 
is necessary to delineate the roles of aircraft guidance and' 
control. In the AFCS and MLS application, two 
fundamental control loops are present. First, a series of 
inner loops involving the feedback of airframe motion 
quantities serve to control the aircraft. The second, an 
outer loop known as the guidance loop, is driven by the 
MLS guidance signals. Two parameters critical in 
specifying a control system are the closed loop bandwidth 
and the loop gain. For most aircrtaft, the guidance loop 
bandwidth is less than 0.5 rad/s for the lateral channel 
and I .5 rad/s for the vertical channel. On the other hand, 
control loop bandwidths typically have comer frequencies 
which lie above 0.3 rad/s and below 10 rad/s. No aircraft 

response of interest lies above 10 rad/s. Error signai 
frequency components which excite the guidance loop are 
called path following errors (PFE). These low-frequency 
error components can displace the aircraft from its 
intended course. 
    Guidance error frequency components which excite 
the control loops are called control motion noise (CMN). 
CMN components fall above the aircraft's guidance loop 
bandwidth and thus are too rapid for the aircraft to 
follow. However, they do affect the control loops and 
may induce aircraft control activity such as aileron and 
cockpit wheel motion as weil as aircraft roll variations. 
This unwanted control activity affects the pilot's 
confidence in both the guidance system and his flight 
control system during autocoupled approaches. 
   The aircraft's capability to track a given course 
depends upon two characteristics of the AFCS: path 
tracking performance and stability. The tracking error is 
the difference between the aircraft position as determined 
by the MLS and the intended course; it does not include 
the MLS PFE which is the difference between the 
aircraft's true position in space and the MLS position 
measurement (see Fig. 18). Assuming good aircraft' 

stability, high autopilot gain (equivalently, wide guidance 
loop bandwidth) results generally in small tracking errors. 
   To stabilize (control) the aircraft requires velocity 
information, e.g., MLS angle rate or DME range rate, 
whose effectiveness is dependent upon the autopilot rate 
gain. High autopilot gains permit the aircraft to respond 
quickly to transient commands. Unacceptable overshoots 
from the derived path must be restricted, however, by 

Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) formed Special 
Committee 151 in January 1983 to develop minimuni 
operational performance standards for airborne MLS '4rea 
Navigation equipment. 
   it should be emphasized again that the DMEiP CMN 
is only a consideration when the application (as defined 
in Table I) requires vertical or lateral guidance using the 
DMEIP, e.g., curved approaches. 

## Appendix B. Dme **Pulse** Interference Environment

choosing the autopilot gain such that the guidance loop 
damping factor is between 0.5 and 0.7.' 
   Damping factors are also a measure of the guidance 
loop's phase margin, which is another way to express the 
stability characteristics of the aircraft guidance loop. 
Phase margins of 30 deg or more are desirable. The 
phase margin is reduced when any element in the aircraft 
guidance loop introduces a delay. One source of phase 
delay is the MLS output data filter (MLS angle filter or 
the DME/P interrogator filter). Although the aircraft loop 
guidance bandwidth for the lateral channel is less than 
0.5 radls, the output filter has a 5 to IO-rad/s bandwidth 
so that its phase delay at 0.5 rad/s is less than 5 to 6 deg. 
Unfortunately. a wideband MLS data filter permits both 
the low frequency guidance signal and undesired high 
frequency noise components (CMN) to be inputs to the 
AFCS. 

As mentioned earlier. CMN has a negative influence 

   As mentioned in Section VIII, the DMEIP pulse 
interference environment is composed of uplink and 
downlink components. However, for the worst case 
analysis only one component dominates, either uplink or 
downlink. For example, if the desired interrogator is at a 
low altitude (final approach 2000 ft), then the downlink is 
critical because the ground transponder is exposed to u
                                                  1
                                                   1
                                                    
the aircraft over a large volume. For the uplink. however. 
the aircraft is not exposed to strong interference from 
many of the transponders because they are limited to line 
of sight and thus their replies are greatly attenuated. The 
situation is reversed when the desired aircraft is at high 
altitude. In summary, only the dominate uplink or 
downlink requires analysis because the other component's 
contribution will be negligible when both are combined 
on an RSS basis. 

upon pilot acceptance factors. Consequently, the 
requirement for good aircraft tracking therefore appears to 
oppose pilot acceptance factor requirements. High gains 
are necessary for accurate tracking. but, at the same time, 
they amplify the CMN components. causing the unwanted 
control activity. Resolution of this difficulty requires the 
CMN to be limited by the system design to a maximum 
of O. I deg everywhere in the MLS coverage sector while 
utilizing an airborne output data filter bandwidth which 
limits the phase delay to 5 or 6 deg (see Section X). 
   It is against this angular error requirement that the 
DME/P CMN accuracy standard (when it is applicable) is 
derived. Since the range information is already linear, it 
is specified to be equivalent to the angular error of O. 1 
deg at all points within the coverage volume. Future tests 
are required to determine whether 0.1 deg is an adequate 
CMN upper limit. Reference 18 provides detailed 
information on CMN and pilot acceptance factors. 
   At the MLS entrance gate, the PFE can be large 
because the aircraft separation standard is large ( &  2 
nmi); however, as the aikraft proceeds toward runway 
threshold, the guidance error must tighten up so that the 
aircraft can comfortably fly through the 100-ft decision 
height window. Thus the PFE can degrade with 
increasing distance from runway threshold by a 10: 
                                                   I 
factor. The situation is different from the CMN 
requirement. For example, it is desirable for the lateral 
channel to maintain a 55-ft tracking error at the 100-ft 
decision height and then allow it to degrade only to about 
100-150 ft at 20 nmi. This means that the autopilot gain 
can be reduced about 2: i. Table 11 is consistent with this 
argument where the DME/P IA mode CMN standard 
permits a 2: I degradation. 
    Since operational procedures and control laws for 
curved approaches are under development, the discussion 
above was directed toward the most restricted curved 
approach scenarios wherein inertial complementation is 
kept to a minimum. To this end, the Radio Technical 

environment used by the ICA0 to develop the DMBP 
channel plan and the 50 percent system efficiency 
specification. These pulse interference rates and 
amplitude levels represent the worst case .downlink 
environment for the FA mode at 7 nmi. Reference 1171 
provides the aircraft traffic loading assumptions upon 
which Table XII was based. Also included in 1171 are the 
garble loading rates at other critical points in the service 
sector such as runway threshold and 22 nmi. The FA 
mode downlink garble induced CMN at 7 n mil was 2.2 
m and the garble efficiency was 97 percent. As 
mentioned above, the uplink garble induced CMN has 
less than a 1. I. m contribution. The rss combination is 2.5 
in. Some uncommon channel assignments may result in 
additional garble error contributions. As noted in Section 
VI1 and Fig. 6, it is permissible to make cofrequency and 
adjacent frequency channel assignments at facilities near a 
DME/P ground station with a DIU = -42 dB. 
Assuming a garble rate of 7200 pulse/s (e&, TACAN 
squitter rate is 3600 pulse paids). the CMN garble 
component is less than 1.5 m for the FA mode and less 
than 4 m for the IA mode. The system efficiency would 
be degraded by less than i2 percent. These contributions 
when rss'd with the previous results are 3 m (FA mode), 
4.1 m (IA mode), and 62 percent for the FA mode 
system efficiency. Therefore, under worst case conditions 
the DME/P garble environment satisfied the SARPs 
specifications. All results were based upon the signal 
processar design defined in Fig. 9. 

   'High damping coefficients of the guidance loop is a necessary but 
not sufficient requirement to avoid undesirable overshoots.

                                            and TNW 
indicate the effect of an interrogation on the opposite 
channel. For the DMEIN transponder, TWw = TWN = O, 
and (2) reduces to the classical reply efficiency relation. 
   Typical values of Tww, 
                             TWN, 
                                   TNw.

        transponder dead time and a 10 psItransmitter 
pulse blanking time. 

   The DMEIP reply efficiency estimation equation is 
not as straightforward as the calculation used currently for 
the DME/N. This is because the ground transponder has 
two channels (IA and F
                      A
                         mode). 
   The mechanism which affects the reply efficiency is 
simple: each interrogation that results in a reply creates a 
period of time during which arriving interrogations will 
not result in replies. This inhibit time is the result of dead 
time gates, reply transmission gates, receiver blanking 
gates, and indirectly, the priority determination technique 
for the replies, squitter, and facility identity pulse. The 
IA and FA reply efficiencies can be estimated using 

$$P_{\rm in}=\frac{I\,+\,(T_{\rm low}-T_{\rm total})\,\,W}{I\,+\,T_{\rm low}N\,+\,T_{\rm low}W\,+\,(T_{\rm low})T_{\rm low}-T_{\rm low}T_{\rm low})\,\,W}$$ (2)

The PFE

Por the purposes of determining compliance with the accuracy standard, the PFE and CMN components are evaluated over each T second interval of the error record (where T=40 seconds in the I
A
 mode and T=10 
seconds in the FA 
m o d e
)
.

 
The 
95% probability requirement is interpreted to be satisfied (on the interval) if the PFE 
and CMN components do not exceed the specified error limits for a total period that is more than 5% of the evaluation time interval (T).

The number of data points required depends on the particular performance parameter to be investigated with the total data collection time adequate to obtain stable statistics.

The PFE

and **D-4** in terms of the discrete time transfer functions together with the corresponding discrete time difference equations, which can be directly implemented in software. Additionally, the frequency response plots of the PFE 
and CMN filters is shown. The filters provide the correct frequency response characteristics when the proper data rates are used: 16

## Sliding Window - Determination Of 95Th Percentiles

accuracy related specifications are in-terms of 95% 
probability limits on an appropriate evaluation interval. Compliance with applicable accuracy specifications is demonstrated by verifying that at least 95% 
of the data points within an evaluation interval have magnitude less than the applicable specification. 

I
f the error signal were Such an analysis is accomplished by applying a sliding window to the absolute value of the PFE (CMN) data stream (which defines the evaluation interval) and determining the value X such that 95% of the data points within the sliding window lie between O and X
.

 
gaussian noise, this would approximate the 2 
sigma error value. 

As each new data point is received (PFE or C
M
N
)
,
 
As an example, consider the FA 
mode case where a 10 second (400 
point) 
sliding window is used. 

its absolute value is placed in the sliding window and the oldest point is discarded. The data in the window is then sorted in ascending order. The 
95th percentile is then the 380th (0.95*400) data point in the sorted sample set. 

A program to implement the sliding window and determine the 95th percentile of the data within that window is described in Figure D-5. 

## Illustration Of Interrogator Error Assessment Method

The interrogator error assessment method is ill-ustrated in Figure D-6, 
- 
D-7, u, and D-9 where the results of the required data processing are detailed for simulated FA 
mode range data in the presence of receiver noise. It is recommended that interrogator accuracy be assessed in a similar manner.

)
, while satisfying the requirements stated in paragraph 
2.3.20. For the examples illustrated here, an alpha/beta filter with the outlier/slew rate limiting is the assumed interrogator data filter (alpha

 mode tests. Compliance with a given specification is demonstrated when 95% 
or more of the data points in each evaluation interval lie between a pair of symmetric limits having magnitude equal to the 95%

not exceed the specification, compliance is confirmed. The 95th percentile is computed by determining the value X such that 95% of the absolute value of the error signal data points within the sliding window lie between O and X. 

limits (t/- 
X) that encompass 95%.of the error samples. 

samples (N is the length of the sliding window) of output from the sliding window processor reflect the initial transient and should be ignored. 

This is the result of filling the sliding window with al1 
new data. The peak 95th percentile observed over the total data collection interval is referred to as the 95th percentile of the error record for the example shown in Figure D-6 
(detailed in Figures D-8 
and - 
D-9), the 95th percentile is 
18 
ns for the CMN component and 13 ns for the PFE 
component. 

## Illustration Of Multipath Performance Test

The effect Due to the presence of instrumentation error (the result of range measurement quantization, receiver noise, e t c
.

)
, the theoretical multipath errors that result from fixed scalloping frequency multipath (Figure D-loa) cannot be readily discerned (Figures D-lob and D-lOc). 

of multipath must then be measured relative to the instrumentation error alone (Figure D-lOd and D-lOe). 

Compliance with the multipath specification is confirmed if the 95th percentile of the "multipath included" data is less than the computed specification limit for the duration of the data collection interval. 

data collection interval should be a minimum of 60 seconds. 

The The computed specification limit is determined by adding the allowed 95% 
multipath error contribution (Paragraph 2.3.1.4) to the peak 95th percentile of the instrumentation error observed over the data collection interval. 

This procedure is illustrated in Figure D-11 
for the FA mode short delay multipath specification for a 30 
second (1200 samples at 40 
Hz interrogation rate) data record. 

## Illustration Of Garble Performance Test

Interrogator performance in the presence of garble is evaluated relative to the PFE/CMN 
obtained in the absence of such interference (i.e., relative to the instrumentation e r r o r
)
.

 
Figures D-12a and D-12b show simulated instrumentation PFE 
and CMN (only the effects of receiver noise have been accounted for) while Figures D-12c and D-12d show the PFE and CMN that result when the effects of a garble environment are included. Figures D-12e and D-12f show the 95th percentile of the PFE/CMN 
with and without the garble environment demonstrating the relative increase in the error quantities when garble effects are included. 

The data collection Compliance with the specification is confirmed if the 95th percentile of the "garble included" data is less than the computed specification limit for the duration of the data collection period. 

period for the garble test should be a minimum of 300 
seconds to insure adequate statistics - i.e., by observing an adequate number of "hits" on the desired signal by pulses which comprise the garble environment. 

The computed specification limit is determined by RSS'ing the 95% 
probability limit with the peak 95th percentile of the instrumentation error. This is illustrated in Figure D-13 
where D-14 
feet (28 
ns) 95% 
probability RSS component has been allocated to the airborne unit.

## Determination Of Interrogator Data Filter Step Response

Determination of the interrogator data filter step response requires that 
(1) the range step be within the interrogator track gate, ensuring that a loss of track does not occur when the test is performed, (
2
)
 the range step be less than the outlier limit (when utilized) to insure that only the linear portion of the interrogator data filter is excited by the range step. 

The filter step response must then be determined by 

Figure D-1a shows both the step input and the theoretical response of an alpha/beta filter (alpha=0.125, beta=0.0078) with outlier/slow rate limiting (300/300 ns) where the input step is less than the outlier limit. When a small step is used, the magnitude of the overshoot and the bandwidth of the light may be masked by the instrumental error as illustrated in Figure D-1a for any sample size, the first method in 66 ns 2 sigma noise. The filter step response must be determined by averaging the corresponding points of repeated trials to minimize the effect of noise:

R(1) = (1/N) SUM (1,j) For each sample i in the data record j=1
where N is the number of repeated samples of the step response S
(
i
, j
)
 is the ith sample point of the jth data record R
(
i
)
 is the ith sample point of the averaged data record Figure D-14c illustrates the result of averaging 10 such trials, thereby demonstrating that the rise time and the percentage overshoot can be adequately measured in the presence of the instrumentation error.

the interrogation and the first reply pulse is the time interval between their virtual origins. (See definition and Figure F-la) 
time measurement technique which is equivalent to measuring the time delay between pulses is the Delay and Compare technique (

partial rise time is linear, then the decision of time of the DAC is given by The For a given T and A, the interrogation transmission Moreover, the illuwhere T is the DAC delay time and A is the attenuation parameter. 

decision time TD is measured relative to the virtual origin (see Figure 
- 
F-1). 

Equation (i) states that the DAC decision time is independent of pulse rise time. 

decision time TD is identical to the received reply transmission decision time. This means that the interrogator calibration procedure is not dependent upon the test set's reply pulse rise time. 

determination of the test set's zero mile delay time i s also not dependent upon the interrogation pulse's rise time. Since the test set zero mile delay calibration is independent of the interrogator zero mile reply delay calibration, and since their DAC 
parameters are, in general, different, then the entire round trip delay is independent of the DAC 
parameters used in the interrogator and those used in the test set. It is assumed that the up-link and down-link propagation times are equal.

Although the above discussion used the DAC 
measurement technique as an example, all conclusions apply to any other technique which is equivalent to the time reference point determined by the virtual origin of a pulse.
