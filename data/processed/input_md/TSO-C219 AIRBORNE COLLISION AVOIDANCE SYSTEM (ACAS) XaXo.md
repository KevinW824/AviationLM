## Technical Standard Order

Subject: AIRBORNE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM (ACAS) Xa/Xo 
 
1. 

PURPOSE. This technical standard order (TSO) is for manufacturers applying for a TSO 
authorization (TSOA) or letter of TSO design approval (LODA). In it, we (the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)) tell you what minimum performance standards (MPS) your airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS) Xa/Xo must first meet for approval and identification with the applicable TSO marking. 

2. 

APPLICABILITY.  This TSO affects new applications submitted after its effective date. a. It is the intention of the FAA to transition manufacturers to the latest airborne traffic alerting and collision avoidance system to increase safety margins, to improve the surveillance logic and to optimize the collision avoidance logic.  All these enhancements support NextGen operations. 

Accordingly, TSO-C119e, Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Airborne Equipment, TCAS II with Hybrid Surveillance, dated June 30, 2016, will remain effective until 24 
months after issuance of this TSO or March 30, 2022 whichever is later.  After this date, we will no longer accept applications for TSO-C119e. 

b. TCAS II Airborne Equipment and TCAS II with Hybrid Surveillance, approved under a previous TSOA, may still be manufactured under the provisions of its original approval. 

 
c.  "ACAS X" in this TSO refers to an ACAS Xa/Xo system and not to any other ACAS X 
variant. 

3. 

 **REQUIREMENTS.**  New models of ACAS X identified and manufactured on or after the effective date of this TSO must meet the MPS qualification and documentation requirements in Section 2.1 and 2.2 of RTCA/DO-385, Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Airborne Collision Avoidance System X (ACAS X) (ACAS Xa and ACAS Xo), dated October 2, 2018, as modified by Change 1, dated September 16, 2019 and Appendix A of this TSO.  
 
a. **Functionality.**  This TSO's standards apply to equipment intended to provide a reliable traffic alert and collision avoidance function for transponder-equipped aircraft.  
 
Table 1-1 defines the ACAS X equipment classes, article labels and functionality for the ACAS X 
architecture.  There are two classes: 

- Class 1 (ACAS Xa - Active Surveillance) and

## - Class 2 (Acas Xo - Operation Specific Surveillance Capability)

 The classes define the capability of the ACAS X System. Class 1 equipment introduces enhanced algorithms compared to the existing Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II) system, with no new traffic symbols, control modes, Traffic Advisory (TA)/Resolution Advisory (RA) information, or operational procedures, so control panels, displays and other existing articles that support TCAS II can be used with the ACAS Xa unit. Class 2 Systems need displays and control panels that support DNA and/or CSPO-3000 functions (see Note below). ACAS Xo DNA provides the capability to suppress all ACAS X alerts and guidance for a designated aircraft; and CSPO-3000 modifies the Collision Avoidance System (CAS) logic for closely spaced parallel approaches separated by 3000 feet for a designated aircraft.

There are twelve articles associated with the ACAS X equipment. Three of the articles are generic 
(marked with * in Table 1-1) and do not have a class associated with them because the performance standards do not differ and are compatible universally on either Class 1 or Class 2 equipment. The other articles have both class and article labels. Appendix I of RTCA/DO-385 maps the performance

## B. Failure Condition Classification.

(1) Failure of the function defined in paragraph **3.a** of this TSO that causes misleading information is:  

(a) 
 *Hazardous/severe-major* for un-annunciated failures that could generate an 
incorrect ACAS X RA, or result in a missing ACAS X RA.  
(b) *Major* for un-annunciated failures that could generate a false ACAS X Resolution 
Advisory (RA).   
However, you may follow the guidance in Advisory Circular (AC) 20-151C, Airworthiness Approval of Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS II), Versions 7.0 & 7.1 and Associated Mode S Transponders, dated July 21, 2017, to define these failure condition classifications.  
Note:  As used in this paragraph: 

- 
A threat is an intruder aircraft that satisfies the threat detection logic and thus 
requires a RA. 
- 
An incorrect RA is a RA occurring when a threat is present, but, because of the 
failure of function, commands a maneuver that reduces separation to the threat. 
- 
A false RA is a RA caused by an ACAS X malfunction that is not warranted by  
an actual threat.    
- 
A missing RA is a RA that does not occur, or that occurs later than the collision 
alerting system logic indicates is necessary, when a threat is present.  
(2) Loss of the function defined in paragraph **3.a** of this TSO is a *major* failure condition, provided the ACAS X equipment provides annunciation of any loss of capability to generate a RA. However, you may follow the guidance in AC 20-151C, to define this failure condition classification. 

Note:  Loss of function does not include unannunciated loss or degradation of capability to generate a RA.  Unannunciated loss or degradation of capability to generate a RA is an unannunciated failure that may result in a missing RA.  See paragraph 3.b(1)(a) of this TSO.  
(3) Design the system to at least these failure condition classifications. However, you may follow the guidance in AC 20-151C, to define these failure condition classifications.  
c. **Functional Qualification.** Demonstrate the required performance under the test conditions in Section 2.4 of RTCA/DO-385 as modified by Change 1 and Appendix A.  Use the ACAS 
 
X Test Suite Encounter Set found in RTCA DO-385 Electronic Supplement, dated August 8, 2018, where applicable in RTCA/DO-385 as modified by Change 1 and Appendix A.  
d. **Environmental Qualification.** Demonstrate the required performance under the test conditions specified in Section 2.3 of RTCA/DO-385 using standard environmental conditions and test procedures appropriate for airborne equipment. You may use a different standard environmental condition and test procedure than RTCA/DO-160G, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, dated December 8, 2010, provided the standard is appropriate for the ACAS X airborne equipment. 

Note: The use of RTCA/DO-160D (with Changes 1 and 2 only, without change 3 
incorporated) or earlier versions is generally not considered appropriate and will require substantiation via the deviation process as discussed in paragraph **3.g** of this TSO. 

 
e. **Software Qualification.** If the article includes software, develop the software according to RTCA, Inc. document RTCA/DO-178C, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, dated December 13, 2011, including referenced supplements as applicable, to at least the software level consistent with the failure condition classification defined in paragraph **3.b** of this TSO.  
 
f. **Electronic Hardware Qualification.** If the article includes complex custom airborne electronic hardware, then develop the component according to RTCA, Inc. Document RTCA/DO-254, *Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware*, dated April 19, 
2000, to at least the design assurance level consistent with the failure condition classification defined in paragraph **3.b** of this TSO. For custom airborne electronic hardware determined to be simple, RTCA/DO-254, paragraph 1.6 applies. 

 
g. **Deviations**. We have provisions for using alternate or equivalent means of compliance with the criteria in the MPS of this TSO. If you invoke these provisions, you must show that your equipment maintains an equivalent level of safety. Apply for a deviation pursuant to 14 CFR § 21.618. 

 

## 4.     Marking.

a. Mark at least one major component permanently and legibly with all of the information in 
14 CFR 45.15(b).  Use serial number in place of optional date of manufacture as stated in 14 CFR 45.15(b)(2).  Include equipment class and article name, unless the classes and article name are identified in the installation instructions or by software. 

 
b. If the article includes software and/or airborne electronic hardware, then the article part numbering scheme must identify the software and airborne electronic hardware configuration. The part numbering scheme can use separate, unique part numbers for software, hardware, and airborne electronic hardware. 

 
c. You may use electronic part marking to identify software or airborne electronic hardware components by embedding the identification within the hardware component itself (using software) rather than marking it on the equipment nameplate. If electronic marking is used, it must be readily 
 
accessible without the use of special tools or equipment. 

 
5. 

APPLICATION DATA REQUIREMENTS. You must give the FAA aircraft certification office (ACO) manager responsible for your facility a statement of conformance, as specified 14 
CFR 21.603(a)(1) and one copy each of the following technical data to support your design and production approval. LODA applicants must submit the same data (excluding paragraph 5.g)

## Appendix A.  Faa Modifications To Rtca/Do-385 And Change 1 This Appendix Lists Faa Modifications To Rtca/Do-385 And Change 1, Minimum Operational Performance Standards For Airborne Collision Avoidance System (Acas X) (Acas Xa And Acas Xo).

Replace 3rd sentence in 5th paragraph in Section 2.2.3.6.1 with   
Identification and surveillance of on-ground Active CAS can be accomplished by examining the VS field in the DF=0 acquisition reply to a UF=0 acquisition interrogation as described in §2.2.4.6.2.2.2 and by correlating the ICAO 24-bit Aircraft Address associated with the reply with the address received in the TCAS Broadcast Interrogation. 

Replace 2nd and 4th paragraph in Section 2.2.3.9.2.1 with   
The Capability field, CA, in DF=11 transmissions from RTCA/DO-181A or later transponders (§2.2.3.8.3.1.5) indicates whether the vertical status of the Mode S equipped aircraft is airborne, on the ground, or unknown.  ACAS X **shall** (1106) make use of the CA field information from RTCA/DO-181A or later transponders as described in §2.2.4.6.2.2.2 to prevent unnecessary interrogations to aircraft that are on the ground. ACAS X derives the ICAO 24-bit Aircraft Address of Mode S-equipped aircraft from the AA field of DF11 or DF17 messages.  Additionally, ACAS X **shall** (1107) examine the Vertical Status field, VS, in the DF=0 transmissions from the aircraft as described in §2.2.4.6.2.2.2 in order to minimize interrogations and prevent tracking of aircraft on the ground. 

Note: ACAS X also monitors the FS field in received downlink formats DF=4, 5, 20, 21 (§2.2.3.8.3.1.8) for Mode S intruder air/ground determination as described in §2.2.4.6.2.2.2. 

Replace Section 2.2.4.6.2.2.1 with All newly initiated tracks should default to the IN-AIR state until ACAS X determines their true Air-
Ground condition. ACAS X **shall** determine the true Air-Ground state using §2.2.4.6.2.2.2 and 
§2.2.4.6.2.2.3 as criteria.  

Replace Section 2.2.4.6.2.2.2 with  
A Mode S-equipped intruder **shall** default to IN-AIR status, unless it is declared ON-GROUND by ACAS X. The ACAS X **shall** declare an intruder ON-GROUND if its CA, FS, and VS fields indicate 
'on the ground'. Optionally, ACAS X may declare an intruder ON-GROUND by meeting all of the following conditions: 

1. The CA, FS, and VS fields that have been received from the intruder have not indicated 
'on the ground' for the duration of the track. 
  
2. The intruder's RI field (from Mode S DF=0 replies) indicates no RA capability. 
  
3. The intruder's airborne velocity or ground speed is reported as < 50 knots (only applicable 
to intruders with ADS-B information). 
  
4. Either of the following conditions are met: 
  
i. 
Ownship is in the IN-AIR state AND the intruder's tracked barometric altitude has 
been less than 360 ft above the ground level estimate determined in §2.2.4.6.2.1 for 20 seconds AND its reported barometric altitude has not increased by more than 100 
ft from its lowest reported barometric altitude for the same 20-second period. 
 
ii. The intruder's tracked barometric altitude is less than 150 ft above the ground level 
estimate determined in §2.2.4.6.2.1. 
 
Optionally, the ACAS X may declare an intruder to be IN-AIR if the intruder's RI field (from Mode S 
DF=0 replies) indicates RA capability. 

 

Notes: 
1. 
It is not necessary to receive all the CA, FS and VS fields in order to make the ON-GROUND 
determination.  Reception of any one of them is sufficient, however, if more than one of the fields is received during the current processing cycle, then all of the received fields must indicate 'on the ground' before declaring the intruder ON-GROUND   
 
2. 
On rare occasions, an airborne Mode S intruder may incorrectly report on the ground status in its CA, FS, and/or VS fields due to a failure in the source of the air-ground discrete. In such 
cases, if the Mode S intruder is also equipped with an Active CAS that is DO-185A,B 
compatible or ACAS X, the equipped intruder can remain fully operational since it uses radio altitude to determine its own air-ground status instead of the air-ground discrete used by the 
transponder. ACAS X may do additional monitoring to determine if a Mode S intruder reporting on the ground status in its CA, FS, and/or VS fields is, in fact, likely to be airborne via the RI field. 3.  
An on the ground Mode S intruder on the airport surface may incorrectly report in-air status in 
its CA, FS, and VS fields due to an installation error or failure in the source of the air-ground 
discrete. In such cases, an ACAS X equipped aircraft on takeoff or final approach may declare a TA during a high workload period. ACAS X may perform additional monitoring to determine if a Mode S intruder reporting in air status in its CA, FS, and VS fields is, in fact, likely to be on the ground via optional ON-GROUND declaration method.  
 
4.  
If the ground level estimate is unavailable as described in §2.2.4.6.2.1, then optional ON-
GROUND declaration method is considered not met.  
Replace 2nd paragraph in Section 2.2.4.6.4.2.1 with  
The CA field in squitter's from RTCA/DO-181A or later transponders **shall** (1337) be used to determine whether the aircraft is on the ground as described in §2.2.4.6.2.2. The equipment shall 
(1338) not interrogate an aircraft for acquisition in the following three cases: (1) the aircraft is currently on the ground as described in §2.2.4.6.2.2.2 and the aircraft does not have an operational Active CAS, (2) the aircraft has is currently on the ground as described in §2.2.4.6.2.2.2, the aircraft has an operational Active CAS, but own ACAS X is above 2000 feet AGL, or (3) the aircraft qualifies for acquisition using passive position reports as specified in §2.2.4.6.4.2.2.2. 

## Replace 2Nd Sentence In 11Th Paragraph In Section 2.2.4.6.4.2.3.2.5 With The Acas X Equipment **Shall** (1441) Also Delete The Established Track On A Mode S Transponderequipped Aircraft Following Five Consecutive Replies In Which The Aircraft Was Determined To Be On

ground as described in §2.2.4.6.2.2.2. 

 
Replace 1st paragraph in Section 2.2.4.6.4.2.4 with   
When ownship is airborne and at or below 2000 ft AGL, the range of Mode S aircraft that are determined to be both on the ground as described in 2.2.4.6.2.2.2, and Active CAS-equipped, according to the TCAS Broadcast Interrogation **shall** (1363) have their range determined for the purposes of NTA3 and NTA6 through: 

a) Surface Position Messages with DF=17 Format Type Code 5, 6, 7 or 8 received within the last 
25 seconds. 
b) On-Ground Ref. T tracks which qualify for AIRB or SURF application active interrogations 
once every 5 seconds when Surface Position Messages are not available. 

## Include In Section 2.2.5.5.9 Receivestatevectorposition

Additional input requirements include the following: 
     …….. 

11. Surveillance **shall** provide the STM only State Vector Position Reports that are identified with an ICAO compliant 24-bit address.  This requirement suppresses the input of State Vector Position Reports with non-ICAO 24-bit addresses (ex: non-ICAO ADS-R (CF=6,IMF=1) and non-ICAO
