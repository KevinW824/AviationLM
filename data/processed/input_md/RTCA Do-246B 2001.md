This report was prepared by Special Committee 159 (SC-159) and approved by the RTCA Program Management Committee (PMC) on November 28, 200 1. 

RTCA, Incorporated, is a not-forprofit corporation formed to advance the art and science of aviation and aviation electronic systems for the benefit of the public. The organization functions as a Federal Advisory Committee and develops consensusbased recommendations on contemporary aviation issues. RTCA's objectives include but are not limited to: 

- 
coalescing aviation system user and provider technical requirements in a manner that helps 
government and industry meet their mutual objectives and responsibilities; 
- 
analyzing and recommending solutions to the system technical issues that aviation faces as it continues 
to pursue increased safety, system capacity and efficiency; 
- 
developing consensus on the application of pertinent technology to fulfill user and provider 
requirements, including development of minimum operational performance standards for electronic 
systems and equipment that support aviation; and 
- 
assisting in developing the appropriate technical material upon which positions for the International 
Civil Aviation Organization and the International Telecommunication Union and other appropriate 
international organizations can be based. 
The organization's recommendations are often used as the basis for government and private sector decisions as well as the foundation for many Federal Aviation Administration Technical Standard Orders. 

Since RTCA is not an official agency of the United States Government, its recommendations may not be regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the U.S. government organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations relate.

## 1 Purpose And Scope 1.1

Introduction This Interface Control Document (ICD) defines the Signalin-Space for the GNSS-
based Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) that supports Category I Precision Approach and the differential positioning service. The LAAS has global application as a GroundÂ­
Based Augmentation System (GBAS) to the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). 

The content of this ICD has been harmonized with standards being developed by the InterÂ­
national Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and The European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) as of the approval of this document. This document should be useful to equipment designers, installers, manufacturers, service providers, and LAAS users. 

Figure 1-1 shows the three required components of the LAAS system, specifically: the GNSS subsystem, the airborne subsystem and the ground subsystem. In addition to these three subsystems, additional components are required to maintain the operations of the LAAS (e.g., the GPS control segment, GLONASS control segment, WAAS/SBAS infraÂ­
structure), however, these components of the GNSS are not considered to be part of the LAAS for the purpose of this ICD. 

The GNSS/LAAS Signal-in-Space is composed of four signals: 

a. 
the navigation signal transmitted from the GNSS subsystem to the ground subÂ­
systems, 
b. 
the navigation signal transmitted from the GNSS subsystem to the airborne subÂ­
system, 
c. 
the VHF Data Broadcast (VDB) transmitted from the ground subsystem to the airÂ­
borne subsystem, and 
d. 
the ranging broadcast transmitted from the ground subsystem to the airborne subÂ­
system. 
1.2 
LAAS System Interface Description The LAAS system operates using four interfaces shown in Figure 1-2. There are three unique interfaces that are defined in this ICD. 

The satellite ranging interface (Interfaces I 
and II) is the GNSS Ranging source interface. The definition of this interface already exists for GNSS in the form of: the ICD-GPS-200C, Navstar GPS Space Segment/NavigaÂ­
tion User Interfaces and the WAAS Signal Specification (Appendix A of RTCA 
DO-2 290), which define the nominal signal characteristics and performance of the GNSS 
satellites. 

Performance above and beyond the minimum guaranteed by the GPS SPS Performance Standard is ensured through signal quality monitoring at the LAAS ground station. SevÂ­
eral LAAS specific ranging source signal performance requirements have been identified to fully characterize anomalous ranging source conditions, which are not naturally corÂ­
rected by the differential operation of the LAAS. 

The third interface (Interface III) is the LAAS Ground Station/Airborne Equipment InterÂ­
face, also referred to as the VHF Data Broadcast (VDB). Section 2.0 defines both the physical layer and the application data layer of the VDB. The physical layer includes a specification of the transmission band and modulation format. The application data includes information such as the differential correction information, the integrity data, the Final Approach Segment (FAS) definition data, and the ground station location data. 

The fourth interface (Interface IV) is the ground based ranging source (GBRS) augmentaÂ­
tion to airborne LAAS equipment. Appendix D of this document defines the proposed Signal-in-Space characteristics of the proposed GBRS (Airport Pseudolite - APL), which may be required to increase the LAAS navigation system availability to support CAT 
II&III operations. Appendix D includes information, which identifies the ranging perforÂ­
mance of the LAAS signal provided by the ranging signal and measurement data for Interface IV. Appendix E provides the proposed pseudorandom pulse sequence used by the GBRS and Appendix F provides the preliminary definition of the LAAS message format required to use a GBRS.

## Data Broadcast Definition

2 
This section describes the Signal-in-Space for the LAAS VHF Data Broadcast (VDB). The broadcast is a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), VHF data broadcast which 
complies with the physical layer of the ISO stack protocol described in ICAO Document 
AMCP/ 3-R/8A (VHF Digital Link Manual). The VDB link layer is different than VDL 
Mode 2. The data broadcast definition includes the data broadcast characteristics, data defÂ­
inition, broadcast timing, message format, and RF signal format. 

## Rf Transmission Characteristics 2.1 2.1.1

Symbol Rate The symbol rate of the LAAS data broadcast is 10,500 symbols/sec Â±0.005%. Each symbol defines one of eight states ( 3  
bits) resulting in a nominal bit rate of 31,500 bits/sec. 

## 2.1.2

Emission Designator The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) emission designator of this modulation technique is 1 4K0G7DET. 

## 2.1.3

Field Strength The FAA-
specified LAAS signal has a minimum field strength of 215 microvolts per meter and a maximum of 0. 350 volts per meter with a horizontal polarization and a minimum field strength of 136 microvolts per meter and a maximum of 0.22 1 volts per meter with a vertical polarization within the coverage region. 

The VDB field strength measurement is averaged over the period of the synchronization and ambiguity resolution segment in the training sequence of the VDB message. 

Notes: 
1. The !CAO Annex JO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for 
GBAS allow for ground stations that transmit only a horizantally polarized 
signal, meeting the horizantal field strength requirements specified above. A 
ground facility that only broadcasts the horizontally polarized signal will be 
designated as a GBAS/H facility, while one that broadcasts the elliptically 
polarized signal will be designated as a GBAS/Efacility. The SARPs GBASIE 
vertical field strength requirements are as specified above. The SARPs recÂ­
ommend that an elliptically polarized signal be broadcast whenever 
practical. 
2. The RTCA DO-245A provides further information and the nominal Link 
Budget. 
3. The broadcast power of an installed VDB is constrained by many factors, 
only one of which is the desired field strength in the defined coverage region. 
Other constraints include adjacent and co-channel interference to neighÂ­
boring systems and the VDB receiver sensitivity. The link budget for the 
minimum field strength is based on a distance of 23 nmi from the transmitting 
antenna, and the maximum field strength is based on a distance of 200 
meters from the transmitting antenna. 

## 2.1.4 Spectral Characteristics 2.1.4.1

Carrier Frequencies The system is defined to be capable of operating on carrier frequencies within the range of 
108.

000 MHz to 117.975 MHz inclusive with 25.0 kHz centers. 

Note: 
         In accordance with !CAO Annex 10, operational frequency assignments will be 
         assigned on 25 kHz centers in the range from 108.025 MHz to 117.950 MHz 
         inclusive. 

## 2.1.4.2 Unwanted Emissions

Unwanted emissions, including spurious and out-of-band emissions, are compliant with the levels shown in Table 2-1. 

The total power in any VDB harmonic or discrete signal will not be greater than -5 3dBm.

Notes: 
         1. If the authorized transmitter power exceeds 150 watts, then the relative 
            unwanted emissions requirements and the maximum unwanted emission 
            requirements both apply. This column indicates the bandwidth over which the 
            maximum unwanted emission levels must be met. 

2. Relative unwanted emission level requirements apply to a 25 kHz bandwidth. 
This will require the conversion of measurements taken over a bandwidth difÂ­
ferent from 25 kHz. 
3. This value is *driven by measurement limitations. Actual performance* is 
expected to be better. 
4. The relationship is linear between single adjacent points designated by the 
adjacent channels identified above. 
5. Spurious emissions are defined in 47 **CFR I.XX** as emissions on a frequency 
or frequencies which are outside the necessary bandwidth and the level of 
which may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of 
information. Spurious emissions include harmonic emissions, parasitic emis-
sions, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out-of
-band emissions. 

6. For LAAS, the necessary bandwidth is defined to be the channel bandwidth 
of 25 kHz. 
7. The FCC spurious requirement may not provide adequate protection of 
nearby aircraf
t
 or LAAS ground subsystem GPS receivers f
rom harmful 
interference, especially VHF 14th harmonics. Depending upon the implemenÂ­
tation, additional filtering, shielding and/or separation from GPS receivers 
in the same area may be required. 
8. Out-of
-band emissions are defined in 47 **CFR I.XX** as emissions on a freÂ­
quency or frequencies immediately outside the necessary bandwidth which 
results from the modulation process, excluding spurious emissions. 
9. !TU-R Recommendation 329 contains requirements for digital transmissions. 

## 2.1.4.3

Adjacent Channel Emissions The amount of power during transmission under all operating conditions when measured over a 25 kHz bandwidth centered on the ith adjacent channels does not exceed the values in Table 2-2.

Notes: 
1. The maximum power applies if the authorized transmitter power exceeds 150 W. 

2. The relationship is linear between single adjacent points designated by the 
adjacent channels identified above. 

## 2.1.4.4

Adjacent Temporal Interference Under all operating conditions, the peak power at any time outside of the assigned time slots, when measured over a 25 kHz bandwidth centered on the assigned frequency, does not exceed -105 dBc referenced to the average power in a VDB burst. 

2.1.4.5 
Carrier Frequency Stability The carrier frequency of the data broadcast is maintained within Â± 0.000 2% (Â± 2 parts per million) of the assigned frequency during all operational periods and through all the operÂ­
ating environmental conditions of the ground transmitter. 

2.1.5 
Modulation Binary data is assembled into symbols, each consisting of 3 consecutive bits. 

The end of the data is padded by one or two fill bits if necessary to form the last 3-bit symbol of the burst. Symbols are converted to differentially-encoded 8 phase shift keyed (D8PSK) 
carrier phase shifts (Ä<l>k) as shown in Table 2-3. 

The carrier phase for the kth symbol (<l>k) is given by: 
<i>k = <i>k -1 + Ä<j>k The transmitted signal is H(ei(Znft + <I> (t))), where H(â¢) is a raised cosine filter with a =  
0.6 
as defined in Section 2. 1.5. 1.

D8PSK may be produced as shown in Figure 2-1 by combining two quadrature RF

                                        modulated by baseband filtered 
impulses. The baseband filters have a frequency response with the shape of a raised cosine 
with an excess bandwidth factor (a) equal to 0. 6. This characteristic allows a high degree 
of suppression of adjacent channel energy, with performance dependent only upon 
hardware implementation of the modulating and amplification circuits. 

## 2.1.5.1

**Pulse Shaping Filters**

The output of differential phase encoder is filtered by a pulse shaping filter whose output, $s(t)$, is described as follows:

$$s(t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{k=\infty}e^{\,j\phi}k\,h(t-kT)$$ $$k=-\infty$$
where: 
h = the impulse response of the raised cosine filter t = time T = duration of each symbol (T=l/ 10500 second, approximately 9 5.2 Âµsec) 
<Pk = as defined in Section 2.1. 5 
This pulse shaping filter has a nominal complex frequency response of a raisedcosine filter with a =  
0. 6. The frequency response, *H(f),* and the time response, *h(t),* of the base band filters are as follows: 
where: 
f is the absolute value of the frequency offset from the channel center. 

2.1.5.2 
Error Vector Magnitude 
The error vector magnitude of the transmitted signal is less than 6. 5 percent RMS. 

## 2.2

Broadcast Timing Structure The high data rate of the physical layer offers more capacity than is required by any single LAAS ground station. As a result, spectrum efficiency is achieved through the use of a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technique that partitions the total capacity offered by a single LAAS frequency assignment to individual proximate ground station VDB transmitters. The paragraphs of this subsection describe the time partitioning approach used for the LAAS VHF Data Broadcast. 

## 2.2.1

TDMA Timing Structure The TDMA timing structure is based on a two level hierarchy as shown in Figure 2-2. 

Each frame is 500 milliseconds in duration. There are two such frames contained in each one-second UTC epoch. The first of these frames starts at the beginning of the UTC epoch and the second starts 0. 5 seconds after the beginning of the UTC epoch. The frame is time division multiplexed such that it consists of 8 individual VDB time slots (A - H) of 6 2.5 
millisecond duration. 

A VDB time slot establishes the incremental capacity resource that can be assigned to an individual LAAS ground transmission station. Within each time slot, a VDB burst can be transmitted. Bursts can be of variable length up to the maximum allowed within the slot. 

The following subsection details the timing budget and physical layer overhead required for the maximum length burst. 

## 2.2.2

Time Slot Initiation and Minimum Use To initiate the use of a time slot, the VDB transmitter will broadcast a burst in that time slot in each of 5 consecutive frames. For each time slot in use, the VDB transmitter will broadcast a burst in at least one frame of every 5 consecutive frames. 

## 2.2.3

Timing Budget For VDB Bursts Each VDB burst is contained in a 6 2.5 millisecond time slot. 

At a rate of 10,500 symbols per second, each time slot contains 656. 25 symbol periods. 

The transmission of each burst begins 95. 2 Âµs after the start of the time slot, with a total tolerance of Â± 95.2 Âµs. The transmitter power ramps up to 90% of the steady-state power level within two symbol periods ("' 190.5 Âµs) after the beginning of the burst, and stabiÂ­
lizes at the steadystate power within five symbol periods ("' 476.2 Âµs) after the beginning of the burst. 

After transmission of the final information symbol of a burst, the transmitter output power level decreases to at least 30 dB below the steady-state power within 
285.7 Âµs. A signal propagation guard time of 1 26 1.

9 Âµs at the end of each slot protects a one way propagation range of approximately 200 nmi. 

Table 2-4 shows the timing budget for a VDB burst. The start of the synchronization and ambiguity resolution portion of the burst transmitted with horizontal polarization (HPOL) will occur within 10 Âµs of the start of the burst transmitted with vertical polarization (VPOL), as received at the aircraft.

Note: 
Event duration indicated for transmission of scrambled data is for the maximum 
application data length of 1 776 bits and two fill bits. The end of the burst occurs 
within 285. 7 Âµs after the last symbol of the scrambled data. 

## 2.3

Burst Data Content Each burst consists of the data elements shown in Table 2-5. 

The maximum burst duration is 19 1 2  useful bits ( 2 39 bytes). Since the communications structure is based on an 88 bit training sequence and a 48-bit application FEC, up tol 776 bits ( 2 2 2  
bytes) can be used for application data. 

As depicted in Figure 2-3, the encoding of the messages follows the sequence: application data formatting, training sequence FEC generation, application FEC generation, and bit scrambling.

## Figure 2-3 Message Encoding 2.3.1 Training Sequence

The data broadcast message begins with a 5-segment demodulator training sequences as shown in Table 2-6. The training sequence allows proper demodulation of the message by the airborne subsystem.

## 2.3.1.1 Power Stabilization

The first segment of the training sequence is the 15-bit Power Stabilization field, coded as all zeros. The transmitted signal reaches at least 90% of the steady-state power level within two symbols to allow the airborne receiver's automatic gain control (AGC) at least three symbols settling time. 

## 2.3.1.2

Synchronization and Ambiguity Resolution The second segment of the training sequence is the 48-bit Synchronization and Ambiguity Resolution field consisting of the following sequence: 
010 001 111 101 111 110 001 100 011 10 1 100 000 011 110 010 000 
with the rightmost bit **(LSB)** transmitted first. 

Note: 
This sequence was designed to have good auto-correlation properties and to facilitate estimation of the center frequency. 

## 2.3.1.3

Station Slot Identifier The third segment of the training sequence is the 3-bit Station Slot Identifier **(SSID).** The SSID is a numeric value from O to 7, corresponding to the letter designation (A through H) 
of the first time slot assigned to a particular ground reference station, where slot A =  
0 and slot H = 7. All messages in all time slots employed by a particular ground station use the same SSID. The SSID is transmitted LSB first. 

Notes: 
1. The purpose of transmitting the SS!D is to provide a low overhead way for 
the airborne receiver to decide whether to process the rest of the burst data. 
This provides the avionics manufacturer the opportunity to reduce unnecesÂ­
sary tra
ffic on the data bus. 

## 2. Ssid Example

| GBAS ID    | Time Slots Assigned    |   SSID  |
|------------|------------------------|---------|
| GYUL       |                        |         |
| A,C        |                        |         |
| 0          |                        |         |
| GYMX       | D,F                    |      3  |
| GYSF       | G                      |      6  |

3. Because SSID values are defined directly f
rom time slot assignments, there is 
no requirement f
or Spectrum Management authorities to separately manage 
the assignment of SS!D. It is not intended that the SS!D be required in an air Â­
borne database. 
4. Because the assignment of slots is not guaranteed to be unique within radio 
range, an airborne user may receive messages from more than one ground 
station with the same SS!D. All messages from a single ground station will 
have the same SS!D; however, all messages received with the same SS!D are 
not necessarily f
rom the same ground station. Theref
ore, the airborne 
receiver must also examine the GBAS ID in the 
field of every message header 
to determine which ground station produced the message. 

## 2.3.1.4

Transmission Length The fourth segment of the training sequence is the 17-bit Transmission Length. This field indicates the total number of bits in the Application Data and Application FEC. This allows the airborne receiver to determine the length of the Reed-Solomon block. The order of transmission is from least significant bit (LSB) to most significant bit (MSB). 

Note: 
         Although no transmission length exceeds 1824 bits the f
                                                              ull 17 bits are included 
         to be consistent with the !CAO Document AMCP/3-R/8A (VHF Digital Link 
         Manual). 

## 2.3.1.5

Training Sequence FEC 
The fifth segment of the training sequence is the Training Sequence FEC. A (25,20) block code is computed over the SSID and Transmission Length segments using the following equation. 

where: 
P 
n is the nth bit of the training sequence FEC (P1 is transmitted first) 
SSID is the nth bit of the Station slot identifier (SSID1=LSB) 
TLn is the nth bit of the transmission length (TL1=LSB) 
HT is the matrix H transpose function and H is the parity matrix defined below: 
0 0 0  
0 0  
0 0 0  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  
1 
0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0  
0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

H =  1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1

0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1  
Note: 
This code is capable of correcting all single bit errors and detecting 75 of 380 
possible double bit errors. 

## 2.3.2

Application Data The application data consists of one or more message blocks, as defined in Section 2.3. 5. The message blocks are mapped directly into the Application Data portion of the VDB 
burst with no additional overhead of intervening layers. Broadcasting of messages across multiple bursts is not supported; each message must be completely contained within a single burst. The order of transmission for the application data is LSB first followed by the higher order bits of each field. 

## 2.3.3

**Application FEC**

The application FEC coding is accomplished by means of a systematic fixed length Reed-Solomon (255,249) $2^{8}$-ary code capable of correcting up to three code word symbol errors. The field defining primitive polynomial of the code is as follows:

$$\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{x}^{8}+\mathbf{x}^{7}+\mathbf{x}^{2}+\mathbf{x}+1$$

The generator polynomial is given by:

$$g(x)=\prod_{i=10}^{255}\left(x-\alpha^{i}\right)=x^{6}+\alpha^{156}x^{5}+\alpha^{156}x^{4}+\alpha^{244}x^{3}+\alpha^{156}x^{2}+\alpha^{156}x+\alpha^{225}$$
where: 
a is a root of p(x) used for construction of the Galois Field of size 28; GF( 256), and ai is the ith primitive element in GF( 2 56). 

Virtual fill bits set to zero will be temporarily appended to the application data as necÂ­
essary to create an input stream to the application FEC encoder and decoder of 1992 bits 
( 2 49 bytes). These virtual fill bits are not transferred to the bit scrambler or transmitted. 

In generating the application FEC, the data to be encoded, m(x), will be grouped into 8 bit Reed-Solomon symbols. 

The data m(x) is defined by: 

( ) _  248  247  248-length+I  248-length  m X  - a248 X  + a247 X  + Â·Â·  Â· + a248-length+I X  + a248-lengt/1 X  + Â· . .  + a I X +  ao 
where: 
length represents the number of 8-bit bytes in the application data block a248 represents the Message Block Identifier **(MBI),** with the rightmost bit defined as the LSB and the first bit of the application data sent to the bit scrambler a248-Iength+ 
1 represents the last byte of the message block CRC, with the leftmost bit defined as the MSB and the last bit of the application data sent to the bit scrambler a248-Iength, .... 

, a 
1, ao are the virtual fill bits (if any) 
The six Reed-Solomon check symbols (bi) are defined as the coefficients of the remainder resulting from dividing the message polynomial x6m(x) by the generator polynomial g(x): 
5 
b(x) = [b;x; = b5x5 + b4x4 + b3x3 + b2x2 + b1x + b0 = [x6m(x)]mod g(x) 
i=O 
These 8-bit Reed-Solomon check symbols are appended to the application data. The Application FEC is ordered such that the first Application FEC bit transferred to the bit scrambler is the MSB of the 6th 8-bit code word, b0, generated by the FEC encoder, and the last Application FEC bit transferred to the bit scrambler is the LSB of the 1st code word, b5. 

Note: 
The order of the transmitted 8-bit Reed-Solomon check symbols of the appended 
application FEC diff
ers from VDL-2. 

## 2.3.4

Bit Scrambling In order to aid clock recovery, a pseudonoise **(PN)** scrambler with a 15-stage generator register are exclusive OR'ed with the transmitted data stream starting with the station slot identifier and ending with the application FEC. 

Bit scrambling of any fill bits is optional, and the set value of the fill bits is optional. 

Note: 
The fill bits are not used by the aircraf
t
 receiver, so their value has no impact on 
system performance. 
The concept of a PN scrambler is shown in Figure 2-4 (the descrambler is identical). The polynomial for the register of the scrambler is 1 + X + X 
15. The register content is rotated at the rate of one shift per bit. The initial status of the register, prior to the first station slot identifier bit of each burst, is 1101 0010 1011 001 with the leftmost bit in the first stage of the register. The first output bit of the scrambler/descrambler is sampled prior to the first register shift. 

## 2.3.5 Application Layer

The application layer of the ISO Stack Protocol for messages within the VHF data broadcast is described in the following paragraphs. Table 2-7 displays the general conÂ­
struction of a LAAS Message Block. All signed parameters are 2's complement numbers except as noted. 

| Message Block        | Bits     |
|----------------------|----------|
| Message Block Header |          |
| 48                   |          |
| 6                    |          |
| Message              |          |
| up to 1696           |          |
| up                   | to 2 1 2 |
| Message Block CRC    |          |
| 32                   |          |
| 4                    |          |

## 2.3.6

Message Block Header The Message Block Header contains information relevant to every LAAS transmission. Table 2-8 diagrams a Message Block Header. It consists of a Message Block Identifier 
(MBI) and a twenty-four bit GBAS ID, which identifies the LAAS reference station. 

These fields are followed by an eight-bit message type field and an eight-bit message length field. 

## Table 2-8 Format Of Message Block Header

| Message Header           |   Bits  |
|--------------------------|---------|
| Message Block Identifier |         |
| 8                        |      1  |
| GBAS ID                  |         |
| 3                        |         |
| 2 4                      |         |
| Message Type             |         |
| 8                        |         |
| 1                        |         |
| Message Length           |         |
| 8                        |         |
| 1                        |         |

Message Block Identifier: The 8-bit message block identifier **(MBI)** denotes the start of a message block, and indicates the operating mode of the LAAS message block. 

"1010 1010" = a normal LAAS message 
"1111 1111" = a test LAAS message All other codings indicate non-
LAAS message formats not supported by this ICD. 

GBAS ID: a fourcharacter (2 4-bit) alphanumeric field that identifies the ground station broadcasting the message. Each character is represented by bits b1 through b6 of its InterÂ­
national Alphabet #5 
representation (reference section 2.4.

2), with bit b1 transmitted first. 

Only capital letters, numbers, and "space" are permitted. 

The rightmost character is transÂ­
mitted first. For a 3-character ID, the right-most (first transmitted) character is "space". 

Message Type: an 8-bit numeric label identifying the contents of the message. Message Length: The length, in bytes, of the Message Block including the message block header, the message and the message block CRC. 

## 2.3.6.1

Test Mode When the station is operating in a mode where the SIS does not conform with the certifiÂ­
cation requirements of the station or the definition in this ICD, the Message Block Identifier is set to " 1111 1111". 

Note: 
Individual message transmissions can be set invalid by setting the Message Block Identifier to "1111 1111 " for that message. 

## 2.3.7

Cyclic Redundancy Check A 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) concludes each message block in order to ensure message integrity. 

The generator polynomial G(x) for the message block CRC is:

$$\text{G(x)}=\text{x}^{32}+\text{x}^{31}+\text{x}^{24}+\text{x}^{22}+\text{x}^{16}+\text{x}^{14}+\text{x}^{8}+\text{x}^{7}+\text{x}^{5}+\text{x}^{3}+\text{x}+1$$
The CRC information field, M(x) is: 

$M(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}x^{n-i}=m_{1}x^{n-1}+m_{2}x^{n-2}+...+m_{n}x^{0}$
M(x) is formed from the 48-bit LAAS message block header and all bits of the variableÂ­
length Message, excluding the CRC. Bits are arranged in the order transmitted, such that m1 corresponds to the first transmitted bit of the message block header, and mn correÂ­
sponds to the last transmitted bit of the (n-48) message bits. 

The CRC is ordered such that r1 is the first bit transmitted and r32 is the last bit transmitted. 

Further details of the CRC implementation are provided in Appendix A. 

## 2.4 Laas Messages 2.4.1

Message Types and Broadcast Rates The range of the 8-bit message type field of the message block header allows for up to 256 
message types. Eight of the 2 56 message types have been allocated. Message Types 1, 2 
and 4 are required, while Message Type 5 is optional. It is intended that unique military information be communicated via Message Type 7 and that experimental, privateuse, and proprietary messages be communicated via Message Type 8. 

Table 2-9 lists the allocated message types, and the required broadcast rates to support Category I precision approach and the differential positioning service. 

Message Types 0, 3, 6 and 9 through 255 
are reserved for future operations. It is intended that proposed definitions of the reserved messages be coordinated through the RTCA. It is also intended that these messages be assigned for commonuse aviation applications only and be defined in this ICD.

Notes: 
1. Each Type 1 message or linked Type 1 message pair broadcast in a given 
frame includes the complete set of measurement blocks for its measurement 
type. 
2. If 
no final approach segments ( 
FAS) are currently being supported, then it is 
not necessary to transmit Type 4 messages. 

## 2.4.2 Data Format

The order of the application data is reflected in the order of the fields in each Message Type and FAS table from top to bottom. 

Bits identified as spare have no defined use and are coded as zeros. In the future, spare bits in a message may be defined to incorporate additional parameters at which point these bits are no longer spare. Spare bits should be ignored except for the purposes of CRC and FEC 
processing. 

Unless otherwise specified, all signed numbers are coded in two's complement format. 

Certain LAAS message fields contain alphanumeric data coded using a subset of InternaÂ­
tional Alphabet No. 5 (IA-5).

Notes: 
1. Binary code values represent IA-5 bits b 
1 through b6, with b 
1 as the rightmost bit. IA-5 bits b7 and b8 are not used in the LAAS application. 
2. Values not used for LAAS message fields. 
3. Values not used for 5-bit Route Indicator field. 
4. For the coding of the route indicator in the F
AS data block, only bits b1 
through b5 are used. 

## Message Type 1 - Differential Corrections 2.4.3 Message Description 2.4.3.1

Message Type 1 provides the differential correction data for individual GNSS ranging sources. The message contains three sections: message information (time of validity, addiÂ­
tional message flag, number of measurements and the measurement type), low frequency correction information (ephemeris decorrelation parameter, ranging source ephemeris CRC and ranging source availability duration information) and the ranging source data measurement blocks. 

The message format is defined in Table 2-11.

Note 5: Parameter is associated with the first transmitted measurement block. 
Each Type 1 Message includes low frequency data for one ranging source consisting of the Ephemeris Decorrelation, Ephemeris CRC and Source Availability Duration parameters. 

The low frequency data corresponds to the first ranging source in the message. Except during an ephemeris change, the ground reference station sequences the first ranging source so that the low frequency data for each GPS ranging source is transmitted at least once every 10 seconds. 

During an ephemeris change, the low frequency data for each GPS 
ranging source are transmitted at least once every 27 seconds. 

The ground reference station will continuously receive the Ephemeris data from each GPS 
satellite, but will not use the new Ephemeris data until it has been received continuously for at least two minutes. The new Ephemeris data becomes the basis for the corrections after two and before three minutes have passed. 

Pseudorange corrections based on the new Ephemeris data will be first transmitted in the Type 1 message in the same message where the "Ephemeris CRC" and the IOD indicate a new data set. Each time the "Ephemeris CRC" changes, the ground reference station sequences the order of the transmission so that the "Ephemeris CRC" is transmitted in all Type 1 messages containing a measurement block for that satellite, for three consecutive frames as shown in the example in Figure 2-5. 

For SBAS satellites, new Ephemeris data (SBAS Type 9) will be used immediately upon receipt by the ground reference station. 

## Figure 2-5 Low Frequency Correction Transmission (Ephemeris Crc)

The correction data applies only to a ranging measurement for which the IOD broadcast by the ranging source is identical to the corresponding IOD in the differential correction message, and for which the CRC calculated from the ranging source ephemeris is identical to the most recent ephemeris CRC for that ranging source in a differential correction message. 

Note 6: Sequencing SEAS satellites and GBRSs through the first ranging source measurement block in Message Type 1 is optional. 

## 2.4.3.2

Message Type 1 Parameters Additional Message Flag: identifies whether the set of corrections (measurement blocks) 
in a single frame for a particular measurement type is contained in a single Type 1 
message or a linked pair of messages. The two messages of a linked pair will have the same Modified Z-
count, and each of the two messages will contain at least one meaÂ­
surement block. 

0 = All measurement blocks for a particular measurement type are contained in 
a single Message Type 1. 
1 = This is the first transmitted message of a linked pair of Type 1 Messages 
that together contain the set of all measurement blocks for a particular meaÂ­
surement type. 
2 = Reserved. 
3 = This is the second transmitted message of a linked pair of Type 1 Messages 
that together contain the set of all measurement blocks for a particular meaÂ­
surement type. 
Note 1: 
When a linked pair of Type 1 messages is used for a particular measurement 
type, the first message will indicate the number of corrections in the first mesÂ­
sage and the second message will indicate the number of corrections in the 
second message. Each message will include the low frequency data for the first ranging source in its own message. 

B 1 through B 4: are the differences between the broadcast pseudorange corrections and the corrections calculated by excluding the specific reference receiver measurement, as illusÂ­
trated in Figure 2-6. A coding of "1000 0000" indicates that the associated LAAS 
reference receiver is not present, or that its measurement was not used to compute the pseudorange correction. 

At least two valid B values will be provided with each pseudoÂ­
range correction. 

Note 2: Bl through B4 are the estimates of the error resulting from specific reference 
receiver measurements on the pseudorange corrections. 
Ephemeris CRC: is the 16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) computed on the satellite ephemeris data set in order to ensure ranging source position integrity. 

The generator polynomial G(x) for the ephemeris CRC is:

$$\rm G(x)=x^{16}+x^{12}+x^{5}+1$$
The CRC information field, M(x), for a given ranging source is: 
For a GPS satellite, M(x), is of length n=576 bits. M(x) for a GPS satellite is calculated using the first 2 4  
bits from each of Words 3 through 10 of Subframes 1, 2 and 3 of the data transmission from that satellite, ANDed with the GPS satellite ephemeris mask of Table 
2-1 2. After the AND operation, M(x) is arranged in the order that bytes are transmitted by the GPS satellite, but with each byte ordered least-significant bit first, such that m1 correÂ­
sponds to bit 68 of Subframe 1 (LSB of Subframe 1, Word 3), and m576 corresponds to bit 287 of Subframe 3 (MSB of Subframe 3, Word 10). 

For an SBAS satellite and GBRS, the ephemeris CRC is coded as all zeros. 

The CRC is ordered such that r1 is the first bit transmitted and r16 is the last bit transmitted. 

Further details of CRC implementation are provided in Appendix A.

Note 3: The order of the Ephemeris Mask corresponds to order of bits transmitted from GPS satellites. 

Ephemeris Decorrelation Parameter (P): characterizes the impact of residual ephemeris errors due to decorrelation. 

Note 4: For ground systems that do not broadcast the additional data block I in the Type 
2 message, this parameter is coded as all zeros. 

Issue of Data: is the IOD associated with the ephemeris data used to determine pseudoÂ­
range and range rate corrections. The IOD for GPS ranging sources is coded to match the GPS IODE parameter. 

A coding of "1111 1111" is used for SBAS ranging source. 

Measurement Type: identifies the type of ranging signal from which the corrections have been computed: 
0 
= *CIA* code L 1  
1 
= *CIA* code L 2  
2 
= P(Y) code L 1  
3 
= **P(Y)** code L 2  
4 - 7 = Reserved Note 5: Measurement type does not indicate the ranging source. The ranging source ID 
indicates the type of satellite. 

Modified Z-
count: indicates the reference time for all message parameters in this message. 

The modified z-count correlates with GPS time, except that it resets on the hour (xx:00), twenty minutes past the hour (xx: 20), and forty minutes past the hour (xx: 40). For a given measurement type, all Type 1 messages transmitted in a given frame have the same modÂ­
ified z-count. The modified z-count for each measurement type advances each frame. 

Number of Measurements: identifies the number of ranging source measurements in the message. 

Pseudorange Correction: is defined as the correction to the ranging source SIS pseudoÂ­
range. A differential pseudorange correction is the average of the corrections based on measurements from multiple ground reference receivers. The pseudorange corrections are based on carrier smoothed code pseudorange measurements. 

The Pseudorange Correction 
(PRC) is applicable at the time defined in the Type 1 message. 

The order of corrections is defined in Figure 2-7. 

Range Rate Correction: is the rate of change of the psvdorange correction. The Range Rate Correction (RPC) is multiplied by the age of the correction [determined from the current time (t) minus the time of applicability of the PRC determined from the modified z-count (t${}_{\rm E\,s\,round}$)] and added to the PRC and the measured psvdorange ($P_{n}$). The satellite clock correction (c*(At${}_{\rm N}$)${}_{\rm L}$), including relativistic corrections, is then added to compute the corrected psvdorange measurement (P${}_{\rm corrected}$).

$$\rm P_{corrected}=P_{n}+PRC+RPC*(t-t_{\rm E\,room})+TC+c*(At_{N})_{\rm L}$$

_Note 6: TC is the tropospheric correction at the user location calculated by the airborne receiver using the Reffractivity Index and Scale Height parameter, where_

where: 

NR = refractivity index from the Type 2 message 

llh= height of the aircraft above the GBAS reference point 

8 = elevation angle of the satellite 

ho= tropospheric scale height from the Type 2 message. 

Ranging Source ID: identifies the ranging source to which corrections and/or availability data are applicable. 

1 to 36 
= a GPS satellite whose PRN is equal to the Ranging Source ID 
value. 

37 
= reserved. 

38 to 6 1  
= a GLONASS satellite whose slot is equal to the Ranging Source ID value plus 37. 

6 2  
to 119 = reserved. 

1 20 to 138 = an SBAS satellite whose PRN is equal to the Ranging Source ID 
value. 

139 to 255 = reserved. 

crpr_gnd: is the standard deviation of a normal distribution that bounds the SIS contribution to the error in the corrected pseudorange at the GBAS reference point. The normal distriÂ­
bution N(0, a2pr_gnd) bounds the error under the H0 hypothesis. In addition, the normal distribution N(Bj, Mifpr_gni(M-1)) (where M is the number of valid measurements) 
bounds the error under the H1 hypothesis for a fault in the j1h receiver measurement. A 
coding of "1111 1111" indicates that corrections for a ranging source have been identified as invalid by the ground system. 

Source Availability Duration: the predicted duration for which corrections for the ranging source are expected to remain available, relative to the modified zcount for the first meaÂ­
surement block. 

Coding: 
"1111 1110" indicates that the duration is greater than or equal to 25 40 seconds. "1111 1111" indicates that the duration information is not provided by the ground facility. 

## 2.4.4 Message Type 2 - Gbas Related Data 2.4.4.1

Message Description Message Type 2 identifies the exact location for which the differential corrections proÂ­
vided by the ground augmentation system are referenced. The LAAS ground station reference point is defined in WGS-8 4 coordinates. The message also contains configuÂ­ ration data and data to compute a tropospheric correction. The message format is shown in Table 2-13. 

Additional data blocks may be appended to the end of the Type 2 message. 

Currently there is only one additional data block defined. In the future other additional data blocks may be defined and appended to the end.

## 2.4.5

Message Type 3 - (Reserved) Ground Based Ranging Source (GBRS) Acquisition Data Message Type 3 defines information required to use the GBRS. 

A preliminary message definition is provided in Appendix F. 

## 2.4.6 Message Type 4 - Final Approach Segment (Fas) Construction Data 2.4.6.1

Message Description The Type 4 message format is defined in Table 2-1 4. Message Type 4 contains one or more data sets that contain approach data and associated vertical/lateral alert limits. Part of the data set is the FAS data block, which is terminated with a FAS CRC. In addition, each Type 4 message is terminated with a separate message CRC (as defined in the message definition). 

Each FAS data block contains the parameters that define a single precision approach. The FAS path is a line in space defined by the Landing Threshold Point/Fictitious Threshold Point (LTP/FTP), Flight Path Alignment Point (FPAP), Threshold Crossing Height (TCH), and the Glide Path Angle (GPA). The local level plane for the approach is a plane perpenÂ­
dicular to the local vertical passing through the LTP/FTP (i.e., tangent to the ellipsoid at the LTP/FTP). Local vertical for the approach is normal to the WGS-8 4 ellipsoid at the LTP/FTP. The Glide Path Intercept Point (GPIP) is where the final approach path interÂ­
cepts the local level plane. A typical Final Approach Segment Diagram is shown in Figure 
2-8. 

The protected FAS data blocks are validated individually by the civil authorities. Contents of a typical FAS data block are depicted in Figure 2-8. The data blocks also include data that allow for an unambiguous FAS selection against the desired approach charts. A Data Set Length field at the beginning of each data set provides the number of bytes in the data set. Other data sets may be defined in the future.

## 2.4.6.2

Message Type 4 Parameters Data Set Length: indicates the number of bytes in the data set. A data set includes a FAS 
data block, FASVAL, FASLAL and the data set length field. 

Note: 
         While the current definition of Type 4 messages has a fixed data set length, it is 
         intended that new F
                            AS data blocks will be defined to support other operations 
         ( 
         as identified in the Operation Type field). 

FAS Data Block: contains the construction data for a Final Approach Segment. The content of the data block is defined in Section 2. 4.6. 3. 

FAS Lateral Alert Limit/Approach Status: the value of the broadcast lateral alert limit. 

A 
coding of " 1111 1111" indicates that the approach is not available. 

FAS Vertical Alert Limit/ 
Approach Status: the value of the broadcast vertical alert limit. A 
coding of "1111 1111" indicates that the vertical guidance is not available. 

## 2.4.6.3

Final Approach Segment (FAS) Data Block The Final Approach Segment Data Block, defined in Table 2-15. contains the parameters that define a single precision approach. Other FAS Data Blocks may be defined in the future. Figure 2-8 depicts a final approach segment and illustrates the parameters that define the approach path. 

The data block includes data that allow for an unambiguous FAS 
selection from the approach chart. 

Each FAS data block ends with a FAS CRC to protect the approach design data. The proÂ­
tected FAS data blocks are validated individually by the civil authorities. A separate message CRC protects each complete LAAS message.

## 2.4.6.4

Final Approach Segment Parameters Airport Identification: represents the three or four alphanumeric characters used to desÂ­
ignate airport facilities. Each character is coded using bits b1 to b6 of its International Alphabet No. 5 representation (reference Section 2. 4.2). For each character, bit b1 is transÂ­
mitted first, and two zero bits are appended after bit b6, so that 8 bits are transmitted for each character. The rightmost character is transmitted first. Only upper case letters, numbers, and IA-5 "space" (" 10 0000") are used. When a three-character identifier is used, the right-most (first transmitted) character is IA-5 "space". 

Approach Performance Designator: represents the general information about the approach design. The convention for the coding is as follows: 
0 
= Spare 
1 
= Category I 
2 
= Reserved for Category II 
3 
= Reserved for Category III 
4 - 7  = Spare Approach TCH Units Selector: defines the units used to describe the Approach Threshold Crossing Height. The coding is: 
0 
= feet 
1 
= meters Approach Threshold Crossing Height (TCH): the height of the FAS path above the LTP/ 
FTP defined in either feet or meters as indicated by the Approach TCH Units Selector. 

CRC code: is a 32 
bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) appended to the end of each FAS Data Block in order to ensure approach data integrity. 

The generator polynomial G(x) for the message block CRC is:

$$\mbox{G(x)}=\mbox{x}^{32}+\mbox{x}^{31}+\mbox{x}^{24}+\mbox{x}^{22}+\mbox{x}^{16}+\mbox{x}^{14}+\mbox{x}^{8}+\mbox{x}^{7}+\mbox{x}^{5}+\mbox{x}^{3}+\mbox{x}+1$$

The CRC information field, $M(x)$, _is_

$$M\ (\ x\ )\ =\ \sum_{i\ =\ 1}^{272}\ m_{\ i\ }\ x^{272\ -\ i}\ =\ m_{\ 1}\ x^{271}\ +\ m_{\ 2}\ x^{270}\ +\...\ +\ m_{\ 272}\ x^{0}$$
M(x) is formed from all bits of the associated FAS data block, excluding the CRC. 

Bits are arranged in the order transmitted, such that m1 corresponds to the LSB of the operation type field, and m272 corresponds to the MSB of the ÄLength Offset field. 

The CRC is ordered such that r1 is the first transmitted bit and r32 is the last transmitted bit. 

Further details of CRC implementation are provided in Appendix A. 

Course Width at Threshold: the lateral displacement from the path defined by the FAS at the LTP/FTP at which full-scale course deviation indicator (CDI) deflection is attained. 

The Course Width field is ignored if Runway Number is coded as O (helicopter pad). 

Instead, the receiver uses a course width of 38 m ( 1 25 ft) at the LTP/FTP. ÄFPAP Latitude: represents the difference of latitude of the runway Flight Path Alignment Point (FPAP) from the LTP/FTP, defined in WGS-8 4 coordinates and transmitted in arc seconds. 

Positive values denote the FPAP latitude north of LTP/FTP latitude. Negative values denote the FPAP latitude south of the LTP/FTP latitude. 

ÄFPAP Longitude: represents the difference of longitude of the runway Flight Path Alignment Point from the LTP/FIP defined in WGS-8 4 coordinates and transmitted in arc seconds. Positive values indicate the FPAP longitude east of LTP/FTP longitude. Negative values indicate the FPAP longitude west of LTP/FTP longitude. 

ÄLength Offset: distance from the stop end of the runway to the FPAP. A coding of 1111 
1111 indicates that the value is not provided. 

Glide Path Angle (GPA): represents the angle of the FAS path (glide path) with respect to the horizontal plane tangent to the WGS-8 4 ellipsoid at the LTP/FTP. 

LTP/FTP Height represents the height of the LTP/FTP above the WGS-8 4 ellipsoid. This is coded as an unsigned value with an offset of -5 1 2  meters. A zero value in this field places the LTP/FTP 512 
m below the WGS-8 4 ellipsoid. 

LTP/FTP Latitude: represents the latitude of the LTP/FTP in arc seconds. Positive values denote north latitude and negative values denote south latitude. 

LTP/FTP Longitude: represents the longitude of the LTP/FTP in arc seconds. Positive values denote east longitude and negative values denote west longitude. 

Operation Type: indicates whether the operation is a straight-in approach procedure or other operation to be defined later. The convention for coding is as follows: 
0 
= straightin approach procedure 
1-15 = spare 

Note 1: Other operations could include straight-in approaches followed by a missedÂ­
approach, precision curved approach or departure procedures, and rollout and 
taxiing procedures. 
Reference Path Data Selector: is a numerical identifier (unique in the broadcast region) 
used to select the FAS data block (desired approach). 

Note 2: The Reference Path Data Selector is the only identifier guaranteed to be unique 
to one F
AS data block among all of the FAS data blocks within the radio range of 
the ground reference station on the tuned frequency. 
Reference Path Identifier: represents the three or four alphanumeric characters used to designate the reference path. Alphanumeric characters are coded using bits b1 to b6 of International Alphabet No. 5 (reference Section 2. 4. 2). For each character, bit b1 is transÂ­
mitted first, and two zero bits are appended after bit b6, so that 8 bits are transmitted for each character. 

The right-most character is transmitted first. 

Only upper case alpha charÂ­
acters, numbers, and IA-5 "space" (" 10 0000") are used. When a three-character identifier is used, the rightmost (first transmitted) character is IA-5 "space". 

Route Indicator: is a single alphabetic character used to differentiate between multiple approaches to the same runway end, coded using bits b1 to b5 of International Alphabet No. 5 (reference Section 2. 4.2). Only upper case letters (excluding "I" and "O"), or IA-5 
"space" may be used. 

Runway Letter: represents the runway letter, where used to differentiate between parallel runways. 

The convention for coding is as follows: 

$$\begin{array}{l l}{{0=\mathrm{no~letter}}}&{{\quad2=\mathrm{C~(center)}}}\\ {{1=\mathrm{R~(right)}}}&{{\quad3=\mathrm{L~(left)}}}\end{array}$$
Runway Number: represents the approach runway number. The designation O identifies heliport operations. 

SBAS Service Provider: this field is used by SBAS equipment to associate the data with an SBAS service provider. This field has no application for the LAAS user and should be ignored (except for the CRC and FEC calculations) in this LAAS application. 

## 2.4.7 Message Type 5 - Ranging Source Availability (Optional) 2.4.7.1 Message Description

Message Type 5 provides a means for the ground subsystem to indicate to the aircraft aviÂ­
onics the future availability of differential corrections to the ranging measurements on an approach specific basis. 

Message Type 5 consists of rising and setting information for the currently visible or soon to be visible ranging sources as shown in Table 2-16. This message allows the ground subÂ­
system to broadcast predicted changes in the availability of differential corrections at future specific points in time to the aircraft so that the aircraft is able to anticipate the ranging sources that can be used for the duration of a specific precision approach. 

This message is designed to allow for unique approaches where ranging sources are masked differently than the LGF.

## 2.4.7.2 Message Type 5 Parameters Modified Z-Count: Is Defined As In Message Type 1.

Number of Impacted Sources: indicates the number of ranging sources for which duration 
information applicable to all approaches is provided. 

Number of Obstructed Approaches: indicates the number of approaches (A) for which duration information applicable to only a specific approach is provided. 

The "Number of Obstructed Approaches" field is followed by (A) repetitions of source information. 

Each repetition includes: the number of impacted sources (NA), followed by (NA) repetitions of a source ID, the source availability sense, and the source availability duration (see Table 
2-16). The value "0" indicates that there are no unique obstructions on any approach. 

Ranging Source ID: is defined as in Message Type 1. Reference Path Data Selector: Indicates the FAS data block to which the source availÂ­
ability data applies. 

Source Availability Sense: indicates whether the ranging source or its differential correcÂ­
tions will become available or cease to be available. A coding of "0" indicates that a ranging source or its corrections will soon cease to be available, and " 1" indicates that a ranging source and its corrections will soon be available. 

Source Availability Duration: is the period of time for which a ranging source or its corÂ­
rections are expected to remain available, or within which the ranging source and its corrections are expected to become available (depending upon coding of Source AvailÂ­
ability Sense). The time is relative to the modified z-count coded in the message. A coding of " 111 1111" indicates a time period greater than or equal to 1 270 seconds. 

Number of Impacted Sources for this Approach (NA): is the number of sources for which duration information applicable only to this approach is provided.

## Appendix A-Cyclic Redundancy Checks (Crcs) A.1 Crc Definition

Cyclic Redundancy Check fields are appended to critical data components to increase the level of assurance that the data are correct and increase system integrity. 

Each CRC is calculated as the remainder R(x) of the modulo-2 division of two binary polynomials:

$$\frac{\left[\left[x^{\lambda}\,M\left(x\right)\right]\right]}{G(x)}\bmod2=Q(x)+\frac{R(x)}{G(x)}$$
where: 
k is the number of bits in the particular CRC. 

M(x) is the information field, which consists of the sequence of data items to be protected by the particular CRC, represented as a polynomial. 

G(x) is the generator polynomial specified for the particular CRC. 

Q(x) is the quotient of the division. 

R(x), the remainder of the division, contains the CRC: 

Note 1: The M(x) and G(x) polynomials are defined in Section 2.
4.3.
2 for the ephemeris 
CRC, Section 2.3.7 for the message block CRC, and Section 2.4.6.4 for the F
AS 
CRC. 
Note 2: Coefficient r1 is the first bit of the CRC to be transmitted. 
Figure A-1 shows an example polynomial division circuit to generate the 16-bit EphemÂ­
eris CRC field in the Type 1 message. 

The register is seeded with all zeros. 

After all bits of M(x) are clocked into the register, the CRC is in the register with coefficient r1 in position xl5_ 
Figure A-2 shows an example polynomial division circuit to generate the 32-bit LAAS 
message CRC. The same implementation could be used to generate the FAS CRC. The register is initially seeded with all zeros. After all bits of M(x) are clocked into the register, the CRC is in the register with coefficient r 
1 in position x3 1.

## Appendix B-Message And Fas Examples B.1 Message And Fas Example

This appendix provides examples of the coding of LAAS Type 1, 2, 4 and 5 messages. The examples illustrate the coding of the various application parameters, including the CRC 
and FEC parameters, and the results of bit scrambling and D8PSK symbol coding. 

Note 1: The engineering values for the message parameters have been selected to illusÂ­
trate the message coding process. They are not necessarily representative of 
realistic values. 
Table B-1 provides an example of a Type 1 message. For illustration purposes, the AddiÂ­
tional Message Flag field is coded to indicate that this is the first of two Type 1 messages to be broadcast within the same frame. (Table B-2 provides the companion message.) 
Table B-2 provides examples of a Type 1 message and a Type 2 message coded within a single burst (i.e., two messages to be broadcast within a single transmission slot). The Additional Message Flag field of the Type 1 message is coded to indicate that it is the secÂ­
ond of two Type 1 messages to be broadcast within the same frame. The Type 2 message includes Additional Data Block 1. 

Note 2: A second Type 1 message is not typically required, except to broadcast more 
ranging source corrections than a single message can accommodate. 
Table B-3 provides an example of a Type 4 message containing two FAS data blocks. Table B-4 provides an example of a Type 5 message. In this example, source availability durations common to all approaches are provided for two satellites. Additionally, source availability durations for two individual approaches are provided: two satellites for one approach, one satellite for another approach.

Note 7: In Binary Representation column, the rightmost bit is the LSB of the binary 
parameter value, and is the first bit transmitted or sent to the bit scrambling proÂ­
cess. All data 
fields are sent in the order specified in the table. 

Note 8: For examples of Ephemeris CRC calculation, see Appendix A, Table A-1. Note 9: This string is coded in hexadecimal with the first bit to be sent to the bit scramÂ­
bling process as its MSB. The first character represents a single bit. 
Note 10: Symbols are represented by their differential phase with respect to the first symÂ­
bol of the message, in units of 7fl4 radians ( 
e.g., a value of 5 represents a phase 
of 57fl4 radians relative to the first symbol). Fill bits are 0. 
Note 11: In the example, the fill bits are not scrambled.

Note 12: In the Binary Representation column, the rightmost bit is the LSB of the binary 
parameter value, and is the first bit transmitted or sent to the bit scrambling proÂ­
cess. 
All data fields are sent in the order specified in the table. 
Note 13: This string is coded in hexadecimal with the first bit to be sent to the bit scram Â­
bling process as its MSB. 
The first character represents a single bit. 
Note 14: Symbols are represented by their dif
f
erential phase with respect to the first sym Â­
bol of the message, in units of 7fl4 radians ( 
e.g., a value of 5 represents a phase 
of 57fl4 radians relative to the first symbol). 
Note 15: In the example, the fill bits are not scrambled.

## Appendix C-Preliminary Carrier Corrections Message Definition (Informative) C.1

Carrier Correction The Carrier Correction may be used to increase the accuracy of the LAAS system in the future. Message Type 6 is reserved to provide differential carrier correction data for indiÂ­
vidual GNSS ranging sources. It consists of the corrections for a variable number of ranging sources, as described in Table C-1. 

The definition in this appendix is included to provide an allocation for the required broadcast data capacity when using carrier corrections. 

## C.1.1

Definition of Parameters B 1 to B 4: are the estimates of the error resulting from specific reference receiver measureÂ­
ments on the carrier corrections and are defined as the differences between the broadcast carrier corrections and the corrections obtained excluding the specific reference receiver measurement. These parameters are two's complement numbers. The bit pattern 
"1000 0000" indicates that the carrier measurement from the associated LAAS receiver is invalid.

## Appendix D Preliminary Airport Pseudolite Signal Specification (Informative)

Note: 
         This appendix remains unchanged from D0-246. Development of the airport 
         pseudolite (APL) as an element of the LAAS and validation of the APL require Â­
         ments are ongoing. This appendix is anticipated to be updated when the work 
         has been completed.

## Appendix D-Preliminary Airport Pseudolite Signal Specification (Informative) D.1 Introduction

This appendix defines the preliminary characteristics of the Signal-in-Space of the proÂ­
posed ground-based augmentation APL. 

The LAAS may use pseudo-satellites (Airport Pseudolites -APLs) to provide ranging sigÂ­ nals that augment the GNSS. This signal specification defines the service to be provided by the APLs. It is written to satisfy the following objectives: 

a. 
Define the ranging signal characteristics. 
b. 
Define the signal data structure. 

## D.2

Signal Characteristics The APL signal broadcast is designed to minimize GPS receiver hardware modifications. The basic signal characteristic is similar to GPS, using the same frequency and modulation technique, including a modified PRN code. In addition, the code phase timing is mainÂ­ tained close to GPS time to provide a ranging capability. In order to minimize interference to GPS ranging source signals, the APL signals are pulsed with a duty cycle of 0.027 33. 

Carrier Frequency The LAAS APL broadcast consists of a single carrier frequency of 1575. 42 MHz (GPS Ll). 

## D.2.2 Spurious Transmissions Spurious Transmissions Are At Least 40 Db Below The Unmodulated Carrier Power. D.2.3

Modulation Bi-phase modulation is used for the code and the data. Message bits at a rate of 50 bits per second (bps) are modulo-2 added to the APL-code, which is then biphase shiftkeyed 
(BPSK) modulated onto the carrier at a rate of 10.2 3 M-chips per second. Code/carrier freÂ­
quency coherence is exactly maintained at a ratio of 1/ 15 4. The relationship between the APL Code and Data modulated on the carrier is maintained as described in the ICD-GPS-
200C. The 50 bps data is synchronized with the 1.5 second APL-code S 1 epochs. 

Carrier Phase Noise The phase noise spectral density of the signal is such that a phase locked loop with a oneÂ­
sided noise bandwidth of 10 Hz will be able to track the carrier to an accuracy of 0. 1 radiÂ­
ans RMS. 

D.2.5 
Signal Spectrum The broadcast signal is centered at the GPS L1 frequency of 1575.42 MHz. Ninetynine percent of the broadcast power is in a 41 MHz bandwidth. 

D.2.6 
Carrier Frequency Stability 
The shortterm stability of the carrier frequency (square root of the Allan variance) at the 
input of the user's receiver antenna is less than 5x10-1 1  over 1 to 10 seconds, excluding the 
effects of Doppler. 
D.2.7 
Polarization 
The broadcast signal is vertically polarized. 

Note: 
         V
          ertical polarization is specified to minimize the eff
                                                          ects of multipath. 

Pulse Sequence and Pulse Repetition Rate The pulse sequence includes at least one pulse every millisecond. For the required low duty cycle, a relatively high pulse repetition rate results in relatively narrow pulses ( 
on the order of a few microseconds). The pulsing sequence is defined to be transparent to the user receivers and Table D-1 summarizes the pulse sequence parameters. 

Details of the pseudoÂ­
random pulse sequence are documented in Appendix E. 

Note: 
A pseudorandom pulse sequence is used to prevent the user receiver from lock Â­
ing on to the pulse pattern. This pseudorandom sequence will result in a random 
pulse repetition rate. The average pulse repetition rate is sufficiently high (1997 pulses per second) so that the APL signal will appear to be continuous in the 
user 's receiver post correlation signal processing, while appearing to be pulsed 
during wideband processing prior to correlation.

User Received Signal Levels The average received power level (Pave) into a 0 dBi Right-Hand-
Circularly-Polarized 
(RHCP) antenna from a LAAS APL varies with distance from the APL as shown in Figure D-1. The minimum and maximum signal strength is TBD within the defined coverage volume. 

Correlation Loss Correlation loss is defined as the ratio of output powers from a perfect correlator for two cases: 

a. 
the actual received APL signal correlated against a perfect unfiltered PN reference, or 
b. 
a perfect unfiltered PN signal normalized to the same total power as the APL signal 
in case 1, correlated against a perfect unfiltered PN reference. 
The correlation loss resulting from modulation imperfections and bandlimiting is less than 1 dB. 

Maximum Code Phase Deviation The maximum uncorrected APL code phase of the broadcast signal is maintained within 1 
second of GPS time. 

## D.3 Apl-Codes The Apl-Codes Are Identified As Follows:

a. 
One GPS-like week-long 10.23 Mchips/second PN code, and 
b. 
Code phase delay with respect to the beginning of the GPS week in minutes. 
The definition of code phase delay is an integer N, between 1 (one minute - 613,800,000 
codechips) and 10,079 minutes after the start of the GPS week, of which 7 2  
integers ( 1 39 
to 210 minutes) are used for APLs. (These 7 2  delays are referred to as PRN 139 - 210). 

Thus, the APL-code phase week starts N minutes after the start of the GPS week and ends N minutes after the end of the GPS week, at which time the APL-code reinitializes to the beginning of the week. APLs operating in the same region will all have different code phase delays. 

## D.3.1

APL-code Definition The APL-
code is a ranging code, APL(t), of 7 days in length at a chipping rate of 10. 2 3  
MÂ­
chips per second. The 7-day sequence is the modulo-2 sum of two sub-sequences referred to as SI and S 234; their lengths are I5, 3 45,000 chips and I5, 3 45,0 37 chips, respectively. 

The S234 sequence is an S2 sequence delayed by 3 4  
chips. 

## D.3.1.1 Code Structure

The APL(t) pattern (APL-code) is generated by the modulo-2 summation of two PRN 
codes, S 
I(t) and S 2(t - 3 4T), where T is the period of one APL-code chip and equals 1/ 
(l.

0 2 3  
x 107) seconds. 

## D.3.1.2

APL-code Generation The APL patterns are the modulo-2 sum of two extended patterns clocked at 10.23 MÂ­
chips per second (SI and S234), as shown in Figure D-2, which shows a functional APLÂ­
code mechanization. Sl itself is generated by the modulo-2 sum of the output of two I 2-stage registers (SIA and SIB) short cycled to 409 2  
and 409 3 chips respectively. When the SIA short cycles are counted to 3750, the Sl epoch is generated. The Sl epoch occurs each 1.5 seconds, after I5, 3 45,000 chips of the SI pattern have been generated. The polyÂ­
nomials for SIA and SIB, as referenced to the shift register input, are: 

S1A: $1+X^{6}+X^{8}+X^{11}+X^{12}$, and

S1B: $1+X^{1}+X^{2}+X^{5}+X^{8}+X^{9}+X^{10}+X^{11}+X^{12}$
Samples of the relationship between shift register taps and the exponents of the correÂ­
sponding polynomial, referenced to the shift register input, are shown in Figure D-3, Figure D-4, Figure D-5 and Figure D-6. 

The state of each generator can be expressed as a code vector word which specifies the binary sequence constant of each register as follows: (a) the vector consists of the binary state of each stage of the register, (b) the stage 1 2  
value appears at the left followed by the values of the remaining states in order of descending stage numbers and ( 
c) the shift direcÂ­
tion is from lower to higher stage number with stage 12 
providing the current output. This code vector convention represents the present output and 11 future outputs in sequence. 

Using this convention, at each S 1 epoch, the SIA shift register is initialized to code vector 
00100100 1000 and the SIB shift register is initialized to code vector 010101010100. 

The first chip of the SIA sequence and the first chip of an S 
lB sequence occur simultaneously in the first chip interval of any S 1 period. 

The natural 409 5  
chip cycles of these generating sequences are shortened to cause precesÂ­
sion of the S 
lB sequence with respect to the SIA sequence during subsequent cycles of the SIA sequence in the Sl period. 

Reinitialization of the SIA shift register produces a 
409 2 chip sequence by omitting the last 3 chips (00 1) of the natural 409 5 chip SIA 
sequence. Reinitialization of the S 
lB shift register produces a 409 3  chip sequence by omitting the last 2 chips (01) of the natural 409 5  chip SIB sequence. This results in the phase of the SIB sequence lagging by one chip for each SIA cycle in the S 1 period. 

The Sl period is defined as 37 50 SIA cycles ( 1 5, 34 5,000 chips) which is not an integer number of SIB cycles. 

To accommodate this situation, the SIB shift register is held in the final state (chip 409 3) of its 37 49th cycle. 

It remains in this state until the SIA shift regisÂ­
ter completes its 37 50th cycle ( 3 4 3  
additional chips). The completion of the 37 50th SIA 
cycle establishes the next Sl epoch, which reinitializes both the SIA and SIB shift regisÂ­
ters starting a new S 1 cycle. 

The S 234 sequence is generated by first producing an S 2  
sequence and then delaying it by 
3 4  
chips. The S 234 sequence is then Modulo-2 added to the S 1 sequence thereby producÂ­
ing the APL(t). 

The S 2A and S 2B shift registers, used to generate S 2, operate in a similar manner to the SIA and SIB shift registers. 

They are short-cycled, S 2A to 409 2  
ant S 2B to 409 3, so that they have the same relative precession rate as the S 1 shift registers. S 2A epochs are counted to include 37 50 cycles and S 2B is held in the last state at 37 49 cycle until S 2A 

completes its 3750th cycle. The polynomials for S2A and S2B, as referenced to the shift register input, are:
S2A: S2B: 

de. The polynomials for S2A and S2B, as referenced to the shift

$$1+\mathrm{X}^{1}+\mathrm{X}^{3}+\mathrm{X}^{4}+\mathrm{X}^{5}+\mathrm{X}^{7}+\mathrm{X}^{8}+\mathrm{X}^{9}+\mathrm{X}^{10}+\mathrm{X}^{11}+\mathrm{X}^{12},$$ $$1+\mathrm{X}^{2}+\mathrm{X}^{3}+\mathrm{X}^{4}+\mathrm{X}^{8}+\mathrm{X}^{9}+\mathrm{X}^{12}$$

The initialization vector for S2A is 100100100101 and for S2B is 010101010100.

The S2A and S 2B epochs are made to precess with respect to the SIA and SIB epochs by causing the S 2  period to be 37 chips longer than the S 1 period. When S 2A is in the last state of its 37 50th cycle and S 2B is in the last state of its 3749th cycle, their transitions to their respective initial states are delayed by 37 chip time intervals. 

At the beginning of the APL week, SIA, SIB, S 2A, and S 2B shift registers are initialized to produce the first chip of the week. The precession of the shift registers with respect to SIA continues until the last SIA period of the APL week interval. During this particular SIA period, SIB, S2A, and S2B are held when reaching the last state of their respective cycles until that SIA cycle completes (see Table D- 2). At this point, all four shift registers are initialized and provide the first chip of the new week. 

Signal component timing is shown in Figure D-7, while the endofweek reset timing and the final code vector states are given in Table D-2 and Table D-3, respectively.

## D.4.2 Timing

LAAS Network Time is defined as that which is maintained, after corrections, close to GPS system time, within the overall LAAS performance requirements. It is noted that, when using differential corrections, the user's solution for time will be with respect to GPS 
system time. If corrections are not applied, then the solution will be with respect to a comÂ­
posite GPS/LAAS APL Time, and the resulting accuracy will be affected by the difference between the two. 

The APL code phase is an integer N minutes delayed with respect to that time. 

## Tropospheric Delay Models D.4.3

Because the range between the APL to the LAAS Ground Station and the user, which are entirely in the troposphere, are different, both the ground station and the user must apply a troposphere correction in addition to the differential correction. Thus, a special tropospheric delay model applies to correct APL ranging measurements. This model is of the form, in meters,

$$\delta R_{T_{P}}=N_{APL}\times(1\cdot\Delta h_{u}/h_{0})\times R\times10^{\cdot6}$$
where N
APL is the tropospheric refractivity along the signal path, R is the range (in meters) 
between the APL and the user, ho is the scale height and 11hu is the altitude (in meters) of the user relative to the APL. Note that !ihu can be negative if the APL is higher than the user, in which case the parenthetical quantity will be greater than one, as it should be. 

A 
tropospheric index, for computing the tropospheric refractivity, and the scale height are broadcast as part of the Reference Point Data message (Message Type 2, see Section 
2. 4. 4). 

## D.4.4

Acquisition Information Signal acquisition can be accomplished by the user via direct APL-code acquisition. This is possible because APL timing is maintained to within 7 1.5 milliseconds of LAAS Network Time, and the APL position is known to within less than a meter via the VHF Data Link (i.e., from the data in Message Type 3). 

Although direct APL-
code acquisition provides exact data timing for data acquisition, the code delay is provided in the APL 50 bps broadcast message to verify correct code acquisition. 

## D.4.5

Block Data Format The block format and definition for the 50 bits per second data rate is fixed for a given APL as shown in Figure D-8. The single data block is 25 bits long and is repeated every 
0.5 seconds. The block starts with a 1 4  bit integer word defining the code delay ( 1  -
10079), followed by 11 - "ls". These " ls" provide for full-integer carrier phase cycle ambiguity resolution and an unambiguous code delay. Only 7 2  
code delays in the range of 
139 to 210 is used for APLs. 

---------- Direction of data flow from APL 

## FiÉºure D-8 Message Block Format

The 1 4-bit code delay starts at bit O of the 25-bit message, of which every third one is lined up with APL S 1 epoch. 

## Appendix E Preliminary Apl Pulse Sequence Definition

         This appendix remains unchanged from D0-246. Development of the airport 
         pseudolite (APL) as an element of the LAAS and validation of the APL require Â­

         has been completed.

## Appendix E-Preliminary Apl Pulse Sequence Definition E.1

APL Pulse Sequence Figure E-1 presents a block diagram of the pseudorandom pulse generator. It is based upon a 19-stage maximal length PRN shift register clocked at a rate of 511.500 kHz. If it were allowed to finish its entire pseudorandom sequence, it would start over at about once every 
1.02 5  
seconds. However, it is short-cycled at I 
-second APL epochs. A pulse is generated every time there is a string of exactly 6-ls at the output of the shift register, which occurs 
1997 times in one second. That event triggers a pulse output during the next 1 40-Wide Band chip slot generated from the pulse sequence clock running at 511, 500
/7 Hz. 

Clocking pre-stored bits out of RAM can also generate the pulses. This can be accomÂ­
plished by storing 7 3,07 2 bits in RAM with 1997 bits set to 1, and clocking them out at a rate of 511, 500/7 bits per second. Anytime a 1-bit is clocked out a pulse is generated. The times, after the start of the sequence, of bits set to 1 are listed in Table E-1

## Appendix F Preliminary Ground Based Ranging Source Data Message Definition (Informative)

Note: 
         This appendix remains unchanged from D0-246. Development of the airport 
         pseudolite (APL) as an element of the LAAS and validation of the APL require Â­
         ments are ongoing. This appendix is anticipated to be updated when the work 
         has been completed.

## Appendix F-Preliminary Ground Based Ranging Source Data Message Definition (Informative) F.1

Variable Definition The GBRS provides additional ranging information to improve the availability of the LAAS system. This message format provides additional detail on the proposed APL 
implementation. 

## F.1.1

Variable Definition Airport Pseudolite (APL) Clock Offset: represents the APL clock offset in meters. It is applied in the same sense that the ranging source clock offset provided in the GPS NavigaÂ­
tion Message is applied. 

Airport Pseudolite (APL) Health: represents the APL health and is TBD. 

Airport Pseudolite (APL) IOD: represents the APL IOD. It also serves as the reference time for the APL Clock Offset. Its resolution is 1 second with a range of 2 40 seconds, rollÂ­
ing over 15 
times per GPS hour, and synchronized with the GPS hour. 

Airport Pseudolite (APL) Ranging Source ID: contains the identity of the ground ranging source for which data is applicable. There are 72 channels each defined as N*6 1, 380,000 
chips (N minutes) offset from the current TOW of the APL code. The ID corresponds directly to N. The range is 1-2 55, where 1 is specified by "0000 000 1" and "0000 0000" is not used. ID's 1 39-210 are reserved for ranging source IDs (PRN) consistent with the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS). Latitude: is the latitude of the reference point and is defined in WGS-8 4 coordinates and transmitted in arc seconds. The most significant bit is the sign bit: 
0 = positive (Northern Hemisphere) 
1 = negative (Southern Hemisphere) 
Longitude: is the longitude of the reference point and is defined in WGS-8 4 coordinates and transmitted in arc seconds. 

The most significant bit is the sign bit: 
0 = positive (Eastern Hemisphere) 
1 = negative (Western Hemisphere) 
Vertical Ellipsoid Offset: is the distance along the vector normal to the WGS-8 4 Ellipsoid to the data point of interest.

## Appendix G-Glossary, Abbreviations And Acronyms

AC - Advisory Circular 
AGC - Automatic Gain Control 
APL - Airport Pseudolite 
CFR - Code of Federal Regulations CRC - Cyclic Redundancy Check 
Differential GNSS (DGNSS) - Differential GNSS is an augmentation, the purpose of which is to deterÂ­
mine position errors at one or more known locations and subsequently transmit derived information to other GNSS receivers in order to enhance the accuracy, integrity, and availability of the position estimate. 

(Source: Adapted from the ICAO FANS GNSS Technical Subgroup.) 

D8PSK - Differential 8-state Phase Shift Keying 
FCC - Federal Communications Commission FEC - Forward Error Correction 
Fictitious Threshold Point (FTP) - The FTP is a point functionally equivalent to a Landing Threshold Point, except that the FTP is not located on the runway centerline. 

Final Approach Segment (FAS) - The straight line segment that prescribes the three-dimensional geoÂ­
metric path in space that an aircraft is supposed to fly on final approach. 

Flight Path Alignment Point (FPAP) - The FPAP is used in conjunction with the LTP/FTP and the geoÂ­
metric center of the WGS-8 4 ellipsoid to define the geodesic plane of a precision final approach, landing and flight path. The FPAP is typically located at or near the runway stop end. The FPAP may have the same latitude/longitude as the LTP/FTP for the approach to the opposite end of the same runway. 

Glide Path Angle (GPA) - The glide path angle is an angle, defined at the Threshold Crossing Point 
(directly above the LTP/FTP at a height equal to the TCH), that establishes the intended descent gradient for the final approach flight path of a precision approach procedure. It is measured between the final approach path and the plane containing the LTP/FTP that is parallel to the tangent to the WGS-8 4 ellipsoid. 

Glide Path Intercept Point (GPIP) - The GPIP is the point at which the extension of the final approach path intercepts the plane containing the LTP/FTP that is parallel to the tangent to the WGS-8 4 ellipsoid at the LTP/FTP. 

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) - GNSS is a worldwide position, velocity, and time deterÂ­
mination system, that includes one or more constellations, receivers, and system integrity monitoring, augÂ­ mented as necessary to support the required navigation performance for the actual phase of operation. 

(Source: RTCA GNSS Task Force Working Group 2: adapted from the ICAO FANS GNSS Technical SubÂ­
group.

) 
Global Positioning System (GPS) - The satellite-based navigation system operated by the United States. 

GLONASS - Global Navigation Satellite System (of the Russian Federation). 

Ho Hypothesis - The H0 hypothesis assumes the situation where no faults are present in the range meaÂ­
surements (includes both the signal and the receiver measurements) used in the ground station to compute the differential corrections. 

H 
1 **Hypothesis** - The H 
1 hypothesis assumes the situation when a fault is present in one or more range measurements and is caused by one of the reference receivers used in the ground station. 

Height Above Touchdown (HAT) - Specifically, the height above the LTP/FTP. In using this term for airborne equipment specifications, care should be taken to define the point on the aircraft (e.g., GPS 
antenna, wheel height, or center of mass) that applies. 

ICAO - International Civil Aviation Organization 
ICD - Interface Control Document ID - Identifier IOD - GPS Issue of Data ISO - International Standards Organization LAAS - Local Area Augmentation System 
Landing Threshold Point (LTP) - The LTP is a point at the designated center of the landing runway defined by latitude, longitude, ellipsoidal height, and orthometric height. The LTP is used in conjunction with the FPAP and the geometric center of the WGS-84 ellipsoid to define the geodesic plane of a preciÂ­
sion final approach flight path to touchdown and rollout. The LTP is a surveyed reference point used to connect the approach flight path with the runway. The LTP is typically coincident with the designated runÂ­
way threshold, but may be displaced from the threshold. 

LSB - Least Significant Bit Mask Angle 
- A fixed elevation angle referenced to the user's horizon below which satellites are ignored by the receiver software. Mask angles are used primarily in the analysis of GNSS performance, and are employed in some receiver designs. The mask angle is driven by the receiver antenna characteristics, the strength of the transmitted signal at low elevations, receiver sensitivity and acceptable low elevation errors. 

MBI - Message Block Identifier MSB - Most Significant Bit Navigation - The means by which an aircraft is given guidance to travel from one known position to another known position. 

The process involves referencing the actual aircraft position to a desired course. 

nmi - Nautical Mile Non-Precision Approach - A standard instrument approach procedure in which no glideslope/glide path is provided. (Source: FAA document 7 110. 650) 
PCR - Pseudorange Correction Rate PRC - Pseudorange Correction Precision Approach - A standard instrument approach procedure in which a glideslope
/glide path is proÂ­
vided. (Source: FAA document 7 110. 650) 
PRN - Pseudorandom Number Pseudolite - A pseudolite (pseudo-satellite) is a ground-based GNSS augmentation that provides an addiÂ­
tional navigation ranging signal which is at GNSS ranging source signal-inspace frequencies. 

The augÂ­
mentation may include additionally differential GNSS corrections. (Adapted from the FANS GNSS 
Technical Subgroup.) 
Pseudorange - The distance from the user to a ranging source plus an unknown user clock offset disÂ­
tance. 

With four ranging source signals it is possible to compute position and offset distance. If the user clock offset is known, three ranging source signals would suffice to compute a position. 

Reference Receiver - A subsystem of the Ground Subsystem that is used to make pseudorange measureÂ­
ments and may contain more than one receiver. 

RF - Radio Frequency RFI - Radio Frequency Interference RMS - Root Mean Squared RSS - Root Sum Square Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) - is a differential GNSS employing satellite transponÂ­
ders to broadcast differential corrections, integrity information and additional ranging signals usable over an extensive geographical area for the supported phases of operation. 

sec - seconds Selective Availability (SA) - A set of techniques for denying the full accuracy and selecting the level of positioning, velocity, and time accuracy of GPS available to users of the Standard Positioning Service (LI 
frequency) signal. 

SIS - Signalin-Space Standard Positioning Service (SPS) - The standard specified level of positioning, velocity and timing accuracy that is available, without qualifications or restrictions, to any user on a continuous worldwide basis. 

TBD - To Be Determined TCH - Threshold Crossing Height TDMA - Time Division Multiple Access TOW - Time of Week UTC - Coordinated Universal Time VDB - VHF Data Broadcast WGS-84 - World Geodetic Survey - 198 4 
Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) - The SBAS operated by the U.S. FAA.
