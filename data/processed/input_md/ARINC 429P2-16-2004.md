## Foreword Aeronautical Radio, Inc., The Aeec, And Arinc Standards

Aeronautical Radio, Inc. (ARINC) was incorporated in 1929 by four fledgling airlines in the United States as a privately-owned company dedicated to serving the communications needs of the air transport industry.  Today, the major U.S. airlines remain the Company's principal shareholders.  Other shareholders include a number of non-U.S. airlines and other aircraft operators. ARINC sponsors aviation industry committees and participates in related industry activities that benefit aviation at large by providing technical leadership and guidance and frequency management. These activities directly support airline goals: promote safety, efficiency, regularity, and cost-effectiveness in aircraft operations. The Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) is an international body of airline technical professionals that leads the development of technical standards for airborne electronic equipment-including avionics and in-flight entertainment equipment-used in commercial, military, and business aviation. The AEEC establishes consensus-based, voluntary form, fit, function, and interface standards that are published by ARINC and are known as ARINC Standards. The use of ARINC Standards results in substantial benefits to airlines by allowing avionics interchangeability and commonality and reducing avionics cost by promoting competition. There are three classes of ARINC Standards: 

a) ARINC Characteristics - Define the form, fit, function, and interfaces of avionics and 
other airline electronic equipment. ARINC Characteristics indicate to prospective manufacturers of airline electronic equipment the considered and coordinated 
opinion of the airline technical community concerning the requisites of new equipment including standardized physical and electrical characteristics to foster interchangeability and competition.   
b) ARINC Specifications - Are principally used to define either the physical packaging 
or mounting of avionics equipment, data communication standards, or a high-level computer language.  
c) ARINC Reports - Provide guidelines or general information found by the airlines to 
be good practices, often related to avionics maintenance and support.  
The release of an ARINC Standard does not obligate any airline or ARINC to purchase equipment so described, nor does it establish or indicate recognition or the existence of an operational requirement for such equipment, nor does it constitute endorsement of any manufacturer's product designed or built to meet the ARINC Standard. In order to facilitate the continuous product improvement of this ARINC Standard, two items are included in the back of this volume: 
--``,,,````,,,,`,````,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
An Errata Report solicits any corrections to the text or diagrams in this ARINC Standard. An ARINC IA Project Initiation/Modification (APIM) form solicits any recommendations for addition of substantive material to this volume which would be the subject of a new Supplement. 

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1  Purpose of ARINC Specification 429 ARINC Specification 429 defines the air transport industry's standard for the transfer of digital data between avionics systems elements. Adherence to these standards is desired for all inter-system communications in which the system line replaceable units are defined as "unit interchangeable" in the relevant ARINC characteristics. Their use for intra-system interchangeability is not essential, although it is desired. 

1.1.1  Relationship to Other Documents The material in this Specification is intended to complement other ARINC Characteristics, Specifications and Reports written for avionics. It is also the intent of this document to encourage the use of any standards of good practice, that have been developed by the government, the military and other industry groups, provided they are applicable to airline electronic equipment. When ARINC 429 was originally developed, all ARINC 429 discrete words were defined in this document. However, with the proliferation of ARINC 429 discrete words, the associated ARINC Characteristic and Specification have been maintaining their own discrete word definitions. Tables 1 and 2 to this document have been developed to aid the reader in reviewing the discrete words. Table 1 is sorted by Equipment Identifier and Table 2 is sorted by octal label number. These tables summarize all the discrete words, and refers the reader to the location where the bit definition of that discrete word is maintained. There are numerous cases where a discrete label has been assigned but no source documentation has been identified for the bit description. If this is the case, the source location column will be blank. 

1.2  Organization of ARINC Specification 429 ARINC Specification 429 was originally published in a single volume until version 14 (429-14) was released. The size of the document and the need for improved organization dictated the division of the document into three parts. Those three parts include: Part 1, "Functional Description, Electrical Interface, Label Assignments and Word Formats Part 2, "Discrete Word Data Formats Part 3, "File Data Transfer Techniques" Part 1 provides the basic description of the functions and the supporting physical and electrical interfaces for the data transfer system. Data word formats, standard label and address assignments, and application examples are defined. Part 
2 lists discrete word bit assignments in label order. Part 3 describes protocols and message definitions for data transferred in large blocks and file format. For convenience of the user, the section and attachment numbering has been retained for the material moved from the original Specification to Part 3. Updates to each part of future releases of ARINC 429 will be independent of the other parts to accommodate timely revisions as industry needs dictate. The dash numbers for each new Part will not be synchronized with the other Parts as time passes. Users of ARINC Specification 429 should ensure that the latest version of each Part is used when designing or procuring equipment

COMMENTARY 
The delay from the time a command is activated at the control panel to the time of the equipment response should 
be minimized. [5] Primary display functions are those functions for which a display may have need designed when that display is also 
being used in a shared manner as a Traffic Advisory Display.

IRS/AHRS Bit Explanations 
 
Bit 
 
Function 
11 
Align Mode/NR 
The IRU operating software mode is ALIGN or the initialization of any mode. 
--``,,,````,,,,`,````,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
12 
Reversionary Att Mode 
The IRU operating software is ATT 
13 
NAV Mode 
The IRU operating software mode is NAV 
14 
Set Heading 
Magnetic heading outputs are no longer being calculated but have the characteristics of a "free DG" and a set heading has been input to the IRU. 
15 
Attitude Invalid 
The IRU has detected a failure of attitude, heading, angular body rates, or linear body accelerations (same as FAULT discrete). 
16 
DC Fail 
The IRU DC power input is less than 18 VDC. 
17 
On DC 
The IRU is operating on the DC power input. 
18 
ADC Fault 
ADC inflight fault, but power on BitE found no faults with the IRU ADC input channel. 
19 
IRU Fault 
The BitE has detected a fault not annunciated in BitS 18, 21, 22, 23, of 24. 
20 
DC Fail - On DC 
The DC power input was not available when required by the IRU. This condition shall be reset only by power on initialization. 
21 
Align Fault 
Failed the IRU operating software ALIGN criterion, but neither power on nor continuous BitE show any faults. 
22 
No IRS Initialization 
No input or an incorrect input has been received from the IRMP or FMCs. 
23 
Excessive Motion Error 
Non-zero ground speed during the ALIGN mode. 
24 
ADC/IRU Fault 
ADC inflight fault, but no power-on BitE information available prior to flight. 
25 
No VOR/DME #1 Input 
 
26 
Align Status 
Align status is represented by a series of descending digits, each indicating a successive state of alignment. Three bits provide a seven state alignment status as stated in Note 1.

 Notes: [1] Attitude invalid is equivalent to AHRS failure. [2] Bit 13 "1" condition indicates that AHRS is in the "Normal" mode as described in Section 1.2.1 of ARINC 
Characteristic 705. A "0" condition indicates that the AHRS is in the reversionary "basic mode." [3] Bit 14 "1" condition indicates that AHRS is in the "Magnetic Heading" mode. A "0" condition indicates the AHRS 
is in the reversionary "DG" mode. See Section 1.2.2 of ARINC Characteristic 705 for description of modes of heading operation.

CAS logic defined by RTCA DO-185 Change 6 does not discreminiate between Climb Corrective and Descend 
Corrective. The omission is expected to be corrected in Change 7. Meanwhile, the receiving RA Display must

[1] Bits 11 to 18 hold an unsigned binary numeral giving the upper display range in 100-foot units.  If the CDTI 
display unit is in relative altitude mode (bit 19 of label 270 is zero), then this is the number shown above and to the right of the "LVL" abbreviation in the lower right corner of the display.  If the CDTI display unit is in pressure altitude mode (bit 19 of label 270 is 1), then the number shown above and to the right of the "LVL" abbreviation is the sum of the number in bits 11 to 18 of label 270 and the own-ship pressure altitude in 100-foot units. 
 
[2] Bits 19 to 26 hold an unsigned binary numeral giving the lower display range in 100-foot units. If the CDTI display 
unit is in relative altitude mode (bit 19 of label 270 is zero), then this is the number shown below and to the right of the "LVL" abbreviation in the lower right corner of the display.  If the CDTI display unit is in pressure altitude mode (bit 19 of label 270 is 1), then the number shown below and to the right of the "LVL" abbreviation is the difference, own-ship pressure altitude minus in 100-foot units minus the number in bits 19 to 26 of label 271. [3] 0 = "Look Up" settings, 
1 = "Look Down" settings, 
2 = "Level (LVL)" settings,

## Arinc Ia Project Initiation/Modification (Apim) Guidelines For Submittal

1. 

ARINC Industry Activities Projects and Work Program A project is established in order to accomplish a technical task approved by one or more of the committees (AEEC, AMC, FSEMC) Projects generally but not exclusively result in a new ARINC standard or modify an existing ARINC standard. All projects are typically approved on a calendar year basis.  Any project extending beyond a single year will be reviewed annually before being reauthorized. The work program of Industry Activities (IA) consists of all projects authorized by AEEC, AMC, or FSEMC (The Committees) for the current calendar year. 

The Committees establish a project after consideration of an ARINC Project Initiation/Modification (APIM) request. This document includes a template which has provisions for all of the information required by The Committees to determine the relative priority of the project in relation to the entire work program. All recommendations to the committees to establish or reauthorize a project, whether originated by an airline or from the industry, should be prepared using the APIM template.  Any field that cannot be filled in by the originator may be left blank for subsequent action. 

## 2. Normal Apim Evaluation Process Initiation Of An Apim

All proposed projects must be formally initiated by filling in the APIM template. An APIM may be initiated by anyone in the airline community, e.g., airline, vendor, committee staff. 

## Staff Support

All proposed APIMs will be processed by committee staff.  Each proposal will be numbered, logged, and evaluated for completeness.  Proposals may be edited to present a style consistent with the committee evaluation process.  For example, narrative sentences may be changed to bullet items, etc. When an APIM is complete, it will be forwarded to the appropriate Committee for evaluation. The committee staff will track all ongoing projects and prepare annual reports on progress.   

## Committee Evaluation And Acceptance Or Rejection

The annual work program for each Committee is normally established at its annual meeting.  Additional work tasks may be evaluated at other meetings held during the year.  Each committee (i.e., AMC, AEEC, FSEMC) has its own schedule of annual and interim meetings. 

The committee staff will endeavor to process APIMs and present them to the appropriate Committee at its next available meeting.  The Committee will then evaluate the proposal.  Evaluation criteria will include: 
- Airline support - number and strength of airline support for the project, 
including whether or not an airline chairman has been identified 
- Issues - what technical, programmatic, or competitive issues are 
addressed by the project, what problem will be solved 
- Schedule - what regulatory, aircraft development or modification, 
airline equipment upgrade, or other projected events drive the urgency for this project  
Accepted proposals will be assigned to a subcommittee for action with one of two priorities:  
- High Priority - technical solution needed as rapidly as possible - Routine Priority - technical solution to proceed at a normal pace 
Proposals may have designated coordination with other groups.  This means that the final work must be coordinated with the designated group(s) prior to submittal for adoption consideration. Proposals that are not accepted may be classified as follows: 
- Deferred for later consideration - the project is not deemed of sufficient 
urgency to be placed on the current calendar of activities but will be reconsidered at a later date 
- Deferred to a subcommittee for refinement - the subcommittee will be 
requested to, for example, gain stronger airline support or resolve 
architectural issues 
- Rejected - the proposal is not seen as being appropriate, e.g., out of 
scope of the committee

APIM Template  
The following is an annotated outline for the APIM.  Proposal initiators are requested to fill in all fields as completely as possible, replacing the italicized explanations in each section with information as available. Fields that cannot be completed may be left blank.  When using the Word file version of the following template, update the header and footer to identify the project. 

## Arinc Ia Project Initiation/Modification (Apim) Name Of Proposed Project Apim #:  _____

--``,,,````,,,,`,````,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

Name for proposed project. 
Suggested Subcommittee assignment 
Identify an existing group that has the expertise to successfully complete the 
project.  If no such group is known to exist, a recommendation to form a new 
group may be made.  

## Project Scope

Describe the scope of the project clearly and concisely.  The scope should describe "what" will be done, i.e., the technical boundaries of the project. 

Example: "This project will standardize a protocol for the control of printers.  
The protocol will be independent of the underlying data stream or page description language but will be usable by all classes of printers." 

## Project Benefit

Describe the purpose and benefit of the project.  This section should describe 
"why" the project should be done. Describe how the new standard will improve competition among vendors, giving airlines freedom of choice. This section provides justification for the allocation of both IA and airline resources. Example: "Currently each class of printers implements its own proprietary protocol for the transfer of a print job.  In order to provide access to the cockpit printer from several different avionics sources, a single protocol is needed. The protocol will permit automatic determination of printer type and configuration to provide for growth and product differentiation." 

## Airlines Supporting Effort

Name, airline, and contact information for proposed chairman, lead airline, list of airlines expressing interest in working on the project (supporting airlines), and list of airlines expressing interest but unable to support (sponsoring airlines).  It is important for airline support to be gained prior to submittal.  Other organizations, such as airframe manufacturers, avionics vendors, etc. supporting the effort should also be listed. 

## Issues To Be Worked

Describe the major issues to be addressed by the proposed ARINC standard.   
Recommended Coordination with other groups Draft documents may have impact on the work of groups other than the originating group.  The APIM writer or, subsequently, The Committee may identify other groups which must be given the opportunity to review and comment upon mature draft documents. 


## Projects/Programs Supported By Work

If the timetable for this work is driven by a new airplane type, major avionics overhaul, regulatory mandate, etc., that information should be placed in this section.  This information is a key factor in assessing the priority of this proposed task against all other tasks competing for subcommittee meeting time and other resources. 

## Timetable For Projects/Programs

Identify when the new ARINC standard is needed (month/year).  

## Documents To Be Produced And Date Of Expected Result

The name and number (if already assigned) of the proposed ARINC standard to be either newly produced or modified. 

## Comments

Anything else deemed useful to the committees for prioritization of this work. 

## Meetings

The following table identifies the number of meetings and proposed meeting days needed to produce the documents described above.
