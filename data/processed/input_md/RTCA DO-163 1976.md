## I N T Rod U C T Ion

This Document sets forth Minimum Performance Standards for airborne radio communications transmitting and receiving equipment operating within the radio-frequency range of 1.5 MHz to 30 MHz. 

Compliance with these standards by manufacturers and users is recommended as a means of assuring that the equipment will satisfactorily perform its intended function under all conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operations. 

In any application of these minimum performance standards, due allowance should be made, where necessary, for equipments in current use which do not fully meet the standards contained herein. 

It is recognized that any regulatory application of these standards is the responsibility of governmental agencies. 

Inasmuch as the measured values of radio equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the method of measurement, standard test c0nditions and methods of test are also recommended in this Document. 

The word "equipment" as used in this Document includes all of the components or units necessary (as determined by the equipment manufacturer) for the equipment to properly perform .its intended function. 

For example, HF "equipment" may include an antenna and coupler, a transmitter unit, a control box, a power supply, a shock mount, etc. 

In the case of this example, all of the foregoing components or units comprise the "equipment." 
It should not be inferred from this example, however, that every HF "equipment" will necessarily include all of the foregoin~ components. 

This will depend on the design, used by the "equipment" manufacturer.

## Minimum Performance Standards - Airborne High Frequency Radio Communications Transmitting Equipment Operating Within The Radio· Frequency Range Of 1.5 To 30 Megahertz 1.0 General Standards 1.1 Operation Of Controls

The operation of controls intended for use during fl.ight, in all possible combinations and sequences, shall not result in a condition whose·presence or continuation would be detrimental to the continued performance of the equipment. 

## 1.2 Accessibility Of Controls

Controls which are not normally adjusted in flight shall not be readily accessibly to flight personnel. 

## 1.3 Effects Of Test

Unless otherwise provided, the design of the equipment shall be such that, subsequent to the application of the specified tests, no discernible condition exists which \vould be detrimental to the conti:lUed performance of the equipment.

## 2.0 Minimum Performance Standards·Under Standard Conditions

The test procedures applicable to a determination of the performance of transmitting equipment including coupling units and definitions of terms, a~e set forth in Appendix A of this standard. 

These standards apply to transmitters and to th~ 
transmitter portion of transceivers used for airborne high frequency radio communication equipment. 

The transmitters may operate over any specified region within the frequency band from 1.5 to 30 MHz as determined by the manufacturer's ratings. 

The following standards are applicable primarily to the transmission of A3J (upper sideband suppressed carrier) . 

A3H (AME) may be provided for compatibility with existing ground equipment. 

Appropriate standards are given for this provision. 

## 2.1 Rated Power Output

The transmitter shall be capable of delivering a peak envelope power (PEP) equal to or greater than the manufacturer's rating. 

## 2.2 Residual Radiation

When all sources of primary power are connected to the transmitter but the microphone switch is in the 
"open" position, the RF power output at the carrier frequency shall not exceed .02 x 10- 12 W. 

## 2.3 Spectrum Control

The power of any emission supplied to the antenna transmission line shall be attenuated with respect to the peak envelope power (PEP) of the transmitter as follows: 

a. 
All spectrum components at a frequency lower 
in frequency than 100 Hz below the carrier 
frequency and higher in frequency than 2900 Hz 
above the carrier frequency shall be attenuated 
by at least 30 dB. 
b. 
All spectrum components lower in frequency 
than 3.1 kHz below the carrier frequency and 
higher in frequency than 5.9 kHz above the 
4 . 
carrier frequency shall be attenuated by at least 38 dB. 

c. 
All spectrum components ·lower in frequency 
than 6.1 kHz below the carrier frequency 
and higher in frequency than 8.9 kHz above the 
carrier frequency shall be attenuated by at 
least 43 dB. 

## 2.4 Audio Distortion

Individual in-band harmonics of an audio test tone shall be suppressed at least 20 dB below the test tone. 

## 2.5 Audio Frequency Response

The output power of the transmitter shall not vary more than 6 dB when the audio input level is held constant at a level producing an output 6 dB below rated PEP at the frequency of maximum response.and the audio input frequency is varied from 350 to 2500 Hz. 

## 2.6 Sidetone

When sidetone ou"tput is provided, its audio frequency response shall not vary more than 10 dB over the range of 
350 to 2,500 Hz when the level of the audio input to the transmitter is adjusted to produce an output 6 dB below the rated peak envelope power of the transmitter. 

## 2.7 Noise Level

The peak amplitude of the noise on the transmitter output shall not exceed 5% of the RF amplitude of the output signal, when an audio input frequency of 2000 Hz and at a level producing an RF output 6 dB below rated PEP is applied. 

## 2.8 Overmodulation Protection

Some form of overmodulation protection such as ALC 
(Automatic Level Control) shall be provided. 

The protection circuit shall prevent the intermodulation limits of paragraph 2.3 from being exceeded when the transmitter audio input is increased 16 dB from a level which produces an RF output 6 dB below rated PEP. 

2.9 
Carrier Suppression 
The level of the suppressed carrier shall be suppressed at 1e~st 26 dB below the full peak envelope power of the transmitter. 

2.10 
Frequency Stability 
The frequency of the RF carrier shall be within 
±20 Hz of the selected frequency. 

2.11 
AM Equivalent Mode 
When A3H output mode is provided the carrier shall be suppressed not more than 6 dB below the peak envelope power of the transmitter. 

2.12 
Channel Selection Time 
The time required to change from one channel to another shall not exceed 30 sec. 

In the case of a transmitter designed to operate with an antenna coupler, the time required for change from one channel to another is the overall transmitter/coupler time. 

2.13 
Antenna Coupling Circuits ~nd Units 
a. 
Efficiency 
The RF efficiency of antenna coupling circuits and units shall be equal to or greater than the manufacturer's rated efficiency. 

b. 
Power Rating 
The RF power capability of antenna coup1inq circuits and units shall be equal to or greater than the manufacturer's power rating.
