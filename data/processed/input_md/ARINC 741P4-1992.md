the airlines  who  have  a  requirement  or  anticipate  a  requirement, with other aircraft operators, 
with the Military semices having  similar  requirements, and with the  equipment  manufacturers. 
It is released as 
              an ARINC  Equipment  Characteristic  only  when 
                                                         the inkrested  airline  companies 
are in general  agreement.  Such  a

manufacturer's  product  designed  or  built 
                                     to meet the Characteristic. An ARINC Characteristic 
has 
   a  twofold  purpose,  which  is: 

(1) 
TO 
indicate to the 
 
prospective 
 
manufacturers 
 
of 
 
airline 
 
electronic 
 
equipment 
 
the 
considered 
 
opinion 
 
of the airline 
 
technical 
 
people, 
 
coordinated on an industry 
basis,  concerning  requisites of new equipment,  and 
(2) 
T
o
 channel 
 
new 
 
equipment 
 
designs 
 
in 
 
a 
 
direction 
 
which 
can result in the 
maximum  possible  standardization  of  those  physical  and  electrical  characteristics 
which 
 
influence 
 
interchangeability of equipment without seriously hampering 
engineering 
 
initiative.

## 8.0 **Introduction  To  Specification** *And* Description Language

In o r d e r
 
to achieve **interoperability** between aircraft and ground stations world-wide 
 
provided 
 
by 
 
different manufacturers, 
 
the functional 
 
pn>cesses required to support intexworking must be precisely defined. 

These processes are defined i n the form o f functional diagrams in this part of the Characteristic. The 
 
format used is that o f C
m
 
Specification 
 
and 
 
Description Language (SDL) diagrams. 

Although this Characteristic is devoted to the a i r c r a f t
 
h t a h t i o n
,
 
this part also includes the logical description oftheprocessesthatmustbeperformedonthegroundin order to i n t e r w o r k correctly with  the **aircraft** installation.
