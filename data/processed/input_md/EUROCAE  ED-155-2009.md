## Chapter 2-2 Minimum Performance Specification Under Standard Test Conditions (Fixed Recording Systems)

2-2.1 
INTRODUCTION 
The requirements for minimum performance under standard test conditions are flight recording system specific and are detailed in Chapter 3 of each of the relevant function specific Parts of this MOPS. 

## Chapter 2-3 Minimumperformance Specification Under Environmental Test Conditions (Fixed Recording Systems)

2-3.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter specifies environmental test conditions. The equipment shall be tested as defined in EUROCAE ED-14F/RTCA DO-160F "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment", or subsequent issue, using the categories most applicable to the aircraft type, and the location of the equipment to be installed. The final choice of test classes within each environmental category will be defined by the equipment manufacturer. The objective of this level of testing is to prove that the equipment does not present a hazard to the aircraft, and can survive and continue to operate under the environmental conditions to which it will be subjected throughout its life. 

Specific testing may be required to demonstrate that the equipment performs its intended functions when operated over the full environmental conditions to which it has been declared to comply, and throughout the extremes which it may be subjected to during an incident or accident. These tests can be undertaken during the specified ED-14F/RTCA DO-160F tests, or separately. For the purposes of these environmental tests, the term 'equipment' shall be interpreted to include the recording equipment together with its accessories such as shock or anti-vibration mounts, where these are included as part of the installation for that particular aircraft type and equipment location. Analysis may be substituted for a test where its use can be shown to produce equivalent evidence of compliance. NOTE: Additional tests applicable to robustness of the recording medium are required for this specific equipment, as it is necessary for data to be recoverable following incidents and accidents well outside the standard environmental conditions defined in ED-14F/RTCA DO-160F. The extent of such tests is stated in Chapter 2-4. 

## Chapter 2-4 Test Procedures For Crash Survival (Fixed Recording Systems) 2-4.1 General This Section Specifies Crash Survival Tests To Be Applied To The Fixed Robust Recorder Or The Robust Memory Module To Demonstrate Compliance With Paragraph 2-1.14.2.

a 
Prior to commencement of any crash survival testing a known, random digital 
data test pattern shall be recorded in the robust memory module. 
b 
After the test sequence has been performed, this test pattern shall be readily 
recoverable to establish that the bit error rate defined in Chapter 2-4 has not been exceeded. 
c 
On completion of a crash survival test sequence, the recording medium may be 
cleaned and dried. Alterations or repairs between tests shall not be made. 
NOTE 1: 
Microscopic examination of the surface characteristics of memory devices is not acceptable as means of data recovery. 

NOTE 2: 
The repair of individual memory devices is not permitted. 

## 2-4.2 Test Procedures 2-4.2.1 Standard Test Conditions

For the purposes of this chapter, standard test conditions are defined in documents EUROCAE ED-14F/RTCA DO-160F, "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment", paragraph 3.5 as: 

a 
Temperature 
:+15 to +35°C 
b 
Relative Humidity : Not greater than 85% 
c 
Ambient Pressure : 84 to 107 kPa 

## 2-4.2.2 Impact Shock

Subject the test article to an impact shock applied in each direction successively along three mutually orthogonal axes of the test article. The energy content of the impact shock shall be equal to or greater than that provided by a half-sine wave shock of 5 
+/- 1 millisecond duration and a peak acceleration of 9806 m/s2 (1 000  g). An acceptable means of compliance is to generate a trapezoidal shock that has an energy content equivalent to that of a half-sine wave as specified above, as shown in Figure 2-4.1 . The shock impulse shall be measured using a calibrated accelerometer and associated instrumentation having a 3dB response over a range of at least 5 to 250 Hz. The following test procedures apply: 

a 
The test article shall be mounted on the shock test machine in such a manner 
that it can be subject to shock impulses in each direction successively along the three mutually orthogonal axes of the test article. 
b 
Apply a 1 000 g shock impulse of duration 5 (±1) ms, to the article test in a 
direction coincident with the first orthogonal axis. 
c 
Reset the activation mechanism. 
d 
Repeat step b and c above, applying the impulse shock in the remaining five 
directions. 

## 2-4.2.3 Static Crush

a 
Subject the test article to a static crush force of 4.54 kN (1,000 lb) applied 
continuously for a period of 5 minutes. At least four points on the test article, irrespective of its shape, shall be tested including, where applicable, each of the 
main diagonals and each of the main faces. 
b 
The minimum number of tests to be performed will depend on the shape of the 
test article. Where a spherical shaped design is used, at least four tests will be required. For a cuboid shaped design, a total of seven tests will be required e.g. 3 faces plus 4 diagonals. 
c 
The static crush test may be performed using a hydraulic press and pressure 
gauge. 
d 
The test article may be supported in the press by means of circular resilient 
pads with a diameter of 5 cm (2 in) and a thickness of 1.25 cm (0.5 in). 
e 
The crush force shall be adjusted following any collapse to restore the required 
pressure for the full 5 minute period. 

## 2-4.2.4 High Temperature Fire

a 
Subject the test article to a fire producing a minimum thermal flux of 158 kW/m2 
(50 000 Btu/ft2/hour). The entire external surface area of the test article shall be 
exposed to the fire for a continuous period of at least 15 minutes. 
The flame temperature should be 1 100°C nominal. The turbulence and local flame cooling due to the test article under test may cause the temperature to vary between 950°C and 1 100°C. However, the minimum thermal flux stated herein shall be maintained for the duration of the test and monitored by suitable instrumentation. Shielding is not permitted. An acceptable method is to subject the test article to a fire test with flames generated by an arrangement of burners either gas or oil fired. A mix of air and propane gas is the preferred fuel since the mixture burns cleanly and is readily controllable. The mixture is adjusted to obtain a stable flame. 

b 
At the start of the fire tests precondition the test article to a stable internal 
temperature equivalent to that reached after operation at ambient pressure and temperature of 25°C ±5°C. Electronic components external to the robust 
memory module may be removed. 

NOTE: 
        As per ED-14F/DO-160F section 2.1, the equipment is considered 
        stabilised when the temperature of the largest internal mass of the 
        equipment does not vary by more than 2°C per hour. When temperature 
        measurement of the largest internal mass is not practical, the minimum 
        time considered applicable for temperature stabilization shall be two 
        hours. 

c 
Where the effectiveness of the fire protection material decreases during normal 
operation and/or storage of the recording system, precondition the protective material to simulate the effects of ageing e.g. by means of extended pressure 
and temperature cycles. 
d 
A water calorimeter shall be used to calibrate the burner array before the fire 
test is performed. The calorimeter shall be of the dimension shown in Figure 2- 4.2. 
Where other burner calibration methods are used such as electronic radiometry, the method shall be validated against the calorimeter method. 

e 
Figure 2-4.3 shows an example of a suitable test arrangement using propane 
gas burners. The calorimeter is supported on steel angle sections approximately 0.5 m (20 inches) above the ground. The water inlet and outlet 
pipes are passed through an insulating block wall. The purpose of the wall is to 
reflect heat onto the rear of the calorimeter (or recorder) and to prevent the 
water pipes from absorbing heat. The short section of pipes between the wall and the calorimeter should be well insulated. 
f 
The number and capacity of burners, their positions and the gas pressure 
should be adjusted to ensure the required criteria of flame coverage, thermal flux and nominal flame temperature are met. It is important that the source of 
water for the calorimeter, and the source of fuel for the fire, can maintain the required flow rates for the full test period. The flame temperature should be monitored continuously by thermocouples placed approximately 25 mm (1 inch) from the surface of the robust memory module or recording system at the approximate centre of a minimum of three faces. Burner output should be set by adjusting the individual burner gas valves. 
g 
The thermal flux (Q) is given by: 
$\begin{array}{c}\mbox{\rm d}T\,\mbox{\rm x}\,\mbox{\rm F}\,\mbox{\rm x}\,\mbox{\rm SH}\\ \mbox{\rm A}\,\mbox{\rm x}\,\mbox{\rm C}\end{array}$ $\begin{array}{c}\mbox{\rm W/m}^{2}\end{array}$

Where $\mbox{\rm d}T=$ temperature rise in cooling water (${}^{\circ}$C)

$\mbox{\rm F}=$ flow rate of cooling water (kg/s)
SH = specific heat of cooling water (4187 Joules/kg/°C) A 
= surface area of calorimeter (sq. metre) 
C  
= Absorption Constant. (A value of 0.5 shall be used) 

h 
Once the required test conditions have been established, the gas pressure 
should be noted and the supply shut off at the main valve. The individual burner gas valves should not be touched. 
i 
The test article shall be substituted for the calorimeter, by placing it at the centre 
of the fire. Where practicable, the internal temperature of the test article should 
be monitored in order to determine the margin of protection obtained for the particular recording medium. If construction is such that a significant portion of the robust memory module or recording system has been damaged as a result 
of previous tests and is likely to melt or burn away during the test, the robust 
memory module or recording system shall be supported in such a way that the robust memory module will be subjected to the full thermal flux for the duration of the test. 
j 
The fire test is started by turning on the main gas valve. If necessary, this valve 
should be used to control the gas pressure to the level noted in step h above. Flame temperature, as indicated by the external thermocouples, shall be continuously monitored. A higher temperature than that achieved during the 
calorimeter test may be observed due to the presence of the robust memory 
module or recording system. The burner outputs shall not be altered to compensate for this difference. 
k 
At the end of the test period, the burners should be shut off and the robust 
memory module or recording system be allowed to cool naturally in ambient conditions. It is permissible to remove the recording system from the vicinity of the support arrangement. 
NOTE 1: 
The intervals Tr and Tf shall be such that the area under the curve is 
equal to or greater than that of a half-sine wave shock pulse i.e. Area = (5 
x 10-3) x 1000/(Pi/2) = 3.183 g-seconds 
NOTE 2: 
In practice, significant ringing of the shock pulse will be observed. Averaging may be applied to establish the effective pulse shape.

## Section 3 Deployable Recorders Chapter 3-1 General

3-1.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This section details the additional requirements and exceptions that are specific to lightweight deployable recorders. The requirements specified in this section shall be met in addition to the requirements of Section 1 and Section 2, Chapter 2-1 and the appropriate recording system specific parts. It is applicable to any robust recorder that is designed to be deployed, its ancillary equipment and its installation in civil aircraft. 

3-1.2 
DEPLOYABLE RECORDING SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY 
A deployable recorder is a recording medium housed in an enclosure that is automatically deployed (released) from the aircraft at the start of an accident sequence. Its characteristics have the objective of enabling it to land at lower speeds clear of the main aircraft wreckage, or, in the event of an accident over water, its flotation characteristics enable it to float. Since the recorder is no longer with the aircraft it should be equipped with a means to locate it. This type of recorder is attached to the exterior of the airframe, and under normal conditions, functions in the same manner as a fixed recorder. The recorder memory module, beacon transmitters, antennas, battery pack and the survival packaging for these units are all an integral part of the automatic deployable package. The deployable package incorporates flight characteristics that enable it to deploy and rapidly establish a flight trajectory that clears the airframe. Compliance with this section will ensure that deployable systems will perform their function under the conditions encountered in aircraft operations. 

## 3-1.3 Airworthiness And Certification 3-1.3.1 Safety

In addition to the safety requirements specified in paragraph 2-1.3.1, the exterior of the equipment shall have no sharp edges or projections that could damage inflatable survival equipment or injure persons. 

## 3-1.3.2 Documents For Certification

In addition to the certification documents specified in paragraph 2-1.3.4, the following shall be provided. 

a 
Instructions shall be provided for safely removing deployable recorders from the 
aircraft for maintenance purposes. 
b 
The transmission frequency and modulation characteristics of the radio location 
beacon. 

## 3-1.4 Recorder Operation In Addition To The Requirements Defined In Paragraph 2-1.5, The Deployable Recorder Shall Not Continue To Record Once It Has Been Deployed.

3-1.5 
DEPLOYMENT CRITERIA 
a 
The design characteristics of a deployable recorder shall result in the recorder 
landing clear of the aircraft wreckage. 
b 
The unit shall incorporate flight characteristics that enable it to rapidly establish 
a flight trajectory that clears the airframe. 
c 
The unit shall not be given sufficient initial momentum on deployment such that 
its release could endanger ground support personnel or the aircraft itself. 
d 
Sufficient sensors shall be installed and located to detect impact, and water 
immersion resulting from an accident. 
e 
Controls and safeguards shall be in place to prevent inadvertent manual 
deployment. 

## 3-1.5.1 Impact Initiation

a 
There shall be an automatic means of impact detection and deployment 
initiation. Frangible or deformation sensors shall be installed in both the nose and the tail of the aircraft. 
b 
An alternative solution is installation of single or multiple MEMS based G-
switches or accelerometers with deploy algorithms based on industry best practices in crash detection. 
c 
Impact sensors shall be designed such that they will only trigger when the 
structure has been significantly deformed (representing a catastrophic 
accident). 

## 3-1.5.2 Hydrostatic Initiation

For both fixed and rotary wing aircraft, a hydrostatic sensor shall deploy the recorder at a depth of 3m or more. 

## 3-1.6 Crash Survival 3-1.6.1 Deployable Recorder

Paragraph 2-1.3.4 defines the crash survival tests to be performed on the deployable recorder system. 

## 3-1.6.2 Radio Location Beacon

All deployable recorders shall be equipped with a radio location beacon compliant with the requirements of ED-62 or RTCA DO-204A. This beacon shall be part of the deployable package. The radio locating device shall be attached to the deployable recorder such that the aerodynamic properties of the recorder are not adversely affected and the risk of damage to, or separation of, the locating device is minimised. 

In addition to meeting the endurance requirements of ED-62 (50 hours), the 121.5 
MHz homing frequency of the ELT shall operate for a minimum of 100 additional hours, bringing the total minimum operational duration to 150 hours. For the additional 
100 hours duration the ELT is not required to operate at the same power as the initial 50 hours but it shall have a minimum EIRP of 5mW. 

NOTE: 
         Other required characteristics of the radio location beacon are outside the 
         scope of this MOPS. Reference should be made to the applicable 
         equipment standard.

a 
Prior to commencement of any crash survival testing a known, random digital 
data test pattern shall be recorded in the robust memory medium. 
b 
After the test sequences have been performed, this test pattern shall be readily 
recoverable and replayed to establish that the data error rate defined in 2-1.6 
has not been exceeded. 
c 
On completion of a crash survival test sequence, the recording medium may be 
cleaned and dried. Alterations or repairs between tests shall not be made. 
NOTE 1: 
Microscopic examination of the surface characteristics of memory devices is not acceptable as means of data recovery. 

NOTE 2: 
The repair of individual memory devices is not permitted. 

## 3-4.2 Test Procedures 3-4.2.1 Standard Test Conditions

For the purposes of this chapter, standard test conditions are defined in documents EUROCAE ED-14F/RTCA DO-160F, "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment", paragraph 3.5 as: 

a 
Temperature 
:+15 to +35°C 
b 
Relative Humidity : Not greater than 85% 
c 
Ambient Pressure : 84 to 107 kPa 

## 3-4.2.2 Impact Shock

The integrity of the robust recording medium contents and the proper operation of the radio location beacon are to be validated when subjected to the following impact shock test. 

a 
Subject the deployable recorder package, to an impact shock applied to the 
most probable landing attitude in the most damage vulnerable direction. The 
shock shall be such a level as to simulate a landing velocity of 25 m/s (80 ft/s) 
onto a hard surface such as rock, concrete or steel. 
NOTE: 
The definitions of "landing attitude" and "most damage-vulnerable direction" should not be limited to the three primary axes of the recorder. 

b 
The deployable recorder containing the robust memory module shall impact or 
be impacted by a hard surface (50 mm thick steel plate of dimensions greater that the overall dimensions of the recorder) at a minimum impact velocity of 25 m/s (80 ft/s). Figure 3-4.1 illustrates an acceptable impact shock test setup 
for deployable recorders. Figure 3-4.2 illustrates an acceptable method and 
setup for retrieval of the deployable after impact. The mass of the impact plate shall be greater than 10 times the mass of the deployable recorder and experience no yield when subjected to the impact. 

## 3-4.2.3 Radio Location Beacon Transmission

Place the deployable recorder in a shielded bag and confirm that the beacon transmits on 121.5 MHz with required power output for at least 150 hours. 

## 3-4.2.4 Seaworthiness

The deployable package shall be buoyant and sufficiently self-righting in fresh and salt water to maintain the antenna substantially in its normal operating position. This shall be demonstrated by testing with fresh and then salt water and confirming the reception of 121.5 MHz transmissions from the transmitter. This test shall be performed in water conditions representative of an open sea state 7 (equivalent to Beaufort scale force 10). 

## 3-4.2.5 High Temperature Fire

Installed performance criteria are generally the same as those contained in this section, which were verified through bench and environmental tests. However, certain performance parameters may be affected by the physical installation and can only be confirmed after installation. 

## 3-5.2 General Equipment Shall Be Compatible With The Environmental Conditions Present In The Specific Location In The Aircraft Where The Equipment Is Installed.

Where the system is connected to mandatory instruments or data sources used for controlling or indicating the flight path of the aircraft, adequate isolation between the instruments or data sources and the flight recording system shall be provided. Particular attention shall be given to ensuring that the segregation required between critical components or systems of the aircraft e.g. power plant installation segregation, is not violated by the installation of the flight recording system. 

## 3-5.3 Equipment Installation 3-5.3.1 Aircraft Environment

The flight recording system shall be installed so that it operates within the environmental conditions to which the items of equipment comprising the system have been declared to comply. Operation of the recording system shall not be affected by aircraft manoeuvring or changes in attitude encountered within the certified operational envelope of the aircraft. Operation of the recording system should not be affected by those extreme conditions likely to be encountered during an accident sequence e.g., violent and extreme manoeuvres. 

## 3-5.3.2 Failure Protection

Any probable failure of the flight recording system shall not degrade the airworthiness of the aircraft. 

## 3-5.3.3 Interference Effects

The installed recording system shall not: 

a 
be the source of harmful conducted or radiated interference, nor 
b 
be adversely affected by conducted or radiated interference from other equipment 
or systems installed in the aircraft. 
NOTE: 
Electromagnetic compatibility problems noted after installation of the 
equipment may result from such factors as the design characteristics of previously installed systems or equipment and the physical installation itself. 
It is not intended that the equipment manufacturer design for all installation environments. The installer will be responsible for resolving any incompatibility between the equipment and previously installed equipment. 

## 3-5.3.4 Stray Magnetic Field

When the recording system is placed, either in an operating or non-operating state in an area free from local magnetic disturbances, the stray magnetic field of this equipment shall cause not more than a 1 degree deflection of a magnetic compass when the closest edge of the equipment is at a distance of 300 mm from the compass. 

## 3-5.3.5 Insulation Resistance

The insulation resistance between any exposed conducting material of the recording system (non-electrical circuit) and the electrical circuit of this equipment shall be at least 10 MOhms when measured with an applied voltage of at least 50 volts DC. 

## 3-5.3.6 Inadvertent Turnoff

Protection shall be provided, or the installation shall be designed, to prevent the inadvertent turnoff of the recording system. 

## 3-5.3.7 Aircraft Electrical Power Source

In addition to the requirements of paragraph 2-5.3.7, the electrical supply for the deployment mechanism shall be from a source which provides maximum integrity for system operation under crash conditions including sinking. An independent battery, located immediately adjacent to the deployment mechanism, shall be provided for activation of the mechanism. 

## 3-5.4 Equipment Location 3-5.4.1 Location Of Robust Recorder

In addition to the requirements of paragraph 2-5.4.1, each deployable recorder shall be located and mounted so as to minimise hazards resulting from intended or inadvertent deployment of the recorder. The deployment trajectory shall not create a hazard to the aircraft in any flight condition. The location of the deployable recorder on the airframe shall be established to ensure that the deployed recorder clears the airframe. 

## 3-5.4.2 Fixed Wing Aircraft Installations

The following installation requirements shall be met when designing a deployable recorder installation for fixed wing aircraft: 

a 
The deployable package including the recorder shall be mounted as far aft on the 
airframe as is practicable and where possible in a non-pressurised section of the 
fuselage. Other acceptable locations include the dorsal fin and tail cone. The installation may produce any combination of upward and sideways deployment. It is not acceptable for the recorder to be deployed downwards when the aircraft is in 
a normal range of flight attitudes. 
b 
When the design of the airframe dictates that a pressurised structure is cut, the 
size of the opening shall be limited to the smallest practical size. 
c 
The deployable package shall separate from the aircraft cleanly without striking 
any part of the airframe. Proper deployment shall be achieved for the whole flight envelope including a margin outside the normal flight envelope which might be expected during the initial stages of an accident sequence. Similarly, deployment 
from an aircraft in an unusual attitude should not make the survival of the recorder less likely. In selecting the location of the deployable package, consideration shall 
be given to antennas or other items protruding from the airframe. The airflow 
characteristics which may determine the flight path of the deployed recorder shall be analysed. 
d 
Crash sensors shall be installed and located to detect the earliest indication of a 
accident sequence in order to provide the highest assurance of survival for the deployable package. The positioning of the sensors should take the shape of the aircraft into account (refer to paragraph 3-1.5.1). 
e 
Crash sensors shall be designed to minimise the risk of inadvertent deployment. 
f 
Hydrostatic deployment shall be demonstrated. 

## 3-5.4.3 Helicopter Installations

The following installation requirements shall be met when designing a deployable recorder installation for helicopters: 

a 
The selected location shall provide a deployment trajectory which is clear of the 
airframe and of the rotors when deployed at any point in the flight envelope. It is not acceptable for the recorder to be deployed downwards when the helicopter is in a normal range of flight attitudes. 
b 
Crash sensors shall be installed and located to detect the earliest indication of a 
accident sequence in order to provide the highest assurance of survival for the deployable package. The positioning of the sensors should take the shape of the helicopter into account (refer to paragraph 3-1.5.1). 
c 
Crash sensors shall be designed to minimise the risk of inadvertent deployment. 
d 
Hydrostatic deployment shall be demonstrated. 

## Part I Cockpit Audio Recording Systems Chapter I-1 Introduction I-1.1 Purpose And Scope I-1.1.1 General

This part defines the minimum specification to be met for a Cockpit Audio Recording System. This part shall be read in conjunction with Sections 1 and 2, together with Section 3 if applicable. 

## I-1.1.2 Description Of Content

This part is divided into six Chapters and two Annexes. Chapter I-1 describes typical equipment applications and operational objectives. 

Background material and accident investigation considerations are included together with a description of the CARS. Chapter I-2 defines the general design specification. Chapter I-3 defines the minimum system performance under standard test conditions. Chapter I-4 defines the minimum system performance under environmental test conditions. Chapter I-5 specifies tests and procedures for determining compliance with the performance requirements. Chapter I-6 defines the installed equipment performance requirements including ground tests and flight tests. The Annexes give additional guidance on replay, recording evaluation and maintenance practices. 

## I-1.2 Application I-1.2.1 Cockpit Audio Recording System

Compliance with this Part will ensure that the CARS will perform its intended function under the conditions encountered in aircraft operations. 

## I-1.3 Description Of The System I-1.3.1 Equipment

The CARS may include the following equipments as appropriate to the aircraft: 

a 
Cockpit equipment, including controls for bulk erase functions, failure indication 
and an area microphone with associated preamplifier, 
b 
A robust recorder in which it is recommended that the recording be 
synchronised with the other airborne recording systems and UTC, 
c 
A means of converting the analogue audio signals to a digital format, 
d 
Audio interface equipment, including signal summing amplifiers. 

## I-1.3.2 Operational Considerations

a 
Objectives 
Each CARS should be installed so as to provide with reference to a timescale, simultaneous recordings, on separate channels, of: 

i. 
area microphone -  the aural environment of the cockpit, 
ii. 
pilot's audio -  pilot's headset audio, which may include: 
Pilot's voice communications, radio communications, 
audio signals identifying navigation or approach aids, warnings and alerts introduced into the headsets, public address announcements made by the pilots.  
NOTE: 
Where possible there is significant benefit to recording individual pilots, using hot microphones, on separate pilot audio channels. 

b 
Start and Termination of Recording 
Recorder operation shall be as defined in paragraph 2-1.5. 

## Chapter I-2 Cars Design Specification I-2.1 Equipment Design Specification I-2.1.1 General

This chapter is applicable to the functions of a flight recording system designed to receive, process, record and preserve audio information in accordance with the requirements of this MOPS. These functions shall be performed reliably even under adverse operating conditions including events leading to an accident. 

This section shall be read in conjunction with Section 2, which defines the requirements that are generic to all flight recording systems. 

## I-2.1.2 Recording Techniques

a 
The CARS shall use a digital method of recording and storing the data in a 
robust memory module. 
b 
The area microphone audio information shall be converted to digital format.  
This shall be stored in an unencrypted, uncompressed linear (no µ-law or a-law) PCM, 16 bit, 44.1 kHz. 
NOTE: 
In addition to speech the area microphone recording will contain non 
speech 
audio 
information 
including 
turbine 
frequencies, 
gearbox 
signatures, aerodynamic and mechanical sounds which are invaluable to accident investigators. To ensure these non speech sounds are accurately recorded, codecs which employ psycho-acoustic (e.g. mp3) or predictive (e.g. CELP) methods must not be used. 
c 
The pilot's audio channel(s) audio information shall be converted to digital 
format.  This shall be stored in an unencrypted, uncompressed linear (no µ-law or a-law) PCM, 16 bit, 11.025 kHz, 22.050 kHz or 44.1 kHz. 
d 
Silence editing shall not be used. 
NOTE 1: 
It is acceptable to use the LSB of the 16 bits to encode a serial time stamp. 
NOTE 2: 
The specific format of the storage method has been stipulated to overcome 
industry problems with some of the current methods of recording audio 
whereby details of proprietary audio codecs have been lost over time. 
NOTE 3: 
The requirement to use uncompressed audio improves the recovery strategy with regards to partial file recovery and removes the need for complicated audio quality standards checks such as Speech Transmission Index (STI). 
NOTE 4: 
Simplicity of design suggests that the voice channel is sampled at the same rate as the area microphone. One objective of this standard is to maximize usefulness of the recordings to the owner. To this end, maintaining the same file format for both the area microphone and voice channel simplifies the replay for the end user. 
NOTE 4: 
Physical memory segregation of the audio channels is not required. 

## I-2.1.3 Recording Capacity

The CARS shall be capable of retaining the data recorded during at least the last 2 hours of its operation. The recording of information as separate channels shall be maintained for the entire duration of the recording. 

## I-2.1.4 Means Of Access To Recorded Information

The means for accessing the recorded information shall: 

a 
Not erase, re-write or alter the recording, 
b 
use a standard computer interface and file format (.wav file for example) for 
lossless retrieval of all non-erased audio, 
c 
use a method of audio transfer of erased data that requires removal of the unit 
to a workshop and supports the concept of only accident investigation 
authorities having access to this erased data, 
d 
not require a special key, code, that would otherwise hamper an accident 
investigation authority's access to the recordings. 
NOTE: 
It is not required for the CARS to continue to record audio information whilst the recorded data is retrieved. 

## I-2.1.5 Recording Delay And Synchronisation

a 
Recording Delay: Audio Signals 
The delay in recording the audio signals from the time of reception at the area microphone to the time of recording in the robust memory module shall not exceed 50 milliseconds. For the other channel(s), the delay in recording the audio signals from the time of reception at the recorder input to the time of recording in the robust memory module shall not exceed 50 milliseconds. 

NOTE: 
The installer should minimize the delay in presenting the pilot channel(s) to the CARS. 
b 
Channel Synchronisation: Audio Signals 
The recordings for separate channels shall be made such that, when replayed, the relative time between channels shall not exceed 4 milliseconds over the recording period. 

NOTE: 
The sample triggers for each channel should be derived from the same 
timing source to ensure the recordings stay synchronised. 

## I-2.1.6 Bulk Erase

a 
Provision should be made for a pilot-operated, post-flight bulk erase function. 
b 
After use of a bulk erase function, the recording shall be modified so that it 
cannot be retrieved using any and all normal replay or copying techniques. 
c 
The installation of a bulk erase function should be designed to prevent 
activation during flight and to minimize any inadvertent operation during a crash impact. 
NOTE 1: 
An acceptable means of compliance would be for a bulk erase function to alter only the specific information needed to access or copy the memory using normal replay procedures. The actual data stored in memory need not be deleted or altered. 
NOTE 2: 
Normal replay is audio or audio data retrieval from the system by the pilots and operator to support flight review, by the maintainer to support installation maintenance or by the aircraft constructors and modifiers to support certification of recorder installations. 
NOTE 3: 
In the event of bulk erasure, non-normal replay or copying techniques may be used by the accident investigation authority to retrieve data, if available, for the purposes of conducting an official investigation. 
NOTE 4: 
Non-normal replay is data retrieval from the memory module using 
special techniques available to the recorder manufacturers and accident investigation authorities for dealing with severely damaged recorders. 
NOTE 5: 
Military organisations may use commercial recorders and have different bulk erase requirements. 

## I-2.1.7 Quality And Reliability Of Recording

a 
For each new CARS installation type, the performance of the system and 
quality of recording shall be established by analysis of audio recorded on the ground and in flight (Annex I-A).  
b 
It is recommended that the relevant accident investigation authority should be 
invited by the certification authority to participate in the assessment of new systems and the quality of the recorded audio (I-A.1.6). 

## I-2.1.8 Digital Systems Characteristics

In digital systems, overdrive conditions can result in severe distortion if not properly handled. It is desirable to have the digital system handle an overdrive condition in the same way as an analogue system does. The design of a digital system's input stage should limit the maximum and minimum values of the digital word used to represent the input. This ensures that the system response to an input overdrive condition will be in the form of a predictable clipping at the system output. An output overdrive condition can result when multiple inputs are improperly combined. In digital audio systems, output stage overdrives normally occur in the digital signal processor. A processor will need to be able to handle an overdrive condition in the same way as an analogue system. Operation of a digital signal processor in its overflow or saturation mode would require that any overflow shall set a value at its largest positive or negative value depending on the direction of the overflow. This prevents errors due to wraparound and yields properly limited inputs and outputs. 

## Chapter I-3 Minimum Performance Specification Under Standard Test Conditions I-3.1 Introduction This Chapter Provides The Minimum Performance Specification Of The Equipment And The Levels To Be Demonstrated Under Standard Test Conditions. I-3.1.1 Standard Test Conditions

For the purposes of this chapter, standard test conditions are defined in documents EUROCAE ED-14F/RTCA DO-160F, "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment", paragraph 3.5 as: 

a 
Temperature 
: +15 to +35°C 
b 
Relative Humidity : Not greater than 85% 
c 
Ambient Pressure : 84 to 107 kPa 
In addition to the above, the electrical power supply shall be within the limits specified as Normal in Section 16 of ED-14F/DO-160F or subsequent issue. In the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC power source of variable frequency, unless otherwise specified, tests should be performed at representative input power frequencies with the input frequency adjusted to within 5% of a selected frequency. In the tests that follow, unless otherwise stated, the Reference Signal is defined as a 1 kHz sine wave having an amplitude equal to the maximum level for which the equipment is designed. 

## I-3.2 Recording System Minimum Performance Levels The Recording System Shall Be Tested To Show Compliance With The Following Minimum Performance Levels.

NOTE: 
        Where these paragraphs state requirements regarding the information in 
        the recording medium it should be interpreted as that obtained by 
        numerical analysis of the recorded audio data or as that observed at the 
        output of suitable playback equipment. 

## I-3.2.1 Start-Up And Effects Of Power Interruptions

Following a system electrical power interruption, the characteristics of the CARS 
(including any networks, busses etc) shall be such that: 

a 
Following initial application of power to the CARS and any start logic is satisfied, 
or following an interruption with a duration of more than two seconds, the recording system shall commence and continue to store information, in accordance with the requirements of this MOPS, within 5 seconds, and any built 
in test function shall be completed within 60 seconds. 
b 
All information available at the start of an interruption together with that 
available in the following 2 seconds shall be recorded in the robust memory module. 
c 
After 5 seconds at a normal power level, interruptions with duration of up to 2 
seconds shall have no effect on the CARS, area microphone and CARS control panel (including any interconnecting networks, busses etc). The initial 5 second 
period allows time to recharge the energy storage. 

## I-3.2.2 Signal Level - Balance Between Audio Channels

If more than one pilot audio channel is provided then, when half the Reference Signal Level is applied to the channels, the maximum difference between the signals recovered from each pilot channel shall be less than 3 dB. 

If more than one CAM channel is provided then, when half the Reference Signal Level is applied to the channels, the maximum difference between the signals recovered from each CAM channel shall be less than 3 dB. 

## I-3.2.3 Audio Frequency Response

a 
When half the Reference Signal level is applied to the input of the area 
microphone channel and its frequency is swept continuously at a rate not exceeding 0.1 octaves per second over the range defined in Table I-3.1. The level of the signal recovered from the memory shall not vary by more than a total range of +/- 3 dB. 
b 
In respect of the pilot audio channels, the above requirement shall be met for a 
signal frequency range of at least 150 Hz to 5 kHz. For frequencies below 150 
Hz, all pilots audio channels shall attenuate the signals at a nominal 12 dB per 
octave.  A second order high-pass filter characteristic shall be used. 
c 
In respect of the area microphone channel, the above requirement shall be met 
for a signal frequency range of at least 150 Hz to 20 kHz. For frequencies below 150 Hz, area microphone channel shall attenuate the signals at a nominal 12 dB per octave.  A second order high-pass filter characteristic shall be used. 
NOTE: 
There is a significant value to the mechanical signatures that would be 
found below 150 Hz. However, there is also the potential for significant audio energy in this region which could saturate the recording. Therefore, it is desirable to have a second order roll off of the frequency response below 150 Hz rather than a step attenuation. 

## I-3.2.4 Audio Noise Level - Signal To Noise

With no signal applied to any input channel, the reproduced signal shall be below the output level produced by an input Reference Signal by the value defined in Table I- 3.1. This requirement shall be met across the frequency band as defined in Table I-3.1 
with the input both open and short circuited. The above Signal to Noise performance shall be met in the presence of out-of-band input signals at the Reference level when tested in accordance with paragraph I-5.2.3. 

NOTE: 
If audio channels are specified with the audio frequency response of the area channel, the area channel out-of-band signal definition shall apply. 

## I-3.2.5 Audio Noise Level - Total Harmonic Distortion Plus Noise (Thd+N)

The reproduced total harmonic distortion plus noise shall not exceed the value defined in Table I-3.1 when measured in the stated frequency band at input levels of 0 to -
20 dB relative to the stated channel signal level. 

NOTE: 
Overdrive considerations are discussed in paragraph I-2.1.8. 

## I-3.2.6 Cross-Talk Between Audio Channels

When the Reference Signal is applied to any one of the inputs of the required audio recording channel, the level of the signal, recorded on that part of the memory assigned to each of the other recording channels, shall be below the level recorded on the intended channel by at least the amount defined in Table I-3.1. 

I-3.3 
AREA MICROPHONE AND PREAMPLIFIER 
The microphone sensitivity and output impedance are not controlled by this document. These values should be chosen for compatibility with the microphone preamplifier and the combination specified together as a complete unit. 

NOTE: 
The use of separate specifications for the area microphone and 
preamplifier does not preclude combining any or all of the functions in a single unit. 

## I-3.3.1 Frequency Response - Area Microphone

The output level of the microphone shall comply with the frequency response requirements listed in Table I-3.1. This requirement shall be met over a sound pressure input range of 60 dB to 94 dB above 20 µPa. 

## I-3.3.2 Total Harmonic Distortion Plus Noise - Area Microphone

The total harmonic distortion plus noise contributed by the microphone shall be less than 1% (-40dB) at sound pressure levels up to 120 dB above 20 µPa in a free field at 1 kHz when measured in a 22 kHz bandwidth (unweighted). 

## I-3.3.3 Polar Response - Area Microphone

The directivity or polar response pattern of the Cockpit Area Microphone is not specified by this MOPS. 

NOTE: 
The best microphone response pattern will be dictated by the location of 
the microphone in the cockpit and the need to detect pertinent airframe, power plant, avionics and pilots activity sounds while rejecting airflow and other extraneous sounds.  The use of windscreens and isolation devices may also be necessary to ensure that ventilation airflow or airframe 
vibrations do not saturate the microphone input. 

## I-3.3.4 Frequency Response - Microphone Preamplifier

The microphone preamplifier shall comply with the frequency response requirements listed in Table I-3.1. 

NOTE: 
There is a significant value to the mechanical signatures that would be found below 150 Hz.  However, there is also the potential for significant audio energy in this region which could saturate the recording. Therefore, it is desirable to have a second order roll off of the frequency response 
below 150 Hz rather than a step attenuation. 

## I-3.3.5 Total Harmonic Distortion Plus Noise - Area Microphone Preamplifier

The total harmonic distortion plus noise of the output signal shall not exceed 0.1% for input signals within the range 150 Hz to 20 kHz when measured within a 22 kHz bandwidth (un-weighted). This requirement shall be met for input signals up to the level produced by the microphone for which the equipment is designed, when it is exposed to a sound pressure level of 120 dB above 20 µPa. 

## I-3.3.6 Signal To Noise Ratio - Area Microphone Preamplifier

The level of any noise at the output of the preamplifier shall be as least 80 dB below the level of an output signal corresponding to the maximum input signal. This requirement shall be met for input signals up to the level produced by the microphone for which the equipment is designed, when it is exposed to a sound pressure level of 120 dB above 20 μPa. 

NOTE: 
The high dynamic range enables the simplification of traditional systems 
by removing the need for Automatic Gain Control (AGC), as well as enabling the same standard unit to transfer from the audio environment of a noisy helicopter to a quiet balloon. 

## I-3.3.7 Output Level - Microphone Preamplifier

When the input level of the preamplifier signal corresponds to a sound pressure level at the microphone of 120 dB above 20 µPa, the output shall not exceed the maximum input level for which the recorder is designed. AGC shall not be used.

## Chapter I-5 Test Procedures

I-5.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter specifies the standard test procedures for demonstrating compliance with Chapter I-2 and Chapter I-3. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognised that they will not apply in all cases and that other methods may be preferred or required. Alternative methods may be used if the manufacturer can show that they provide equivalent certification data. Where a test procedure is not specified for a particular performance parameter, the manufacturer may show compliance either by analysis or by devising a test appropriate to the equipment design. All test measurements shall be traceable to a recognized calibration standard. 

Traditional Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) systems, including the replay facilities, recorded analogue audio and reproduced analogue audio, often with little practical access to the signal or data being used between these processes. Digital audio technology has significantly changed since early digital CVRs and become more commonly available.  This standard describes a CARS in which the output is the digital data representing the audio and can be more openly accessed than with traditional CVRs.  In this case, there may be little or no control over the standards of the equipment used to convert the digital data back into audible signals. The CARS described within this standard need not have an analogue audio output at all.  Therefore, it may be more practical to analyse the recorded digital data against known analogue test signals rather than comparing the analogue input and output signals as per traditional test techniques. 

## I-5.1.1 Adjustment Of Equipment

The equipment under test shall be properly aligned and adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. 

## I-5.1.2 Test Instrument Precautions

Precautions shall be taken to prevent the introduction of errors resulting from impedance mismatch and the improper connection of test instruments to the equipment under test. 

## I-5.1.3 Test Conditions

Unless otherwise stated, the test procedures of this chapter apply to systems with analogue inputs and analogue outputs. Where parts of the system use digital processing, the test procedures assume that interface conversion equipment appropriate to the recovery of the recorded information and which match the performance characteristics of the system to be certified, are used. Unless specified as part of environmental testing, all tests shall be performed under the conditions specified in paragraph III-3.1. 

## I-5.1.4 Connected Loads

Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed with the equipment connected to loads having the impedance values for which it is designed. 

## I-5.1.5 Warm-Up Period

Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed after a warm-up (stabilisation) period of not less than 5 minutes and not more than 15 minutes. 

## I-5.1.6 Recording Of Test Results

Except where tests are "Pass / Fail" in character, the actual numerical values obtained for each of the parameters tested shall be recorded in a qualification test report.

Replay the recording and measure the output level and frequency. Determine the level variation over the frequency band. Repeat the test with the input signal adjusted as appropriate to the channel under test. Where the recorded signal is reprocessed after a 30 minute period, recheck the output level and frequency, then determine the level variation over the frequency band for this condition.

Simultaneously, use an oscilloscope to ensure there are no parasitic oscillations during the sweep. Determine the maximum and minimum output levels between 150 Hz and 20 kHz. Calculate the dB difference between the two levels. Calculate the slope of the high-pass filter from 22 Hz to 150 Hz. Reduce the input level to produce one tenth the rated output level and repeat the measurement. At no time during this test shall the system be in an output limiting state. If limiting occurs, drop the input level below limiting and repeat the test. The test frequency sweep rate shall be limited to ensure that high Q system response will not be missed.

## Chapter I-6 Equipment Installation And Installed Performance I-6.1 Introduction This Chapter Specifies Installation Characteristics And Performance With Procedures For Verifying That Performance When The Equipment Is Installed In An Aircraft.

Installed performance criteria are generally the same as those contained in Chapter I-
3, which were verified through bench and environmental tests. However, certain performance parameters may be affected by the physical installation and can only be confirmed after installation. In some installations, audio system overdrive conditions may occur, resulting in clipping of waveforms.  Attenuation strapping should be used to prevent overdrive conditions in any/all normal aircraft audio environments, especially during flight. 

## I-6.1.1 Interface Design

a 
Figure I-6.1 of this chapter illustrates possible CARS configurations. 
b 
Impedance and signal levels shall be such that a satisfactory recording is 
obtained without unwanted coupling between the audio system microphone and telephone circuits. With all telephone inputs set to provide maximum signal to the audio but not selected to be active on the audio control panel (if installed), and with a long term rms input to the microphone, the input level at the CARS should be the long term rms level. The appropriate measures, which may include the utilization of the selectable attenuation capability of the pre-amplifier 
and pilots audio channel(s) inputs, shall be appropriately adjusted as determined by installation configuration. 
c 
Hot microphone, interphone, and radio reception (if applicable) 
With high volume control settings, the relative levels of the microphone and telephone signals shall be such that, at the summing point, the microphone signal exceeds the level of its corresponding sidetone signal on a high percentage of occasions. With an input signal to the microphone equivalent to a moderate speech level (note 1) and with input to the radio reception equivalent to a strong reception signal (note 2), when volume control settings are high (note 3), the level of the recorded microphone signal (hot microphone included), shall be greater than the radio reception signal level on the majority of occasion whether interphone is in use or not. 

NOTE 1: 
          According to ARINC 538 and D0-214 definitions, a moderate speech level 
          (or average speech level) could be considered with SPL (Sound Pressure 
          Level) of 98 dB (re: 20 μPa), which is around 65 mV ±3 dB. 

NOTE 2: 
According to ARINC 716 definition, transceiver nominal output level could 
be considered as a strong level for 2.5V (10 mW on 600Ω). 
NOTE 3: 
High volume control settings could be considered with a value greater than 65%. 
d 
Hot microphone, radio transmission, and interphone, when PTT is activated (if 
applicable) 
The phase of any sidetone signal measured at the summing point should be within 50 degrees of the corresponding microphone signal. Where sidetone phase is uncontrolled, it is permissible for the sidetone signal to the summing point to be attenuated during radio transmissions or when interphone is selected (PTT activated). A sufficient attenuation factor will be applied in order to avoid signal cancellation effect greater than 3 dB. 

e 
In reference to paragraphs c and d above, the hot microphone signal shall not 
be attenuated. 
f 
If hot microphones are employed, then in order to maintain continuous 
microphone recordings by the CARS during periods when radio transmitters or 
interphone are not selected, an energising supply shall be provided for carbon 
or simulated carbon microphones. This supply may be derived from the electrical supply to the summing amplifier but shall be interrupted if and when the microphone is energised by a radio transmitter of the interphone system. 
g 
Transients caused by microphone switching should be suppressed to avoid 
blocking of any recording channel.  
 

## I-6.2 Equipment Installation I-6.2.1 Area Microphone Location

Particular attention shall be given by installers to the location of the area microphone. 

To aid in voice and sound discrimination, general rules for optimum performance are: 

a 
Position the microphone for recording general cockpit sounds, voice 
communications originating at the pilot and co-pilot stations, voice communications of other pilots in the cockpit when directed to those stations, 
and for helicopters, transmission gearbox sounds. In certain cases, it may be 
necessary to install an additional area microphone in order to obtain adequate 
recordings of cockpit and/or transmission gearbox sounds. 
b 
Correct phasing of microphones needs to be observed.  
c 
Position the microphone to minimize noise from vents, fans, windshield wipers 
and other undesirable acoustic noise generators. Additionally, to minimise 
airstream noise, the installer should consider isolation of the microphone from structure connected to the aircraft skin. 
d 
Position the microphone away from cockpit loudspeakers. 
e 
Position the microphone such that it cannot be obstructed by loose articles e.g. 
navigation charts. 
f 
Position the microphone such that it is unlikely to be damaged during pilots 
entry to, or exit from the cockpit. 
NOTE: 
it is recommended that the microphone is not installed on the lower centre console. 

## I-6.2.2 Bulk Erase Control

The installation of a bulk erase control should be designed to prevent activation during flight and to minimize any inadvertent operation during a crash impact. 

## I-6.2.3 Quality Of Recording

For the first installation of a new combination of equipment and airframe the quality of the recording shall be established by analysis of information recorded on the ground and in flight. The replay and evaluation will need to be performed after the flight test.  
If mandated by the Certification Authority, verification of the flight test recording shall be performed by an approved readout and replay centre. 

## I-6.3 Ground Test Procedures I-6.3.1 General

This section provides guidance for ground testing prototype installations. It may need to be adapted to suit the particular installation configuration being tested and to comply with operating regulations.  

## I-6.3.2 Conformity Inspection

a 
Visually inspect the installed equipment to determine the use of acceptable 
workmanship and engineering practices. 
b 
Verify that proper mechanical and electrical connections have been made and 
that the equipment has been located and installed in accordance with the requirements and the manufacturer's recommendations. 

## I-6.3.3 Interference Effects

a 
With the recording equipment in normal and standby operation, operate other 
electrically operated aircraft equipment and systems to determine that no significant levels of conducted or radiated interference exist. 
b 
Evaluate all combinations of control settings and operating modes. 
c 
Operate communication and navigation equipment on the low, high and at least 
one mid-band frequency. 
d 
Identify systems or modes of operation that should be evaluated during flight. 
e 
If appropriate, repeat the tests using emergency power with the aircraft's 
batteries alone and any standby inverters operating. 

## I-6.3.4 Power Supply Fluctuations And Protection

a 
Under normal aircraft conditions, cycle the aircraft engine(s) through all normal 
power settings and verify the proper operation of the equipment. 
b 
Isolate the electrical supply to the recording system by means of the protective 
devices provided (e.g. circuit breakers) and verify that the equipment is off. 

## I-6.4 Flight Test Procedures I-6.4.1 General

a 
This section provides guidance for flight testing prototype installations. It may 
need to be adapted to suit the particular installation configuration being tested and to comply with operating regulations. 
b 
Each newly installed CARS shall be flight tested, and the recording so obtained 
shall be evaluated to show adequate recording quality during all normal regimes of flight including taxiing, takeoff, cruise, approach and landing. For helicopters, hover and autorotation should be included. 
c 
Since the duration of the recording may be limited, the test flight should be 
carefully planned. The CARS circuit breaker can be tripped between each test phase and at the end of the landing run if the flight is likely to exceed the recording duration limit. 
d 
Systems which generate sounds in the cockpit and which might not otherwise 
be used during the test flight, should be operated with appropriate 
announcements by the pilots. 
e 
To enable proper analysis of the recording, it is essential that adequate 
commentary on the flight is provided, e.g. pilots actions, altitudes and speeds. 
Each test should be clearly announced and the pilot identified, e.g. "Co-pilot testing oxygen mask microphone with interphone off". 
f 
If mandated by the certification authority, verification of the flight test recording 
shall be performed by an approved read-out and replay centre. Refer to Annex 
I-A.

## I-6.4.8 Follow-On Cars Installations

There is no requirement for dedicated ground or flight test, however following installation, recorded flight data should be reviewed to confirm functionality at the earliest opportunity. 

## Annex I-A Post Flight Evaluation Of Recordings I-A.1 Introduction

I-A.1.1 
Following the flight testing of each new CARS installation type, the recording so 
obtained shall be evaluated to confirm adequate quality. Similarly, it will be necessary 
to evaluate recordings obtained on a sampling basis from in-service flying or following cockpit modification which may change the audio environment, to ensure that quality is maintained. 
I-A.1.2 
It is recommended that the replay equipment be located in a clean, quiet area which is 
separated from other work areas sufficiently to ensure the privacy of recordings and to protect other staff from exposure to irritating noise. Access to the replay equipment 
should be restricted to authorised personnel only.  
I-A.1.3 
Provision shall be made for the secure storage of CARS recording media and any 
copies made. 
I-A.1.4 
The replay and evaluation of recordings shall be performed by personnel with 
adequate knowledge of CARS and aircraft operations, and who have appropriate 
experience of the techniques used to evaluate recordings. 
I-A.1.5 
The recording evaluated shall be the original recording that is stored in the robust 
memory module. 
NOTE 1: 
Accident investigation authorities may be able to provide demonstrations 
which would assist the training of personnel. 
NOTE 2: 
Where possible, replay personnel should be given the opportunity to 
accompany the pilots on a CARS test flight in order to become familiar with the test procedure. 
I-A.1.6 
A test report and certification in a format acceptable to the certification authority shall 
be required to record the observations made from evaluation of the recording. 

## I-A.2 Replay Equipment

I-A.2.1 
Experience has shown that a multi-channel replay method re-creates the flight 
conditions with a measure of realism which assists subjective evaluation of the recording. For this reason, the evaluation of recordings from new CARS installations should involve replay on equipment capable of multi-channel reproduction. 
I-A.2.2 
The recording should be replayed for qualitative review and analysed quantitatively to 
check recorded signal levels. 

## I-A.3 Recording Evaluation

I-A.3.1 
The recording on each channel shall be checked to confirm that the required input 
sources are connected to the CARS system, and that recorded levels and signal 
quality are acceptable. 
I-A.3.2 
In general, the proper recording level will be confirmed to show that the full recording 
dynamic range has been achieved without clipping of peak signals. A check should be 
made to confirm that adequate signal to noise ratios exist for all significant input signals, and that signal levels are reasonably balanced between the channels. Signal quality may be confirmed during subjective listening checks and by ensuring that the 
recording is free from electrical interference and from the effects of vibration. The presence of cockpit sounds, pilots speech and audible warnings should be confirmed on the area microphone channel.  
NOTE 1: 
A low level of AC power interference may be tolerated. 
NOTE 2: 
To avoid signal cancellation effects, and to ensure that incoming radio 
messages do not mask pilots speech, with a moderate speech level (refer to paragraph I-6.1.1) levels of telephone signals, at high volume control settings (greater than 65%), should be preset lower than the CARS hot microphone signal level. 
I-A.3.3 
For combined CARS and ADRS, flight data recordings may be verified by correlating 
data values against announcements made by the pilots, and by ensuring that the parameter range and resolution available are sufficient to meet the specified range/accuracy requirements. 

NOTE: 
        Further verification of data accuracy may be required by the certification 
        authority. This aspect of data verification is the subject of Part II of this 
        document. 

## I-A.4 Test Report

I-A.4.1 
A suitable report is shown in Table I-A.1. This will need to be tailored to match the 
aircraft installation configuration. The report may be supplemented by graphic evidence obtained from selected extracts of the recording. 
I-A.4.2 
The spaces on the report, as applicable, should be annotated with brief comments on 
the replay signal quality.

Certified that the above mentioned recording has been evaluated in accordance with the terms of the contract/order applicable thereto and the requirements of the Certification Authority relating to the evaluation of such recordings. 

## Annex I-B Maintenance Practices I-B.1 General

I-B.1.1 
The maintenance tasks required to ensure the continued serviceability of the installed 
CARS will depend on the extent of monitoring built into the CARS. Appropriate inspections and functional checks, together with the intervals at which these should be performed are described in Table I-B.1. 
I-B.1.2 
Maintenance procedures should emphasise the need to preserve the recording 
following a reported incident. 

## I-B.2 Recording Evaluation

I-B.2.1 
An in-flight recording should be replayed and assessed for quality. Annex I-A provides

## Chapter Ii-5 Test Procedures

II-5.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter specifies the standard test procedures for demonstrating compliance with Chapter II-2 and Chapter II-3. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognised that they will not apply in all cases and that other methods may be preferred or required. Alternative methods may be used if the manufacturer can show that they provide equivalent certification data. Where a test procedure is not specified for a particular performance parameter, the manufacturer may show compliance either by analysis or by devising a test appropriate to the equipment design. All test measurements shall be traceable to a recognized calibration standard. 

## Ii-5.1.1 Adjustment Of Equipment

The equipment under test shall be properly aligned and adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. 

## Ii-5.1.2 Test Instrument Precautions

Precautions shall be taken to prevent the introduction of errors resulting from impedance mismatch and the improper connection of test instruments to the equipment under test. 

## Ii-5.1.3 Test Conditions

Unless otherwise stated, the test procedures of this chapter apply to systems with analogue inputs and analogue outputs. Where parts of the system use digital processing, the test procedures assume that interface conversion equipment appropriate to the recovery of the recorded information and which match the performance characteristics of the system to be certified, are used. Unless specified as part of environmental testing, all tests shall be performed under the conditions specified in paragraph II-3.1. 

## Ii-5.1.4 Connected Loads

Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed with the equipment connected to loads having the impedance values for which it is designed. 

## Ii-5.1.5 Warm-Up Period

Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed after a warm-up (stabilisation) 
period of not less than 5 minutes and not more than 15 minutes. 

## Ii-5.1.6 Recording Of Test Results

Except where tests are "Pass / Fail" in character, the actual numerical values obtained for each of the parameters tested shall be recorded in a qualification test report. 

## Ii-5.2 Electrical Test Procedures Ii-5.2.1 Bit Error Rate (Paragraph 2-1.6)

It shall be verified that the bit error rate arising from differences between the recorded and the retrieved data caused by corruption of the data during processing, recording and retrieval does not exceed the specification in paragraph 2-1.6. 

a 
Equipment Required: 
Basic simulation of start/stop conditions, Readout Tool, such as a computer and appropriate software, to process the recorded data. 

b 
Measurement Procedure: 
Apply power to the recording system and set the starting conditions to true. Continue recording for the duration specified in paragraph II-2.1.3. Set the stop conditions to true and readout the recorded data. Verify that bit errors or discontinuities in recovered data are within the allowance of paragraph 2-1.6. 

 

## Chapter Ii-6 Equipment Installation And Installed Performance

II-6.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter specifies ADRS installation characteristics and performance with procedures for verifying that performance when the system is installed in an aircraft. Installed performance criteria are generally the same as those contained in Chapter II- 3, which were verified through bench and environmental tests. However, certain performance parameters may be affected by the physical installation and can only be confirmed after installation. 

## Ii-6.2 Equipment Installation Ii-6.2.1 Acceleration Sensors

Acceleration data shall be obtained from sensors which are rigidly attached. When practicable these sensors should be aligned with aircraft main axes. Sensor location and alignment should be documented. 

## Ii-6.3 Installation Calibration And Correlation Tests Ii-6.3.1 General

A schedule of tests should be prepared by the equipment installer. For the prototype installation, a comprehensive programme of tests should be performed, as described in paragraph II-6.4. 

## Ii-6.3.2 Installation Tests

Proper functioning of a newly installed ADRS may be determined by a combination of ground and flight tests. Ground testing should confirm the accuracy of recorded parameters throughout their whole operational range where practicable. The flight test should validate the consistency of the recorded data with indications in the cockpit. 

## Ii-6.4 Initial Aircraft Data Recording System Installation The Following Tests Shall Be Performed For Certification Of An Initial Adrs Installation.

a 
With the ADRS operating, perform a calibration check of all parameters and 
discretes. All sensors or transducers should be exercised over their effective 
range and all discretes exercised through their 'off' / 'on' states. Specific test points should be recorded to enable replay to confirm values. 
b 
Sensors which may not be practical to exercise or stimulate for the purpose of 
calibration tests (e.g. airspeed and altitude) may be simulated by appropriate test equipment. 
c 
Each calibration point should be predetermined and tabulated on a calibration 
record sheet. The calculated value for each calibration point should be shown on the record sheet and the test operator should enter the value of the recorded data. 
d 
Where the output of a sensor is indicated on cockpit instruments and/or 
displays, the correlation between the indicated value and the predetermined calibration point should be established. 
e 
Where a sensor output does not provide a cockpit indication or where it results 
in an indication with resolution too low for correlation, (e.g. position of flight control surfaces) angle-measuring devices such as clinometers should be used 
to set predetermined test points required for calibration. 
f 
The number of correlation or test points for non-linear parameters must be 
sufficient to precisely define the relationship between the recorded value and measured value over the full operating range of the parameter within the accuracy required by Table II-B.1. The correlation between recorded and measured values for linear parameters can be established with three test 
points, one at the mid or null point and the others at each end point of the operating range. Test points should include upper, transition and lower values (e.g. left, zero and right lateral deviation) and should confirm test points denoting to, from, north, south, east, west, plus, minus, etc. For parameters 
derived from cockpit controls having discrete detent positions (e.g. throttles, flaps), each detent position should be tested. 

## Ii-6.5 Ground Test Procedures Ii-6.5.1 General

This section provides guidance for ground testing prototype installations. It may need to be adapted to suit the particular installation configuration being tested and to comply with operating regulations. 

## Ii-6.5.2 Conformity Inspection

a. 
Visually inspect the installed equipment to determine the use of acceptable 
workmanship and engineering practices. 
b. 
Verify that proper mechanical and electrical connections have been made and 
that the equipment has been located and installed in accordance with the requirements and the manufacturer's recommendations. 

## Ii-6.5.3 Equipment Function

Vary all controls of the equipment through their full range to determine that the equipment is operating according to the manufacturer's instructions and that each control performs its intended function. 

## Ii-6.5.4 Interference Effects

a 
With the recording equipment in normal and standby operation, operate other 
electrically operated aircraft equipment and systems to determine that no significant levels of conducted or radiated interference exist. 
b 
Evaluate all combinations of control settings and operating modes. 
c 
Operate communication and navigation equipment on the low, high and at least 
one mid-band frequency. 
d 
Identify systems or modes of operation that should be evaluated during flight. 
e 
If appropriate, repeat the tests using emergency power with the aircraft's 
batteries alone and any standby inverters operating. 

## Ii-6.5.5 Power Supply Fluctuations And Protection

a 
Under normal aircraft conditions, cycle the aircraft engine(s) through all normal 
power settings and verify the proper operation of the equipment. 
b 
Isolate the electrical supply to the recording system by means of the protective 
devices provided (e.g. circuit breakers) and verify that the equipment is off. 

## Ii-6.6 Flight Tests The Flight Test Should Validate The Consistency Of The Recorded Data Through The Use Of Cockpit Indications.

The flight test shall be performed after the ground test and while it should be of minimal duration, should nevertheless be of sufficient length to determine if there has been any degradation of the recorded data when compared with the ground correlation and calibration data and to validate all parameters that can only be exercised during the aircraft's in-flight (dynamic) condition. The certification flight test of the initial ADRS installation shall include specific test points of all parameters and should cover takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, approach and landing. The test schedule should include test points for the following where practicable: 

a 
Instrument and/or electronic display readings and recordings made at intervals 
during the flight for the purpose of determining data correlation of the required 
parameters. 
b 
Unless conducted through ground tests, functioning of the equipment and 
systems in all modes and over their full ranges to generate the various discretes and variable parameters to be recorded. 
c 
Operation of radio transmitters and electrical equipment (e.g. pumps, solenoids, 
motors, fans) to demonstrate ADRS immunity to electromagnetic interference. 
d 
For the assessment the raw recorded data shall be converted to engineering 
units using the information contained in the certification document specified in 
paragraph 2-1.3.4d. The assessment shall then be carried out on this converted data. 
II-6.7 
FOLLOW-ON ADRS INSTALLATIONS 
There is no requirement for dedicated ground or flight test, however following installation, recorded flight data should be reviewed to confirm functionality at the earliest opportunity. 

## Annex Ii-A Required Documentation Ii-A.1 To Support Certification And Installation Of The Adrs:

a. 
A report prepared to comply with the requirements shall describe the ADRS 
installation and the equipment installed and shall contain a record of the results of all ground and flight tests, including calibrations and correlations. A copy of 
the actual ground and flight test data shall be retained by the installation approval holder. 
b. 
Any processing time delays between the aircraft data recording acquisition 
system input and aircraft data recording output shall be documented. 

## Ii-A.2 To Support Interpretation Of The Recording Format Of The Adrs:

Because ADRS documentation is necessary for the recovery of aircraft data recording information, the progress of an investigation can be significantly hindered if there are any delays in recovering the recorded information. This will not only delay determination of the cause, but also slow down the identification of critical safety issues. ADRS documentation is currently maintained in a variety of electronic and hard copy formats that are often incomplete or difficult to interpret. 

a 
A description of the file structure and naming convention for the recording in the 
robust memory device shall be in a commonly readable format, such as ASCII 
encoding, and stored separately within the robust memory device. 
b 
In order to convert raw recorded data into engineering units, the following 
information shall be documented for each parameter. This documentation shall be in a commonly readable format, such as ASCII encoding, and stored separately within the robust memory medium: i. 
Parameter Name 
ii. 
Information needed to locate the parameter samples in the data recording 
iii. 
Minimum and maximum raw recorded values 
iv. 
Algorithm(s) required to be applied to the raw recorded values in order to 
convert them into engineering units 
v. 
Units (e.g. degrees, feet, knots) 
vi. 
Discrete Interpretation (e.g. 1 = Engaged, 0 = Disengaged) 
vii. 
Sign Convention (e.g. positive values = aircraft nose-up) 
viii. 
When available, timing information including any processing time delays 
between sampling at the sensor and recording in the robust memory device 
c 
The documentation held in the robust memory medium shall be maintained so 
as to reflect accurately the functionality of the recording system. 

## Ii-A.3 Example Of An Electronic Documentation Standard

The ARINC FRED (Flight Recorder Electronic Documentation) format 647A qualifies as an international standard for documenting the content and format of information retained in FDRs. The FRED format 647A is not a standard for the data, but a standard for the documentation that a ground station needs to recover the data. The ARINC FRED format 647A - Flight Recorder Electronic Documentation have been designed and developed to provide a standardised format for maintaining and conveying FDR system documentation. 

A brief description of the standard and the full document can be obtained on ARINC 
website at https://www.arinc.com/cf/store/catalog_detail.cfm?item_id=673. 

NOTE: 
         This documentation is not intended to replace the system descriptions 
         that manufacturers currently produce. These normally contain much 
         greater information about the system that is of use to investigators. 

## Annex Ii-B Definition Of Parameters To Be Recorded Ii-B.1 Parameter Tables

Table II-B.1 provides details of parameter characteristics appropriate to ADRS. Parameters annotated with an "E" are of primary importance for accident investigation and shall be recorded in order to comply with this MOPS. Parameters annotated with an "R" should be recorded if practicable. 

NOTE 1: 
Where spare capacity exists, manufacturers and operators should be 
encouraged to use the space to increase sampling rates or resolution or to record additional parameters for operational use. 
NOTE 2 
Where practicable, spare input ports to the acquisition system should 
also be mapped to the data frame. 

## Ii-B.2 Recording Format

The data shall be recorded in either raw data or converted engineering unit format. If the engineering unit converted format is used, the information shall be in a commonly readable format, such as ASCII encoding and shall comply with range, accuracy and resolution requirements detailed in Table II-B.1. The recording format used, including parameter timing information, shall be fully documented and stored on the robust memory device. Provision may need to be made for the recording of documentary parameters which might be needed as an aid to data retrieval, conversion and analysis. For example, it might be necessary to include in the recording, parameters to identify airframe and system configuration including the software standard associated with data acquisition. 

When creating a data frame the following points should be considered: 

a 
Certain parameters need to be recorded at equal time intervals to aid computer 
processing during accident analysis e.g. accelerations, attitude. 
b 
Related parameters such as the acceleration on 3 axes or parameters from an 
engine should be sampled and recorded as close together in time as possible. 

## Ii-B.3 Recording Range

Reference in Table II-B.1 to the term "full range" is to be interpreted as the operational range of the parameter appropriate to the aircraft in question (e.g. the total angular movement of a control surface) irrespective of the range available from the associated transducer or the magnitude of the word on a data bus. A margin for abnormal conditions may need to be provided, e.g. excess speed. 

## Ii-B.4 Recording Interval

The figure given for each parameter Table II-B.1 in is the maximum time interval in seconds between two consecutive readings. The requirements relating to time correlation between sampling and recording are specified in paragraphs II-2.1.12.1 
and II-2.1.12.3b.  

## Ii-B.5 Recording Accuracy

The recorded parameter accuracy shall be at least the accuracy specified in Table II- B.1. In this context, the term 'recording accuracy' refers to the correctness of the recorded data in relation to the physical value. The recorded parameter accuracy applies only to the sensor through the recorded data and does not apply to items upstream of the sensor. When the accuracy is given as a percentage, the percentage will apply to the operational range of the parameter as opposed to the total range of the sensor. 

## Ii-B.6 Recording Resolution

The resolution required for each parameter is listed in Table II-B.1. Resolution typically refers to the value of the least significant bit (LSB) as recorded by the system. The resolution should be such that it does not compromise the accuracy of the parameter (resolution should be an order of magnitude better than the required parameter accuracy).

## Annex Ii-C Maintenance Practices Ii-C.1 General

II-C.1.1 
The maintenance tasks required to ensure the continued serviceability of the installed 
ADRS will depend on the extent of monitoring built into the ADRS. Appropriate inspections and functional checks, together with the intervals at which these should be performed are described in Table II-C.1. 
II-C.1.2 
Maintenance procedures should emphasise the need to preserve the recording 
following a reported incident. 

## Ii-C.2 Recording Evaluation

II-C.2.1 
An in-flight recording should be replayed and assessed for quality. An ADRS should 
be considered inoperative if there is a significant period of poor quality data, 
unintelligible signals or if one or more of the essential parameters is not recorded correctly. 

## Ii-C.3 Primary Maintenance Tasks

## Part Iii Airborne Image Recording Systems Chapter Iii-1 Introduction Iii-1.1 Purpose And Scope Iii-1.1.1 General

This part defines the minimum specification to be met for an Airborne Image Recording System. This part shall be read in conjunction with Sections 1 and 2, together with Section 3 if applicable. A combination of audio, data and cockpit image recordings will provide air safety investigators with the necessary information to better define the facts, conditions and circumstances of an occurrence, and to broaden the scope of the vitally important human factor aspects of investigations. Additionally, image recordings can capture other cockpit information that would otherwise be impractical or impossible to record. 

In some instances it will be practical to use image recordings of sufficient resolution to record information that is not readily available to the ADRS or CARS (e.g. secondary displays, pilot's selections, data link messages or weather radar). However, it is always preferable to record parametric data on the ADRS rather than use an image recording, as ADRS provide a more accurate and useable recording. The use of image recordings is considered an acceptable means of compliance when it is the only method of recording parametric data that would otherwise not be economically feasible or available to the ADRS or CARS. Use of image recordings to capture datalink messages is also considered acceptable. 

## Iii-1.1.2 Description Of Content

This Part is divided into 6 Chapters and one Annex. Chapter III-1 describes typical equipment applications and operational objectives. Background material and accident investigation considerations are included together with a description of the AIRS. Chapter III-2 defines the general design specification. 

Chapter III-3 defines the minimum system performance under standard test conditions. 

Chapter III-4 defines the minimum system performance under environmental test conditions. Chapter III-5 specifies tests and procedures for determining compliance with the performance requirements. Chapter III-6 defines the installed equipment performance requirements including ground tests and flight tests. The Annex provides additional guidance on maintenance practices. 

## Iii-1.2 Application Iii-1.2.1 Airborne Image Recording System

Compliance with this Part will ensure that the AIRS will perform its intended function under the conditions encountered in aircraft operations. 

## Iii-1.3 Description Of The System Iii-1.3.1 Equipment

The AIRS may include the following equipment as appropriate to the aircraft: 

a 
Cockpit equipment, including controls for bulk erase functions, failure indication 
and single or multiple cameras/image sources, 
b 
Image communication network, 
c 
A robust recorder in which it is recommended that the recording be 
synchronised with the other airborne recording systems and UTC, 
d 
Interface equipment to provide communication between the elements of the 
system. 

## Iii-1.3.2 Classes Of Recording Systems

For the purposes of this MOPS, AIRS are classified by "Class" as follows.

For example - to capture forward view or aircraft parts such as landing gear. 

## Iii-1.3.3 Operational Considerations

a 
Objectives 
Each AIRS should be installed so as to provide, with reference to a timescale, simultaneous recordings, on separate channels, of one or more areas of coverage. 

b 
Start and Termination of Recording 
Recorder operation shall be as defined in paragraph 2-1.5. 

c 
Areas of coverage 
The following coverage areas are not necessarily related to the number of cameras required to obtain the information. It may be that one camera can satisfy several requirements or that several cameras are necessary to satisfy one requirement. Each aircraft may need to be assessed on an individual basis to identify the need for an appropriate number of dedicated image sensors to sufficiently capture the information described in sub-paragraphs i and ii below. 

A coverage area refers to the information required to be captured. 

i. 
General Cockpit Area 

Coverage areas: 
All 
pilot's 
stations 
work 
areas 
including 
instruments and controls. 
Purpose: 
To determine the following: 
- 
Ambient conditions in the cockpit (smoke, 
fire, lighting, etc.); 
- 
General pilot's activities such as use of 
checklists, charts, etc, and health and well-being of pilots; 

- 
Non-verbal 
communications 
(hand 
signals, pointing, etc.); 

- 
Cockpit selections within pilot's reach 
while 
seated 
at 
duty 
station 
(switch/throttle/flight controls, etc). 
Resolution: 
Sufficient to determine general pilot's activities and ambient conditions; 
Frame Recording Rate: Sufficient to determine significant pilot's actions. 
Colour: 
Required  

ii. 
Instruments and Control Panels:  

Coverage Area: 
Forward Instrument Panel  
Purpose: 
To determine the following: 
- 
Status of instrument displays and display 
modes (blank screen, partial display, automatic display mode changes, etc.); 
Resolution: 
Sufficient to: 
- 
Determine instrument display status and 
operational mode of the displays  
- 
Determine 
parameter 
values 
whose 
recording requirements can only be met by image recording. 
Frame Recording Rate:  
As specified in paragraph III-2.1.8 
Colour: 
Required 

iii. 
Pilot's Privacy Issues 
Misuse and privacy issues with respect to recorded voices, images and to some extent data, remain of significant concern to the aviation community. When taken out of context, images of the cockpit have the potential to mislead inexperienced people by virtue of their readily understandable format. They will also tend to have a high media appeal for sensationalist purposes and higher potential to be viewed out of context. Privacy issues generally increase in sensitivity when information contains personal and/or emotional elements. This is the primary reason why audio recordings are considered privileged by most investigation authorities and international standards. Image recordings should be treated with the same, or higher, level of sensitivity. 

## Iv. Use Of Airs

It is the intent of investigators to obtain information with respect to pilots interaction, the human/machine interface and information that is otherwise impractical to record. It is therefore not necessary to record the total image of the pilots. 

While accident investigators recognise and share the privacy and misuse concerns, the need to record the image of the general cockpit environment is nonetheless considered fundamental. Use of audio and image recordings for reasons other than aviation safety, can do a disservice to the community as well as harm individuals, and can be detrimental to an investigation and the parties involved. In order to prevent unauthorised access to image recordings, gain further acceptance by the aviation community, and minimise the potential for misuse, it is required that: 

a 
Following an accident or reportable incident, recorded images may be 
used only for investigation purposes and shall not be publicly disclosed. To ensure that the recording is not used for purposes other than investigation, the investigative authority shall retain custody of the recording. It is recommended that the manufacturer of the image recording system insert a similar warning in his system documentation, 
b 
Provisions shall be made for a pilot operated post flight bulk erase, 
c 
Playback of image recordings by unauthorised persons shall be inhibited 
through the use of suitable protection mechanisms (refer to paragraph III- 2.1.7), 
d 
Use of image data for training and maintenance purposes is permitted. 
 

## Chapter Iii-2 Airs Design Specification Iii-2.1 Equipment Design Specification Iii-2.1.1 General

This chapter is applicable to the functions of a flight recording system designed to receive, process, record and preserve image information in accordance with the requirements of this MOPS. These functions shall be performed reliably even under adverse operating conditions including events leading to an accident. 

The operation of AIRS controls intended for use during flight, in all possible positions, combinations and sequences, shall not result in a condition whose presence or continuation would be detrimental to the continued performance of the equipment. 

This section shall be read in conjunction with Section 2, which defines the requirements that are generic to all flight recording systems. 

## Iii-2.1.2 Recording Techniques

a 
The AIRS shall use a digital method of recording and storing the data in a 
robust memory module. 
b 
The recorded information shall be able to be exported to an industry standard 
digital format without loss of quality, or timing correlation irrespective of the recording format. 
c 
Image compression techniques may be used to minimise the amount of 
recording medium dedicated to image recording. 

## Iii-2.1.3 Recording Capacity

The AIRS shall be capable of retaining the data recorded during at least the last 2 hours of its operation. 

## Iii-2.1.4 Means Of Access To Recorded Information

The means for accessing the recorded information shall not erase, re-write or alter the recording. The means of replay, which will be provided by the manufacturer, shall produce image data in an unencrypted, industry standard format. If the data has been encrypted the manufacturer shall provide the information required to decrypt the data as part of the AIRS maintenance manual. 

NOTE: 
It is not required for the airs to continue to record images whilst the recorded data is retrieved. 

## Iii-2.1.5 Recording Delay

The delay between the acquisition of the image at the image sensor, and the time the data is stored in the robust medium, shall be minimised, and shall not exceed 3 seconds. 

## Iii-2.1.6 Image Compression

Image compression techniques may be used to minimise the amount of recording medium dedicated to image recording. The loss of one image (frame or equivalent) shall not result in the loss of more than one second of images. It shall be possible to reconstruct the images from the information stored in the robust memory module. Under normal replay conditions the images shall be available both as a real time flow of images, and as one image at a time. 

The image compression techniques may generate limited artefacts or loss of details. These shall not preclude the overall system from meeting the requirements of paragraph III-1.3.3. 

## Iii-2.1.7 Image Security/Encryption

To address the privacy and security concerns in paragraph III-1.3.3iii the provision of a dual password or encryption key protection capability for image playback systems such that both passwords are required to playback a recording could be utilized. 

Official investigation authorities will have access to specialised playback capability that does not require the use of these passwords/encryption keys. 

NOTE: 
It is envisaged that the passwords will be delegated to the operator and its pilot representative. 

## Iii-2.1.8 Minimum Required Frame Recording Rates

Images from each sensor(s), as installed, shall be updated with the following rates as a minimum: 

Minimum Frame Recording Rate 
AIRS Class 
Description 
Recording Period 
Recording Period 
Most Recent 30 mins
30 mins -  2 hour 
A 
General Cockpit View 
4 per second 
1 per second 
B 
CPDLC Message Display 
1 per second 
1 per 2 seconds 
C 
Cockpit Displays

1 per second, or the rate provided to the pilots, whichever is lower  
1 per 2 seconds, or the rate provided to the pilots, whichever is lower 
F 
External view 
4 per second 
1 per second 

## Iii-2.1.9 Privacy Of Recorded Images

To respect pilot privacy, cockpit area views shall be designed as far as practical to exclude the head and shoulders of pilots whilst seated in their normal operating positions. 

## Iii-2.1.10 Bulk Erase

For Class A AIRS, provision should be made for a pilot-operated post-flight bulk erase function. Where a Class C AIRS is used instead of an ADRS to capture parametric data from instrument displays (refer to paragraph III-1.1.1), a facility to bulk erase that captured parametric data shall not be provided. 

After use of a bulk erase function, the recording shall be modified so that it cannot be retrieved using any normal replay (refer to note 2 below) or copying techniques. An acceptable means of compliance would be for a bulk erase function to delete that information needed to access the memory by the normal replay procedure. 

The installation of a bulk erase function should be designed to prevent unintentional operation during flight or crash impact. 

NOTE 1: 
         In the event of bulk erasure, non-normal replay or copying techniques 
         may be used by the accident investigation authority to retrieve data, for 
         the purposes of conducting an official investigation. 

NOTE 2: 
Normal replay is data retrieval at the equipment level as used in the 
laboratories of aircraft constructors and modifiers to support certification of recording system installations. 
NOTE 3: 
Non-normal replay is data retrieval from the recording medium media 
using special techniques available to the recording system manufacturers and accident investigation authorities. 
NOTE 4: 
It is understood that military organisations may use commercial recorders. In this case, they may have unique requirements outside the scope of this MOPS.   

## Iii-2.1.11 Maintenance Access

The installed system shall allow a loopback real time monitor function for test purposes and alignment. 

NOTE:  
The current image(s) from the system may be displayed on command. This should not allow the display of recorded images. 

## Iii-2.2 Camera Specifications Iii-2.2.1 General

There shall be no requirements for pilot intervention during normal operation. 

## Iii-2.2.2 Beating Effects

For those AIRS where data is to be retrieved from electronic instrument displays, beating effects should be minimised. 

## Iii-2.2.3 Optical Characteristics

III-2.2.3.1 
Spatial Resolution 
Spatial resolution of the images shall be verified by differentiation of resolution lines presented for the appropriate information class. For Class A, B and C images, the resolution as shown in TABLE III-3.1 should be used. 

III-2.2.3.2 
Depth of field  
Depth of field shall be sufficient for the Class of image recording as shown in TABLE III-3.1.  

NOTE: 
For a Class B or C AIRS, the required depth of field need only 
encompass the instrument panel (furthest instruments to nearest 
instruments) whereas for a Class A AIRS, the required depth of field should be as large as possible to accurately focus all movement in the cockpit. 
III-2.2.3.3 
Field of View 
Field of view shall be sufficient for the class of AIRS as shown in TABLE III-3.1. 

III-2.2.3.4 
Contrast 
The level of contrast shall be adequate to differentiate between the lines presented on the Test Chart as appropriate for the class of AIRS as shown in TABLE III-3.1. 

III-2.2.3.5 
Distortion 
Distortion of the Image shall be minimised in order to allow for differentiation between the lines presented on the Test Chart as appropriate for the Class of image recording as shown in TABLE III-3.1. 

III-2.2.3.6 
Digital Artefacts 
The level of artefacts introduced by the digitisation and compression systems shall not compromise the required resolution of the AIRS specified in TABLE III-3.1. 

## Iii-2.2.4 Spectral Bandwidth

The objective of the Class A, general cockpit view, is to record the cockpit environment as experienced by or presented to the pilots. The wavelengths of light sensed should be optimised to the spectral sensitivity of the human eye as closely as practicable. 

NOTE:  
The eye generally has a spectral wavelength sensitivity range from 410 
nm to 710 nm. 

For Class B, C, D, E and F installations the spectral bandwidth should be optimised to capture the intended information. 

## Iii-2.2.5 Lighting And Sensitivity

The image sensor shall not require supplemental lighting during normal operation. The AIRS shall be capable of operating in lighting conditions from 86 000 lux (full sun) to an illumination of 1.0 lux, by automatic means, and for Class B and C AIRS shall be capable of resolving data from instruments with a luminance of 1.71 +/- 0.85 nits. 

## Iii-2.2.6 Dynamic Range

The image sensor shall accommodate a dynamic range of lighting of at least 10:1 between the brightest and darkest elements in a single image while providing the resolution, contrast, and depth of colour performance specified herein. 

## Iii-2.2.7 Depth Of Colour

Where a colour image is required, the depth of colour shall be no less than 256 
colours, distributed across the visual bandwidth. 

## Chapter Iii-3 Minimum Performance Specifications Under Standard Test Conditions Iii-3.1 Introduction This Chapter Specifies The Minimum Performance Specification Of The Equipment And The Levels To Be Demonstrated Under Standard Test Conditions. Iii-3.1.1 Standard Test Conditions

For the purposes of this chapter, standard test conditions are defined in documents EUROCAE ED-14F/RTCA DO-160F "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment" paragraph 3.4 as: 

a 
Temperature 
: +15 to +35°C 
b 
Relative Humidity : Not greater than 85% 
c 
Ambient Pressure : 84 to 107 kPa 
d 
Lighting Level 
: Between 100 and 1 000 lux 
In addition to the above the electrical power supply shall be within the limits specified as Normal in Section 16 of ED-14F/DO-160F or subsequent issue. In the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC power source of variable frequency, unless otherwise specified, tests should be performed at representative input power frequencies with the input frequency adjusted to within 5% of a selected frequency. 

## Iii-3.2 Recording System Performance Levels The Equipment Shall Be Tested To Show Compliance With The Following Minimum Performance Levels.

NOTE: 
Where these paragraphs state requirements regarding the information in the memory it should be interpreted as that obtained by numerical analysis of the recorded audio data or as that observed at the output of suitable playback equipment. 

## Iii-3.2.1 Recovered Image Quality

The recovered image shall conform to TABLE III-3.1. 

## Iii-3.2.2 Start-Up And Effects Of Power Interruptions

Following a system electrical power interruption, the characteristics of the AIRS (including any networks, busses etc) shall be such that: 

a 
Following initial application of power to the AIRS and any start logic is satisfied, 
the recording system shall commence and continue to store information, in accordance with the requirements of this MOPS, within 120 seconds. 
b 
All information available at the start of an interruption together with that 
available in the following 10 ms shall be recorded in the robust memory module. 
c 
After 5 seconds at a normal power level, interruptions with duration of less than 
10 ms shall have no effect on the AIRS, Class A, B, C and D image sensors and AIRS control panel (including any interconnecting networks, busses etc). The initial 5 second period allows time to recharge the energy storage. 
NOTE 1: 
Systems should be designed to minimize the start up time and should 
start recording as soon as data is available to the recording system. Recording should not wait until all BITE and sub-system start-up 
functions are completed: for example, audio and image information may be available before other parametric data. 
NOTE 2: 
During power interruptions of less than 2 seconds some sensors may not 
provide valid data to the recorder, but the recording system shall continue to operate.

## Chapter Iii-5 Test Procedures

III-5.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter specifies the standard test procedures for demonstrating compliance with Chapter III-2 and Chapter III-3. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognised that they will not apply in all cases and that other methods may be preferred or required. Alternative methods may be used if the manufacturer can show that they provide equivalent certification data. Where a test procedure is not specified for a particular performance parameter, the manufacturer may show compliance either by analysis or by devising a test appropriate to the equipment design. All test measurements shall be traceable to a recognized calibration standard. 

## Iii-5.1.1 Adjustment Of Equipment

The equipment under test shall be properly aligned and adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. 

## Iii-5.1.2 Test Instrument Precautions

Precautions shall be taken to prevent the introduction of errors resulting from impedance mismatch and the improper connection of test instruments to the equipment under test. 

## Iii-5.1.3 Test Conditions

Unless specified as part of environmental testing, all tests shall be performed under the conditions specified in paragraph III-3.1.  

## Iii-5.1.4 Connected Loads

Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed with the equipment connected to loads having the impedance values for which it is designed. 

## Iii-5.1.5 Warm-Up Period

Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed after a warm-up (stabilisation) 
period of not less than 5 minutes and not more than 15 minutes. 

## Iii-5.1.6 Recording Of Test Results

Except where tests are "Pass / Fail" in character (e.g. the determination of whether or not mechanical devices function correctly), the actual numerical values obtained for each of the parameters tested shall be recorded in a qualification test report. 

## Iii-5.1.7 Recovered Image Quality

The quality of the recovered image shall be established and shall not be less than that corresponding to the values of "quality index pattern" as stated below. The overall system quality can be assessed by imaging a reference test pattern. This test pattern shall have the following attributes which are met by the test chart shown in FIGURE III-5.1: 

− 
Horizontal lines with separation ranging from 5 mm to 1 mm spacing. 
− 
Vertical lines with separation ranging from 5 mm to 1 mm spacing. 
− 
Colour blocks with 8 typical cockpit colours (red, green, blue, magenta, cyan, 
yellow, black and white). 
− 
Text (compatible with class B and C image) 
− 
Industry standard preferred. 
This pattern, which will be 0.3 m x 0.225 m, should be placed in the 4 corners and the centre of the image area which typically measures 2 m (horizontal) by 1.6 m (vertical) minimum, as shown in FIGURE III-5.2. Alternative dimensions may be used, but should be representative of the dimensions and format of the cockpit in which the equipment is to be installed.  The background of the image area shall be patterned to represent a typical cockpit. It shall be possible to distinguish the lines at the required separation level after imaging and reproducing the image with the system under test under standard lighting conditions (100 - 1 000 lux). Other lighting conditions will be verified in separate tests. 

NOTE: 
         FIGURE III-5.1 requires full colour reproduction, which is not possible 
         within this document. The chart is not to scale, A chart with correct 
         colours, scaling and resolution may be obtained from EUROCAE. 

## Iii-5.1.8 Start Of Recording

The equipment shall be switched on, and the time until the first image is successfully recorded shall be noted. This shall conform to the timing requirements given in paragraph III-3.2.2. 

## Iii-5.1.9 Recording Frame Rate

The equipment shall be set to operate, viewing a scene representative of an aircraft cockpit. The equipment shall be allowed to stabilise for a period of 5 minutes. The equipment shall then be operated over a period of one minute, and the number of picture frames recorded shall be recorded. A frame rate per second shall be calculated, and conformity with the required update rate for the AIRS shall be established. Required recording frame rates shall be as defined in "Most Recent 30 min" column of paragraph III-2.1.8. 

## Chapter Iii-6 Equipment Installation And Installed Performance Iii-6.1 Introduction This Chapter Specifies Installation Characteristics And Performance With Procedures For Verifying That Performance When The Equipment Is Installed In An Aircraft.

Installed performance criteria are generally the same as those contained in Chapter III-3, which were verified through bench and environmental tests. However, certain performance parameters may be affected by the physical installation and can only be confirmed after installation. 

## Iii-6.2 Equipment Installation Iii-6.2.1 Accessibility

a 
Maintenance provisions for equipment adjustments should not be readily 
accessible to the pilots. 
b 
Bulk erase control (if installed) shall be available in the cockpit. 

## Iii-6.2.2 Aircraft Environment

Equipment shall be compatible with the environmental conditions present in the specific location in the aircraft where the equipment is installed. Operation of the equipment shall not be affected by aircraft manoeuvring or changes in attitude encountered in normal flight operations. Operation of the equipment should not be affected by those extreme conditions likely to, be encountered during an accident sequence e.g. stall buffet, violent and extreme manoeuvres, however under these conditions picture quality may be degraded. Based on the expected displacement of the camera relative to the scene being viewed, it is recommended that the camera is mounted sufficiently rigid to avoid resonances. 

## Iii-6.2.3 Interference Effects

The installed equipment shall not: 

a 
be the source of harmful conducted or radiated interference, nor 
b 
be adversely affected by conducted or radiated interference from other 
equipment or systems installed in the aircraft. 
NOTE: 
Electromagnetic compatibility problems noted after installation of the 
equipment may result from such factors as the design characteristics of previously installed systems or equipment and the physical installation itself. It is not intended that the equipment manufacturer design for all installation environments. The installer will be responsible for resolving any incompatibility between the equipment and previously installed 
equipment. 

## Iii-6.2.4 Bulk Erase Control

The installation of a bulk erase control should be designed to prevent activation during flight and to minimize any inadvertent operation during a crash impact.  

## Iii-6.2.5 Quality Of Recovered Image

For each newly installed system, the quality of the recovered image shall be established by analysis of data recorded on the ground and in flight. 

## Iii-6.2.6 Maintenance

An analysis shall be performed by the equipment installer to identify those aspects of the installation where the serviceability could be degraded and remain undetected. The maintenance tasks to be performed shall take account of this analysis by requiring appropriate functional and maintenance checks at suitable intervals. 

## Iii-6.3 Ground Test Procedures Iii-6.3.1 Equipment Function

Vary all controls of the equipment through their full range to determine that the equipment is operating according to the manufacturer's instructions and that each control performs its intended function. 

## Iii-6.3.2 Interference Effects

With the equipment energised, individually operate each of the other electrically operated aircraft equipment and systems to determine that no significant levels of conducted or radiated interference exist. Operate communication and navigation equipment on the low, high and at least one mid-band frequency. Identify systems or modes of operation that should be evaluated during flight. 

## Iii-6.3.3 Power Supply Fluctuations And Protection

Verify equipment operation from available aircraft power sources, including normal generator switching. 

## Iii-6.4 Flight Test Procedures Iii-6.4.1 General

This section provides guidance for flight testing installations on aeroplanes and helicopters. The guidance may need to be adapted to suit the particular installation being tested. Each newly installed AIRS will need to be flight tested, and the recording so obtained shall be evaluated to show adequate recording quality during normal regimes of flight including taxiing, takeoff, cruise, approach and landing. 

For helicopters, hover and autorotation should be included. 

Since the duration of the recording may be limited, the flight test should be carefully planned. The AIRS circuit breaker can be tripped between each test phase and at the end of the landing run if the flight time is likely to exceed the recording duration limit. 

The replay and evaluation will need to be performed after the flight test. If mandated by the certifying authority, verification of the flight test recording shall be performed by an approved readout and replay centre. 

## Annex Iii-A Maintenance Practices Iii-A.1 General

III-A.1.1 
The maintenance tasks required to ensure the continued serviceability of the installed 
AIRS will depend on the extent of monitoring built into the AIRS. Appropriate inspections and functional checks, together with the intervals at which these should be performed are described in Table III-A.1. 
III-A.1.2 
Maintenance procedures should emphasise the need to preserve the recording 
following a reported incident.

## Iv-1.2 Application Iv-1.2.1 Data-Link Recording System

Compliance with this Part will ensure that the DLRS will perform its intended function under the conditions encountered in aircraft operations. 

## Iv-1.3 Description Of The System Iv-1.3.1 Equipment

The DLRS may include the following equipments as appropriate to the aircraft: 

a. 
A robust recorder in which it is recommended that the recording be 
synchronised with the other airborne recording systems and UTC, 
b. 
Digital interface equipment suitable for converting a data-link message into a 
format which is to be recorded, and 
c. 
Digital data busses or networks providing communications between elements of 
the system. 

## Iv-1.3.2 Operational Considerations

a. 
Objectives 
Each DLRS should be installed so as to provide, with reference to a timescale, a recording of data-link messages to and from an aircraft. 

b. 
Start and Termination of Recording 
Recorder operation shall be as defined in paragraph 2-1.5. 

## Chapter Iv-2 Dlrs Design Specification Iv-2.1 Equipment Design Specification Iv-2.1.1 General

This section is applicable to the functions of a flight recording system designed to receive, process, record and preserve data-link information transmitted to and from the aircraft in accordance with the requirements of this MOPS. These functions shall be performed reliably even under adverse operating conditions including events leading to an accident. This section shall be read in conjunction with Section 2, which defines the requirements that are generic to all flight recording systems. 

The requirements for digital communications that may be recorded both on board the aircraft and on the ground are summarised as follows. For complete text of the overall systems requirements and message types to be recorded refer to Minimum Aviation System Performance Specification for CNS/ATM Recorder Systems (ED-93): 

a 
It is desirable that all communications to and from the pilots are recorded on the 
aircraft in order to develop a thorough understanding of the working environment of the cockpit. This is of fundamental importance to accident investigation. 
b 
In the same way that traditional audio recording has enabled investigators to 
determine if radio communications systems were overall functioning as required, the airborne recording of digital communications will help to determine the end-to-end functioning of the data-link communication system. 
c 
Increased reliance will be placed on digital messaging to ensure safe operation 
in an environment where separations will be significantly reduced and profiles flown will be assumed to be much more precise. Much of this information may not involve the pilots or controller and messages may be addressed directly to and from the aircraft's systems. The recording of such information will prove 
valuable. 
d 
Ground based recording will involve many stations and locations around the 
world. An effective means of ensuring that the information is readily available to 
an accident investigation is to record as much of it, as practical on board the aircraft. 
e 
Recording on the ground is required in order to correlate the transmitted and 
received messages and to investigate periods beyond the duration of the airborne recording. Part of this reason is to be able to understand the role of air 
traffic control in the occurrence, and to be able to understand the interactions between ground stations, other aircraft, and other agencies. 
f 
To meet the operational goals, there are two main issues each of which require 
consideration in terms of both airborne and ground recording: i. 
Recording of digital communications to and from the pilots. This includes 
those messages that would have traditionally been passed by voice 
means. 
ii. 
Other data-link messages that are transmitted to and from the aircraft for 
the purposes of weather information, navigation and surveillance (For example differential GPS requiring position correction), and advanced TCAS that may require communication from aircraft to aircraft. 

## Iv-2.1.2 Recording Techniques

a 
The DLRS shall use a digital method of recording and storing the data in a 
robust memory module. 
b 
Each message shall be recorded in a format that is easily identified and can be 
decoded with reference to the documents specified in 2-1.3.4.d. 
c 
Data compression shall not be used. 

## Iv-2.1.3 Recording Capacity

The recording system shall have adequate capacity to record all required data-link messages during the most recent time period of at least 2 hours. 

NOTE 1: 
Future technology may require alternate bus transfer speeds and larger 
recording medium capacity. This should be taken into account in the design of the recording system. 
NOTE 2: 
As the data-link message recording is an event type recording (opposed 
to sequence method as is the case for the audio recording system), there is no fixed relationship between the recording medium capacity and the duration of the recording. However in some circumstances, the data-link 
message traffic may exceed the limit defined, and consequently the recording duration may be insufficient regarding the recording medium size defined. 
The recording system shall, as a minimum, provide sufficient capacity to store 5 standard messages per minute and each followed by an acknowledgement message of 28 characters (in addition to any protocol overhead as required to meet this specification), for a duration of at least 2 hours. 

NOTE 3: 
This requirement is derived from a perceived maximum of current CPDLC 
traffic and message sizes. It is based on the assumption that 60 percent of the recording capacity will be used for CPDLC messages, and the 
remaining 40 percent for other types of messages. 
NOTE 4: 
Today's definition of data-link architectures do not provide enough 
information on the amount of anticipated or typical data flow and as such it is suggested that sufficient reserve shall be provided for system growth. 
NOTE 5: 
In order to minimise recording medium utilisation and to optimise 
recording medium capacity, data-link messages may be recorded on an interrupt basis, i.e. as the message occurs. 

## Iv-2.1.4 Means Of Access To Recorded Information

The means for accessing the recorded information shall: 

a 
not erase, re-write or alter the recording, 
b 
utilise a standard computer interface for lossless retrieval of all data, 
c 
not require the removal of the robust memory module from its location in the 
aircraft and, 
d 
allow accident investigation authorities unrestricted access to the data. 
NOTE: 
it is not required for the DLRS to continue to record information whilst the recorded data is retrieved. 

## Iv-2.1.5 Recording Delay

The delay in recording the data, from the time that it is presented at the input of the recording system to the time this data is stored in the robust medium, should be minimised. 

For a standard message (as defined in paragraph IV-3.2.2) the delay in recording the data, from the time of reception of the complete message at the recording device to the time of recording in the robust memory module, shall not exceed 1 second. 

NOTE 1: 
For a message with a larger payload than the standard message or a 
burst of messages the delay may exceed the limit of 1 second. 
NOTE 2:  
It is important to preserve all available data. For this reason, any delay should be minimised. Where buffer devices are used, it is strongly recommended that non-volatile devices are used and that they are 
located within the robust memory module. 
For a standard message (as defined in paragraph IV-3.2.2), the delay between the message being recognized as data to be recorded and the last bit being presented at the recording device shall not exceed 2 seconds. In any case, for a message of any length, the delay between the message being recognized as data to be recorded and the first bit being presented at the recording device shall not exceed 2 seconds. 

NOTE 3: 
System delays attributable to the installed data-link communication system are outside this scope of this chapter and are not addressed. 

## Iv-2.1.6 Data To Be Recorded

IV-2.1.6.1 
Data-link applications and services to record 
If the aircraft flight path is authorized/controlled directly or indirectly by data-link messages, then all data-link messages, both up-links (to the aircraft) and down-links (from the aircraft), the time they are displayed to the pilots, and their data-link response shall be recorded on the aircraft in order to determine an accurate sequence of events for the aircraft and cockpit operation. AOC/AAC data-link services, navigation and surveillance parameters should be recorded if data-link message transfer is a feature of the system architecture - refer to Annex IV-A for message type details required to be recorded. 

Message recording and associated timing shall apply to the recording requirements of: 

a 
Pilots Communication as defined in ED-93 paragraph 2.3.2.1, 
b 
Navigation as defined in ED-93 paragraph 2.3.2.3, 
c 
Surveillance as defined in ED-93 paragraph 2.3.2.5. 
NOTE:  
In order to minimise recording medium utilisation, data-link messages may be recorded on an interrupt basis, i.e. as the message occurs. 

The recording of digital messages may be made in one or more airborne recording systems. The data-link message shall be recorded on the aircraft, whether generated automatically or manually, and shall be independent of the media transmission method (VHF, Satcom, HF, Mode-S or other). 

## Iv-2.1.6.2 Content Of Recordings

Sufficient information shall be recorded to enable the following to be determined: 

a 
The content of all messages generated and received by the pilots, 
b 
The message priority (if any), 
c 
The number of messages in any available queue, 
d 
The display status of each message. 
NOTE 1: Clarification of "Message priority": Being able to determine message 
priority means - if a message has an associated priority that may have an effect upon the order of or method of its display or transmission, then the 
existence of such a priority should be determinable from the recorded information. 
NOTE 2: Clarification of "Available queues": Being able to determine the number of 
messages in available queues means - as far as practical given by the architecture of the system the recorded information should be sufficient to determine at any given time, how many messages may have been received at the aircraft, but not displayed to the pilots. Conversely, it should be determinable how many messages the pilots have generated which have not yet been sent to the ground. 
NOTE 3: Clarification of "Display Status": The recording of message display status 
means, as far as practical, given the architecture of the system, information concerning the state of pilots selection of the messages should be recorded. Current states may include new arrival, open, acceptance, rejection of messages, etc. 

## Iv-2.1.6.3 Time Stamp

It shall be possible to determine time information associated with each data-link message, with a minimum resolution of 1 second. The time information shall include hours/minutes/seconds/day/month and should include year, if available. 

NOTE 1: 
The reason for the inclusion of date within the timestamp is that, since a 
data-link message may be recorded on interrupt basis, there may be information from more than a single 24-hour period within the recording 
system and the date will provide information to determine which is most 
recent. 
The following timing information associated with the digital messages shall, as far as practical given the architecture of the system, be capable of being determined from the airborne-based recordings: 

a 
The time each message was generated (i.e. when "send" was selected), 
b 
The time any message was available to be displayed by the pilots, 
c 
The time each message was actually displayed or recalled from a queue, 
d 
The time of each status change. 
NOTE 2: 
Clarification of "Time stamp": The recording of time stamps means - the recorded information associated with each message should be sufficient to determine the time the message was recorded. This can be accomplished either by recording an explicit time identifier with each message or by recording in such a manner that the relative time can be referenced to a timeline with an absolute time basis. 
NOTE 3: 
Clarification of "Status change": The recording of message status change 
means - as far as practical given the architecture of the system, information concerning the pilots interaction with the messages should be recorded. Interactions include acknowledgement of messages, recall of messages, WILCO of messages, etc. 

## Iv-2.1.7 Data Burst Throughput

The recording system should be capable of processing and recording a high speed burst of digital data at the maximum rate of the interface employed in the digital communication system design which shall have no adverse effect on the performance of the recording system. (Refer to paragraph IV-3.2.3) 

## Iv-2.1.8 Databus Selection

The databus interface chosen for the recording system shall, as a minimum, support the amount and frequency of digital message traffic required to be recorded in accordance with design requirements of this MOPS. 

## Iv-2.1.9 Recording Format

Each message shall be recorded in a format that is easily identified and can be decoded with reference to the documents specified in 2-1.3.4.d. 

## Iv-2.1.10 Erasure Of Recorded Data

a 
Except for the overwriting of the oldest data by new information, no means for 
the erasure of the recorded data shall be provided in the recording system. 
NOTE: 
It is understood that military organisations may use commercial 
recorders. In this case, they may have additional security requirements 
that exempt the recording system from this requirement. Arrangements should be made with the appropriate certification authority in regard to such exemptions. 
b 
It is recommended that appropriate procedures are used to avoid the overwriting of data during aircraft maintenance following a reportable incident or accident. 

## Iv-2.1.11 Quality And Reliability Of Recording

a 
For each newly installed system, the performance of the system and quality of 
recorded data shall be established by analysis of data recorded on the ground 
and in flight. 
b 
It is recommended that the relevant accident investigation authority should be 
invited by the certification authority to participate in the assessment of new systems and the quality of the recorded data particularly where novel features exist (refer to paragraph II-2.1.7). 

## Iv-2.1.12 Means Of Functional Test

A means shall be provided for checking the recording system for proper operation as required by paragraph 2-1.4 of Section 2. 

## Chapter Iv-3 Minimum Performance Specifications Under Standard Test Conditions Iv-3.1 Introduction This Chapter Specifies The Minimum Performance Specification Of The Equipment And The Levels To Be Demonstrated Under Standard Test Conditions. Iv-3.1.1 Standard Test Conditions

For the purposes of this chapter, standard test conditions are defined in documents EUROCAE ED-14F/RTCA DO-160F "Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment" paragraph 3.4 as: 

a 
Temperature 
:+15 to +35°C 
b 
Relative Humidity : Not greater than 85% 
c 
Ambient Pressure : 84 to 107 kPa 
In addition to the above; the AC electrical power supply shall be within the limits specified as Normal in Section 16 of ED-14F/DO-160F or subsequent issue. In the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC power source of variable frequency, unless otherwise specified, tests should be performed at representative input power frequencies with the input frequency adjusted to within 5% of a selected frequency. 

## Iv-3.2 Recording System Minimum Performance Levels The Recording System Shall Be Tested To Show Compliance With The Following Minimum Performance Levels.

NOTE: 
Where these paragraphs state requirements regarding the information in 
the recording medium, it should be interpreted as that observed at the 
output of the data retrieval equipment specified by the equipment manufacturer. 

## Iv-3.2.1 Start Up And Effects Of Power Interruptions

Following a system electrical power interruption, the recovery characteristics of each component of the DLRS, including any networks and busses, shall be such that: 

a 
Following initial application of power to the DLRS and any start logic is satisfied, 
or following an interruption with a duration of more than 200 milliseconds, the recording system shall commence and continue to store information, in accordance with the requirements of this MOPS, within 60 seconds. 
b 
All information available at the start of an interruption together with that 
available in the following 200 milliseconds shall be recorded in the robust memory module. 
c 
After 5 seconds at a normal power level, interruptions with duration of up to 200 
milliseconds shall have no effect on the DLRS. 
NOTE 1: 
The recording of data should commence immediately when data is 
available. 
NOTE 2: 
Any built-in-test function may take up to 5 seconds to recover. The recovery period of 5 seconds is intended to permit power-up test and system initialisation routines to be performed. It is recommended that such routines should be performed as rapidly as possible to minimise the recovery period. 
NOTE 3: 
No constraint is intended to be placed on maintenance actions 
associated with setting the initial configuration status of the system 
following equipment replacement. 

## Iv-3.2.2 Standard Message

A standard message is defined as 103 ASCII characters (or equivalent) of payload at the input to the recording system. Protocol or overhead required to identify the message during playback also be processed and stored. An example of required header/protocol information is the time stamp added to the message prior to it being sent to the recording system. 

## Iv-3.2.3 Short Term Maximum Throughput

The recording system shall continue to operate in accordance with the other requirements of this chapter when it receives a burst of six consecutive message pairs at the interface's maximum possible input data transfer rate, with an interval of one minute between such bursts. These message pairs shall be as defined in paragraph IV-3.2.2.  

## Chapter Iv-4 Minimum Performance Specifications Under Environmental Test Conditions Iv-4.1 Introduction Chapter 2-3 Of This Document Defines The Environmental Tests To Be Performed On The Recording System.

Compliance with the applicable performance requirements of this part for DLRS shall be demonstrated as shown in TABLE IV-4.1.

INTRODUCTION 
This chapter specifies the standard test procedures for demonstrating compliance with Chapter IV-2 and Chapter IV-3.

## Chapter Iv-6 Equipment Installation And Installed Performance

IV-6.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter specifies ADRS installation characteristics and performance with procedures for verifying that performance when the system is installed in an aircraft. Installed performance criteria are generally the same as those contained in Chapter II- 3, which were verified through bench and environmental tests. However, certain performance parameters may be affected by the physical installation and can only be confirmed after installation. 

IV-6.2 
GENERAL 
A schedule of tests should be prepared by the equipment installer. For the prototype installation, a comprehensive programme of tests should be performed, as described in paragraphs IV-6.3 and IV-6.4. Following the testing of each new DLRS installation, the recording so obtained shall be evaluated to confirm adequate message recording accuracy and synchronisation with other recording devices both on the aircraft and on the ground. Similarly it will be necessary to evaluate recording obtained from in-service flying to ensure this accuracy is maintained and the system has sufficient capacity to preserve all messages received over the required recording duration. 

NOTE: 
The recording performance test can be conducted in a laboratory environment or in the real aircraft environment. 

An analysis shall be performed by the equipment installer to identify the "subsystems" where the serviceability or accuracy could be degraded and remain undetected. Maintenance tasks shall take account of this analysis by requiring the appropriate calibration checks at suitable intervals. During introduction to service of a new component in the DLRS, in order to test the correct operation of the overall recording system, a scenario has to be developed. In the course of the scenario, one or more procedures, involving the pilots of an aircraft, a ground station such as an ATC centre (or a simulation thereof) should be exercised. There may be benefit in performing the test twice, once with an ATM centre and once with a non-ATM centre. 

A complete test scenario consists of three test domains 

a 
Aircraft recording domain 
b 
Ground recording domain (or simulation) 
c 
Correlation of recording domains (end-to-end test) 

NOTE:  
          It shall not be required to test the data-link technology itself. The data-link 
          establishment, test and approval are described in the EUROCAE 
          document ED-78A/RTCA document DO-264. The test procedures shall 
          focus on the data-link overall recording system comprising on board 
          recording, ground recording and correlation of both recording domains. 

 The verification of a communication data recording shall be done in order to correlate the message flows between both parts. 

- 
on the aircraft, and 
- 
simultaneously on the ground 
It shall be verified that 

- 
the actual or deduced message content for airborne recording is correct 
(through comparison with ground recordings or equivalent means), 
- 
a synchronisation with a common time base is possible, 
- 
the reconstitution of message sequences in the scenario is possible. 

## Note: Standardisation Of Recording Formats May Make Automatic Correlation Of These Messages Possible.

A test procedure shall include following activities: 

a 
send messages (different types) from the ground equipment to the aircraft and 
vice versa, 
b 
perform the communication on the aircraft and on the ground (both digital 
message generation and voice commenting) in order to be able to correlate voice and data communication, 
c 
retrieve the data after the test from the aircraft recording system on ground, 
d 
Check airborne recording (e.g. through the ground recording) and confirm the integrity of on board data. 

NOTE: 
        It is recommended that anyone operating an aircraft equipped with the 
        data-link communication system shall have the possibility to obtain an 
        audit to recover data-link messages from their network provider. The 
        operator may ensure this by requesting a data recovery of all available 
        data-link messages for a single randomly selected flight. The 
        recommended frequency is once per year. This procedure will ensure 
        identification of any deficiencies in the service provider's capabilities. 

## Iv-6.3 Ground Test Procedures Iv-6.3.1 General

## Annex Iv-A Data-Link Recording Table Iv-A.1 Data To Be Recorded

The material in the Table IV-A.1 is to be considered as guidance material only and as a means of compliance with the MASPS ED-93. 

IV-A.1.1 
Table IV-A.1 lists the function and states if the appropriate data shall be recorded, 
a 
on ground, or 
b 
on board. 
c 
Depending on the type of information this data has to be differentiated between 
i. 
data-link messages to be recorded either with full content or just the 
identifier code saying, that the data reached/left the aircraft, 
ii. 
parameters to be recorded on the ADRS part. 
NOTE 1: 
The full content of the ARINC 623 ATC type messages shall be recorded. 
NOTE 2: 
For AOC/AAC messages as per ICAO definition (refer to paragraph 1-
1.5.1), the origin/destination code of messages) sent to/generated by the ATSU/CMU, FMS, CMS, ACMS, or Printer shall be the minimum data to be recorded, if practicable within the system architecture, (per Table IV- A.1) but this does not preclude recording of additional data. 
NOTE 3: 
ADS data shall be recorded as defined in Table IV-A.1 because some 
parameters contained in the ADS report are transmitted by voice today (e. g. two, three next waypoints). ADS data supports the task of accident investigation, 
because 
they 
allow 
the 
reconstruction 
of 
the 
aircraft/controller scenario.

## Annex Iv-B Maintenance Practices Iv-B.1 General

IV-B.1.1 
The maintenance tasks required to ensure the continued serviceability of the installed 
DLRS will depend on the extent of monitoring built into the DLRS. Appropriate 
inspections and functional checks, together with the intervals at which these should be 
performed are described in Table IV-B.1 
IV-B.1.2 
Maintenance procedures should emphasise the need to preserve the recording 
following a reported incident. 

## Iv-B.2 Recording Evaluation

IV-B.2.1 
An in-flight recording should be replayed and assessed for quality. 

## Iv-B.3 Primary Maintenance Tasks

 
Item 
Task 
Maximum Interval 
Interpretation 
1 
Operational Check 
Daily or prior to each flight 
Confirm serviceability using TEST function 
on DLRS controller or Check 'no-fail' indication for built in test 
2 
System check and replay 
As agreed between operator and regulatory authority (24 months recommended) 
Carry out a lossless download of the DLRS recordings immediately post-flight. Replay and evaluate the quality of the in-flight recording.
