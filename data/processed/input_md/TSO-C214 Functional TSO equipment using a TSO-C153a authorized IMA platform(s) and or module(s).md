## Technical Standard Order Subject: Functional Tso Equipment Using A Tso-C153A- Authorized Ima Platform(S) And/ Or Module(S)

 1. 

PURPOSE.  This technical standard order (TSO) is for manufacturers applying for a TSO 
authorization (TSOA) or letter of TSO design approval (LODA).  In it, we (the Federal Aviation Administration, (FAA)) tell you what minimum performance standards (MPS) your Functional TSO(F-TSO) Equipment must meet for approval and identification with the applicable TSO marking. 2. 

APPLICABILITY.  This TSO affects new applications submitted after its effective date. This TSO standard is applicable to any equipment presented for a TSO authorization to an existing TSO standard for an aircraft function (F-TSO), where the equipment is implemented on one (or several) TSO-C153a-authorized Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) platform(s) and/or module(s).  Compliance credit from TSO-C153a can be taken to demonstrate compliance with a F-TSO.  This TSO standard is also applicable to any equipment for which an applicant is seeking TSO authorization of a F-TSO standard, where the applicant performs additional development on a previously authorized TSO-C214 'open' class article, and intends to take compliance credit from this authorization to demonstrate compliance with further F-TSO standards.  This TSO 
standard provides the requirements which F-TSO equipment using a TSO-C153a-authorized IMA platform(s) and or module(s) or integrating further a TSO-C214-authorized article that is designed and manufactured on or after the date of this TSO, must meet in order to be identified with the applicable TSO marking. RTCA DO-297 and EUROCE ED-124 recognize the concept of incremental IMA system approval by introducing intermediate acceptance steps.  TSO-C153a authorization is the first step in the TSO IMA authorization process.  This TSO C-214 standard is an intermediate step to authorize F-TSO equipment implemented on a TSO-C153a-authorized IMA platform(s) and/or module(s), when the applicant is seeking compliance credit from these preceding authorizations to demonstrate compliance with an F-TSO standard.  This TSO standard defines the requirements and delta activities that shall be performed for the authorization of the F-TSO 
equipment. 

 
Note:  This TSO standard does not define the minimum operational performance specifications of a defined function; 
these are defined by the individual F-TSO standards. F-TSO equipment is the integrated equipment for which the applicant is seeking a TSO standard approval, using TSO-C153a platform(s) and/or module(s). 

3. 

REQUIREMENTS.  New models of F-TSO Equipment Using TSO-C153a authorized IMA 
Platform(s) and/or Module(s) identified and manufactured on or after the effective date of this TSO must meet the requirements of this TSO, when applicable. 

 
a. Functionality.  This TSO's standards apply to equipment intended to meet the minimum performance standards outlined in appendix 1 or 2. b. Failure Condition Classifications.  There is no standard minimum failure condition classification for this TSO.  The failure condition classification appropriate for the equipment will depend on the intended use of the equipment in a specific aircraft.  Document the loss of function and malfunction failure condition classification for which the equipment is designed. Development to a lower Design Assurance Level (DAL) may be justified for certain cases and accepted, but will lead to installation restrictions and must be documented in the installation and limitations manual defined in paragraph 5.a of this TSO. c. Functional Qualification.  Demonstrate the required performance under the test conditions in appendix 1 or 2 of this TSO. d. **Environmental Qualification.**  Environmental Qualification of this TSO using standard environmental conditions and test procedures appropriate for airborne equipment. 

 
 
Note:  The use of RTCA/DO-160D (with Changes 1 and 2 only, without change 3 incorporated) or earlier versions is generally not considered appropriate and will require substantiation via the deviation process as discussed in paragraph 3.g of this TSO. 

 
e. Software Qualification.  If the article includes software, develop the software according to RTCA, Inc., document RTCA/DO-178C, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, -, including referenced supplements as appropriate, and the applicable guidance in  AC20-115D (or later version) to at least the software level consistent with the failure condition classification defined in paragraph 3.b of this TSO.  You may also develop the software according to RTCA, Inc., document RTCA/DO-178B if you follow the guidance in AC 20-115D(or later version). 

 
1. The applicant shall clearly define the software that will be developed and integrated with the TSO-C153a platform(s) and/or module(s) that are used and with any possible additional hardware. 

 
f.   Electronic Hardware Qualification.

Appendix 1 1.  MINIMUM PERFORMANCE STANDARD.  This section provides the minimum performance standard requirements for the process of further development of equipment using a TSO-C153a-authorized platform(s) and/or module(s) for which a F-TSO authorization (defined as the F-TSO equipment) is sought. 
a. The process requirements will cover the environmental qualification, the hardware 
development assurance, software development assurance and finally the integration of these developed items into the F-TSO equipment to demonstrate compliance for the intended function, using the credit of the authorized TSO-C153a platform(s)/module(s). 
 
b. The applicant is responsible for establishing the necessary communication channels with 
the company that holds the authorization for TSO-C153a. The applicant shall have access to all necessary design data as a 'user' of the TSO-C153 platform(s) and/or module(s) (for instance, the declaration of design performance, user guide/manual per TSO-C153a Appendix 3, installation manual, environmental qualification plans/reports, etc.). The applicant's organization shall establish a communication means to obtain timely notifications of design changes, open problem reports (at least the ones affecting the usage of the platform(s) and/or module(s), occurrence reports and airworthiness directives (ADs) that affect or relate to the TSO-C153 platforms/modules. 
 
c. The applicant shall perform a change impact analysis on TSO-C153a platform(s) and/or 
module(s) design evolutions on the functional TSO equipment, and shall perform the necessary development life cycle activities that are impacted by the TSO-C153a changes. The functional TSO holder is responsible for assessing the classification of the changes to 
the F-TSO equipment as minor or major as per CFR Part 21.611 and for providing the necessary associated justification.  Change management processes shall be compliant with AC 20-170 Section 5.4. 
d. The management, analysis and classification of OPRs shall be performed by the applicant 
following the objectives of AC 20-170 Section 5.5, for which objective a) of that section 
is adapted to the F-TSO context as follows: 
 
1) The reporting of open problem reports (OPRs) between the different TSO-C153a 
platform(s) and/or /module(s) and the F-TSO equipment shall be established and assessed by the F-TSO applicant. 
 
2. DEFINITION OF CLASSES.  This TSO is an incremental step between TSO-C153a and complete IMA systems certified during an aircraft type certification.  Depending on the future evolution of the F-TSO equipment, two classes are defined: 
 
a. 'Open' class refers to a TSO article that has been integrated taking into account the 
provisions for future evolution (*) of the TSO article but restricted to an IMA context. That means that there are still shared resources available after the integration of all the functions of the F-TSO article, and that the performance and usage constraints of the remaining resources are characterized. 
 
b. 'Closed' class refers to TSO articles that have been integrated and where no evolution (*) 
has been anticipated, with all IMA-related activities considered closed.  The performance of the remaining resources are not characterized.  An F-TSO 'closed' class article no 
longer offers the capability for IMA development.  Design changes may still be 
performed in accordance with the part-21 provisions, as for other TSO articles. 
 
 
Class Minimum performance standard 

| "Open"    | Appendices 1 and 2 of this document    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| "Closed"  | Appendix 1 of this document            |

 
(*) The term 'evolution' in these sentences refers to further development of functions using the remaining resources of the IMA, and without affecting the performance of the already authorized F-TSO equipment. 
 
3. IDENTIFICATION OF TSO-C153a PLATFORM(S) AND/OR MODULE(S).

and/or module(s) and the F-TSO software/application(s) and additional hardware. 

 
Appendix 2 1. MINIMUM PERFORMANCE STANDARD.  In addition to Appendix 1, this appendix is applicable to 'open' class IMA equipment. 
 
When the TSO-C214 article is of 'open' class, the F-TSO applicant shall properly characterize and document the resulting platform resources and partitioning features for the next user. Three main cases of 'open' equipment are distinguished in order to adapt the requirements to the 
development specificities of the F-TSO article as follows: 
a. When the applicant uses only one TSO-C153a platform and does not augment its 
resources, as illustrated below: 
 
Shared resources of the F-TSO equipment 
(1) The applicant shall describe the use of the original TSO-C153a platform with regard 
to the TSO-C153a appendix 3 data (such as the user guide). 
 
(2) The applicant shall describe the remaining resources with respect to appendix 3 data 
so it is clear which shared resources remain available for future incremental development by an independent user or aircraft manufacturer.   
 
(3) The applicant shall describe and quantify the resources that are used and allocated. 
 

b. When the F-TSO equipment integrates multiple TSO-C153a-authorized resources 
without augmenting the IMA sharing capability, as illustrated below: 
 
Shared resources of the F-TSO equipment 

(1) The F-TSO applicant shall characterize the resulting platform using the individual 
characterization of the TSO-C153a platform  
 
(2) The F-TSO applicant shall document the resulting TSO-C214 'open' platform in 
compliance with TSO-C153a appendix 3. 
c. When the F-TSO equipment augments the IMA sharing resources with additional 
development (hardware and/or software), as illustrated below: 
(1) The F-TSO  applicant shall comply with TSO-C153a appendix 2 and the related 
classes. 
  
(2) The F-TSO  applicant shall document the augmented 'open' platform TSO-C214 
in compliance with TSO-C153a appendix 3. The applicant can use the appendix 3 data of the TSO-C153a platform(s) and/or module(s) that are used and augment or 
amend them to document the TSO-C214 'open' platform user data, in compliance 
with TSO-C153a appendix 3. Within the characterization effort of resources, the applicant should document the instructions for configuration of the TSO-C214 article so that the next user can ensure the integrity and continuity of the system configuration, and ensure that the 
resource allocation, partitioning, and health monitoring will not be impaired when integrating the TSOA article. 2. CONTINUOUS HEALTH MONITORING CAPABILITY. As a user of a TSO-C153a 
platform(s) and/or module(s), the F-TSO applicant should pay particular attention to ensuring 
that there is a continuous health monitoring capability.   
 
a. Health monitoring features provided in an 'open' class platform shall be continuously 
maintained and characterized throughout the integration process.  
 
b. Health monitoring capability shall be made available for any potential further incremental 
development.
