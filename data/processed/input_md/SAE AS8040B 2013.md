## 2.2 Definition

A combustion heater is one that utilizes the heat produced by combustion of a fuel within the heater for the purpose of heating air being supplied to various aircraft systems. 

## 3. General Requirements 3.1 Heater Components

A combustion heater shall include: 

a. Combustion chamber and heat exchanger assembly b. Casing or shroud for combustion chamber and heat exchanger assembly c. Igniter d. Burner e. Ventilating air inlet f. 
Ventilating air outlet 
g. Combustion air inlet h. Exhaust outlet i. 
Fuel inlet 
j. 
Fuel drain(s) 
A typical installation of an aircraft combustion heater is shown in Figure 1. Heater components and accessories are identified in the figure. 


## 3.2 Accessories

There are several accessory devices considered necessary to the safety and performance of the heater and shall be covered in that respect by this standard. These devices may be furnished separately or as part of the heater. This standard does not cover all tests necessary on these devices, but only those relevant to the heater. 

The following accessories are discussed to the extent that they are relevant to heater design and operation: 

a. Fuel System: The fuel system supplies fuel to the heater at the correct pressure, temperature, and flow rate. 
Components included in the heater fuel system are as follows: 1. Fuel nozzle, restrictor, orifice, or equivalent 2. Fuel shutoff valve 3. Fuel filter 4. Fuel pressure regulator 
5. Fuel pump 

b. Spark Ignition System: The spark ignition system uses aircraft electrical power to generate a high temperature electric 
discharge across an air gap within the combustion chamber of the heater. Components of the spark ignition system include: 1. Device to provide high voltage power 2. High-voltage ignition lead assembly or equivalent electrical linkage between high voltage device and spark plug. 3. Radio interference shielding. Radio interference suppression and test method shall be specified by the procuring 
and/or regulatory agency. Heaters with output ratings of 11 700 W (40 000 Btu/h) or less may use an electrically heated resistance wire as an ignition source. 
c. Air Supply System: The air supply system provides both air for the combustion process and air (usually referred to as 
ventilation air) to be heated and distributed for various aircraft uses. Major devices of the air supply system include: 
1. Combustion air blower 2. Combustion air inlet scoop 3. Ventilation blower 4. Safety device(s) to hold off fuel to the heater in the event of insufficient combustion airflow or excessive ventilation 
air discharge temperature.

heater downstream temperature. In a typical installation, three thermostats are used to control heater operation. 1. A cabin or compartment thermostat that is usually adjustable 2. A cycling switch located on or just downstream of the heater that limits heater air discharge temperature 3. An overheat switch, located on the heater, that prevents overheating 
e. Safety Controls: Heater controls must be provided to prevent hazardous or unsafe operation of the heater. Unsafe 
conditions include excessive heat exchanger temperature, insufficient combustion air to support complete combustion 
of the fuel, and insufficient ventilating airflow. Heater accessories that may be installed to prevent unsafe operating 
conditions include: 1. A thermostat to sense heat exchanger temperature 2. A device to sense combustion airflow or inlet pressure 3. A thermostat to sense excessive downstream air temperature 4. A device that senses heater ventilating air pressure differential

Measure the airflow required to maintain the internal pressure. The air leakage shall not exceed 4.1 kg/h (9 lb/h) at sea level and 15 Â°C (59 Â°F). In addition, a test will be conducted to show that there will be no leakage of fuel into the ventilating air circuit in the event that the heater fails to ignite. For this additional test, the heater is to be mounted as normally installed with all fuel drains open.

endurance test. At the end of the test, there shall be no leakage through the case or body. 

## 5.2.10.6 Safety Control

5.2.10.6.1 The device used to prevent the heater from becoming overheated shall not be serviced or replaced during the 
endurance test due to failure to shut off the heater. At the beginning of the endurance test and at the end of each test period (5.2.10.2 or 5.2.10.3), any cycling or intermediate controls shall be bypassed and the ventilating air rate gradually reduced over a period of 15 min to permit operation of this device. Operation shall be within 14 Â°C (25 Â°F) of the value obtained at the beginning of the endurance test. 
5.2.10.6.2 The device to prevent fuel flow when combustion air is insufficient for safe operation shall be sensitive to 
heater combustion air pressure differential or combustion air pressure. The device may be an air-actuated electrical switch designed for use with an electrical fuel shutoff valve, or an air-actuated mechanical valve designed to control the flow of fuel. 
5.2.10.6.2.1 If an air-actuated electrical switch is used, it shall be checked as follows at the end of each test period 
(5.2.10.2 or 5.2.10.3) with the heater in operation. 
Reduce the combustion air differential pressure or combustion air pressure gradually (approximately 30 s) from normal rating to a point where the switch closes the electrical fuel shutoff valve. The combustion air differential pressure or combustion air pressure at which the fuel shutoff valve closes shall not be less than the minimum value required for safe heater operation. At the end of 15 min, fuel off time, the combustion air differential pressure or combustion air pressure, as applicable, shall be gradually increased at the same rate and the switch shall open the electrical fuel shutoff valve at or above the minimum safe combustion air pressure differential.

With the heater operating and the fuel shutoff valve open, the combustion air differential pressure shall be reduced gradually (approximately 30 s) from normal rating to the value required for safe heater operation. Leakage through the airactuated mechanical fuel valve shall then be measured and shall not exceed 2 cm3 in 10 min. At the end of 15 min fuel off time, the combustion air differential pressure shall be gradually increased at the same rate and the valve shall permit rated fuel flow when the rated combustion air pressure differential is reached.

5.2.10.8 Unless otherwise specified, items covered in 5.2.10.6 and 5.2.10.7, if furnished separately, need not be tested 
more than once, provided no changes are made in their design, construction, or adjustment. 
5.2.10.9 In case of endurance test failure of one or more of the devices in items covered in 5.2.10.6 and 5.2.10.7, the 
test may be continued to qualify the heater or devices that have not failed. A separate endurance test shall
