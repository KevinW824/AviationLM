THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 

## 1.0 Purpose And Scope Introduction 1.1

This document sets forth minimum operational performance standards for optional equipment which displays non-radar derived data on weather and ground mapping radar indicators: 
Incorporated within these standards are system characteristics that should be of value to users, designers, manufacturers and installers. 

These characteristics are intended to accord with requirements of various users. 

The optional equipment as defined in this standard can provide graphic and/or alphanumeric data. 

This equipment is not intended to be a flight instrument, but rather a supplement to aid the flight crew in correlation of numerous "data sources. 

Section 1.0 of this document is intended to provide information needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated in the remaining sectic;:"cu? 

It describes typical equipment applications and operational goals, as envisioned by the members of Special Committee 133, and is the basis for the standards stated in Sections 2.0 through 
4.0. 

Definitions essential to proper understanding of this document are also provided in Section 1.0. 

Section 2.0 contains the minimum performance standards for the equipment. 

These standards define the required performance under standard operating conditions and stressed physical environmental conditions. 

It also details the recommended bench test procedures necessary to demonstrate compliance. 

Section 3.0 describes the performance required of the installed equipment. 

Tests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. 

Section 4.0 describes the operational characteristics for equipment installations and defines conditions that will assure the operator that operations can be conducted safely and reliably in the expected operational environment. 

Compliance with these standards by manufacturers, installers and users is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will satiSfactorily perform its intended functionCsl under all conditions normally encountered in routine operations. 

It is recognized that any regulatory application of this document in whole, or in part, is the sole responsibility of appropriate governmental agencies. 

Since the measured values of equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the method of measurement, standard test conditions and methods of test are recommended in this document. 

The word "equipment" as used herein includes all components or units necessary (as determined by the manufacturer or installer) for the equipment to properly perform its function. 

In the establishment of the optional equipment standards, the inclusion of color was not considered to be a minimum requirement for the radar display element on which the non-radar derived data is being displayed. 

However, it was recognized that the state of the art of both technology and product devalopment is such that many radar displays may, either now or in the future, include color capability. 

In this regard, for those equipments that do provide color displays, it was considered critical in RTCA/DO-173, "Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Airborne Weather ,md Ground Mapping Pulsed Radars," that the color characteristics of the radar-derived data be precisely defined with attendant minimum performance requirements and test procedures for verification of performance. 

Appendix A to DO-173 covers this situation. 

Additional colors may be used to display non-radar derived, nonflight-critical information. 

The selection and specification of colors used for this purpose do not require minimum performance standards. 

Care should be taken, however, to ensure that when nonradar derived data is displayed concurrently with radar-derived data, either the choice of display colors or the juxtaposition of display elements does not result in any degradation in display interpretation or discrimination between each type of data. 

## 1.2 Operational Considerations

Typical applications include but are not limited to: 

a. 
The use of such equipment to display navigation-related 
information. 
b. 
The storage of frequently used information in a manner 
which allows rapid retrieval, thus reducing flight crew 
workload. 
The equipment must be of sufficient content and accuracy so as to display useful information on the weather radar indicator. 

When displayed with radar-derived data, the auxiliary information shall not degrade displayed radar information. 

## Test Procedures

1.3 
The test procedures and associated limits specified throughout this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the minimum acceptable performance parameters. 

Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the test ac tivity. 

These alternate procedures may least **eauivalent** info~ation. 

cited herein should be used as acceptability of the alternate be used if they provide at In sueh cases, the procedures one criterion in evaluating the procedures . 

. The order of tests suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of different tests as it moves from design, and design qualification, into operational use. 

For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2.0 should. have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section 3.0. 

Four types of test procedures are included which should be used at different stages in the equipment life cycle. 

These are discussed in the following paragraphs. 

## Environmental Tests

1. 
3.1 
Environmental tests are specified in Subsection 2.3. 

The procedures and their associated limit requirements are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations. 

Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance, in preparation of installation instructions and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture. 

## Bench Tests

1.3.2 
Bench test procedures are specified in Subsection 2.4. 

These tests are conducted at the equipment level and are intended to provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Subsections 2.1 and 2.2. 

Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture. 

## 1.3.3 Installed System Tests

The installed system test procedures and their associated limit requirements are specified in Section 3.0. 

Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included in the installed system tests, their successful completion is a precondition to completion of the installed tests. 

In certain instances, however, installed system tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from or to_ other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc. 

Installed tests are normally performed under two conditions: 

a. 
With the aircraft on the ground and using simulated 
or operational system inputs. 
b. 
With the aircraft in flight using operational system 
signals appropriate to the equipment under test. 
Test results may be used to demonstrate functional perfiirmance in the environment in which the equipment is intended to operate. 

In addition, the ground test. procedures may be used as an optional check of equipment performance following corrective maintenance. 

## 1.3.4 Operational Tests

The operational tests are specified in Section 4.0. 

These test procedures and their associated limits are intended to be conducted by operating personnel as one means of ensuring that the equipment is functioning properly and can be reliably used for its intended function.
