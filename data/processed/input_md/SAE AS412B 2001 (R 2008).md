When tests are conducted with the atmospheric pressure or the temperature substantially different from these values, allowance shall be made for the variation from the specified conditions.

5.2
Vibration:
(To minimize friction.)  Unless otherwise specified, all tests for performance may be conducted with the instrument subjected to a vibration of 0.002 to 0.005 inch double amplitude at a frequency of 1500 to 2000 cycles per minute.

such as to allow vibration to be applied along each of three mutually perpendicular axes of the test 
specimen.
5.3.2
Circular Motion Vibration: Vibration equipment for shock mounted panel instruments shall be such 
that a point on the instrument case will describe, in a plane 45° to the horizontal plane, a circle the 
diameter of which is equal to the double amplitude specified.

## 6. Individual Performance Requirements:

All instruments or components of such shall be subjected to whatever tests the manufacturer deems necessary to demonstrate specific compliance with this Aeronautical Standard, including the following requirements where applicable:

## 6.1 Response Time:

The instrument shall be tested so that, when an air sample per Paragraph 5.6 is introduced, the alarm circuit or control circuit shall be energized within a maximum of 5 minutes.

## 7. Qualification Tests:

As many instruments as deemed necessary to demonstrate that all instruments will comply with the requirements of this section shall be tested in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.

## 7.1 Stability:

The instrument shall be operated continuously for twenty-four hours at room temperature.  At the end of the first and twenty-fourth hour of operation a sample of air, per Paragraph 5.6 shall be introduced into the instrument and the time required for operation of the alarm circuit or control circuit at the end of the twenty-fourth hour shall not exceed that observed at the end of the first hour of this run by more than 30 seconds and in no case shall it exceed the time specified in Paragraph 6.1.

## 7.2 Suction Variation:

The instrument shall be operated continuously by varying the suction from 25 percent below to 25 
percent above the normal rated suction.  At each of these values a sample of air, per Paragraph 5.6, shall be introduced and the time required for operation of the alarm circuit or control circuit shall not differ from that observed under the normal response time test at normal rated suction, by more than 
±30 seconds, and in no case shall it exceed the time specified in Paragraph 6.1.

## 7.3 Voltage Variations:

The instrument shall be operated at any voltage within the range of Paragraph 4.4.  The instrument shall then be tested with an air sample, per Paragraph 5.6, and the response time shall not vary from that at the rated by more than ±30 seconds, and in no case shall it exceed the time specified in Paragraph 6.1.

## 7.4 High Temperature:

--``,`,,,```,,,`,,`,```,```,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 7.5 Low Temperature:

The instrument shall be exposed to a temperature of -65 °C for a period of 48 hours, after which it shall be raised to a temperature of -55 °C.  After operating for thirty minutes at a temperature of -55 °C, the rate of response shall not exceed the time specified at room temperature by more than

--``,`,,,```,,,`,,`,```,```,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Tests shall be conducted at an altitude pressure equivalent to 25,000 feet and under these conditions the time of response shall not be increased by more than 60 seconds over sea level conditions and in no case shall it exceed the time specified in Paragraph 6.1.  The instrument shall then be placed in a pressure altitude equivalent to 40,000 feet and at that pressure tested with air.  No false alarm shall result.

## 7.8 Vibration:

The instrument while operating normally shall be subjected to vibrations of all frequencies within the appropriate range specified in Paragraph 3.3.4 in order to determine if there exists any natural frequencies of any parts that lie within the specified range.  The amplitude used may be any convenient value that does not exceed the maximum double amplitude specified in Paragraph 3.3.4 
and such as not to exceed the maximum acceleration specified in Paragraph 3.3.4. The instrument shall then be subjected to vibration at the appropriate maximum double amplitude or maximum acceleration specified in Paragraph 3.3.4 at each of the above determined natural frequencies for a period of three hours.  If no natural frequencies occurred in the appropriate frequency range, the frequencies and double amplitude for this endurance test should be determined from the following table:

The time required for a response to a sample while under vibration, per Paragraph 5.6, shall not vary from that observed under normal conditions before the vibration test by more than 60 seconds, and in no case more than the time specified in Paragraph 6.1.

## 7.9 Contamination Tests:

Air contaminated with 100 octane gasoline in concentration of 1000 parts per million by volume shall be passed through the instrument continuously for a period of 2 hours, after which an air sample per Paragraph 5.6 shall be passed through the instrument.  The time shall not exceed that specified in Paragraph 6.1, and during the passage of the gasoline contaminated air through the instrument, no false alarms shall result.  In the event that it is impractical to maintain a vapor concentration of 1000 
parts per million, the length of test shall be varied in inverse proportion to the concentration for variations within ±25 percent of the specified concentration.
