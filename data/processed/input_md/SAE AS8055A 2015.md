## 1. Scope

This SAE Aerospace Standard (AS) specifies minimum performance standards for airborne binocular Head-Up Displays 
(HUDs) in fixed wing (14 CFR part 23, 25) aircraft; while this document is also applicable to rotorcraft (14 CFR part 27, 29) additional performance standards may be required for rotorcraft.  This aerospace standard covers basic display standards, but does not include specific application requirements.  Specific applications can include flight instrumentation, navigation, engine and system status, alerting, surveillance, communication, terrain awareness, weather, enhanced vision, synthetic vision and other displays. This document covers criteria for conformal and non-conformal HUD systems that are intended for use in the flight deck by the pilot or copilot. Display minimum performance characteristics are specified for standard and other environmental conditions for the purpose of product qualification. This document does not address sensor imaging systems, displays worn by the pilot (goggles, helmet mounted displays) 
or specific symbology to be displayed. This document is intended to be used in combination with other guidance material contained in current system specific, Technical Standard Orders (TSOs), Advisory Circulars (ACs), and other Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved guidance material.  This SAE Aerospace Standard can be applicable to HUDs used across multiple aircraft types.

## 3.11.4 Scale Indications

The display scaling, graduations, and numeration shall be appropriate for the level of reading accuracy and dynamic range required (e.g., familiar units of measure are not as significant as the values and may be a smaller font, but still must be discernible).

## 3.13 Mechanical Hazard System Protection

Within the environmental constraints of this document, the HUD system shall be designed such that no hazard will result from implosion, or other mechanical failures. When the HUD combiner is stowed, the combiner shall be designed such that it cannot be inadvertently deployed.

## 3.14 Fire Resistance

Except for small parts (e.g., fasteners, grommets, knobs, seals, small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire, all materials used must be self-extinguishing when tested in accordance with the requirements of 14 CFR 2X.853 and 25.869 Appendix F thereto, with the exception that materials tested may be configured in accordance with paragraph (b) of Appendix F or may be configured as used.

## 3.15 Supplemental Heating/Cooling

Where supplemental heating or cooling is required by the equipment to ensure conformance with this standard, it shall be the responsibility of the manufacturer to specify such requirements. If the loss of supplemental heating or cooling during normal system operation could lead to hazardously misleading information, the heating or cooling sources shall be monitored and the flight crew alerted to the failure. 

## 3.16 Lighting

Per regulation 14 CFR 2X.1543, all instrument markings shall be clearly visible to the appropriate crewmember.  All display and control labels and markings shall be clearly visible and easily readable in all flight deck lighting conditions, without requiring external lighting.

When integral lighting is provided, all indices within the required viewing envelope shall be viewable under normal flight deck lighting conditions.

## 3.17 Flight Guidance Performance

If the HUD displays command guidance, it shall not cause sustained nuisance oscillations, undue attitude changes or excessive control activity (resulting from configuration, power changes, or any other disturbance to be expected in normal operation), when followed by the pilot.

## 3.18 Visual Obstructions

The HUD should not have drive electronics or supporting structure that is so intrusive so as to block the outside view to a hazardous degree.

## 4. Minimum Performance Standards Under Standard Conditions

The manufacturer shall conduct sufficient tests to prove compliance with this Aerospace Standard. The applicable standard test conditions are given in RTCA DO-160G/EUROCAE ED-14G. Applicable measurement procedures are given in ARP5287, Optical Measurement Procedures for Airborne Head Up Displays; however, they should not be considered the only acceptable methods for optical testing of airborne HUD.

## 4.1 Equipment Functions And Mechanical Operation

Equipment shall display information with contents as specified by the appropriate standard document.

All equipment functions and mechanical devices shall perform their intended function.

## 4.1.1 Start-Up

Under standard ambient conditions, a display shall present statically correct and nonmisleading information within 1 minute of receiving valid data.  Full dynamic and other detailed performance requirements should be met within 10 minutes.

## 4.1.2 Power Transient Recovery

For power interruptions up to 200 ms in duration, recovery time should not exceed 1 second.  In no case shall power transients cause any erroneous display or output after the recovery time (see also section 16 of DO-160G/ED-14G).

## 4.1.3 Lag Time

The lag time between pilot selection of a format and display of the format should not exceed 1 second.  The lag between pilot selection of primary flight data and display of the data should not exceed 0.25 seconds (reference ARP4102/7, 6.1.3).

## 4.1.4 Data Update

Display data shall be updated at sufficient frequency to meet symbol motion (4.2.11) requirements.  In particular, for pitch and roll the update rate should be a minimum of 15 Hz.

## 4.2 Display Characteristics

The following requirements apply to the HUD in its installed position and as viewed under all flight deck lighting conditions from the HUD Eye Reference Point. The following subparagraphs do not include the effects of sensor errors or noise.

## 4.2.1 Hud Display Viewing Angles

There are four distinct field-of-view (FOV) characteristics which shall be specified to fully describe the characteristics of the angular region over which the virtual HUD display is visible. These FOV characteristics are the total FOV, the instantaneous FOV (IFOV), the binocular overlapping FOV, and the instantaneous monocular FOV. These FOV characteristics shall be specified by the HUD manufacturer and shall be consistent with the intended function of the HUD. The amount of vertical and horizontal head movement needed to see the total FOV should not cause excessive pilot workload or discomfort.

## 4.2.2 Hud Eyebox

The HUD Eyebox is a three-dimensional volume of a size and shape that is specified by the HUD manufacturer in which certain optical performance requirements are met. From all points within the HUD Eyebox, a minimum monocular FOV shall be visible. The minimum monocular FOV should include the center of the FOV and shall be specified by the manufacturer. 

The minimum size of the HUD Eyebox should be: Lateral: 76.2 mm (3.0 inches) Vertical: 50.8 mm (2.0 inches)
Longitudinal: 101.6 mm (4.0 inches) The lateral and vertical dimensions represent the total movement of a monocular viewing instrument with a 6.35 mm (0.25 inch) entrance aperture (pupil). The HUD Eyebox longitudinal dimension represents the total fore-aft movement over which the requirement of this specification are met. The Eyebox size should be maximized consistent with other flight deck constraints. The Eyebox size may ultimately constrain the placement of the symbology in some applications. Whenever possible, the HUD Eye Reference Point should be coincident with the flight deck Design Eye Position. As a minimum, the HUD Eyebox shall contain the flight deck Design Eye Position. When the HUD Eye Reference Point is not coincident with the flight deck Design Eye Position, the above stated minimum Eyebox dimension may not be sufficient. Loss of binocular overlapping field of view with head motion should be minimized.  The HUD Eyebox volume is not constrained to be rectangular, but shall totally contain the volume of the minimum HUD Eyebox defined in this specification. Figure 1 
graphically shows an example where the minimum HUD Eyebox is wholly contained within the manufacturer's stated HUD 
Eyebox.

## 4.2.3 Symbol Positioning Accuracy (External)

External Symbol Positioning Accuracy, or Display Accuracy, is a measure of the relative conformality of the HUD display with respect to the real world view seen through the combiner and windshield from any eye position within the HUD Eyebox. Display Accuracy is a monocular measurement, and, for a fixed field point, is numerically equal to the angular difference between the position of a real world feature as seen through the combiner and windshield, and the HUD projected symbology.

The total HUD system display accuracy error budget (excluding sensor and windshield errors) includes installation errors, digitization errors, electronic gain and offset errors, optical errors, combiner positioning errors, errors associated with the CRT and yoke, misalignment errors, environmental conditions (i.e., temperature and vibration), and component variations. Optical errors are both head position and field angle dependent and are comprised of three sources: uncompensated pupil and field errors originating in the optical system aberrations, image distortion errors, and manufacturing variations. The optical errors are statistically determined by sampling the HUD FOV and Eyebox. (See 4.2.10 for a discussion of field of view and Eyebox sampling.) The optical errors shall represent 95.4% (2 sigma) of all sampled points.

The display accuracy errors are characterized in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Total display accuracy shall be characterized as the root-sum square (RSS) errors of these two component errors. All display errors shall be minimized across the display field of view consistent with the intended function of the HUD. The following are the allowable display accuracy errors for a conformal HUD as measured from the HUD Eye Reference Point:

HUD Boresight
d 17' 11" (5.0 mrad)
d 10 degree diameter
d 25' 47" (7.5 mrad) (2 Sigma)
d 30 degree diameter
d 34' 23" (10.0 mrad) (2 Sigma)
> 30 degree diameter
< 34' 23" + kd[(FOV)(in degrees) - 30]
(10 mrad + kr[(FOV)(in degrees) - 30)] (2 Sigma) kd = 0' 43" of error per degree of FOV kr = 0.2 mrad of error per degree of FOV FOV = Field of view in degrees

The HUD manufacturer shall specify the maximum allowable installation error.

In no case shall the display accuracy error tolerances cause hazardously misleading data to be presented to the pilot viewing the HUD.

## 4.2.4 Symbol Positioning Alignment

--```,,```,,``,`,`,,`,```,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
Symbols which are interpreted relative to each other shall be aligned to preclude erroneous interpretation of information. 

Symbols which are not interpreted relative to each other may overlap but shall not cause erroneous interpretation of display data.

## 4.2.5 Display Drift

Dimensional and positional stability of display system presentations shall be sufficient to ensure the requirements of 4.2.3 
are met. Drifts shall in no case cause an erroneous interpretation of the information presented.

## 4.2.6 Line Width

When viewed from any point in the HUD Eyebox, unless specifically enhanced, the symbol line width shall be less than 
2 mrad when measured at the 50% intensity points with symbol luminance set at maximum. The symbol line width shall be greater than 0.5 mrad when measured at the 50% intensity points with symbol luminance set at 3.4 cd/m2 (1 fL). Display line widths shall be of sufficient size and sharpness to display the intended information with no distracting visual effects or display ambiguities that could result in an unsafe condition.  The line should appear uniform when viewed at all rotational or translational orientations.

## 4.2.7 Display Jitter

There should be no discernible display jitter when viewed within the viewing envelope.  In no case shall the display jitter be objectionable. Display jitter amplitude shall be less than 0.6 mrad peak-to-peak when viewed from the HUD Eye Reference Point.  Jitter of 0.3 mrad peak-to-peak from any point within the HUD Eye Box is a suggested upper limit, but that may not be acceptable in some instances.

## 4.2.8 Display Flicker

The display shall not exhibit any unacceptable level of flicker under the full range of ambient environment up to the maximum ambient illumination level specified by 4.3.1 when viewed from any position within the HUD Eyebox when viewing into the HUD Total Field of View. For CRT based HUDs, refresh rates of 60 Hz with a P-43 phosphor and 50 Hz with P-53 phosphor should provide an acceptably low level of flicker. Other refresh rates and phosphors shall be shown to not exhibit unacceptable flicker.  Refresh rates of 60 Hz have also been found to be acceptable for LCD HUDs.

## 4.2.9 Symbol Quality

Lines, symbols, and characters shall have no tails, squiggles, skews, or gaps, other geometric distortions (of greater than one half the local width), which cause erroneous interpretation of displayed data.  Any distorted dimension should not exceed one half the local line width in the area of the distortion. 

For a digital (e.g., LCD based) HUD, the display is an array (matrix) of discrete elements and, therefore, displayed information may have visible spatial anomalies, such as stair stepping, line width variation, and moire'.  The display shall have no matrix anomalies which cause distraction or erroneous interpretation.  This shall be assessed in both static and dynamic conditions. Visible defects on the display (such as failed-ON or failed-OFF elements, rows, or columns, spots, etc.) should not be distracting and shall not cause an erroneous interpretation of the display. Gray scale control, when used for anti-aliasing or to provide luminance control should be sufficient for its intended function.  
Its use should not cause apparent variations in line shape and quality.  Deviations across the HUD field of view should be minimized to avoid misleading information.

## 4.2.10 Display Binocular Parallax Errors

The HUD provides a virtual image at optical infinity. Parallax errors exist when two eyes view the same information in the HUD virtual image. Thus, parallax errors exist only within the Binocular Overlapping portion of the Field of View (7.7). If the optical system is not perfect, there will be slight angular errors between what the two eyes see. These errors are known as binocular parallax errors. Parallax errors are generally specified for eyes spaced apart 63.5 mm (2.5 inches) (the interpupillary distance) which lie in a common horizontal plane. Parallax errors are subdivided into horizontal errors, which are those errors in the plane of the eyes, and vertical errors, which are those errors perpendicular to the plane of the eyes. Computing of these errors is acceptable. The binocular parallax error for a fixed field point is equal to the angular difference in the two rays entering the eyes separated by the interpupillary distance. If the projected virtual image was perfect, the two ray angular directions would be identical, and the parallax errors would be zero. Since HUD optical systems are not perfect, there are residual uncompensated optical errors in the optical system. These uncompensated errors result in parallax errors and contribute to display accuracy errors. Display Accuracy errors are specified in 4.2.3. Horizontal parallax is further divided into convergent errors, or optical errors causing the eyes to angle inward (i.e., objects inside of infinity), and divergent errors which cause eyes to angle outward. Vertical parallax errors, or dipvergence, represent eyes skewed differentially out of the horizontal eye plane. Thus, convergence, divergence, and dipvergence describe how two eyes are oriented with respect to each other to visually merge symbology.

Normal eyes cannot readily compensate for divergent or dipvergent parallax errors. For this reason, these errors should be made as small as practical. Convergent parallax errors cause the apparent display depth to vary inside of optical infinity across the field-of-view. Convergent errors are easy to visually accommodate, but lead to accuracy errors.

One means to characterize parallax errors is to divide the HUD total field of view into a grid containing many field points (i.e., a grid size of about 1 degree vertically by 2 degrees horizontally). This field of view grid is sampled from many different head positions within the HUD Eyebox, resulting in thousands of parallax performance data points. The parallax errors for the HUD can then be characterized as a percentage of points meeting a performance criteria. The computed parallax errors shall meet the following 2 sigma values:
Within the central 10 degree diameter portion of the total field of view, when viewed from the HUD Eye Reference Point:

| Convergence   | < 6' 53" (2.0 mrad)   |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| Divergence    | < 3' 26" (1.0 mrad)   |
| Dipvergence   | < 3' 26" (1.0 mrad)   |

Within the total display field of view, when viewed from within the HUD Eyebox:

| Convergence   | < 12' 2" (3.5 mrad)   |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| Divergence    | < 5' 9" (1.5 mrad)    |
| Dipvergence   | < 6' 53" (2.0 mrad)   |

Note that a convergence error of 12' 2" (3.5 mrad) corresponds to a display image distance of about 18 m (59 feet). These errors apply to HUDs designed to operate with non-distorting windshields. Larger parallax errors may be unavoidable when correcting for windshields curvature.

## 4.2.11 Symbol Motion

The system operation should not be adversely affected by aircraft maneuvering or changes in attitude encountered in normal operation. For those elements of the display that are normally in motion, any jitter, jerkiness, or ratcheting effect should neither be distracting nor objectionable.  They should maintain luminance, contrast, line width, and symbol quality characteristics independent of the rate of motion. Screen data update rates for analog symbols used in direct airplane or powerplant manual control tasks (such as attitude, engine parameters, etc.) should be equal to or greater than 15 Hz.  Any lag introduced by the display system should be consistent with the airplane control task associated with that parameter.  In particular, display system lag (including the sensor) for attitude should not exceed a first order equivalent time constant of 100 ms for airplanes with conventional control system response.  Evaluation should be conducted in worst case aerodynamic conditions with appropriate stability augmentation systems off in order to determine the acceptability of display lag.

For a Digital (e.g., LCD based) HUD, the response time of pixel state changes should not be so long as to create erroneous interpretation or loss of displayed information due to artifacts such as smearing and loss of luminance.

## 4.2.12 Image Retention

Image retention is an undesired afterimage that persists on the display (applies to both CRT and LCD Digital based HUDs). 

Image retention should not be readily discernable day or night, should not be distracting, and shall not cause an erroneous interpretation of the display. If the HUD incorporate slow rate "dithering" to reduce image retention resulting from stationary symbology, non-conformal symbology may be moved at a slow rate if the spatial relationships are not misinterpreted.  Conformal symbology should not be dithered, unless it does not exceed the positioning accuracy errors defined in this section.

## 4.2.13 Response Time

For a Digital (e.g., LCD based) HUD, the response time of pixel state changes should not be so long as to create erroneous interpretation or loss of displayed information due to artifacts such as smearing and loss of luminance.  The display response time shall meet the following requirements.

x
"ms for total range, i.e., sum of full-off to full-on plus full-on to full-off (as measured from 10% maximum gray level 
of 90% maximum gray level plus 90% maximum to 10% maximum).
x
"ms between any intermediate levels of gray with a luminance change of at least 10%.
x
In addition to the above for subjective evaluation, no tunneling (i.e., dimming) or objectionable smearing of critical or 
essential dynamic symbology or video shall be observable.
x
This level of response time performance is required after the warm-up period ends, as defined in the environment 
section (see Section 5).  

## 4.3 Hud Photometric Characteristics 4.3.1 Hud Luminance

The HUD shall be capable of providing a usable display under all foreseeable ambient background conditions, including a sun-lit cloud of 34 000 cd/m2 (10 000 feet/L) and a night approach to a sparsely lit runway (a black hole approach).

## 4.3.2 Luminance Uniformity

The luminance variation of displayed symbols, lines, or characters nominally of equal luminance shall meet the following requirements:

a.
When measured from the center of the HUD Eyebox, the luminance variation of symbols contained in the monocular 
instantaneous FOV shall be less than Â±30%.
b.
When measured over 80% of the HUD Eyebox, the luminance variation of any particular symbol shall not vary by more 
than Â±30%.
These requirements apply for any luminance control setting. The luminance uniformity variation shall be calculated as follows:

**Luminance Uniformity Variation (%) = $\frac{\text{Lmax x}-\text{Lmin}}{\left(\text{Lmax x}+\text{Lmin}\right)}\times100$** (Eq. 1)
Where Lmax and Lmin are the maximum and minimum, respectively, values of luminance measured at a minimum of five points, including one point at the display center and four points equidistant from the center.

## 4.3.3 Display Contrast Ratio

The HUD Contrast Ratio is a measure of the ratio of the luminance of the virtual display relative to the real world background. 

HUD display contrast ratio is defined as follows:
Based on this definition, a contrast ratio equal to 1.0 represents no information on the display.

The HUD contrast ratio shall be greater than 1.20 when measured against a 34 000 cd/m2 (10 000 fL) ambient background, and assuming a 100% transmissive aircraft windshield. The measurement is made at the center of the display area from the HUD Eye Reference Point. Degradation over time to a contrast ratio of 1.15 is allowable. The combiner transmissivity requirements of 4.3.4 shall be simultaneously achieved when computing Contrast Ratio.

## 4.3.4 Hud Combiner Transmissivity

The light transmissivity of the HUD combiner shall be greater than 70% (photopic) for all HUD viewing angles when measured from the HUD Eye Reference Point. The transmissivity can be measured against a D65 light source or computed by analysis/ measurement. The transmissivity through the combiner shall not vary by more than Â±20% over the total field of view when viewed from the HUD Eye Reference Point.

## 4.3.5 Hud Combiner Real World Color Shift

When wavelength selective combiners are used to enhance the photometric performance of the HUD combiner, the real world color shift shall not be objectionable, and shall not cause erroneous or ambiguous interpretations of real world objects.

## 4.3.6 Manual And Automatic Luminance Control

The HUD system should have both manual and automatic luminance control capabilities. While the luminance control is varied, the relative luminance of all displayed symbols, characters, lines, and generated backgrounds shall generally track the control setting in a smooth and easily controllable manner without abrupt luminance changes. In no case shall any symbols or characters become invisible at the minimum luminance setting while other characters or symbols are usable. If the HUD system has both manual and automatic luminance control modes, there shall be no objectionable luminance transients while transitioning from manual to automatic mode, or from automatic to manual control mode. NOTE: Automatic luminance control is highly recommended and may be required for low visibility operations when the pilot may not have time to manually adjust the luminance.

## 4.3.6.1 Manual Luminance Control

The display luminance of the HUD system shall be capable of being manually adjusted from less than 1.7 cd/m2 (0.5 fL) to a luminance level capable of meeting the requirements of 4.3.1.

## 4.3.6.2 Automatic Luminance Control (If Required)

When the automatic luminance mode is selected by the crew member, the HUD shall be capable of automatically tracking the ambient luminance level such that the pre-selected HUD display contrast ratio remains approximately constant as a function of ambient light from 340 cd/m2 (100 fL) up to the maximum HUD luminance level required by 4.3.3. The HUD 
luminance shall track the ambient luminance level until the maximum luminance capability of the HUD is achieved. As the ambient luminance level continues to increase, the HUD luminance shall remain constant. The ability to control HUD 
luminance may be evaluated during flight test in night conditions ranging from a dark background to a night approach at a runway with bright city background, an ALSF II (or equivalent) approach lighting systems, touchdown zone lights, and centerline lights with high intensity runway lights set to step 5. The manual luminance control shall not be adversely affected by failure of the automatic luminance control.

## 4.3.7 Combiner Performance

As far as practical, the optical performance and physical characteristics of the combiner shall be sufficient to not degrade, distort, or distract the pilot's view of external references or of other aircraft.

## 4.3.7.1 Combiner Induced Real World Distortion And Parallax Errors

The HUD combiner should not cause the angular location of real world objects, as they appear through the combiner, to deviate by more than 2.0 mrad (monocular). This deviation requirement shall apply for all head positions within the allowable HUD Eyebox and over the total field of view of the HUD. The maximum allowable radial error shall be computed as the root sum square of the azimuth and elevation component errors. When viewing through the HUD combiner, the parallax errors 
(binocular) of the real world view seen by the pilot should be less than 1.5 mrad.

## 4.3.7.2 Reflections, Secondary Reflections, And Glare

The HUD combiner should not result in any unwanted reflections or glare (from external or internal sources) that cause erroneous or ambiguous interpretations of real world objects or display information.

## 4.3.7.3 Secondary Display Images

When viewed from within the HUD Eyebox, the luminance of any secondary display images (ghost images) should be less than 2% of the luminance of the main display.

## 4.3.8 Color

Where multiple colors are used to enhance discrimination, the use of color shall result in unambiguous and no erroneous interpretation of the displayed information for all foreseeable conditions relative to the lighting environment for which the use of the HUD is intended. In general, color should not be used as the only coding dimension. Other coding dimensions such as shape, location, bold, boxed, or highlighting should be used as redundant coding.  

## 4.3.8.1 Color Uniformity

The color difference between any symbols of the same color located at any position within the total FOV shall be sufficient to prevent an ambiguity or an incorrect identification of an assigned color from any head position within the HUD Eyebox. 

## 4.3.9 Color Registration

When a display element is a composite of multiple traces (such as multiple guns of a shadow mask CRT), the color line centers shall be converged. This convergence value at any point shall be within the average of the line widths of the respective traces at that point. This requirement applies over the HUD Eyebox area for all symbol intensity settings. When a display element is comprised of two or more closely spaced traces (such as video generated symbology) the primary color line centers shall be converged. This convergence value should be within one display line width when viewed from the manufacturer's specified Eye Reference Point. In no case shall misconvergence cause a line, symbol, character color or character form to be ambiguous.

## 4.3.10 Discrimination

Displayed information shall have sufficient luminance contrast and/or color difference to discriminate between the following as applicable:

a.
Between symbols (including characters and/or lines) and the background (ambient or generated) on which they are 
overlayed.
b.
Between various symbols, characters and lines.  This shall also include when they overlay ambient or generated 
backgrounds.
c.
Between the generated backgrounds and ambient backgrounds.
d.
Between the generated backgrounds of various specified colors.
In all cases the luminance contrast and/or color differences between all symbols, characters, lines, or all backgrounds shall be sufficient to preclude confusion or ambiguity as to information content of any displayed information. When operationally required, the absolute color of the information shall be identifiable.

## 4.4 Hud Physical Assembly

The HUD installation should be shown to be safe from physical hazards likely to be encountered during both routine operations or emergency procedures. Criteria to be considered should include physical hazards to the pilot during turbulence, hard landings, bird strikes, abrupt deceleration encountered during maximum braking, and rapid egress.

## 4.4.1 Combiner Stowage

The HUD combiner should be capable of being stowed when not in use.

## 4.4.2 Combiner Head Injury Criteria

The combiner assembly shall be designed to meet the requirements of 14 CFR 2X.562.

## 4.4.3 Combiner Position Alignment

The HUD system shall provide a warning to the pilot if the position of the combiner causes conformal data to become hazardously misaligned.

## 4.4.4 Head Clearance Measurement

Head clearance is defined as the physical spacing between any portion of a pilot's head and the closest approaching portion of the HUD system located generally above the pilot's head. For the purpose of this document, head clearance is specified with respect to a 95 percentile male head illustrated in Figure 2. The HUD manufacturer shall specify the minimum clearance between the three-dimensional outline of the head and the closest approaching HUD system structure, excluding padding. 

A distance of 50 mm (2 inches) has been shown to be acceptable.

## 4.5 Video Display Performance (Imaging Display)

When the HUD system is capable of displaying video images, the HUD shall meet all requirements contained within this section in addition to the other requirements of this document. The term "video" is not intended to limit or restrict the display technology and implies any display technology which is capable of generating a full field display containing imagery generated by any number of sensor types or data bases. When an imaging display capability is included in the HUD, it should perform as follows:

## 4.5.1 Hud Symbology And Video Display Compatibility

The display of video on the HUD shall not compromise the presentation of aircraft flight information when that information is required to be displayed.

## 4.5.2 Video Resolution

The HUD system video resolution requirements shall be specified by the vendor to be consistent with imaging sensor angular resolution, the HUD optics and the intended function of the HUD-sensor system. The HUD and sensor system resolution should not be limited by the display capabilities of the HUD optics or electronics. The HUD system video resolution shall meet the vendor specified requirements and its intended function system requirements for all environmental test conditions in Section 5.

--```,,```,,``,`,`,,`,```,,,,,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---

## 4.5.3 Video Luminance

The HUD video luminance shall be adequate to display a minimum number of gray shades against a real world background luminance which is representative of the environment in which the HUD and sensor system is intended to operate. The vendor shall specify the maximum background luminance in which the HUD and sensor system is intended to operate and the minimum number of gray shades the system is to display. The system shall be capable of providing this video display luminance requirement for all environmental test conditions in Section 5.

## 4.5.4 Video Contrast Variation

The contrast ratio between sequential gray shades in a display of six shades of gray should be 1.4 +0.4, -0.2 with appropriate HUD settings of brightness and contrast controls, and excluding the contribution of ambient background.

## 4.5.5 Video Low Level Luminance

The HUD should be capable of providing a very dim, easily controllable image free of background glow in areas not displaying information in night conditions. The requirement can be considered to have been met when the following is achieved:
In a dark ambient background (less than 0.34 cd/m2 (0.1 fL)), with symbols and peak white video adjusted to approximately

Refractive optics HUDs have been in use for many years in both military and commercial aircraft. Refractive optics HUDs are characterized by an optical system illustrated in Figure A1. In this design an image source (cathode ray tube (CRT) or liquid crystal display (LCD)) is collimated (focused at optical infinity) by the exit lens of the optical system. Collimation is achieved by refractive optics. The exit lens acts as a pupil when reflected by the combiner as shown in Figure A1. The HUD image seen by the pilot appears through the pupil. This is analogous to looking through a porthole while standing several feet away. Only a portion of the total scene can be seen from a fixed head position. In a HUD, the instantaneous field of view is equal to the angle the pupil subtends at the pilot's eye. By moving his head up and down and side to side, the subtended angle changes and the pilot can see a different portion of the field of view. The limits of the subtended angle is referred to as the total field of view and is dependent on the optical design and image source size. This is illustrated in Figure A2. To increase the field of view in a refractive HUD, either the pupil size (exit lens) aperture shall be increased, or the distance from the pilot's eye to the pupil shall be reduced. The vertical instantaneous field of view may be increased by adding a second combiner plate parallel with the first combiner but vertically displaced above it as illustrated in Figure A3. The combiners in refractive HUDs are designed to reflect a percentage of the light coming from the CRT. Special reflective coatings can be used on the combiner to enhance the reflectance. Reflective coatings can be either wavelength insensitive or wavelength sensitive depending on the transmission and reflection characteristics desired of the combiner. If nonwavelength selective coatings are used, the sum of the combiner transmission and combiner reflection is less than or equal to one.

## A.2 Huds That Collimate By Reflection

"Reflective HUDs" are also commonly referred to as "Holographic HUDs", or "Diffractive HUDs". In this design approach, the collimating function, performed by the exit lens in the refractive HUD design is merged with the combiner into a single collimator-combiner element. The combiner necessarily has optical power and is often curved. The curved reflective surface within the combiner cooperates with a relay lens assembly to provide a collimated display at optical infinity.

By merging the combining and collimating functions, the porthole effect no longer restricts the field of view. The field of view is limited more by flight deck geometry and physical constraints, such as maximum combiner size and overall HUD envelope. The combiner used in reflective HUDs often contain an embedded reflection enhancing coating, such as a holographic coating, to reflect the CRT's intermediate image to the pilot. When wavelength selective reflective coatings are used (i.e. holograms) the sum of the combiner eye- weighted (photopic) transmission and the combiner reflection can be greater than one. Figure A5 illustrates a typical overhead mounted reflective HUD optical configuration.

One significant benefit of the reflective optics is that the instantaneous field of view is larger than in refractive HUDs and approaches the total field of view of the system. The resulting advantage is that the pilot no longer has to move his head to see the total field of view. The display is visible as long as the pilot's eyes remain within the HUD eye motion box or pupil. 

It follows that a large eye box allows a greater range of head motion without losing the instantaneous field of view. A typical reflective HUD field of view is illustrated in Figure A4.
