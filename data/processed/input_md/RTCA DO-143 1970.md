## For E W 0 R D

This Paper was prepared by Special Committee lIS, International Coordination Group 7 (ICG-7), of the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA). 

It was approved by RTCA on January 8, 
1970 and supersedes RTCA Paper 87-S4/DO-S7A, dated March 8, 1962. 

RTCA is an assoc~ation of aeronautical organizations of the United States from both government and industry. 

Dedicated to the advancement of aeronautics, RTCA seeks sound technical solutions to problems involving the application of electronics and telecommunications to aeronautical operations. 

Its objective is the resolution of such problems by mutual agreement of its member organizations. 

The findings of RTCA are in the nature of recommendations to all organizations concerned. 

As RTCA is not an official agency of the government of the United States, its recommendations may not be regarded as statements of official government policy unless so enunciated by the government organization or agency having statutory jurisdiction over any matters to which the recommendations relate. 

The European Organization for Civil Aviation Electronics (EUROCAE) 
concurs with RTCA on the Minimum Performance Standards set forth herein, except for the performance standards under the humidity environmental test condition specified in Paragraph 3.2. 

Coordination of these standards was accomplished by RTCA SC-llS's International Coordination Group 7 (ICG-7) and EUROCAE Working Group 7 (WG-7).

## I N T Rod U C T Ion

This Paper sets forth minimum performance standards for airborne radio marker receiving equipment operating on 75 MHz. 

Compliance with these standards by manufacturers and users is recommended as a means of assuring that the equipment will satisfactorily perform its intended function under all conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operations. 

In any application of these mlnlmUffi performance standards, due, allowance should be made, where necessary, for equipments in current use which do not fully meet the standards contained herein. 

It is recognized that any regulatory application of these standards ,is the responsibility of governmental agencies. 

Inasmuch as the measured values of radio equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the method of measurement, standard test conditions and methods of test are also recommended in this Paper. 

The word "equipment" as used herein includes all of the components or units necessary (as determined by the equipment manufacturer) for the equipment to properly perform its intended function. 

For example, an airborne radio marker receiving "equipment'1 may include an antenna, a control box, an indicator, a power supply, a shock mount, etc. 

In the case of this example, all of the foregoing components or units comprise the "equipment." It should not be inferred from this example, however, that every "equipment" will necessarily include all of the foregoing components. 

This will depend on the design used by the 
"equipmentll manufacturer.

TEST PROCEDURES WHICH PROVIDE EQUIVALENT 
INFORMATION MAY BE USED. 

THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 

## Part I Definitions Of Terms And Conditions Of Test

The following definitions of terms and conditions of test are applicable to the test procedures specified herein. 

A. 
Power Input Voltage - Direct Current 
Unless otherwise specified, when the receiver is designed for operation from a direct current power source, all measurements shall be conducted with the power input voltage adjusted to 13.75 volts, ±2% for 12-14 volt equipment, or to 27.5 volts, ±2% for 24-28 volt equipment. 

The input voltage shall be measured at the receiver power input terminals. 

B. 
Power Input Voltage - Alternating Current 
Unless otherwise specified, when the equipment is designed for operation from an alternating current power source, all tests shall be conducted with the power input voltage adjusted to design voltage ±2%. 

In the case of receivers designed for operation from a power source of essentially constant frequency (e. g., 400 Hz), the input frequency shall be adjusted to design frequency ±2%. 

In the case of receivers designed for operation from a power source of variable frequency (e.g., 350 to 1000 Hz), tests shall be conducted with the input frequency adjusted to within 5% of a selected frequency within the range of which the receiver is designed. 

C. 
Adjustment of Equipment 
The circuits of the equipment under test shall be properly aligned and otherwise adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practices, prior to the application of the specified tests. 

D. 
Test Instrument Precautions 
Due precautions shall be taken during the conduct of the tests to prevent the introduction of errors resulting from the improper connection of headphones, voltmeters, oscilloscopes, and other test instruments across the input and output impedances of the equipment under test. 

## E. Ambient Conditions

Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be conducted under conditions of ambient room temperature, pressure, and humidity. 

However, the room temperature shall be not lower than 10°C. 

## F. Warm-Up Period

Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be conducted after a warm-up period of not less than fifteen (15) minutes. 

## G. Connected Loads

Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed with the equipment connected to loads having the impedance value for which it is designed. 

## H. Rf Input Voltage

The "rf input voltage"·is defined as the lIopen circuit" 
voltage of the circuit connected to the receiver input. 

The circuit connected to the receiver input shall be the equivalent of the rf input voltage in series with an impedance having a resistance within 10% and a reactance of not more than 10% of the characteristic impedance of the transmission line for which the receiver is designed. 

--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---
NOTE 1: 
The terminal voltage at an antenna is one-half the induced voltage (open circuit voltage) when the antenna is terminated in its characteristic impedance. 

Most signal generators indicate terminal voltage when terminated in their characteristic impedance. 

Therefore, when the signal generator voltage is applied. to a receiver, the indicated generator voltage must be multiplied by two to obtain the antenna induced voltage. 

By placing 6 db attenuation between the generator and the receiver, the induced voltage may be read directly on the generator output indicator, which is the voltage referred to in the tests unless otherwise specified. 

NOTE 2: 
The rf input voltages specified herein are for 
the case of a receiver designed for a transmission line having a nominal characteristic 
impedance of 52 ohms. 
In the case of a receiver designed for a transmission line having 
a nominal characteristic impedance of other than 
52 ohms, the rf input voltage values shall be 
computed according to the following equation: 
$$\mathbb{E}_{2}\qquad=$$
Where: 
E2 is the rf input voltage to be used in the case of a receiver designed for a transmission line having a nominal characteristic impedance other than 52 ohms -

| El       | is    | the          | rf      | input          | voltage    | specified    |
|----------|-------|--------------|---------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| R2       | is    | the          | nominal | characteristic | impedance  |              |
| of       | the   | transmission | line    | for            | which      | the          |
| receiver | is    | designed.    |         |                |            |              |

## I. Standard Test Signal

Unless otherwise specified, the rf input signal shall be a 75 MHz ±.005% signal amplitude modulated *9S±3%* successively at 400 ±l% Hertz, 1300 ±l% Hertz, and 3000 ±l% Hertz.

A Lamp-on condition exists when either--
(1) 
The operating relay, or its equivalent, is 
supplying power to the lamp, or 
(2)

(2) 
The RMS voltage across the lamp terminals is 
less than 25% of the equipment manufacturer's 
rated value. 
K.
