## Technical Standard Order Subject: Integrated Modular Avionics (Ima) Platform And Modules

 1. 

PURPOSE.  This technical standard order (TSO) is for manufacturers applying for a TSO 
authorization (TSOA) or letter of design approval (LODA).  In it, we (the Federal Aviation Administration, (FAA)) tell you what minimum performance standards (MPS) your integrated modular avionics (IMA) platform and/or module must first meet for approval and identification with the applicable TSO marking. 

 
2. 

APPLICABILITY.  This TSO affects new applications submitted after its effective date. 

 
a. TSO-C153 will also remain effective until November 29, 2020.  After this date, we will no longer accept applications for TSO-C153. 

 
b. Integrated Modular Avionics Hardware Elements approved under a previous TSOA may still be manufactured under the provisions of its original approval. Minor changes can be made under this provision. 

 
3.  REQUIREMENTS.  New models of IMA platforms and/or modules identified and manufactured on or after the effective date of this TSO must meet the MPS qualification and documentation requirements in Appendix 2 of this TSO. 

 
a. Functionality.  This TSO's standards apply to equipment intended to perform the functions described in Appendix 1 of this TSO. 

 
b. Failure Condition Classifications.  There is no standard minimum failure condition classification for this TSO. The failure condition classification appropriate for the equipment will depend on the intended use of the equipment in a specific aircraft.  Document the loss of function and malfunction failure condition classification for which the equipment is designed. Qualitative and safety mechanisms requirements for each Minimum Performance Standard class are specified in Appendix 2 of this TSO. 

 
c. Functional Qualification.  Demonstrate the required performance under the test conditions in Appendix 2 of this TSO. 

 
d. Environmental Qualification.  Demonstrate the required performance under the test conditions specified in Appendix 4 of this TSO, using standard environmental conditions and test procedures appropriate for airborne equipment. You may use a standard environmental condition and test procedure other than RTCA DO-160G, provided the standard is appropriate for the IMA platform and/or module. 

 
Note:  The use of RTCA/DO-160D (with Changes 1 and 2 only, without Change 3 incorporated) or earlier versions is generally not considered appropriate and will require substantiation via the deviation process as discussed in paragraph 3.g of this TSO. 

 
e. Software Qualification.  If the article includes software, develop the software according to RTCA, Inc. document RTCA/DO-178C, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, dated December 13, 2011, including referenced supplements as applicable, to at least the software level consistent with the failure condition classification defined in paragraph **3.b** of this TSO. You may also develop the software according to RTCA, Inc. document RTCA/DO-178B, dated December 1, 1992, if you follow the guidance in advisory circular (AC) 20-115C, Airborne Software Assurance, dated July 19, 2013, or later version. 

f. Electronic Hardware Qualification.  If the article includes complex custom airborne electronic hardware, develop the component according to RTCA, Inc. Demonstrate compliance with RTCA/DO-254*, Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware,* to at least the design assurance level consistent with the failure condition classification defined in paragraph **3.b** of this TSO. For custom airborne electronic hardware determined to be simple, RTCA/DO-254, paragraph 1.6 
applies. 

 
g. **Configuration Management.**  Manufacturers must include design features in each hardware platform and/or module that support a robust automatic configuration management function. This functionality may not be fully operational until actual installation. However, the manufacturer must be able to show that, by either mechanical means or automatic electronic monitoring of the integrated assemblies, the higher-level assemblies will only be assembled according to the intended design or that incorrect assembly can be detected at power-up.  Furthermore, for individual platforms and/or modules that require interfaces to other system equipment through a mechanical or electrical connector(s), the manufacturer must be able to show that each platform and/or module, by either mechanical means or automatic electronic monitoring of the higher level assembly, will either prevent an incorrect connection or that an incorrect connection will be detected before any dispatch. The manufacturer must consider failure of the configuration management design features in the safety assessment performed on the installed IMA system in each unique aircraft configuration. 

 
h. Deviations.  We have provisions for using alternate or equivalent means of compliance to the criteria in the MPS of this TSO.  If you invoke these provisions, you must show that your equipment maintains an equivalent level of safety.  Apply for a deviation pursuant to Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulation (14 CFR) § 21.618. 

 

## 4. Marking.

 
a. Mark at least one major component permanently and legibly with all the information in 14 
CFR § 45.15(b) 
 
b. Also, mark the following permanently and legibly, with at least the manufacturer's name, subassembly part number, and the TSO number: 

 
(1) Each component that is easily removable (without hand tools); and, 
 
(2) Each subassembly of the article that you determined may be interchangeable. 
 
c. If the article includes software and/or airborne electronic hardware, then the article part numbering scheme must identify the software and airborne electronic hardware configuration.  The part numbering scheme can use separate, unique part numbers for software, hardware, and airborne electronic hardware. 

 
d. You may use electronic part marking to identify software or airborne electronic hardware components by embedding the identification within the hardware component itself (using software) rather than marking it on the equipment nameplate.  If electronic markings are used, they must be readily accessible without the use of special tools or equipment. 

 
5.

## Appendix 1 Integrated Modular Avionics Overview, Definition And Examples

This Appendix provides: 

o Chapter 1:  An overview of Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) o Chapter 2:  Applicable definitions o Chapter 3:  Definition of Minimum Performance Standard (MPS) classes o Chapter 4:  Examples of IMA platform using IMA modules 

## Chapter 1: Integrated Modular Avionics Overview

In this TSO, Integrated Modular Avionics is defined according to RTCA DO-297 (equivalent to the EUROCAE ED-124): 
Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA): is a shared set of flexible, reusable, and interoperable hardware and software resources that, when integrated, form a platform that provides services, designed and verified to meet a defined set of safety and performance requirements, to host applications performing aircraft functions. 

IMA architecture integrates many aircraft functions on the same platform, provided by several hosted applications that historically have been contained in functionally and physically separated 'boxes' or Line Replaceable Units (LRU). 

IMA platforms are composed of modules, which are designed to be reusable in order to reduce development cost and occasionally facilitate certification programs. Some modules provide only mechanical functionality, such as cooling the supply of electrical power. Others include core software and associated computing capabilities. The IMA modules are usually both generic and configurable, and the same platforms are adaptable for use on different aircraft models. 

## Chapter 2: Applicable Definitions Legend

o 
[DO-297]: Definitions from RTCA DO-297 (equivalent to the EUROCAE ED-124). 
o

Application *[DO-297]*: Software and/or application-specific hardware with a defined set of interfaces that, when integrated with the platform, performs a specific function. Cabinet *[TSO-C153a]*: Result of the integration of hardware modules mounted within one rack. 

Characterization item *[TSO-C153a]*: Identified module characteristic towards which the IMA module developer needs to determine the module performance, with full verification and documentation in the user guide/installation manual as appropriate. Component *[DO-297]*: A self-contained hardware, software part, database, or combination thereof that is configuration-controlled. A component does not provide an aircraft function by itself. Configuration data *[DO-297]*:  See paragraph 3.7.1. Core Software *[DO-297]*: The operating system and support software that manage resources to provide an environment in which applications can be executed. Core software is a necessary component of a platform and is typically comprised of one or more modules (e.g., libraries, drivers, kernel, data-loading, boot, etc.). IMA Platform *[DO-297]*: Module or group of modules, including core software, which manages resources in a manner sufficient to support at least one application. IMA hardware resources and core software are designed and managed in a way that provides computational, communication, and interface capabilities for hosting at least one application. Platforms by themselves do not provide any aircraft functionality. The IMA platform may be accepted independently of hosted applications. IMA System *[DO-297]*: Consists of (an) IMA platform(s) and a defined set of hosted applications. LRM (Line Replaceable Module) *[TSO-C153a]*: IMA platform element, identified in aircraft configuration and replaceable by aircraft line maintenance to restore the aircraft into an operational ready condition. An IMA LRM is stand-alone equipment that does not provide any aircraft function until Hosted applications are integrated. LRU (Line Replaceable Unit) *[TSO-C153a]*: Element supporting an aircraft function, identified in aircraft configuration and replaceable by aircraft line maintenance to restore the aircraft into an operational ready condition. An LRU is usually stand-alone equipment such as a radio, Flight Management Computer, or any functional equipment. 

 
IMA Module *[TSO-C153a]*: A component or collection of components that may be hardware or a combination of hardware and software, which provides resources to the IMA-hosted applications. 

Application and module configuration data are not covered by this definition. Modules may be distributed across the aircraft or may be co-located. Operating System *[DO-297]:* 1)  
The same as executive software. 

2) 
The software kernel that services only the underlying hardware platform. 
3)  
Software that directs the operations of a computer, resource allocation and data management, controlling and scheduling the execution of computer-hosted applications, managing memory, 
storage, input/output, and communication resources. 
 
Rack *[TSO-C153a]*: A physical package able to contain at least two hardware modules, which may provide partial protection from environmental effects (shielding) and may enable installation on and removal of the mounted modules from the aircraft without physically altering other aircraft systems or equipment. 

 
 
Resources / Shared resources *[DO-297]*: Any object (processor, memory, software, data, etc.) or component used by an IMA platform or application. A resource may be shared by multiple applications or dedicated to a specific application.  A resource may be physical (a hardware device) or logical (a piece of information). Support software *[TSO-C153a]*: Embedded software necessary as a complement to the operating system to provide general services such as contributing to the intended function of resources sharing, handling hardware, drivers, software loading, health monitoring, boot strap, etc. Unit *[TSO-C153a]*: Set of physical components (hardware and/or software) inside equipment in charge of providing a resource. 

Usage Domain *[TSO-C153a]*: The usage domain of an IMA module is defined as an exhaustive list of conditions (configuration settings, usage rules, etc.) to be respected by the user(s) to ensure that the IMA 
module continues to meet the performance characteristics and requirements of the TSO Minimum Performance Standard.  Compliance with usage domain ensures that: 
 
- 
the module is compliant with its functional, performance, safety, and environmental requirements specified for all implemented intended functions. 

- 
the module characteristics documented in the User Guide (as required by Appendix 2) are guaranteed by manufacturer.

Chapter 4: Example of IMA platform using IMA modules RTCA DO-297 contains some examples relating to the definition of IMA module and platform, which can be completed by some additional examples related illustrating Chapter 3 definitions. 

 
Figure 1: Single LRU platform (as per RTCA DO-297). This figure illustrates the sharing of computational and Input/output (I/O) resources within a single Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). Such IMA system key characteristics include: 

- 
Hosting of multiple applications (not part of the IMA platform). 
Note:  The IMA platform includes all the components in the blue highlighted area. 

- 
Platform configuration data and data loading. 
 

- 
Defined API between the IMA platform and hosted applications. 
At one level, this figure illustrates a single platform providing core computational resources. At another level, it illustrates a module to be used within a larger IMA platform. 

 
If sharing of processing, memory, and I/O resources is implemented within the LRU, such single LRU platform will be eligible to CLASS PR, DS, and IF. 



In this architecture, the two TSO-C153a class IF modules are switching A664 frames, providing each of the subscribers a shared access to the network. Network subscribers can be other TSO-C153a modules as the lower row of modules shows, or non-IMA equipment (top row) such as displays, radio transceivers. If sharing of ARINC Standard 664 I/O resources is implemented within the LRU, such single LRU 
platform shall be eligible to **CLASS IF**. 


This figure illustrates the sharing of resources within several single Line Replaceable Modules (LRM) installed in a Rack: 
- 
Rack: is an IMA module and will be eligible to **CLASS RH**; 
- 
LRM 1: provides shared Processing and Input/Output and shall be eligible to **CLASS PR+IF**; 
- 
LRM2: provides shared Graphical Processing and shall be eligible to **CLASS GP**; 
- 
LRM3: provides shared Power Supply to LRM embedded into the same rack and shall be eligible 
to **CLASS PS**; 
- 
LRM 4: does not provide shared resource. This module shall be considered as a non-TSO-C153a 
module. 
 All these modules are considered as parts.

whatever the implemented intended function class(s). 
o CLASS RH: Rack Housing intended function. o CLASS PR: Processing intended function. o CLASS GP: Graphical Processing intended function. o CLASS DS: Data Storage intended function. o CLASS IF: Interface intended function. 
o CLASS PS: Power Supply intended function. o CLASS DH: Display Head intended function. 
 To apply for TSO-C153a authorization, IMA module shall comply with common Minimum Performance Standard and implement at least one Intended Function Class as defined in this Appendix 2. When applying for TSO-C-153a authorization, the applicant shall include in the certification basis all classes for which the intended function is implemented in the IMA module/platform. 

 

## Verification Procedures: For Verification Procedures, The Following Definitions And Symbols Are Used In This Appendix: Analysis (A)

Analysis is the method of verification which consists in comparing design with known scientific and technical principles, technical data, or procedures and practices to validate that the proposed design will meet the specified functional or performance requirements. 

## Demonstration (D)

Demonstration is the method of verification where qualitative versus quantitative validation of a requirement is made during a dynamic test of the system/equipment. In general, software functional requirements are verified by demonstration since the functionality shall be observed through some secondary media. 

## Inspection (I)

Inspection is the method of verification to determine compliance with requirements and consists primarily of visual observations or mechanical measurements of the system/equipment, physical location, or technical examination of engineering support documentation. 

## Test (T)

Test is the method of verification that shall exercise equipment functions and measure system/equipment performance under specific configuration and load conditions after the controlled application of known stimuli. Quantitative values are measured, compared against previous predicated success criteria, and then evaluated to determine the degree of compliance. 

 

Y  
The test is mandated under the conditions indicated in the column. 
 
m/n   Either verification method 'm' or verification method 'n' shall be used to verify the 
requirement (i.e., D/A can be verified by Demonstration or Analysis).

authorization or as part of a type certification effort. This software is sometimes referred to as operational software, application software, or flight software. 

 
Functional TSO: A TSO with a defined functionality (for example, Airborne Weather Radar, TSO-C63e). TSO-C153a is not considered a functional TSO, because IMA hardware elements typically do not have system-level functionality. 

 
Grounding / Shielding Provisions: The electrical and/or mechanical details of the design which provide grounding of the element or which provide electromagnetic shielding. These are the design details usually associated with the Radio Frequency emission and susceptibility protection of the system. 

 
Hardware Element: In this TSO, a hardware element is: (1) a hardware module, or (2) cabinets or racks that host hardware modules. 

 
Note:  This definition may differ from terminology in other documents  
(for example, RTCA/DO-254). 

 
Inter-Element Connections: The connector type standard and connector pin assignments specified to allow modules to be installed interchangeably in the cabinets or racks.

volt and open" outputs. 

(4) Input Terms Hysteresis: The values of the input voltage lag when changing states. For example, if an input circuit has 0.2 volts of hysteresis and if the trip point is 2.0 volts then the circuit will change state as the input voltage reaches 2.0 volts but will not revert back to the original state until the input voltage drops below 1.8 volts. 

 
Logic Sense: This is the functional interpretation of the discrete input states. A true or positive logic sense may identify the "ground" state as a 'low" or binary "0". An inverse or negative logic sense may identify a "ground" state as a "high" or binary "1". 

 
Maximum Logic-High Level: The largest voltage value that can be connected to the input for which the circuit will interpret as "high". 

 
Maximum Logic-Low Level: The largest voltage value that can be connected to the input for which the circuit will interpret as "low".

These announce that a higher priority or asynchronous event is occurring. 

 
Memory Management Unit: A specialized control circuitry, sometimes integrated within the microprocessor, which performs predictive reads of instruction (pre-fetch) for use by the processor. It also may perform structured or prioritized control of specific sections of memory internal to or external to the processor memory. 

Monitors: Specific circuits which observe the normal operation of the processing system and alert the processor or user of an abnormal condition. Examples are power supply monitors, which reset the processor when a voltage is outside of its tolerance, and activity monitors which reset the processor when the processor is not performing a prescribed sequence. 

 
Reset Structure: The architectural details of the various signals that stops execution of an ongoing process, or software application. They then restart the processor at a known state.

Output Current Capacity: The continuously operating maximum current supplied for each output voltage. 

 
Power Monitors & Status Outputs: Separate circuitry which checks the output voltage levels and current loading of the power supply. This circuitry will generate one or more binary signals that may be connected to the processor to alert it to the "out of spec" condition. These binary signals may also force the power supply to shut-down to prevent damage to power supply components. 

 
Power Resets: A binary signal output from the power supply that is asserted when the output voltages are outside acceptable tolerances. 

 
Regulation: The percentage of variation of the output voltages when subjected to changes in load, changes in temperature, and all input voltage transients and deviations. 

 
Restart: The ability of the power supply or other circuit to return to the normal operating mode when the input voltage returns to or above the minimum level or when the tripped monitor indicates the "out-of-spec" condition has returned to normal. 

 
Short Circuit Management: The circuitry that monitors for short circuits or over-current conditions in the power supply outputs. The results from this circuitry may shut down the affected output or the entire power supply. 

 
Transient Immunity: The ability of the power supply to continue operating normally during variations in the input voltage. This is usually expressed as the length of time and the voltage level of the transient. 

 
Voltage Outputs & Tolerances: The voltage levels and tolerances of the outputs produced by the power supply. 

 
(8) Digital Communication Terms 

  
Data Rates: The number of data bits transmitted in a time period. This is usually expressed in thousands of bits per second (Kbps) or millions of bits per second (Mbps). 

 
Integrity Checks: The process that uses additional data accompanying the message information to validate that the message data was received without corruption or contamination. Examples are parity checks, checksums, data validity checks, and cyclic redundancy checks. 

 
Maximum Bit Error Rates: The largest number of bit errors allowed in a message transmission before the receiver invalidates its ability to receive data from that source. 

 
Monitors: Separate circuitry that checks either the continuing operation of a transmitter, or checks that the receiver responds to input data. This circuitry will generate one or more binary signals that may be connected to the processor, alerting it to the "failed" condition. 

 
Resets: Conditions that result in the receiver or transmitter stopping operation, clearing all data, and restarting. 

 
Signal Levels: The minimum and maximum voltages for each state of the input or output. 

Typically, tolerances, thresholds, and reference ground point are also identified. 

 
Signal Rise and Fall Times: The signal rise time is the time for the output to transition from 10% 
of the amplitude to 90% of the amplitude. The signal fall time is the time for the output to transition from the 90% level to the 10% level.

## Appendix 2.2 Integrated Modular Avionic Platform And Module Minimum Performance Standard (Mps) Class Rh: Rack Housing Purpose And Scope Introduction

 
This appendix contains Minimum Performance Standards (MPS) for CLASS RH Intended Function: Rack Housing. These standards specify module characteristics that are useful to designers, manufacturers, installers, and users of the IMA module. 

 For TSO-C153a CLASS RH, IMA module is a physical package able to contain at least two hardware modules, which may provide partial protection from environmental effects (shielding, etc.) and enable installation and removal of those module(s) from the aircraft without physically altering other aircraft systems or equipment. These IMA modules may be simple mechanical enclosures, or they may incorporate passive communication interfaces, passive interconnection for data and power, active or passive cooling unit or any combination of these features. The following definitions are used: 

o 
Mounted: refers to another hardware module, installed and fixed inside the IMA Rack Module, after a human operation. 
o 
Slot: a physical space inside the Rack Module, allocated to one hardware module. 
 These definitions are independent of the design choices made by the IMA module manufacturer. 

## Note:

- IMA module compliant to TSO-C153a CLASS RH MPS is only relevant  
in case of IMA platform architecture using a Cabinet. 
- Hardware modules mounted inside the Rack Housing will be themselves  
IMA modules (compliant with TSO-C153a MPS other classes than RH)  
or non-IMA modules (i.e., non-IMA application specific hardware). 

 For TSO-C153a CLASS RH, the intended function is to provide the capability to share some housing services supplied by one mechanical unit. This intended function can be divided into 4 sub-functions: 

o 
F1 : Housing (mandatory); 
o 
F2 : Shielding (optional); 
o 
F3 : Interconnection (optional); 
o 
F4: Temperature control (optional). 
 The following figure provides an overview of the previously mentioned Rack Housing Module intended functions and definitions.

## Appendix 2.4 Integrated Modular Avionic Module Minimum Performance Standard (Mps) Class Gp: Graphical Processing 1. Purpose And Scope Introduction

 
This Appendix contains Minimum Performance Standard (MPS) for CLASS GP Intended Function: 
Graphical Processing. These standards specify characteristics that should be useful to designers, manufacturers, installers, and users of the IMA module. 

 For TSO-C153a CLASS GP, the IMA module provides shared resources in terms of graphical conversion and graphical laying out between the Hosted applications, modules, and/or components based on commands coming from these Hosted applications, modules, and/or components. 

The following definitions are used: 

o 
Graphical Thread: Set of graphical (displayable) information for which a level of isolation would be guaranteed by the IMA module. 
o 
Data Thread: Well-defined set of data which is a primary form of drawing directives received as 
input by the IMA module from Hosted applications (modules and/or components). 
o 
Command Thread: Well-defined set of command directives received as input by the IMA module 
from the Hosted applications (modules and/or components) in order to change the conversion and 
laying out settings. 
o 
Graphical conversion: Transformation of a set of data information that is the primary form of 
drawing directives (data thread) into a set of displayable basic information. 
o 
Laying out: Operation consisting of a combination of merging or/and splitting actions on 
displayable basic information in order to build the final Graphical Thread to be rendered. 
o 
Conversion Unit: Set of physical components (hardware and/or software) in charge of graphical conversion. 
o 
Laying out Unit: Set of physical components (hardware and/or software) in charge of laying out. 
 
Note:  Both units can be merged into one unit.  The final rendering of the graphical thread(s) is out of the scope of this module (refer to CLASS DH). 

 
In the context of GP class, the 'concurrent item' defined in Appendix 2.1 paragraph 1 means 'Graphical and/or Command Thread'. 

 
For TSO-C153a CLASS GP, the intended function is to provide the capability to share graphical conversion and graphical laying out supplied by one or several graphical conversion and graphical laying out unit(s). The function of the Graphical Processing Module is to receive commands from Hosted applications, modules, and/or components, and optionally receive video from external analog or digital sources, process them, and to generate a display image. This intended function is Graphical Conversion and Laying out resource sharing composed of: 

o 
Information acquisition & control, 
o 
Information conversion and laying out, 
o 
Information forwarding & control. 
The following figure provides an overview of the previously mentioned IMA module intended function and associated definitions:

Purpose and scope 

## Introduction

 
This Appendix contains Minimum Performance Standards (MPS) for CLASS PS Intended Function: 
Power Supply (PS) These standards specify module characteristics that should be useful to designers, manufacturers, installers, and users of the module. 

 
For TSO-C153a CLASS PS, IMA module is a module - mounted into a rack or the rack itself - able to supply power received from aircraft electrical network to one or more hardware modules mounted in the same rack. Following definitions are used: 

o 
Power supply unit: set of physical components (hardware and or software) in charge of managing a power supply (or a part of the power supply) resource. 
o 
Power supply resource: obtained electrical energy from aircraft electrical network to be distributed to electrical loads which are modules mounted into the rack 
o 
Power rail: part of supplied electrical energy for which a level of isolation would be guaranteed by the IMA module. 
o 
Mounted: refers to another hardware module, installed and fixed inside the IMA Rack Module, 
after a human operation. 
o 
Slot: a physical space inside the Rack Module, allocated to one hardware module 
o 
Hold-up Capacity: The capacity of the power supply to continue supplying output current after the 
input voltage drops below the minimum level. This is usually expressed as the time from the input voltage drop to the reset generated by the power supply to the processor. 
o 
Output Current Capacity: The continuously operating maximum current supplied for each output voltage. 
o 
Power Monitors & Status Outputs: Separate circuitry which checks the output voltage levels and current loading of the power supply. This circuitry will generate one or more binary signals that may be connected to the processor to alert it to the "out of spec" condition. These binary signals may also force the power supply to shut-down to prevent damage to power supply components. 
o 
Power Resets: A binary signal output from the power supply that is asserted when the output 
voltages are outside acceptable tolerances. 
o 
Regulation: The percentage of variation of the output voltages when subjected to changes in load, changes in temperature, and all input voltage transients and deviations. 
o 
Transient Immunity: The ability of the power supply to continue operating normally during variations in the input voltage. This is usually expressed as the length of time and the voltage level of the transient. 
o 
Voltage Outputs and Tolerances: The voltage levels and tolerances of the outputs produced by the power supply. 
 In the context of PS class, the "concurrent item" defined in Appendix 2.1 paragraph 1 means 'Power Rail'.

 Chapter 1 - IMA module DO-297 documentation IMA system approval can be made incremental by introducing intermediate acceptance steps. TSO-
C153a authorization is a first intermediate step dedicated to authorize IMA platform or IMA modules (independent of any specific aircraft installation). RTCA DO-297 contains guidance for Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) developers, application developers, integrators, certification applicants, and those involved in the approval and continued airworthiness of IMA systems in civil certification projects. To prepare the integration of the TSO-C153a IMA module, consider the Task 1 development objectives that are defined in RTCA DO-297 (Table A-1 objectives). The following data are available (A) or submitted (S) as part of the TSO-C153a authorization data package:

The Installation Manual includes all data necessary for the proper installation and use of the IMA module (including marking aspects). Each item of the characterization and functional requirements are addressed in the User Guide (or possibly in the Installation Manual, if appropriate). 

 
The User Guide defines the usage domain for which the module acceptance data are valid. The information includes recommendations and may also include examples for correct use. In addition, the guide highlights any warnings or limitations for integrating or interfacing the module to avoid potential incorrect or unintended use. The User Guide may be completed by the IMA module manufacturer with: 

- 
Information on Single Event Upset (SEU) effects; 
- 
A Validation and Integration Kit for application developers and system integrators; 
- 
Development and In-Service support; 
- 
Some training. 
 The Installation Manual includes information as required in MPS appendix or reference subsequent applicable chapter of the User Guide. In this case, the User Guide chapter will be submitted to the Airworthiness Authority (see note (1) above). The User Guide may be included in the Installation Manual of the IMA module (e.g., Annexes) or a separated document referenced by the Installation Manual. Chapter 3 - Core software 
 
As defined in Appendix 1, IMA module may be an association of Hardware and Core Software. The Core Software is constituted by the operating system and the support software that manage resources to provide an environment in which the intended function is performed. Core software is typically comprised of one or more component(s). Core Software may be resident or a Field-Loadable Software Part. If IMA module contains Core Software, Core Software characteristics required by CO.r) in Appendix 2 
are documented in the IMA module User Guide. 

 
 
Chapter 4 - Health management and reporting 
 
Data requirement related to Health Management and reporting is listed in CO.x). Chapter 5 - IMA module usage domain 
 
TSO-C153a authorization relies on the concept of Usage Domain (See Appendix 1 - Chapter 2 
Definitions). The usage domain is defined at the IMA module level, and used at the Application and IMA system level.  The definition of the usage domain includes consideration of the module functionality, performance, and safety requirements, and its required environmental performance. 

 
Pursuant to 14 CFR parts 23, 25, 27, and 29, IMA modules manufactured to comply with TSO-C153a may be used to support other TSOs or systems. These TSO authorizations, IMA system approvals, and aircraft-level approvals are not covered by TSO-C153a but will rely on the fact that compliance with Usage Domain documented in the User Guide is correctly implemented. Chapter 6 - Configuration IMA modules may need to be configured before installation in the IMA system (See RTCA DO-297 
Task 2, 3, and 4). Data requirement related to configurability are listed in CO.y) in Appendix 2. 

Chapter 7 - Tools IMA modules may need to use some tools during installation in the IMA system (See RTCA DO-297 Task 2, 3, and 4). These tools may be used by: 

- 
Application developers,  
- 
Integrator(s), 
- 
Type Certificate (TC) or Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) Applicant. 
 These tools may address: 

- 
Software development (Hosted applications); 
- 
Configuration development; 
- 
Network architecture and configuration; 
- 
Debug, data-loading; 
- 
WCET analysis and measures; 
 
In cases where tools are used, the User Guide shall reference each tool and the data listed in Appendix 2 CO.z). Qualification data are considered as data to be submitted to the FAA as part of the TSO C-153a authorization. 


## Chapter 8 - Compatibility And Mix Ability Information The Ima Module Manufacturer Provides Compatibility And Mix Ability Information Between Hardware, Software, Tools, And Usage Domain In The User Guide, As Required Per Appendix 2 Co.Aa). Appendix 4 Integrated Modular Avionic Module Environmental Qualification Requirements

 
Perform Environmental testing in accordance with the appropriate revision to RTCA DO-
160. For TSO-C153a, certain aspects have to be addressed: 

- 
The Test Software representativeness, 
- 
The Applicable Test Procedures, 
- 
The Parameters needing monitoring during the Environmental Qualification Test. 
 

## Chapter 1: Test Software Representativeness

In the case where an IMA module is qualified without the functional software installed and operating, engineering analysis from the manufacturer must determine that the Test Software (not the target functional software) is representative of the usage domain stress envelope for the environmental tests (i.e. dissipated temperature, power consumption, radiated field radiation, etc.) Develop Test Software to require the Hardware to perform the environmental tests in the worst-case conditions.  The Test Software must evaluate the Hardware in its most sensitive configurations in order to evaluate the robustness of the IMA module over the full Usage Domain.  For example, Test Software should exercise all physical interfaces with the maximum number of applications or input, with the filter values, set to the domain boundary which would be the most transparent to input electrical interferences. 

Chapter 2: Applicable Test Procedures 

For TSO-C153a authorization, an IMA module may be a single LRU platform or may be a module located into a Rack (Line Replaceable Module). Depending on the IMA module characteristics, consider one of the listed cases: 

- 
Case 1: The IMA module is a single LRU platform, 
- 
Case 2: The IMA module is a module designed to be located in a Rack at installation. 
 
Note:  Rack Housing module is not addressed in this generic  
appendix but is addressed in Appendix 2.2 Class RH - Rack Housing. 



Chapter 2.1: The IMA module is a single LRU platform In this case, the environmental sections defined in the Table below are applicable to the IMA module. The usage domain of IMA module must be defined and maintained so that all these environmental qualification tests produce a complete credit for other functional TSOs authorization at the Type-Certificate level.

Chapter 2.2:  The IMA module is a module designed to be located into a Rack at installation or the rack itself. 

 
In this type of installation, only a minimal subset of environmental conditions is applicable to the IMA module. This minimal subset is defined as mandatory in the table below (See Figure 27.) Test sections identified as optional are not required for TSO-C153a application, but may be subjected to these test conditions on a voluntary basis. When optional sections are not tested, they shall be marked as X. Complete the Environmental Qualification Testing after the cabinet integration in the frame of other TSO authorizations (functional ones) and during Type Certificate. 

 
Define and maintain the usage domain of the IMA module to allow the subset of qualification tests to provide credit for other TSOs authorization and Type-Certificate programs. It is acceptable to perform the environmental qualification on the intended rack installation equipped with mounted IMA module(s). The TSO-C153a IMA module  
should be set in worst-case configurations. Doing so, the set of Qualification documents (Qualification Test Plans, Procedures and Reports) may be common to the rack and  
module TSO-C153a authorizations. These documents should demonstrate that the considered configurations (which may be different depending on RTCA DO-160 section) 
are the worst-cases for the set of authorized configurations of modules within the rack. 

Whatever the qualification method, the authorized configuration should be specified in the installation manual(s). Such documented authorized configurations include any installation limitations taken as hypothesis for Environmental Qualification Testing (rack part number(s), slot number(s), blade neighborhood(s), and temperature to be guaranteed) to be specified in the Installation Manual and respected by the integrator to take credit of the Environmental Qualification Testing performed at module level. 

| Environmental Test    | DO-160 section    | Requirement for TSO-C153a     |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|

Temperature 
4.5 
Mandatory When module performance over environmental conditions is dependent on the host rack, it is the responsibility of the applicant to adapt DO-160DO-160 temperature high and low values and temperature variations cycle to the intended IMA module installation context. 

| Environmental Test    | DO-160 section    | Requirement for TSO-C153a     |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|

 For example, in case of temperature testing (RTCA 
DO-160 DO-160 section 4.0), the temperature environment of the module (inside a rack) may be much higher or lower than the equipment level condition expressed in RTCA DO-160 DO-160 section 4.0. The applicant may therefore qualify their IMA module based on a chosen intended environment, and, finally, indicate in the installation manual the temperature range for which the good operation of the IMA module is guaranteed. 

 

| Altitude    | 4.6    | Mandatory    |
|-------------|--------|--------------|

Temperature Variation 
5.0 
Mandatory As for section 4.5, when module performance over environmental conditions is dependent on the host rack, it is the responsibility of the applicant to adapt DO-
160DO-160 temperature high and low values and temperature variations cycle to the intended IMA module installation context. As for section 4.5, for example, in case of temperature testing (RTCA DO-160 DO-160 section 4.0), the temperature environment of the module (inside a rack) may be much higher or lower than the equipment level condition expressed in RTCA DO-160 DO-160 section 4.0, the applicant can qualify their IMA module based on a chosen intended environment, and, finally, indicate in the installation manual the temperature range for which the good operation of the IMA module is guaranteed.

Note: the IMA module technology should be assessed for further DO-160DO-160 vibration qualification. This preliminary assessment could consider the IMA module components technology diversity, integration density and number of layers of the circuit boards within the IMA module. The assessment could be confirmed with testing on a module representative of the IMA module technology used in the product under certification. This preliminary assessment under vibration of the IMA module technology doesn't constitute a credit of the qualification testing of the module integrated into the rack.
