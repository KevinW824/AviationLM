interpretable as an on-scale reading or as an off-scale reading in the wrong direction.
3.3
Power Malfunction:
Means (e.g. warning flags, off-scale indication) shall be incorporated in the instrument to indicate the loss of essential power for proper operation of the indicator.  This does not apply to the loss of signal used to drive the instrument where no other power is used.

3.4
Markings:
Where terminal posts are used for thermocouple connections, they shall be of different sizes and shall be distinctly identified to indicate plus for the larger terminal, and minus for the smaller terminal.  The thermocouple material, and when applicable, the required external resistance of the lead and thermocouple, or the thermocouple circuit shall be plainly marked.

3.5
Signal (Sensor) Characteristics:
Instruments shall be calibrated to indicate temperature in accordance with the signal characteristic specified by the manufacturer of the instrument in his installation instructions.

3.6
Adjustments:
When provided, external adjustment provisions shall have sufficient friction so that they will not change in the environment encountered in service.

3.7
Accessibility of Controls:
Controls which are not normally adjusted in flight shall not be readily accessible to flight personnel when the equipment is installed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

3.8

3.10
Fire Resistance:
Except for small parts (such as knobs, fasteners, seals, grommets, and small electrical parts) that would not contribute significantly to the propagation of a fire, all materials used must be self-extinguishing when tested in accordance with the requirements of Federal Aviation Regulation 25.1359 (d) and Appendix F thereto, with the exception that materials tested may be configured in accordance with paragraph (b) of Appendix F or may be configured as used.

from an alternating current power source all tests shall be conducted with the power input voltage adjusted to design voltage ±2 percent.  In the case of equipment designed for operation
from a power source of essentially constant frequency (e.g. 400 Hz), the input frequency shall be adjusted to design frequency ±1 percent.  In the case of equipment designed for operation
from a power source of variable frequency (e.g. 350 - 1,000 Hz), tests shall be conducted with the input frequency adjusted to within 5% of the high frequency limit, the low frequency limit, and the mid frequency (test at three frequencies).
4.5
Scale Error:
4.5.1
With the appropriate signal applied, the scale error shall be determined at not less than 5 test
points, each taken in a different 1/5 of the scale range, and shall not exceed the scale error tolerances of the specific class of instrument involved as shown in 3.1.

normal position.
4.6.2
The maximum change in reading from the normal shall not exceed the tolerance of the
specific class of instrument involved.
4.7
Lead Resistance Effect:
For instruments using a resistance temperature detector, where the ground lead is connected at the detector, there shall not be a change in indication at any point on the scale due to changing the balanced lead resistance, more than that allowable for the class of instrument involved, provided the instrument is installed in accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions.

4.8
Friction Error:
The friction test may be conducted in conjunction with the scale error test.  The signal shall be slowly increased up to the test point.  The instrument reading shall be noted before and after the instrument is lightly tapped or vibrated.  The change in reading must not exceed the tolerance allowed for the particular class of instrument involved.  The above procedure shall be repeated for decreasing signal values.

## 4.9 Magnetic Effect:

The magnetic effect of the instrument shall be determined in terms of the deflection of a free magnet, approximately 1-1/2 inches (3.81 cm) long, in a magnetic field with a horizontal intensity of 0.18 ± 0.01 gauss when the instrument is held in various positions on an east-west line with the nearest part 12 inches (30.48 cm) from the center of the magnet.  With the instrument operating, the maximum deflection of the free magnet shall not exceed 5 degrees from an indicating or reference position.
