    "Galley Insert Equipment (GAIN) is electrical equipment, used in conjunction with aircraft food service. GAIN (e.g., beverage maker, oven) is not an integral part of the galley and is removable from the galley without tools or with the use of simple tools. The design and operation of GAIN has a significant impact on cabin service, cabin safety and workload of the crew members. Most types of GAIN have significant electrical power consumption, are connected to the aircraft potable water system,",
    "have significant electrical power consumption, are connected to the aircraft potable water system, and are controlled by electronic devices. This AS specifies criteria to assure safe GAIN design and function.",
    "## Foreword",
