    "The Aviation Satellite Communications (SATCOM) System will present standard interfaces to a number of other aircraft systems.  These include ACARS, multi-purpose control and display units (MCDU), Communication Management Units (CMU) (ultimately to be shared with Mode S and VHF Data Links) and passenger telephone coder/encoder and CCS units. Details of the interfaces may be found in Part 2 of this Characteristic, and in **ARINC Characteristic 746**:  Cabin Communications System (CCS).",

    "## Commentary\n\nThe ARINC 741 Aviation Satellite Communications System avionics design envisages the availability of ACARS avionics on the aircraft to effect certain data collection and distribution functions.  Those operators who do not utilize ACARS may employ an appropriately equipped MCDU to perform these functions or a specially designed substitute unit.  In practical terms, their most economical solution to the problem may be the use of a \"stripped down\" ACARS unit.",
    "## 1.3 Function Of Equipment\n\nThe function of this equipment is the transmission, reception and processing of signals via a satellite providing aeronautical services in the L-band (1525-1660.5 MHz).  The system should provide a capability for all aeronautical satellite communications requirements external to the aircraft including passenger telephone and data services depending on aircraft equipage. \n\n--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---",

    "The airborne system may also include support of higher speed data services designated by Inmarsat as \"Swift64\" or \"SwiftBroadband.\"  Initial implementations may add this capability as an additional LRU (refer to Section 1.5.11) or by integrating this capability into the existing form factors of the SDU, RFU, or HPA.",
    "Provisions to accommodate incorporation of these higher speed services within the existing SDU, RFU, or HPA are defined in Attachment 4. Also refer to ARINC Characteristic 781 for pertinent additional information regarding SwiftBroadband (e.g., the Ethernet interface control document (ICD) attachment, aircraft position data requirements from the inertial/GNSS interface to support RF transmit signal timing requirements, Type D diplexer details, etc.).",
    "## 1.5 Unit Description 1.5.1 Satellite Data Unit (Sdu)",
    "The signal-in-space parameters are determined by the SDU in relation to modulation/demodulation, error correction, coding, interleaving, and data rates associated with the communication channel(s).  This unit contains circuits for conversion of digital/audio inputs to a baseband or intermediate frequency (IF), if required, and interfaces with the radio frequency unit (RFU).  The SDU also interfaces with the ACARS Management Unit (MU) based on ARINC Characteristics 724 and 724B.",
    "## 1.5.2 Radio Frequency Unit (Rfu)",
    "The RF unit consists of low power amplifiers, filters, frequency conversion and related components.  The RFU operates in a full duplex mode (i.e., simultaneous, transmission and reception of satellite signals).  The transmit side uses a power amplifier which accepts a signal from the SDU at either baseband or IF and translates it to the appropriate RF.  The receive side uses the output from a low noise amplifier (LNA) and translates signals to baseband or IF for use by the SDU. The RFU should",

Note that only one LNA is turned on at a time.  The combiner then provides a matching network for distribution of the RF signal from each LNA to the RFU.",
    "## 1.5.3.3 High Power Relay (Hpr)\n\nThe HPR is a coax switch for switching output RF power from the HPA to a particular antenna subsystem.

    "## 1.5.4 Diplexer/Low Noise Amplifier (Lna)\n\nThe diplexer and LNA are combined into one unit for installation.  The Diplexer Unit (DU) couples transmit signals from the HPA to the respective antenna (and couples receive signals from the respective antenna to the LNA unit) while preventing transmit-frequency power from degrading the receiver system. The LNA amplifies the very low level L-band signal from its respective antenna.  The LNA also compensates for transmission line losses to the RFU.",
    "## 1.5.5 High Power Amplifier (Hpa)\n\nThe high power amplifier provides an adequate RF power level, by automatic control, to the antenna in order to maintain the aircraft EIRP within limits.  The HPA unit may be located near the respective antenna to assure minimum loss of energy at the RF operating frequency and to avoid excessive thermal dissipation in the HPA unit, or it may be located in the radio equipment rack in certain aircraft. \n\n## 1.5.6 Low Gain Antenna (Lga)",
    "## 1.5.6 Low Gain Antenna (Lga)\n\nA low gain (i.e., 0 dBic) antenna may be used to provide communications in case of failure of a main antenna or to provide a means for additional service.  Service will be restricted to low data rates when this antenna is employed. \n\n## 1.5.7 High Gain Antenna (Hga)\n\nHigh gain antennas provide at least 12 dBic gain and are essential for both high data rates and voice services. \n\n## 1.5.7.1 Dual Side Mounted Hga",

The coverage of the main antennas is shown in Attachment 1-8. \n\n## 1.0 Introduction And Description 1.5.7.2 Single Top Mounted Hga\n\nA single top mounted HGA antenna may be used instead of the dual side mounted configuration.  Drag may be increased in this application.  Either mechanically or electronically steerable antennas may be used.",
    "## 1.5.8 Keyhole Antennas\n\nA typical installation makes no provision for keyhole antennas to provide coverage in the \"Blind Areas\" (keyholes) shown in Attachment 1-8.  Pins are not presently reserved on the SDU for any such antennas. \n\n## 1.5.9 Antenna Control Unit (Acu)",
    "## 1.5.9 Antenna Control Unit (Acu)\n\nThe antenna control unit (ACU) is used with a mechanically steered antenna to translate antenna beam positioning data and beam position change commands received from the SDU in a standard digital format into the form needed to position the antenna beam correctly. \n\n## 1.5.10 Beam Steering Unit (Bsu)",
    "## 1.5.10 Beam Steering Unit (Bsu)\n\nThe beam steering unit (BSU) is used with electronically steered antennas to translate antenna position data and beam change commands received from the SDU in a standard digital format into the signals needed to select antenna elements in combinations that result in the beam pointing at the desired satellite. \n\n## 1.5.11 High Speed Data Unit (Hsdu)",
    "This characteristic also reserves certain SDU pins for interfacing to one or more optional external High Speed Data Units (HSDUs).  The HSDU is an optional LRU that may be used to support SwiftBroadband and other possible future High Speed Data (HSD) services from Inmarsat.  The functionality and interconnect wiring to these external LRUs varies by manufacturer, and is outside the scope of this characteristic.  However, several SDU rear connector pins are reserved to accommodate the necessary",

A Type D diplexer/LNA (Section 2.2.4.3) is required if the HSDU is capable of providing SwiftBroadband services.",

    "The transmit system is equipped to adjust the EIRP according to commands from the GES.  For a single channel system using a Class \"C\" HPA, the back-off is accomplished entirely in the HPA, while the RFU maintains a constant power level to assure adequate drive to the non-linear HPA.  For a multi-channel system using a linear HPA, the back-off is a combination of HPA back-off (collective control of all channel carriers) and RFU output carrier level control on an individual channel basis (to",

    "000000 and FFFFFF are not valid; the presence of either of these codes on either a 429 input or the discrete interface is an indication of an unprogrammed address.",
    "## Commentary\n\nInstallers wishing to use a single Mode-S transponder as the source of the ICAO address should ensure that the transponder will continue to transmit a valid ICAO address when in standby mode.  The SATCOM system may be rendered inoperative if a valid ICAO address cannot be obtained due to deselection or failure of the single transponder.",

Pins assigned to take on the binary \"zero\" state in the code should be jumpered to pin MP15K (Address Common) on the airframe side of the connection. \n2. The coverage of the Parity Pin is TP10A through TP10K and TP11B through TP13K (39 pins",
    "2. The coverage of the Parity Pin is TP10A through TP10K and TP11B through TP13K (39 pins \nother than itself). The Parity Pin is programmed to a zero or one to yield an odd number of strap bits set to the one state including the Parity Pin itself. \n3.

The state of this strap is \"Don't Care\" for a single SDU configuration. 5. The steady vs. flashing light option applies to the call annunciation phase only. The light \nremains on (steady) for the duration of the call after the acknowledgment of the annunciation with either the STEADY or FLASHING option.",

This capability is also defined from the CMU perspective in ARINC Characteristic 758 (Supplement 2 and subsequent, including in Attachment 6, Table 6-16).

In ARINC Characteristic 761, label 172 thus has a unique definition and usage of bits 17-29 that are only defined as pad (zero) bits in the generic ARINC Specification 429 definition of label 172.
