    "The RTCA has been developing the minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) needed to support Unmanned Aircraft (UA) flights within the National Airspace System (NAS) and beyond the operational limits placed on small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).  In 2013, the RTCA initiated SC-",
    "228 with a narrower scope; namely to develop MOPS needed for (a) a UAS detect and avoid (DAA) system [focus of Working Group (WG) 1] and (b) a UAS Terrestrial Control and Non-Payload Communications (CNPC) Link System (focus of WG 2). CNPC Link Systems are unique to UAS.  The International Telecommunications Union has identified multiple spectrum bands, including L Band and C Band Terrestrial, as candidates for use for these CNPC Data Links.  DO-362 prescribes the MOPS for the UAS CNPC",
    "as candidates for use for these CNPC Data Links.  DO-362 prescribes the MOPS for the UAS CNPC Terrestrial Link System intended to provide data link capabilities supporting the control and communication function of the UAS.  This function provides CNPC link capabilities supporting the UAS information exchanges that allow the pilot to safely control, monitor, and manage the Unmanned Aircraft (UA).  The CNPC Link System also may perform data link services for one or more of the following: Air",
    "The CNPC Link System also may perform data link services for one or more of the following: Air Traffic Services voice and data relay, detect and avoid, weather radar, and/or video. DO-362 MOPS specifies CNPC Terrestrial Link System characteristics that should be used by designers, manufacturers, installers and users of the system.  This MOPS document supports a wide range of UAS Command and Control architectures, from the simplest point-to-point radio line of sight application to more complex",
    "architectures, from the simplest point-to-point radio line of sight application to more complex multi-aircraft and networked solutions, however if interoperability between different manufacturers' systems is desired within the more complex architectures, then additional technical standards will need to be developed.",

    "## 1.1.1 Structure And Use Of This Mops\n\nThe structure of this MOPS is different from other MOPS for several reasons as indicated in the following:",
    "1. The CNPC Link System addressed in the MOPS includes two radios (a ground radio \nand an airborne radio), their antennas, the cabling between the antennas and the radios, and the propagation path between them, not just individual avionics equipment as addressed by most MOPS. \n2. The CNPC Link System addressed in the MOPS includes a description and the data \nfor a \"MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System used for MOPS validation or as a baseline for alternative \"Manufacturer-Specific\" designs.",
    "3. Section 2.2 of this MOPS includes three types of requirements, not all of which will \napply to every TSO applicant:  \na. Requirements that are common and apply to all systems (Section 2.2.1), b. Requirements for systems designed against the parameter values used for the \nMOPS Baseline CNPC Link System (Section 2.2.2), and  \nc. Requirements for systems designed against parameter values for Manufacturer-\nSpecific CNPC Link Systems (Section 2.2.3) \nThis MOPS approach was adopted because:",
    "1.  The UAS market and approaches to design and operation of CNPC Link Systems are \nstill maturing, \n2. The range of UA levels of automatic operation and the range of UAS operational \nenvironments require different levels of CNPC Link System performance so one design would not optimally satisfy all applications, and \n3. There is no Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) document to \nwhich key assumptions in this MOPS could be referenced and justify their viability.",
    "For these reasons the MOPS first includes a set of common requirements (Section 2.2.1) that all CNPC Link Systems must comply with to ensure compatible operation in their shared frequency spectrum.  The MOPS then includes a set of requirements for a MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System (Section 2.2.2) that can either be used directly by a manufacturer for their CNPC Link System design or as a baseline for alternative manufacturer-specific designs.  Finally, the MOPS includes Section 2.2.3 that",
    "for alternative manufacturer-specific designs.  Finally, the MOPS includes Section 2.2.3 that provides manufacturers with ranges of acceptable performance comparable to that of the MOPS Baseline System section. This standard was developed as a continuation of the work done by RTCA Special Committee 203 in support of the U.S. position at World Radio Conference 2012. Operational and system constraint assumptions from that work were continued into the current effort.  Starting in late 2015 there",
    "assumptions from that work were continued into the current effort.  Starting in late 2015 there have been new concerns raised that the assumed level of permitted L Band output power may cause operationally unacceptable interference with some existing aircraft systems (specifically the Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN)). Due diligence to evaluate these concerns was initiated and there are further studies and tests being conducted as of this writing.  Manufacturers and users are strongly cautioned",
    "and tests being conducted as of this writing.  Manufacturers and users are strongly cautioned that solutions implemented in the L Band against the requirements of this standard may not ultimately be found to be operationally acceptable, and therefore not approved for operation.  At present, any potential manufacturer or user should maintain close coordination with frequency and aircraft certification regulatory bodies prior to committing to an implementation path in the L Band.  Future",
    "regulatory bodies prior to committing to an implementation path in the L Band.  Future revisions of this standard, or perhaps a new standard, may be forthcoming when the additional due diligence efforts are complete to provide further guidance.

In order to keep the U/D ratio down to manageable levels that are consistent with the \npower spectral densities specified in paragraph 3.2.1.4 for the L Band and C Band ARS and GRS systems, exclusion zones that prevent an ARS from getting too close to an undesired GRS will be necessary.  Assuming such exclusion zones (minimum flight",
    "heights and minimum distances between GRSs and airport runways) are imposed, U/D Link Budgets tabulated in Appendix L show that the maximum U/D ratio that can be tolerated between two UASs occupying non-adjacent L Band spectrum assignments while maintaining 21.5 dB link margin for multipath fading and airframe blockage as well as 6 dB ICAO aviation safety margin is 54 dB.  Similarly, the maximum U/D ratio that can be tolerated between two UASs occupying non-adjacent C Band spectrum assignments",
    "U/D ratio that can be tolerated between two UASs occupying non-adjacent C Band spectrum assignments while maintaining 23.3 dB link margin for multipath fading and airframe blockage as well as 6 dB ICAO aviation safety margin is 44 dB.  The 10 dB difference in maximum tolerable U/D ratio between L Band and C Band systems is due to the fact that the off-channel power spectral density noise floor specified in paragraphs 2.2.1.6.2.1 and 2.2.1.6.2.2 for L Band Airborne and Ground Radio transmitters,",
    "in paragraphs 2.2.1.6.2.1 and 2.2.1.6.2.2 for L Band Airborne and Ground Radio transmitters, respectively, is -75 dBc relative to a reference on-channel peak power spectral density; on the other hand, the off-channel power spectral density floor specified in paragraphs 2.2.1.6.2.3 and 2.2.1.6.2.4 for C Band Airborne and Ground Radio transmitters, respectively, is -65 dBc relative to reference on-channel peak power spectral density.",
    "e. Power spectral densities specified in the sub-paragraphs below paragraph 2.2.1.6.2 \nfor L Band and C Band airborne and ground transmitters at frequency offsets equal to \n0.5C are -40 dBc relative to a reference on-channel peak power spectral density.",
    "Therefore the tolerable U/D ratio for L Band and C Band adjacent channel operation is 19 dB.  That is, the tolerable L Band U/D ratio for adjacent channel operation is 35 dB smaller than the maximum tolerable L Band U/D ratio for non-adjacent channel operation.  And the C Band tolerable U/D ratio for adjacent channel operation is 25 dB smaller than the maximum tolerable U/D ratio for non-adjacent channel operation. \nf.",
    "f. \nThe link budgets of Appendix L presuppose a maximum tolerable received interference level (after filtering) that is equal to the receiver's internal noise level N, thus raising the receiver's interference-plus-noise level and degrading its sensitivity by 10 log ((I + N)/N) = 10 log ((N + N)/N) = 3 dB.",

    "To increase the effective data rate, data puncturing (the selective omission of bits) **shall** be performed on the output of the Turbo encoder to increase the effective code rate with framing bits to approximately R=0.62 with minimal loss of code performance. All four Data Classes **shall** use the same 30-bit puncture pattern defined below. This puncture pattern is repeated until the last Turbo encoded output bit has been processed. The puncture pattern is continued (applied) over the twelve",

    "## Appendix C L Band And C Band Relationship C.1 Scope\n\nThis Appendix addresses systems-engineering issues associated with the relationship between terrestrial CNPC usage of the 960–1164 MHz band (\"L Band\") and its usage of the 5030–5091 MHz band (\"C Band\").  These tasks were defined in the RTCA SC-228 Terms of Reference and reiterated in Section 1 of the SC-228 Command and Control (C2) Data Link White Paper, RTCA Paper No. 075-14/PMC-1201:",
    " \nEvaluate potential for sharing waveform structure between L Band and C Band solutions to reduce certification [cost/complexity]. \n \nEvaluate potential/value of simultaneous operation of L Band and C Band to improve system performance.   \n",
    " \nEvaluate potential/value of physical integration of L Band and C Band into a common radio for SWAP advantage.  Or do we have L Band alone, and joint L Band/C Band variant?  Small UAS may need L Band alone, larger UAS will need both and might want a single LRU.",
    "Section 1 of the White Paper also raised the question of whether a single MOPS document would be preferable to the approach of two separate MOPS for L Band and C Band. However, Section 9.3 of the White Paper appears to have resolved that issue in favor of a single MOPS, and so it will not be considered further in this Appendix.",
    "## C.2 Frequency Allocations",
    "Recent World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) have granted non-exclusive L Band and C Band allocations in the 960–1164 and 5030–5091 MHz frequency ranges to the aeronautical mobile (route) service (AM(R)S).  That service supports terrestrial (nonsatellite) air/ground radio links. In the United States, although not in Europe, UAS CNPC Link Systems are the only AM(R)S activity now being seriously contemplated for either of those bands.  However, competing non-AM(R)S uses also exist for both",
    "contemplated for either of those bands.  However, competing non-AM(R)S uses also exist for both bands, as discussed below.  (Further information on the allocations can be found in the Final Acts of the 2007 and 2012 WRCs.)",
    "## C.3 Band Characteristics\n\nThe most important differences between L Band and C Band for air/ground radio communications are: \n\n \nFor any given values of transmitter power and antenna sizes, communication is possible at substantially longer ranges in L Band than in C Band. \n \nC Band is much less spectrally congested and is likely to have considerably more spectrum available for terrestrial CNPC. \n\n## C.3.1 Propagation Characteristics",
    "The radio-wave propagation characteristics of L Band are more favorable to CNPC Link Systems than those of C Band.  Free-space link budgets show a 14 dB higher loss in C Band, potentially requiring (as demonstrated in the link budgets in RTCA Paper SC203- CC019) the use of steerable directional antennas either on the ground or on the UA to close a C Band CNPC link at ranges longer than a few nautical miles.  (No such requirement appears to exist in L Band.) Also, Doppler shifts are five times",
    "miles.  (No such requirement appears to exist in L Band.) Also, Doppler shifts are five times greater in C Band.",
    "Fading resulting from multipath propagation is prevalent in both bands and can seriously degrade link availability.  Frequency diversity (sending messages simultaneously in both L Band and C Band) can be a way to ensure that there are two paths with statistically independent fading mechanisms, thereby improving link availability.  Unlike time diversity techniques, this method would not involve an increase in transaction time. \n\n## C.3.2 Antenna Characteristics",
    "## C.3.2 Antenna Characteristics\n\nBecause wavelengths are five times as large in L Band as in C Band, antennas in L Band generally require linear dimensions about five times as great as those of their C Band counterparts to achieve comparable values of directive gain.  This is an advantage for C Band that in many circumstances significantly compensates for C Band's propagation-loss disadvantage.  \n\n## C.3.3 Spectrum Congestion",
    "The 5030–5091 MHz C Band frequency range is currently empty except for the little-used Microwave Landing System (MLS).  The aeronautical mobile-satellite (route) service (AMS(R)S) also has an allocation in this band; at least one European company has shown interest in using it, but no system has yet been deployed or funded.  UAS CNPC is the only terrestrial or satellite communications activity known to be under consideration in this band. In the U.S. and Europe, the 960–1164 MHz L Band",
    "known to be under consideration in this band. In the U.S. and Europe, the 960–1164 MHz L Band frequency range is already heavily utilized by preexisting radio-frequency (RF) systems.  RTCA Paper SC203-CC021 provides an overview of those systems and analyzes their potential interactions with CNPC.  The systems include Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), secondary surveillance radar (SSR), 1090-MHz Extended Squitter (1090ES), the Traffic Alert and Collision",
    "surveillance radar (SSR), 1090-MHz Extended Squitter (1090ES), the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), the Universal Access Transceiver (UAT), and the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS).",
    "## C.4 Sharing Waveform Structure Between L Band And C Band",
    "Waveforms and channelization schemes for L Band and C Band CNPC should be made as consistent as possible to reduce certification cost and also to facilitate simulcasting for frequency diversity, in case that proves to be necessary to meet availability requirements. However, the higher Doppler shifts and oscillator frequency inaccuracies in C Band might be somewhat problematic for narrowband signals in narrow channels, so it might be necessary to have slightly larger channel widths in C-band.",
    "in narrow channels, so it might be necessary to have slightly larger channel widths in C-band.  Also, it is possible that future propagation testing could reveal important differences in multipath characteristics between the two bands that would require some differences in modulation types.",
    "## C.5 Coordinated Use Of L Band And C Band C.5.1 Unrestricted Use Of Bands\n\nProposals have been advanced in the past for limiting L Band or C Band CNPC to particular airspace domains, UA sizes, or link directions.  Some of those proposals are listed below: \n\n \nSome have suggested that C Band is best suited for an airport environment, where propagation losses are small, aircraft densities are high, and individual data demands (e.g., video for taxiing) may also be high.",
    " \nOthers have proposed that C Band should be used at low altitudes, where radio horizons are relatively close and larger numbers of aircraft might be more easily accommodated through high-frequency-reuse strategies enabled by closer radio horizons. \n",
    " \nStill others have advised that C Band be limited to larger UA, whose CNPC links may have higher availability requirements and which, being less SWAP-limited, will be better able to carry the higher-power transmitters and/or directional antennas that may be needed to meet those requirements. \n",
    " \nThe fact that more spectrum is likely to be usable in C Band has led some to advocate that L Band be used only for the relatively narrowband uplinks and C Band only for the generally more wideband downlinks.  The wide frequency separation between the two bands would facilitate this sort of frequency-division duplexing. \n",
    " \nThe larger amount of usable spectrum in C Band has also led to suggestions that, even if uplinking and downlinking are both permitted in both bands, video downlinking should be allowed only in C Band in order to conserve the relatively scarce L Band spectrum. \nWhile all of the foregoing proposals have merit, the following considerations tend to argue against mandating unnecessary restrictions on the use of either band:",
    "1. The existing terrestrial spectral assets in L Band and C Band constitute a fixed \nresource that is very unlikely to be augmented in the foreseeable future. \n2. The geographical, altitude, and size distributions of future UA populations cannot be \nforecast with any certainty and will undoubtedly change over time. \n3. Relative uplink and downlink traffic loads, and the contribution of video to downlink \nloading, are also difficult to predict and subject to change.",
    "loading, are also difficult to predict and subject to change. \n4. Because of L Band spectral congestion and the uncertain future of AMS(R)S \n(satellite) C Band for CNPC applications, the respective amounts of spectrum in L Band and C Band for terrestrial CNPC links are also apt to change unpredictably over time. \n5. Restricting any part of existing spectrum to a particular part of the UA population, or",
    "5. Restricting any part of existing spectrum to a particular part of the UA population, or \nto one link direction, will tend to create spectrum shortages in other subsets of the population or the other link direction. \n6. Usable L Band spectrum is unlikely to be able to carry all the non-airport, higheraltitude, small-UA, or uplink traffic, so C Band must be allowed to share the burden. \n7. Little if any L Band spectrum is likely to be usable by CNPC links in Europe because",
    "7. Little if any L Band spectrum is likely to be usable by CNPC links in Europe because \na different AM(R)S application, the L Band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), is under intensive consideration there, so unidirectional CNPC link use of C Band would not meet international harmonization requirements. \n8. Placing artificial restrictions on the use of either L Band or C Band CNPC spectrum",
    "8. Placing artificial restrictions on the use of either L Band or C Band CNPC spectrum \nwould unnecessarily limit the flexibility of system designers and users in devising methods for overcoming local and system-wide spectrum shortages. \n9. Many situations are likely to arise in which messages will need to be transmitted \nsimultaneously in both bands, in the same directions, to achieve the frequency diversity needed for sufficient link availability.",
    "Consequently, the use of L Band and C Band for CNPC links in all airspace domains, at all altitudes, in both directions, and for all purposes should be allowed, provided that",
    "adequate frequency-planning criteria are developed and applied.  This will maximize the flexibility of the system (and its designers and users) to adapt to future changes in the spatial and size distributions of future UA populations, the relative traffic loads of CNPC uplinks and downlinks, and the amounts of usable spectrum in L Band and C Band for CNPC link applications.  It will also allow international harmonization and simultaneous L/C Band message transmission.",
    "## C.5.2 Simultaneous Message Transmission In L Band And C Band",
    "The frequency diversity achievable by simultaneous message transmission is an important means of enhancing link availability.  Since multipath fading typically occurs independently over a given propagation path in L Band and C Band, link availability can be increased if the same message is transmitted simultaneously by a CNPC Link System airborne or ground radio in both bands.  This will be especially important if very high availability numbers become necessary to meet stringent requirements",
    "important if very high availability numbers become necessary to meet stringent requirements for uplinked control messages and/or downlinked DAA target-track messages. Accordingly, simultaneous message transmission in both bands by individual CNPC Link System airborne or ground radios could be used whenever necessary for higher link availability.",
    "## C.6 Physical Integration Of L Band And C Band Radios",
    "Combining L Band and C Band CNPC functionality into a single airborne radio has obvious SWAP advantages if both bands are to be used by a given UAS.  On the other hand, some small UA may be unable to carry a radio capable of operating in both bands, and the owners of those UA may not want to incur the additional expense.  Consequently, physical integration of the two bands in a single radio should be allowed but not required. The MOPS may specify separate classes of ground and airborne CNPC",
    "be allowed but not required. The MOPS may specify separate classes of ground and airborne CNPC Link System radios (L Band, C Band, and dual-band) that can be selected and built as needed for a particular application.",
    "## C.7 Conclusions",
    "1. Waveforms and channelization schemes for L Band and C Band should be made as \nconsistent as possible to facilitate simulcasting for frequency diversity, in case that proves to be necessary to meet availability requirements. \n2. If the nationwide system uses synchronized TDD, the L Band and C Band frames \nshould be aligned and synchronized with each other (rather than operating independently) in order to help protect collocated L Band and C Band radios against mutual co-site RFI.",
    "3. The use of L Band and C Band in all airspace domains, at all altitudes, in both \ndirections, and for all purposes should be allowed, provided that adequate frequencyplanning criteria are developed and applied. \n4. Simultaneous transmissions of the same message in L Band and C Band by individual \nCNPC Link System airborne or ground radios could be used whenever necessary to achieve the redundancy needed for adequate link availability.",

    "These architectures differ by the existence or lack of an intermediary network. The 'Direct' communications link architecture involves the PS communicating unassisted with the UA via the GRS and ARS.  The 'Networked' architecture provides a terrestrial and RF access network supporting end-to-end connectivity and mobility of the ARS and UA.

    "in normative section of the SC-228 CNPC MOPS. SC-228 is sensitive to maintaining a balance between developing real and meaningful security requirements in light of the fact that the perceived systems to which they pertain (i.e., the Access architecture) do not yet exist.

    "such that future networks and related technologies are readily able to adopt technologies needed to meet and maintain an acceptable security stance.  In practice, direct and network architectures continuously evolve just as today's GSM and CDMA cellular phone network infrastructures.

The link is designed to provide the PIC the communications necessary to safely and securely operate the UA within the National Airspace System (NAS).

    "1) The aircraft had adequate flight performance to land at an airport equipped for \nUAS. \n2) The aircraft did not have adequate flight performance to land at an airport \nequipped for UAS.",
    "In case (1) it was determined that there would be adequate time for a ground observer and or chase plane to be deployed and that ATC could support airspace clearance to provide adequate mitigation.  In case (2) however it was assessed that there would not be enough time to deploy any mitigation and that without video the UA pilot could not make an assessment of a suitable landing or flight termination site so the loss of the function had the potential to cause major or worse injury or property",
    "site so the loss of the function had the potential to cause major or worse injury or property damage. Additionally, since it is not anticipated that Detect and Avoid will cover the case of remaining well-clear of non-transponder equipped objects (towers, buildings, small aerial objects etc.) and terrain that loss of visual cues particularly during low altitude operation would lead to the potential to cause major or worse injury or property damage.",
    "## E.5 Step 4 - Required Video Performance And Supporting Data Rate\n\nThe ten requirements remaining after the safety assessment step were then reviewed to determine the performance of the video that would be required to support sending the associated visual cues to the pilot. The following four performance parameters were used:",
    " \nBlack and White or Color.  Color requires approximately twice as much data as \nBlack and White.  Black and White includes infra-red (e.g., Enhanced Flight Vision System) since both are monochromatic. \n \nField Of View (FOV).  Wide ±120 degrees azimuth and ±15 degrees elevation \n(equivalent to the cockpit windshield limit) or Narrow ±10 degrees (e.g., 2km baseline at 5km range) \n \nResolution.  High Resolution 1280 x 720 pixels (approximately 1.5m feature size",
    " \nResolution.  High Resolution 1280 x 720 pixels (approximately 1.5m feature size \nat 5km range with a Narrow FOV) or Low Resolution 352 x 240 pixels (approximately 6m feature size at 5km with a Narrow FOV) \n \nFrame Rate.  Low, 1-3 frames per second or High, greater than 7.5 frames per \nsecond.",
    "The above performance points were used in this assessment and represent typical capabilities.  Exact performance requirements will need to be assessed by the designer of a specific system to meet operational and safety needs. The video performance assessment concluded that color was required to differentiate the types of terrain on which to perform an emergency landing or the obstacles and terrain to avoid during low altitude flight and certain runway visual references during a 14 CFR 91.175",
    "to avoid during low altitude flight and certain runway visual references during a 14 CFR 91.175 compliant landing.  It also concluded that High Frame Rate was only required for low altitude flight to avoid obstacles and terrain.  Although Field Of View does not directly impact data rate it is important to determine the Resolution required in order to see a feature of a particular size.  The assessments determined that High Resolution was required for all visual cues other than the requirement",
    "determined that High Resolution was required for all visual cues other than the requirement to ensure that the aircraft was approaching the correct runway.  Low Frame Rates were assessed acceptable for all of the requirements except during low altitude Enroute operation. Motion JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group - ISO 10918-1) and H.264 ISO 14496 10 Advanced Video Coding were used as references to determine the data rates required to support the assessed video performance.  Each is capable",
    "to determine the data rates required to support the assessed video performance.  Each is capable of compressing a 352 x 240 pixel resolution black and white image into approximately 20 kbits of data (depending on the image content) and decompressing it back to an image that is acceptably free of visually distracting artifacts once every second.  Other data rates were then scaled from this reference based on the resolution and need or otherwise for color. The highest data rate (approximately",
    "based on the resolution and need or otherwise for color. The highest data rate (approximately 1627 kbps) would be required to support obstacle and terrain avoidance during low altitude Enroute operations and the lowest data rate (20kbps) would be required to support the requirement to ensure the aircraft is approaching the correct runway.  The majority of the other requirements were supportable with either 217 kbps (Takeoff, Approach and Landing and Enroute phases) or 435 kbps off-airport",
    "with either 217 kbps (Takeoff, Approach and Landing and Enroute phases) or 435 kbps off-airport emergency landing. An additional Utilization assessment was also performed to determine the amount of time that the various video transmissions would occupy in a typical mission.  In was determined that the video duration for the Takeoff phase would be ten minutes on average and that a similar time would be required for the Approach and Landing phase.  If video is required to support low altitude",
    "would be required for the Approach and Landing phase.  If video is required to support low altitude Enroute operations, then it would need to be transmitted continuously.  If video was only required during climb and descent to and from high altitude Enroute operation, then it would be required for approximately 15 minutes in total (additional to that required for Takeoff and Approach and Landing). Finally, video support during emergency landings could be needed for approximately 10 minutes but",
    "Finally, video support during emergency landings could be needed for approximately 10 minutes but this would only be on the very rare occasion that an emergency off-airport landing was required.",
    "## E.6 Conclusion",
    "Visual inputs to pilots form an integral part of today's manned aircraft operations in civil airspace.  The assessments performed by RTCA SC-228 show that, under certain circumstances, with alternate approaches other than video, visual cues need not be sent to the remote pilot over the CNPC Link System.  The assessments did conclude however that video can provide a valuable contribution to overall safety and efficiency of operation and that its use should not be precluded from the options",
    "safety and efficiency of operation and that its use should not be precluded from the options available to the designer.",
    "If video is chosen by the system designer, then the performance and data rate assessments contained in this Appendix can be used as a guide to help design and certify systems. Based on these assessments it is proposed, on a nationwide basis, that a single (435 kbps)",
    "video channel is allocated for Enroute operation and that it is set aside for emergency situations.  Additionally, it is also proposed that two (217 kbps) video channels (per runway) are provided at every airport designated for UAS operations allowing two aircraft to be in the vicinity of the runway at the same time.  Since Takeoff and Approach and Landing operations occur at lower altitudes it is reasonable to assume that high geo/altitude frequency reuse factors can be employed with these two",
    "reasonable to assume that high geo/altitude frequency reuse factors can be employed with these two video channels. Frequency assignments to support these video channels will be required as part of the overall frequency planning activity discussed in Appendices H and I. Since video transmission is infrequent and may not be necessary with some UAS architectures designers may choose to implement video capabilities with an airborne transmitter separate from the equipment supporting the CNPC Link",
    "capabilities with an airborne transmitter separate from the equipment supporting the CNPC Link System. If video is required for Low Altitude Enroute operation then it is recommended that, because of the spectrum required (1627kHz per aircraft, assuming one bit per Hertz), the need for continuous video transmission and the difficulty of delivering adequately available RLOS CNPC links at low altitudes then consideration should be given to alternate means (some of which are identified in this",
    "then consideration should be given to alternate means (some of which are identified in this Appendix and Table E-1) to support the delivery of the visual cues to the pilot or that satellite CNPC or other RF links are employed depending on the criticality of the operations.",

While not an ICAO standardized system, it operates under the ARNS. At the upper end of the frequency band, the 1164 - 1215 MHz band is also allocated to the Radionavigation Satellite Service (RNSS).  Within this allocation, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) L5 are planned",
    "Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) L5 are planned for operation in this subband.  There will be other worldwide GNSS constellation signals such as the European Galileo E5a/E5b, the Russian Federation GLONASS L3 and the People's Republic of China BeiDou B2I signal.  There are also satellite-based and ground-based augmentation systems that most likely will operate in that band. As described above, it is proposed that the CNPC Link System would operate",
    "operate in that band. As described above, it is proposed that the CNPC Link System would operate under the AM(R)S allocation within the 960-1164 MHz band.  Since the ARNS and RNSS services operating in L Band were established before the AM(R)S service, any new AM(R)S systems will have to integrate with the existing ARNS and RNSS systems and meet the protection requirements necessary to ensure interference free operations among all the L Band systems.

As a result, it was determined that with a maximum L Band transmit power of 32 mW for UA flying at low altitude (less than 3kft AGL) and within short range (less than 15NM) of their GRS, the 1040-1080 MHz and 1104-1150 MHz sub-bands had the greatest possibility of being acceptable; an analysis of the use of the 1040-1080",

Given that the 1040-1080 MHz and 1104-1150 MHz sub-bands had the greatest possibility of being acceptable, this appendix will define both the RF environment of the offboard incumbent systems as well as the cosite equipment.

However, following additional analyses, it was determined that there would be far more extensive coordination needed with agencies using TACAN in that portion of the band.

As noted in Section 2, these analyses are not sufficiently complete to constitute a full recommendation that the use of L Band is possible for any specific location.  Additional",

    "## H.2.3 Channel-Licensing Procedures",
    "Under the Communications Act of 1934, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have authority to grant frequency licenses to Federal and non-Federal users, respectively. By purview of NTIA, the FAA administers the Aeronautical Assignment Group (AAG), which is responsible for engineering frequencies in specified aviation-related frequency bands and designating which frequency applications should be approved by NTIA and",
    "frequency bands and designating which frequency applications should be approved by NTIA and the FCC. Since C Band and part of L Band are under AAG authority, the FAA will be responsible for the engineering review of CNPC license applications. It is anticipated that civil users of terrestrial CNPC will require frequency authorizations from the FCC, with review by the FAA, at least for the ground radio systems. The nature and scope of the licenses will depend upon the proposed technical",
    "ground radio systems. The nature and scope of the licenses will depend upon the proposed technical parameters (including final channelization, frequency reuse, and emissions), the final configuration of any UAS network architecture, and the regulations of NTIA and the FCC. Both of those agencies will determine how air and ground radio system licenses will be issued to UAS operators.",
    "## H.3 Technical And Operational Considerations",
    "1. All terrestrial CNPC uplinks and downlinks operating in compliance with this MOPS \nwill be separated in the time domain by time-division duplexing (TDD), synchronized among all users, as provided in Section 2.2.1.  Synchronized TDD prevents ground-toground RF interference (RFI).  It also precludes air-to-air RFI except when interfering-signal paths are very long (which can happen under conditions of ducting or super refraction, or when very-high-altitude UA are involved).",
    "2. Every CNPC uplink or downlink compliant with this MOPS must operate within a \ncontiguous frequency channel comprising one or more 5-kHz frequency blocks as \nstipulated in Section 2.2.1, and its transmitter's emissions must comply with the",
    "stipulated in Section 2.2.1, and its transmitter's emissions must comply with the \ntransmitter emission mask depicted therein.  However, there is no universal requirement to utilize a common set of channel spacings, widths, or placements. Spectrum managers in this band must be prepared to deal with a wide variety of channel widths that may vary drastically from system to system. \n3. Uplink and downlink frequencies may be chosen independently.  That is, a given UAS",
    "3. Uplink and downlink frequencies may be chosen independently.  That is, a given UAS \ncan use one frequency for its uplink and a different frequency for its downlink. \n4. Systems operating in compliance with this MOPS will not depend on the use of a \ncommon signaling channel. \n5. Frequency planning should strive to provide maximum frequency reuse consistent",
    "5. Frequency planning should strive to provide maximum frequency reuse consistent \nwith keeping every CNPC receiver's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) sufficiently high to meet the link-availability requirements of the UAS that it supports. This is achievable through appropriate combinations of over-the-horizon frequency reuse, directional antennas, and adequate separations between links using adjacent channels.",
    "6. The traditional 4/3 earth radio horizon is not an impenetrable barrier against \ninterference.  Ducting and other anomalous propagation phenomena can occasionally carry cochannel interference much farther than expected, especially in warm, humid climates.  In a CNPC system where required availability is high, anomalous propagation could have a significant impact and should be taken into account in frequency reuse planning.",
    "7. CNPC service for a given UAS can be provided in either of two ways: \n \nA \"standalone\" CNPC link directly connecting the radios of the UAS ground radio system (GRS) and the UA itself; or \n \nA network capable of simultaneously serving two or more UAS.",
    "## H.4 Cellular Frequency Planning",
    "If CNPC service is provided to some UAS via one or more networks, it may be advantageous to devise for each network a cellular frequency plan with lists of frequencies allotted to particular volumes of airspace for use as needed by individual UAS.  Figure H- 1 shows an example of such a plan.  The number inside each hexagonal cell does not represent a single frequency, but instead designates a list of frequencies available for assignment by the dynamic resource-assignment process to UAS",
    "a list of frequencies available for assignment by the dynamic resource-assignment process to UAS operating within the cell.",
    "The entire area covered by the network is divided into cell clusters with repeating patterns of frequency lists.  In the example, the cell-cluster size (K) is 12. That value of K is the smallest for which it is possible to avoid assigning first adjacent channels to immediately adjacent cells—a useful measure for preventing adjacent-channel interference (ACI). Another benefit is that cochannel interference (CCI) between ground and airborne radios is possible only at distances greater than four",
    "(CCI) between ground and airborne radios is possible only at distances greater than four cell radii.  Under normal propagation conditions, that largely precludes air-to-air CCI unless the altitude of the UA concerned is higher than about 10C2 feet, where C is cell radius in nautical miles. A major drawback of large values of K is that the frequency-reuse factor is inversely proportional to cell-cluster size.  In other words, the fraction of total frequency resources available to users in any",
    "size.  In other words, the fraction of total frequency resources available to users in any given cell is only 1 / K.  If those resources were small to begin with, dividing them by 12 could result in cellular resource lists so small that instances could often arise in which one cell runs out of frequencies while each of its neighbors still has several frequencies available.  Using lower values of K can limit such effects.  The smallest value of K that prevents adjacent cells from using the same",
    "K can limit such effects.  The smallest value of K that prevents adjacent cells from using the same frequency is 3.",
    "## H.4.1 Low-Altitude Coverage",
    "Three-dimensional frequency plans can be constructed in which the value of K (and thus the entire pattern of resource lists) is a function of altitude.  If the horizontal cellular pattern remains constant regardless of altitude, this has the advantage of allowing UA at all altitudes to use the same GRS at the center of a given \"stack\" of cells—provided that the UA are within sight of the GRS.  However, that is not necessarily the case, as Figure H-2 illustrates.  In that figure, a cell radius",
    "that is not necessarily the case, as Figure H-2 illustrates.  In that figure, a cell radius of 69 NM is assumed.  The radio horizon distance over a smooth earth with a standard atmosphere is 1.23H nautical miles, where H is altitude in feet.  Even if the surrounding terrain is quite smooth, a 100-foot cell tower at the center of such a cell would be unable to provide coverage down to the ground in more than a small fraction of the total area of the cell.  At the corners of the cell, only UA",
    "in more than a small fraction of the total area of the cell.  At the corners of the cell, only UA about 4000 feet above ground level (AGL) or higher could have a line of sight to the cell tower.  Since virtually all UA must take off and eventually land, and many never fly at all above a few hundred feet, local low-altitude coverage must be provided by appropriately placed \"gapfiller\" GRS as shown in the figure.  The fact that some gapfillers will have to operate near cell edges, to meet the",
    "in the figure.  The fact that some gapfillers will have to operate near cell edges, to meet the needs of UA operating there, poses a threat of adjacent-channel interference (ACI) in adjacent cells and complicates frequency reuse.",
    "## H.4.2 Other Issues Affecting Cellular Frequency Planning",
    " \nCell boundaries must be \"soft\" in the sense that UA will be allowed to fly, perhaps as \nfar as 2 NM, into adjacent cells without changing their frequency assignments.  Soft boundaries are necessary to accommodate UA whose flight paths require frequent crossing of cell boundaries.  In effect, this will enlarge the cells and cause them to overlap.  In some altitude tiers this may require larger K values and thus reduce frequency reuse. \n",
    " \nIn a system that relies on a predetermined nationwide cellular frequency plan, it is difficult to accommodate temporary deviations from the plan, on relatively short notice, to cope with localized demand surges arising from emergencies or disasters. Each GRS will have been optimized to operate on a particular set of frequencies, and any changes to that set are likely to require time-consuming actions such as retuning of filters. \n",
    " \nCellular frequency planning is very difficult to accomplish without a small and rigidly defined set of channel widths.  If applied to standalone (non-networked) CNPC links, it could greatly reduce the link-design flexibility provided by the variable-channelwidth provisions of Section 2.2.1.",
    "## H.5 Noncellular Frequency Planning\n\nAlthough cellular frequency planning would probably be necessary for the design of a large CNPC network, it may be unsuitable for assigning frequencies to standalone CNPC \nlinks or to links between UA and gapfiller GRS.  The following adverse consequences would be likely to stem from a decision to require standalone and gapfiller links to conform to a cellular frequency plan:",
    " \nDesigner flexibility in tailoring channel widths to the throughput needs of a given \nUAS would be curtailed. \n \nIt could prove very difficult to protect adjacent cells against interference emanating from a standalone or gapfiller GRS operating near cell boundaries. \n \nStandalone UA traversing cell boundaries would consume frequency resources in both cells involved, whereas in a noncellular plan a single frequency would often suffice. \n",
    " \nOperational flexibility in shifting frequency resources to particular regions to deal with temporary local demand surges would be reduced. \nConsequently, for non-networked standalone and gapfiller CNPC links, a noncellular frequency-reuse planning approach (similar to that used by the FAA for the VHF air/ground ATC radio system, and for navigational aids such as VOR and DME) is recommended.",
    "## H.6 Interference-Prevention Criteria\n\nFrequency-distance separation rules must be established for each pair of CNPC radio types to establish limits on how closely neighboring CNPC links can be tuned to each other as a function of their physical separation.  Such criteria can be established on the basis of inherent radio parameters, including:",
    " \nTransmitter output powers, channel widths, and EIRPSD masks \n \nReceiver channel widths and adjacent-channel rejection parameters \n \nAntenna gains, horizontal and vertical beamwidths, polarizations, and orientations. \n\n## H.7 Terrestrial/Satcom Cnpc Coexistence In C Band",
    "The aeronautical-mobile satellite (route) service (AMS(R)S) has had a spectrum allocation in the 5030–5091 MHz band since 2007.  That allocation allows the creation of a SATCOM CNPC system in that band.  In 2008 a plan was unveiled for providing such a system for UAS in European airspace.  It was envisioned as using the 5030–5050 MHz part of the band for space-to-Earth links and 5071–5091 MHz for Earth-to-space links, leaving 5050–5071 MHz for the remnants of the Microwave Landing System (MLS),",

However, that SATCOM CNPC system has not yet been deployed or funded. The 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-12) granted an allocation to the AM(R)S throughout the same band.  The only prospective user for that AM(R)S allocation is terrestrial CNPC.  Since the SATCOM and terrestrial allocations exactly coincide in frequency, and the SATCOM",
    "CNPC.  Since the SATCOM and terrestrial allocations exactly coincide in frequency, and the SATCOM system may someday be built, it is important to consider procedures by which they could share the band. If the SATCOM system is built, there are two good reasons for allowing it to use band segments on each end (although not necessarily 20 MHz each as in the 2008 plan):",
    " \nIf the SATCOM system uses frequency-division duplexing, it will need to maximize the frequency separation between its Earth-to-space and space-to-Earth segments, because of filter-design constraints. \n \nInternational Radio Regulations footnote 5.443C limits AM(R)S EIRP density to –75 dBW/MHz in the adjacent 5010–5030 MHz band, so a significant separation between that band and terrestrial CNPC might be beneficial.",
    "It is possible, of course, that SATCOM CNPC will never exist in this band, or will exist only in regions outside the U.S.  Band segments should be allocated to SATCOM CNPC only in regions where that service is available.  Where it is not available, the entire band should remain available to terrestrial CNPC. Another band-sharing issue, if SATCOM CNPC becomes a reality, is whether the spectral boundaries between terrestrial and SATCOM CNPC should be static (fixed) or flexible (movable) in",
    "boundaries between terrestrial and SATCOM CNPC should be static (fixed) or flexible (movable) in frequency.  Static partitions would have two advantages:  first, they would facilitate global harmonization; second, they would enable the development of a common, worldwide filter design for each band segment (SATCOM or terrestrial). On the other hand, flexible partitions would eliminate the need to make a premature, binding decision on terrestrial and SATCOM allocations in the band.  They would",
    "make a premature, binding decision on terrestrial and SATCOM allocations in the band.  They would allow future adjustments based on observed demand patterns.  They would also allow for the possibility that some regions of the world would use only one of the two types of C Band CNPC link (terrestrial or SATCOM, but not both).  Finally, they would enable the use of a single wideband front-end filter (over the entire 5030–5091 MHz band) that could be used by hybrid terrestrial/SATCOM terminals",
    "(over the entire 5030–5091 MHz band) that could be used by hybrid terrestrial/SATCOM terminals aboard UA. Consequently, if the 5030–5091 MHz band is ever partitioned into terrestrial and SATCOM CNPC segments, the terrestrial segment should be placed in the middle of the band.  Its boundaries with the SATCOM segments should be flexible rather than static so that they can be shifted in accordance with operational experience, and/or eliminated on a region-by-region basis.",

    "a) The UAS has left the assigned airspace, is using a different assignment, and does \nnot plan to re-enter the airspace.   \n\n## I.3.2.5 Cost Function",
    "Mechanisms must be implemented in the scheme to encourage users who allow other users to share the spectrum and discourage those whose usage prevents other users from using the limited resource that they all must share. There is an implied cost function and an optional monetary one with this scheme. The implied cost function is that a PIC requesting a CNPC Link channel that is hard to fit in will have a high chance of it being rejected, hence delays before takeoff.

    "This appendix provides estimates for data rates for a single UA. This estimation analyzed the Control, Navigational Aids (Navaids), ATC Voice Relay, ATS Data Relay, Weather Radar, and Target Data components of the control and non-payload communications (CNPC) data link, as indicated in Section 1 and Appendix F.  The CNPC link considered in this appendix is between a single fully equipped generic unmanned aircraft (UA) operating in non-segregated airspace, and the pilot who will be remotely",
    "unmanned aircraft (UA) operating in non-segregated airspace, and the pilot who will be remotely operating the aircraft from a PS. The throughput calculations are determined by considering the data loading and overhead associated with the Terminal Departure, En Route and Terminal Arrival phases of flight. For each phase of flight, the throughput was calculated for both uplink and downlink communications with the pilot operating an unmanned aircraft (UA) in manual or automatic mode.  Manual mode",
    "with the pilot operating an unmanned aircraft (UA) in manual or automatic mode.  Manual mode means the pilot is directly controlling the UA's control surfaces and other operational functions. Automatic operation means the pilot is indirectly controlling the UA control surfaces and operational functions by commanding a processor onboard the UA.

    "and external non-payload information flows of a generic UAS.  The information in Section J.3 describes the sources of data loading during the three phases of flight for upload and download communications in both manual and automatic mode.

Section J.5 describes notional service classes based on",
    "throughput in Bytes per second (B/sec). Section J.5 describes notional service classes based on estimated UA equipage. Section J.6 depicts the results from a series of simulations, which were used to size the data rates based on operations of a realistic link.  Section J.7 uses the data rates from the previous section and builds example data classes, based on a prototype data link implementation.",

    "ATC Voice Relay discussed in assumed ATC communications in 2030 would be in a digital format similar to the design of VDL Mode 3. The VDL Mode 3 produces 4133 bps message appended with 667 bps of overhead to yield a 4800 bps message throughput. The vocoder frames would be packed for transmission over the CNPC link.  Each vocoder frame is 96 bits in length, and represent 20ms of voice.  Five (5) vocoder frames would be packed into single transmissions unit, 5 x 96 = 480 bit (60 byte) frame,",

    "A nationwide system providing ATS data services of various kinds is expected to be in place by the 2020s. It seems likely that the messages associated with those services will need to be relayed to and from the pilot via the UA.

    "by Leidos. NIST SP800-38D specifies that a minimum 64-bit short tag is sufficient to protect 4+ billion packets of up to 32K bytes of data before a new key must be generated.  This length is presumed to be sufficient to protect a communication session at the CNPC link's low data rates for days. Should data rates significantly increase in the future, a longer tag should be used for the authentication data, for example 96-bits or 128-bits. In addition to the ICV, the ESP trailer also contains 2",
    "data, for example 96-bits or 128-bits. In addition to the ICV, the ESP trailer also contains 2 bytes of bookkeeping and an additional 0-3 bytes of padding in order to align the ICV on a 4-byte boundary. This brings the total size of the trailer to 10-13 bytes.

    "Many of the Control and Navaids STANAG messages being sent are small and must be sent at fixed intervals. Thus, even with header compression in use it is important to combine messages in order to reduce network overhead. The STANAG standard allows for combining messages up to 576 bytes (including packet headers). This guideline is derived from the minimum Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) an IP network must be able to handle. While this guideline is valid for IPv4, IPv6 has a minimum link MTU of",
    "must be able to handle. While this guideline is valid for IPv4, IPv6 has a minimum link MTU of 1280 octets. Figure J-4 shows how several message types being sent at different rates could be combined with the goal of producing the largest possible messages while still preserving the timeliness of each message type. In this example, by shifting the two and five hertz messages, an alternative arrangement could have been made where no more than two messages were combined. However, the end result",
    "could have been made where no more than two messages were combined. However, the end result would be less efficient in terms of network overhead. Also, no matter the combination of rates, all message types can be combined for one occurrence and results in the largest message.",
    "Thus, in the example provided in figure J-4, the 20 Hz message type must be sent 14 times without any other message attached. This reduced value becomes the compressed message group rate, and will be used to calculate the combined total rate of message data. The STANAG message, as defined in NATO STANAG (Edition 3) December 15, 2008, contains a 16 byte header, a 5 byte time stamp, a 1 to 5 byte presence vector, and the aggregate data of the message fields sent.  The 16 byte header can be",
    "byte presence vector, and the aggregate data of the message fields sent.  The 16 byte header can be compressed to 2 bytes, containing only a message type field, reducing each STANAG message by 14 bytes. The frequency of each message type depends on the phase of flight and the mode of operation, either manual or automatic.  Table A-1, located in Addendum A shows STANAG message types and sizes. Tables A-2 thru A-7, shows the recommended downlink message types and fields by phase of flight.",

Since Target Data and ATC Voice are sent individually their message group rate is equal to the actual rates that were specified in Sections J.3.3 and J.3.5 respectfully. But due to the message-packing scheme, the rates for the STANAG message groups reflects the true number of occurrences of that combination of messages sent every second. For example, the type 4000 message is sent 20 times",
    "that combination of messages sent every second. For example, the type 4000 message is sent 20 times a second, but can be combined with at least one of the other messages at six different occasions, hence the type 4000 message is only sent independently 14 times a second.

The lower plots in each table, labeled \"Recovery Time\" on the vertical axis depicts the case of a burst of traffic",
    "in each table, labeled \"Recovery Time\" on the vertical axis depicts the case of a burst of traffic in a high priority message queue being filled to capacity and overflowing.  The recovery time in these plots is defined as the amount of time required once the burst stops until the average delay returns to the value measured before the burst occurred.  The burst results are based on a queue size of five (5) messages. The dotted \"black\" vertical line is a recommended Message Data Payload size,",

    "Since the Required Link Performance is dependent on levels of automatic operation as well as the architecture of the UAS and its operating environment no specific RLP can be provided however the examples in this appendix should help guide UAS designers and regulators in the assessment of specific systems. Section K.9 identifies design and operational mitigations to help minimize the impact of CNPC Link System impairments and Section K.10 provides conclusions and recommendations based on the",

    "## Definition",
    "Required Link Performance (RLP).  RLP is a specification of the CNPC Link System, availability, continuity, transaction expiration time, transaction time, and integrity performance necessary for operation within in a defined airspace. RLP Availability (A).  The probability that an operational transaction supported by the CNPC Link System can be initiated when needed.",
    "RLP Continuity (C).  The probability that an operational transaction supported by the CNPC Link System can be completed within the transaction expiration time given that the CNPC Link System was available at the start of the transaction RLP Transaction Expiration Time.  The safety related maximum time for the completion of the operational transaction supported by the CNPC Link System after which the initiator is required to revert to an alternative procedure.",
    "RLP Transaction Time.  The nominal time for the completion of the operational transaction supported by the CNPC Link System. \n\nRLP Integrity (I).  The probability that an operational transaction supported by the CNPC \nLink System is completed with no undetected errors",
    "Note: While RLP integrity is defined in terms of the \"goodness\" of the CNPC Link \nSystem capability, it is specified in terms of the likelihood of occurrence of \nmalfunction on a per flight hour basis. \nNote: From a safety perspective the undetected errors associated with integrity are \nmuch more important than detected errors. \n\n## Approach",
    "## Approach\n\nThe analyses performed in Sections K.5, K.6 and K.7 uses a four-step approach: \n1)  Timelines are developed to determine how long the CNPC Link System can be interrupted before the UAS safety becomes degraded.  The timelines effectively derive the RLP Transaction Expiration Time.",
    "2)  Safety analyses are developed to determine how often messages can be missed (availability and continuity) or erroneous (integrity) before the UAS safety becomes degraded.  The safety analysis also provides guidance on how frequently a loss of function, i.e. Lost CNPC Link, can occur. 3)  The link analysis (from Section K.4) determines the frequency and length of the CNPC \nLink System interruptions.",
    "4)  Using the information obtained from the above three steps the frequency of interruptions (from step 3 above) of a length longer than the Transaction Expiration Time (from step 1 above) can be compared to the safety target determined from step 2 above) to assess if the safety target in the example analysis has been met.  Additionally, a similar analysis can be used to determine if the frequency of Lost CNPC Links is also acceptable based on the Lost CNPC Link Decision Time (see Appendix F,",
    "of Lost CNPC Links is also acceptable based on the Lost CNPC Link Decision Time (see Appendix F, Section F.5) developed from step 1). Modeling, simulation, and safety analysis activities were conducted to assess the CNPC Link System RLP to safely support command and control, DAA, as well as air traffic control data relay, weather radar, and video services, and evaluate the relationships between RLP and the levels of automation of the UAS operations. The RLP parameters of availability,",

The RLP parameters of availability, continuity, transaction expiration time, transaction time, and integrity of function capabilities need to be sufficient to perform link services for the command and control function(s), and additional services for one or more of the following functions: detect and avoid, air traffic service data relay, weather radar, and video.",
    "## Modeling And Simulation Approach",
    "Several propagation modeling and simulation approaches can be used to estimate CNPC link performance.  Possibly the most accurate approach is actual flight testing in a variety of scenarios that vary aircraft altitude, slant range, maneuvering, terrain type, among others.  Use of propagation modeling tools are ways to check the validity of flight testing and provide advanced design inputs while still in the engineering tradeoff phase.

    "## K.3.1.1 Overview Of Propagation Modeling Approaches",
    "Air-Ground channel modeling and simulation using Spherical-Earth-Model (SEM) and Terrain Integrated Rough Earth Model (TIREM) [6] as well as airframe shadow modeling and simulation were conducted to determine the CNPC Link System RF propagation loss.",
    "TIREM was used to predict RF propagation loss over variable terrain and sea water for ground-based and airborne transmitters and receivers using digital terrain elevation data (DTED).  In SEM, the terrain profile is represented as the arc of a circle, valid for propagation over a smooth sea or fresh water.  TIREM takes into account the effects of irregular terrain along the propagation path, requiring information regarding terrain elevations of the region of interest.  TIREM and SEM can be used",
    "information regarding terrain elevations of the region of interest.  TIREM and SEM can be used as independent propagation models for rough-earth or smooth applications, respectively.  If a clear lineof-sight exists between two antennas, both models consider the effects of surface-wave propagation (refraction), diffraction, tropospheric-scatter propagation (not useful for CNPC), and atmospheric absorption, as appropriate.  TIREM evaluates the effects of irregular terrain along the great circle",

For a particular CNPC Link System, DAA and command and control functions, an increase or decrease in the CNPC Link System RLP, levels of automation for DAA and command and control functions may allow a trade-off in design complexity provided that the target level of safety is achieved. Figure K-51 depicts the relationship",

    "On the vertical axis, we see a series of possible increasing levels of RLP, from single link architectures through multiple command link/control link architectures to full L Band and C Band diversity.  In developing the CNPC Link System MOPS, we will define a level of link performance (or a series of levels) for the CNPC radio.  Designers can then use these data to determine the RLP of their particular system, which will depend on the characteristics of the message transactions of their system",

On the horizontal axis we see a series of possible increasing levels of automation, in three forms: (1) DAA or command and control function automation, (2) Lost CNPC Link automation and (3) ground and air distribution of automation.

    " \nThe discussion of the hazard level and development assurance level hinges on several things, to include: (1) the investigation of requirements on loss of the CNPC Link System, (2) traditional mitigations including ATC actions on flight plan, and (3) the traditional navigation backups for the proposed flight which are \nstill required.  The entire DAA and command and control architecture may then serve as mitigation of loss of CNPC Link System.",

Where is the master flight plan? \n \nConsideration must be given to requirements for availability and continuity of function.  The integration of exposure time in the discussion is likely to be controversial in terms of lowering certification levels.   \n",
    " \nFrom an aircraft certification perspective, the difference between manned and unmanned aviation is the replacement of a physical avionics link (connecting pilot with control surface) with a wireless signal in space that provides that connectivity.  What effect does this have on the traditional hazard class determination?  Should we construct separate arguments for loss of UAS telecommand and telemetry control (command and control) link and loss of pilot/ATC communications link? \n",
    " \nFrom a CNPC Link System perspective, an implication of automation is its relationship with transmission bandwidth and resulting communications rate.  In general terms, the more automated a UAS becomes the lower the transmission bandwidth requirements become while still supporting the required CNPC Link System RLP. \n",
    " \nThe control link thread transmits and receives control instructions to the aircraft for DAA and command and control.  A lost CNPC Link System condition should not cause an immediate unstable flight situation or any undue work load for ATC.

    "1. UAS radio systems should provide CNPC Link System services to a level of RLP \nadequate to support the safety requirements of the class of UAS in which it is installed or connected and in the environment in which the UAS operates. \nNote 1: Compliance with this requirement will be demonstrated by the use of the data \ncaptured during the flight tests described in this MOPS document, section 3.3, Test Procedures for Installed Equipment Performance, and the UAS design applicant's safety case.",
    "Note 2: The effects of CNPC Link System availability, continuity, transaction expiration \ntime, and integrity on the CNPC Link System service function performance must be taken into account during normal, abnormal and emergency conditions.  \nNote 3: While the CNPC Link System is in an interrupted condition but prior to the UAS",
    "declaring a Lost CNPC Link the UA is in its most safety degraded condition because neither is the pilot able to actively manage the flight nor is the UA following preprogramed, predictable maneuvers pre-coordinated with ATC. Determine unacceptable link interruptions duration for the CNPC Link System design and operating environment similar to the assessment described in this appendix and provide appropriate mitigations.",
    "2. In the event of loss of all links with the GRS the UA will automatically squawk a \npre-determined transponder code and execute the pre-programmed lost link \nfunction; and the pilot/operator will contact ATC and state the contingency trajectory.   \n3. There are various ways to improve CNPC Link performance.  Some of them are \nlisted below.   \n",
    "listed below.   \n \nExcess Link Margin:  Degradations in availability and continuity can be caused by undesirable propagation effects such as, multipath cancellation. Such effects can cause the received power to be significantly less than the power expected in free space (with omnidirectional antennas).  If the probability of these excess losses versus their magnitude were known, then enough extra power could be transmitted to lower the unavailability to an acceptable value. \n",
    " \nTime Diversity:  Transmitting extra power may not always be a practical solution.  If the separate transmissions are degraded by statistically independent processes, sending messages multiple times (or repeating messages if no acknowledgement is received) can be a way to improve performance.  Because such methods will require extra bandwidth and \n \nmore time, the benefits of these techniques need to be weighed against their disadvantages.",
    " \nSpatial Diversity:  To overcome blockage and multipath effects, spatial diversity in the form of multiple antennas can be used.  For example, \nairframe blockage can be mitigated by placing antennas on the fuselage top and bottom or forward and aft (or on the wingtips of fixed-wing aircraft).  In such cases it seems unlikely that both antennas would be blocked simultaneously.  To address ground multipath issues, multiple well-separated ground antennas can be useful.   \n",
    " \nThere is a downside to such methods in terms of cost (beyond just the cost of the antennas themselves).  Typically, each antenna will have its own radio attached.  Also, the receivers could be linked together and different receptions will have to be sorted out via some type of voting algorithm.   \n",
    "Frequency Diversity:  Sending messages simultaneously in both L- and C Band can be a way to ensure that there are two paths with statistically independent fading mechanisms.  This is similar to time diversity techniques, but it would not involve an increase in transaction time.  On the other hand, two types of radios would be needed on the ground and in the air.  This could be a problem for small UA with size, weight and power constraints, especially because C Band communications can have",
    "small UA with size, weight and power constraints, especially because C Band communications can have path-loss issues - requiring more power and/or directional antennas.  Such small UA could be included in a category requiring less stringent RLP parameters.",
    " \nImproving link availability and continuity performance with the UA being able to hand-off its link connection to another GRS, using higher link layer work-arounds, or using variable data rate control, etc. \n \nThe use of circular polarization antenna(s) or other configurations, for example, dual linear polarization should be considered to mitigate fading. \n",
    "Integrity:  Techniques to ensure a specified integrity level include forward error correction codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon, Turbo Code), simple checksums, Fletcher checksums, cyclic redundancy codes (CRCs), context matching and possibly others.  These methods involve adding extra bits to each message.  The integrity level can be improved by increasing the number of extra bits.  The numbers of extra bits required is generally not a significant driver of required throughput.  Link redundancy (active",

    "1) **UA Operating Range.**  To support the anticipated desired operations a nominal range \nof 35NM was considered appropriate for both L and C frequency band equipped UAS using omnidirectional antennas on the UA and Directional (higher gain) antennas on the ground.  Operation at longer ranges (up to approximately 100NM) with directional (higher gain) antennas on the UA will be possible while still complying with the EIRPSDs (see Antenna Gain assumption 3) for further discussion).",
    "2) **CNPC Link Symbol Rates.**  The analysis in Appendix J was used to set a nominal",
    "upper limit on Symbol Rate of 138ks/s (lower symbol rates are also allowed but will not present the stressing case on the example link budgets or the U/Ds).  Section 2.2.1.5.5 limits the maximum -40dBc channel bandwidth to 250kHz, which allows for Doppler and Frequency Accuracy additions to the basic modulated envelope spectral width while leaving the designer open to choose an alternate to the Baseline GMSK modulation (used in the example link budgets in this Appendix) if higher bit rates are",
    "desired. \n3) **Antenna Gains.**  Significant consideration was given to a number of aspects",
    "associated with antenna gains.  From a UA perspective, size and weight drove the focus on simple omnidirectional antennas; however, airframe shadowing and multipath effects, discussed in more detail in Appendix K led to the need to consider the effects of the installed omni antenna gain variations ranging from a minimum gain of -10dBi to +5 dBi in the example link budgets.

    "can carry directional antennas there is no significant reduction in the apparent gain due to the airframe (assuming the antenna is not pointed through the airframe); again Appendix K provides more detail on this topic.

    "4) **Path Losses in Excess of Free Space Loss.**  Appendix K provides significant detail \non this topic.  The path loss between the two CNPC Link System antennas consists not \nonly of the \"range squared\" Free Space Loss (FSL) but also on the loss due to \nmultipath and diffraction caused by the terrain below and near to the RLOS path",
    "between the two CNPC Link System antennas.  This Excess Path Loss (EPL) was quantified through both simulation and flight test and a 20dB EPL is included in all example link budgets.

    "analysis and possibly flight test data to substantiate them.",
    "In addition to the above four fundamental assumptions other considerations were also included in the example link budgets and example U/D link budgets. Transmitter powers of 10W at C Band and 32mW at L Band were used, not only to reflect the lower carrying capacity of the UA anticipated to use L Band but also in consideration of the L Band interference environment cited in Section 2 and described in more detail in Appendix G. Airframe related apparent antenna gain reduction, EPL and multipath",
    "in more detail in Appendix G. Airframe related apparent antenna gain reduction, EPL and multipath enhancement of the Undesired signal level at the victim receiver were combined statistically in the example link budgets since it is very unlikely that worst case values for each will occur simultaneously.",
    "A 6dB \"ICAO aeronautical safety margin\" was included in the Desired path to ensure that the victim had additional protection even after all of the considerations described in this Appendix are included. Receiver noise figures of 4dB and 6dB were assumed for the L Band and C Band receivers, respectively.  In addition, the link budgets include consideration of antenna cable losses for the aircraft and ground installations.  Modem required Signal-to-Noise ratio in a bandwidth equal to the",
    "and ground installations.  Modem required Signal-to-Noise ratio in a bandwidth equal to the modulation symbol rate, Es/N0, for the Baseline modem waveform described in Section 2.2.2, which consists of GMSK modulation with a Recursive Turbo Convolutional Code with rate 5/8, was assumed including a 1 dB implementation loss; other designs that employ different modulation and error correction may be better or worse. For the U/D analysis, limitations on how close the Undesired transmitter could",
    "be better or worse. For the U/D analysis, limitations on how close the Undesired transmitter could approach the Desired CNPC Link System's receiver were also included as a combination of altitude and range limit examples, when the Desired path is 35NM.  Limits on off-axis emissions from directional antennas are included in Section 2 .2.1 of this MOPS to provide protection under the majority of orientation configurations of transmitters and receivers.  It is possible for the interference levels",
    "configurations of transmitters and receivers.  It is possible for the interference levels in the example U/D link budgets to be exceeded, which may cause the Lost CNPC Link algorithm of the victim receiver to be initiated, but it is expected that this will be infrequent given the considerations in this Appendix and the validated requirements in the MOPS.",

    "## Baseline Cnpc Link System Overview",
    "The baseline CNPC Link System uplink and downlink link transmission schemes are not the same. The uplink transmission, from the GRS to the aircraft, uses a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) approach. Information is sent from the GRS to one or multiple aircraft using time slots. The downlink transmission, from the aircraft to the GRS, uses a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) approach. Information is sent from the aircraft to the GRS over a specified frequency. Information transmitted",
    "is sent from the aircraft to the GRS over a specified frequency. Information transmitted over the uplink and downlink is categorized into Data Classes. A Data Class is an elemental structure carrying Message Data Payload and overhead information. Four data classes exist, each having a different size fixed Message Data Payload and overhead. Downlink transmission - UA to GRS - uses an FDMA scheme that assigns a single frequency to each aircraft. In a Single Aircraft mode, the UA transmits one of",
    "assigns a single frequency to each aircraft. In a Single Aircraft mode, the UA transmits one of the four data classes on its assigned frequency to the GRS.  In the Multi-aircraft mode, multiple UA's transmit one of the four data classes on their individually assigned frequency to the GRS. Unlike the uplink transmission, a downlink transmission can only support one UA even in multimode. This means that even though multiple UAs are supported with one uplink, there always has to be an independent",
    "that even though multiple UAs are supported with one uplink, there always has to be an independent downlink for each UA. Uplink transmission - GRS to UA - uses a TDMA scheme that allows the GRS to transmit to one or multiple UA's.  In the Single-Aircraft mode one time slot is used to transmit one of the four data classes to the UA.  In the multi-aircraft mode the GRS transmits a combination of data classes over multiple time slots to multiple UA's. Multi-aircraft mode packs more information",
    "data classes over multiple time slots to multiple UA's. Multi-aircraft mode packs more information into a transmission frame. When using multi-slot mode, the amount of information that can be transmitted uplink depends on the number of slots that are used and the data class type used.",

    "To increase the effective data rate, data puncturing (the selective omission of bits) is performed on the output of the Turbo encoder to increase the effective code rate with framing bits to approximately R=0.62 with minimal loss of code performance. All four Data Classes use the same 30-bit puncture pattern defined below. This puncture pattern is repeated until the last Turbo encoded output bit has been processed. The puncture pattern is continued (applied) over the twelve trellis termination",

    "Note: Only the parity bits (Z and Z') and Tail bits may be punctured (deleted). The message bits (M) are never punctured (a systematic code). (Termination bits do not contain Message Bits. Termination bits contain Tail Bits and parity bits. All termination bits may be punctured.)",

Test procedures were created in Section 2.4.3 for the radios and most of the test equipment required to verify the procedures was",
    "Section 2.4.3 for the radios and most of the test equipment required to verify the procedures was available. But since the radios were a prototype no test set was available to measure the internal test points. Thus the measurements in Table N-1 were chosen based on the availability of test equipment and the radio's data and RF inputs and outputs.",

    "This test procedure verifies the transmit output power measured at the MOPS Baseline CNPC Link System antenna interface port. This test procedure is valid for both L Band and C Band, airborne and ground radios. The test procedure configures the radio to transmit messages for a minimum duration of 10 seconds. Measurement of the transmit output power is achieved using a power meter that will measure the average power over the full transmit cycle. Additionally, the radio's transmit duty cycle must",

    "## N.2.1 Procedure/Setup\n\nThe test procedure and equipment configuration for the RF Output Power can be found in Section 2.4.3.2.1.1.1. This test used a 50 Watt, 40 dB attenuator to reduce the power input to the Rohde & Schwarz power sensor. Power measurement calculations included total path loss from the RF antenna output connector on the transmitter to the power meter. Data Class 4 was used for all testing. \n\n## Results And Comments",
    "## Results And Comments\n\nBoth high and low power setting results for each band were captured as shown in Figures N-1 through N-4 below. The Level Offsets used account for the cable and attenuator losses at the frequencies tested. Additionally, the Level Offsets were verified using a ZN- Z151 Rohde & Schwarz network analyzer. \n\n## L Band Comments",
    "## L Band Comments\n\nA 32 mW transmitter output in L Band was not obtainable using the controls available on the CNPC radio. Since the 32 mW requisite is a recent requirement a modification to the radios transmit power output could be made to achieve the required power output. A measurement of the transmitter's high power capability was also measured and shown in Figure N-2. \n\n## C Band Comments",

Classical rough terrain propagation models such as the Longley-",

The model contained within the ITU Recommendation P.528 [21]",
    "represents a compromise between the simplicity of the two-ray models and the detailed computations of TIREM. The path loss results obtained from the measurements generally agree with those computed via the methods in [21].",
    "## Q.2.2 Small-Scale Fading",
    "In addition to the LOS and surface reflection, the AG channel also often contains multipath components (MPCs). These MPCs arrive at the receiver with various amplitudes and phases, due to different path lengths (and reflection coefficients), and cause variation of the received power on spatial scales of the order of /2, and are hence termed smallscale fading. This fading is almost always modeled stochastically—in direct contrast to the essentially deterministic two-ray components. With a",

With a dominant LOS component, the small-scale fading is most commonly modeled as having Ricean statistics (other common distributions include the Nakagami and Weibull). The Ricean distribution is characterized by the \"Rice factor\" or K-factor, where k represents the ratio of the power in the LOS (or, dominant) component to the power in all other components. This is usually specified in dB: *K=10log(k)*. See",
    "component to the power in all other components. This is usually specified in dB: *K=10log(k)*. See [22] for a thorough discussion of this well-known distribution. The Ricean K-factor was estimated for all the GS environments. In order to do this, a socalled *stationarity distance* had to be first established. To estimate any statistical channel parameters, it is necessary to determine the region of space over which the channel's statistics can be assumed constant1. This spatial region is",
    "of space over which the channel's statistics can be assumed constant1. This spatial region is quantified by the stationarity distance (SD)2. Estimation of SD is a topic of current research, and this is not discussed extensively here—see [17] and [23]. The SD can be computed via multiple methods. For the wideband (50 MHz C Band) measurements, two methods were selected. The first method [24] can be viewed as a wideband method, in which a temporal correlation coefficient (TPCC) for the",
    "[24] can be viewed as a wideband method, in which a temporal correlation coefficient (TPCC) for the time-varying PDP is computed. The second method [25] requires multiple receiving or transmitting antennas, but is a narrowband metric, termed collinearity, which estimates correlation among channel gains. Details are described in [17] and [23]; applying these measures yielded the result that for essentially all of the AG measurements, a median SD of 15 m (~250 at C Band) was obtained. Example",
    "essentially all of the AG measurements, a median SD of 15 m (~250 at C Band) was obtained. Example contour plots of the TPCC and collinearity for a segment of over-sea data are shown in Figure Q-5 [17]. The channel was declared stationary when the SD metric value was 0.9 or larger (hence this is a conservative estimate, i.e., the channel is very likely stationary for even larger travel distances, corresponding to smaller SD metric values). The quasi-periodicity one can observe in Figure Q-5 is",
    "corresponding to smaller SD metric values). The quasi-periodicity one can observe in Figure Q-5 is attributable to two-ray \"oscillations.\"3 The value of travel distance x in the example data of Figure Q-5 for which the TPCC>0.9 is approximately 5 m. To determine an SD applicable to all data in all environments, TPCC and collinearity statistics were collected in all settings, and from these statistics the 15 m SD value was obtained. The statistical channel parameters were",
    "computed over this value of SD for all FTs; worth noting is that K-factors do not appreciably change if the assumed SD value ranges from ~5-30 m.  \n\n## Q.2.3 Correlations",
    "Another channel parameter of interest for communications applications is the correlation of channel effects on different antennas. Uncorrelated channel effects enable spatial diversity gains and can also enable use of advanced multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) techniques for improved performance (via diversity) or increased data rates. The correlations of the channel effects across the four Rx antennas were thus quantified. This comprises the spatial correlation between antennas operating",
    "Rx antennas were thus quantified. This comprises the spatial correlation between antennas operating in the same band, and the frequency-domain correlation between antennas operating in different frequency bands. The correlation between signal components on the two different antennas in each band, and between components on antennas employing different bands, over the SD, was computed from the measured data. In general, the correlations of interest are those among all received signal components",
    "data. In general, the correlations of interest are those among all received signal components (including MPCs), but in the AG channels, one is primarily interested in the correlations of the LOS components, which contain the vast majority of received power. For the two C Band antennas for example, the amplitude correlation coefficient is computed by",
    "$$\\rho_{\\rm A_{C1},A_{C2}}=\\frac{\\rm E[(A_{C1}-\\mu_{\\rm A_{C1}})(A_{C2}-\\mu_{\\rm A_{C2}})]}{\\sigma_{\\rm A_{C1}}\\sigma_{\\rm A_{C2}}}$$ ( $$Q.2$$ )",
    "where E denotes expectation, the A's in the numerator are sample amplitude vectors, and the 's are the means of the A vectors. Specifically, AC1=(AC1,1, AC1,2, …A*C1,n*) is the vector of LOS amplitude samples for C Band Rx1, with A*C1,i* the ith amplitude sample, and analogously for C Band Rx2. Both vectors are of lengths that span only the SD, and the \n's are the standard deviations of the respective sample vectors.",
    "## Q.2.4 Airframe Shadowing",
    "Airframe shadowing occurred during many of the banking turns in the oval-shaped FTs. This large scale channel effect is essentially independent of the small-scale fading, but does of course depend upon the specific aircraft heading and attitude. The shadowing effects also depend upon the aircraft size, so the results obtained pertain to medium-sized aircraft similar in size to the S-3B. The airframe shadowing observed was caused largely by the aircraft wings. This effect can be effectively",
    "shadowing observed was caused largely by the aircraft wings. This effect can be effectively mitigated with appropriate placement of multiple antennas, e.g., with one antenna on top of the aircraft and one on the bottom. Nonetheless, models for airframe shadowing do not exist in the literature, and the new results enabled creation of such models, which can be useful for link designers.",
    "## Q.2.5 Wideband Models",
    "All the prior channel characteristics provide a partial description of the AG channel. The time-varying (spatially-varying) CIR is a wideband model that can provide a complete description of the channel. Most often the CIR is separated from large scale path loss and shadowing, and this approach has been used here. The wideband models consist of the deterministic LOS and surface reflection, plus the intermittent MPCs measured throughout the various environments; these MPCs are quantified",
    "plus the intermittent MPCs measured throughout the various environments; these MPCs are quantified statistically. For these intermittent MPCs, for each GS environment, the following characteristics were quantified: their probability of occurrence (often as a function of link distance); their durations (spatial or temporal extents); their delays relative to that of the LOS component; and their amplitudes relative to that of the LOS component (intermittent MPC phases were found to be fairly well",
    "relative to that of the LOS component (intermittent MPC phases were found to be fairly well modeled as uniformly distributed on [0,2)). With the LOS and surface reflection characteristics (amplitude, phase, and delay), plus the intermittent MPC characteristics, tapped-delay line wideband AG channel models were developed.",
    "## Q.3 Example Results Q.3.1 Path Loss And Excess Path Loss",
    "Path loss was quantified as described in the prior section for all FTs in all environments. Although results were gathered for both straight and oval-shaped FTs, since path loss is usually expressed as a function of link distance, the focus is on straight FT results here (see [6]-[8]).

Plotted results include measured path loss, a linear fit to the logarithm of distance for these measured results (i.e., one of the path loss models), free-space path loss, and the CE2R model path loss. As noted in [6]-[8], path loss is larger than that of free space at shorter link distances due to aircraft antenna effects. In general, the measured path loss follows the free-space loss fairly well, as expected. Significant variations",
    "the measured path loss follows the free-space loss fairly well, as expected. Significant variations about the free-space lines result from the surface reflection, and from MPCs. The rapid variations, quantified by the Ricean K-factor, are attributable to multiple relatively weak MPCs. For the plots in Figure Q-6, the CE2R model fits the measurements only for a limited range of distances where the geometry is such that a large surface area is exposed to allow a strong surface reflection (see",
    "the geometry is such that a large surface area is exposed to allow a strong surface reflection (see [34]). For the desert terrain of Figure Q-6(a), two-ray effects (path loss peaks) can be observed at distances larger than approximately 20 km; for the mountainous terrain of Figure Q-6(b), the two-ray effects appear only for link distances from approximately 10-20 km. Since the earth's surface in these environments is not perfectly smooth, and since the CE2R model is very sensitive to changes in",
    "environments is not perfectly smooth, and since the CE2R model is very sensitive to changes in terminal heights, the CE2R fit is not expected to be perfect (see Figure Q-4(c) for an example of aircraft altitude variation during a typical FT).

In general, the CE2R model fits better at L Band than at C Band, since the longer L Band wavelength means that a given surface is",
    "\"electrically smoother\" at the lower frequency. Note also that the CE2R plots here assume a constant FT altitude; adjusting the aircraft altitude vs. link distance in the CE2R does improve its agreement with measurements. Our CE2R models also incorporate surface roughness effects. Example results for C Band appear in Figure Q-7, for over sea in Figure Q-7(a) [6], and for mountainous terrain in Figure Q-7(b) [26].

For the mountainous terrain, the C Band results in Figure Q-7(b) show path loss slightly less than that for free space for nearly the entire FT; this is likely attributable to a waveguiding effect of the canyon below the FT.

For link budget and availability analyses, not only path loss, but *excess* path loss is also of interest. Excess path loss is defined as the channel attenuation in excess of that of some",
    "also of interest. Excess path loss is defined as the channel attenuation in excess of that of some reference attenuation [8].

    "Figure Q-13 shows a sequence of PDPs from C Band over-sea measurements [6]. The strong LOS component is nearly of constant power over this short segment of an FT, and the sea surface reflection is also easily identified. An intermittent (\"3rd ray\") MPC is also visible for a spatial extent of approximately 10-15 m. The chip index axis in Figure Q-13 \ncorresponds to delay (one C Band chip is of duration 20 ns).",

The RMS-DS is the most common measure of the channel's temporal dispersion [27].

    "The Ricean K-factor models were described in a previous section. Specifically, equation (Q.5) describes the linear fit of K-factor in dB to distance in km. This linear equation also has a zero-mean Gaussian error term (Y) that describes the variation about this linear fit; values for Y are usually less than 3 dB. As previously noted, depending upon the model user's preference, simplifications to the linear fit with distance can be employed, such as a constant plus the Gaussian variation (K0",
    "to the linear fit with distance can be employed, such as a constant plus the Gaussian variation (K0 *+ Y)*, or even just a constant value, i.e., either K0 or one of the statistics computed for the K-factor. The median K-factors are approximately 28.7 dB in C Band and 13.1 dB in L Band, which pertain to the aggregate data for all straight FTs for all measured GS environments.

The K-factor was estimated using multiple methods [34], the most accurate of which is the maximum-likelihood (ML) method.

    "## Appendix R Undesired-To-Desired Signal Ratios Introduction",
    "The purpose of this appendix is to develop the rationale for the specification of the RF Emissions Mask and the specifications of Adjacent Channel and Non-Adjacent Channel Interference Rejection.  Both of these depend on how much noise is emitted by a CNPC Link System radio transmitter into adjacent channels within the allocated frequency band(s) and on the maximum expected ratio of the received interference signal level from an Undesired CNPC Link System transmitter to the level of the signal",
    "interference signal level from an Undesired CNPC Link System transmitter to the level of the signal received from the Desired CNPC Link System transmitter, or U/D ratio.  These relationships are established later on in this appendix.",
    "## Calculation Of Undesired-To-Desired (U/D) Signal Ratios Assumptions\n\nAppendix L provides detailed link budgets illustrating the calculation of the maximum tolerable Undesired (U)-to-Desired (D) signal ratios, or U/D for short. The assumptions made in the calculation of the maximum tolerable U/D ratio are as follows",
    "1. The worst case/maximum tolerable downlink (Air-to-Ground) U/D ratio occurs \nwhen the \"Desired UA\" is at its maximum operational range from its GRS, while the \"Undesired UA\" that is the source of the interference is as close to the GRS \nthat is controlling the \"Desired UA\" as allowed or possible while remaining \nwithin RLOS of its own GRS. \n2. Similarly, the worst case/maximum tolerable uplink (Ground-to-Air) U/D ratio",
    "2. Similarly, the worst case/maximum tolerable uplink (Ground-to-Air) U/D ratio \noccurs when the UAS that is experiencing interference is operating as close to an \ninterfering \"Undesired GRS\" as allowed or possible while remaining within \nRLOS of its \"Desired GRS\" at its maximum operational range. \n3. Maximum tolerable U/D calculations are presented in appendix L for two cases.  \nOne case assumes the GRSs that control the 'Desired UA\" and \"Undesired UA\"",
    "One case assumes the GRSs that control the 'Desired UA\" and \"Undesired UA\" \nare not co-located and the UA ARS are sufficiently far apart so their GRS directional antenna beams are pointed in different directions. In this case the \n\"Undesired downlink\" signal is assumed to arrive on a sidelobe the victim GRS",
    "\"Undesired downlink\" signal is assumed to arrive on a sidelobe the victim GRS \ndirectional antenna and the \"Undesired uplink\" is assumed to be emitted by a sidelobe of the interfering GRS directional antenna.  The U/D calculations for this first case assume a \"Desired link\" with maximum operational range of 35 NM.",
    "The second case assumes the GRSs are co-located or closely located as they might in an airport terminal area, and that the GRS directional antenna beams are pointed in the same direction when the UA under their control are landing or taking-off one behind the other.  In this case the \"Undesired downlink\" and",
    "'desired downlink\" signals are assumed to arrive on the main beam of the victim GRS directional antenna and the \"Undesired uplink\" and \"Desired uplink\" signals are assumed to be emitted by the main beams of 'Undesired GRS\" and 'Desired GRS\", respectively.  The U/D calculations for this second case assume the \"Desired link\" maximum operational range is sufficient to support landing operations from an altitude above ground of up to 3000 feet following a glide path of 3º, i.e. a 10 NM operational",
    "an altitude above ground of up to 3000 feet following a glide path of 3º, i.e. a 10 NM operational range\".",
    "4. The maximum tolerable U/D calculations presented in Appendix L also assume \nthat operational restrictions (exclusion zones) need to be imposed on the UA to \n \nprevent them from getting too close to \"Undesired GRSs\" in order to keep the resulting U/D ratio within tolerable levels.",
    "5. The U/D link budgets in Appendix L show that the minimum distance between a \nUA and an \"Undesired GRS\" must be greater than 200 feet for UA equipped with \nL Band CNPC systems and greater than 500 feet for UA equipped with C Band CNPC Link systems. The C Band U/D link budgets show that in order to allow \noperation with 500 feet separation between UA and \"Undesired GRS\", the ARS",
    "operation with 500 feet separation between UA and \"Undesired GRS\", the ARS \nmust have a high output power and low output power mode of operation where the low output power setting is 20 dB lower than the high output power setting and that certain restrictions be applied to the deployment of C Band GRS on or near airports.  The implications of these operational restrictions are discussed in Section R.2.2. \n6. The UAS air-to-ground (downlink) and ground-to-air (uplink) links are assumed",
    "6. The UAS air-to-ground (downlink) and ground-to-air (uplink) links are assumed \nto operate with the maximum transmitter output power required to operate the link reliably at the maximum operating range, so the link margin1 available is a function of the distance between the GRS and its associated UA. \n7. The required link margin is assumed to be that needed to keep outages of 2 \nseconds or more down to less than 1 per hour.",
    "seconds or more down to less than 1 per hour.   \n8. The operating link margin includes margin to cope with the Excess Path Loss due \nto multipath, airframe blockage loss, and RF interference from other UASs operating in the area. \n9. The maximum tolerable U/D ratio calculations in Appendix L assume that no \nmore than 1 outage of 2 seconds or less per hour occur.  Outages may occur when \nthe \"Desired downlink\" and \"Desired uplink\" signals fade randomly below their",
    "the \"Desired downlink\" and \"Desired uplink\" signals fade randomly below their \nfree-space propagation expected value and/or when the \"Undesired downlink\" and \n\"Undesired uplink\" signals become stronger than their free space propagation",
    "\"Undesired uplink\" signals become stronger than their free space propagation \nexpected value. Fades of the desired signal of up to 20 dB excess path loss over free space propagation due to multipath fading at both L Band and C Band are assumed and up to 12 dB of airframe blockage loss at C Band and up to 8 dB airframe blockage loss at L Band are also assumed to occur independently from",
    "the multipath propagation loss.  On the other hand, the \"Undesired downlink\" and \"Undesired uplink\" interfering signals are assumed to experience random signal \nlevel enhancement due to multipath of up to 6 dB at both L Band C Band and random signal enhancement due to ARS antenna pattern gain variation of up to 3 dB independently of the multipath enhancement also at both L Band and C Band. \n10. The excess path loss due to multipath, the airframe blockage loss and RF",
    "10. The excess path loss due to multipath, the airframe blockage loss and RF \ninterference signal enhancement due to multipath and/or aircraft antenna gain dependence on takeoff angle/angle of arrival are assumed to vary randomly as the",
    "geometry of the link changes as the two UASs move and maneuver.  Therefore, the combined losses due to these three effects are treated statistically and are assumed to be uncorrelated.  That is, it is assumed that the deep fading, large airframe blockage and RFI enhancement due to multipath constructive interference and higher antenna gains in certain directions do not all occur at the same time.",
    "11. Appendix K provides data that relates the excess path loss margin loss required \nfor a given desired link availability and terrain/obstacle clearance height (see Figure R-1).   \n12. Appendix K also provides predicted antenna gain distributions from which the \nairframe blockage loss can be estimated. \n13. The maximum tolerable U/D calculations in Appendix L assume that there is only",
    "13. The maximum tolerable U/D calculations in Appendix L assume that there is only \none \"Undesired Interferer\" at the minimum allowed distance.  The on-channel interference due to off-channel RF emissions from this \"Near Undesired \nInterferer\" is allowed to raise the noise floor of the victim receiver by 3 dB.  The",
    "Interferer\" is allowed to raise the noise floor of the victim receiver by 3 dB.  The \nfaded minimum \"Desired Signal\", Dmin, is assumed to be 10 dB greater than the receiver sensitivity in the absence of interference, Smin, of which 3 dB accounts for the doubling of the mean receiver noise floor by the mean value of the on-channel interference from the single interferer, 1 dB accounts for the sporadic increase of \nthe noise floor due to enhancement of the RF interference level above its mean",
    "the noise floor due to enhancement of the RF interference level above its mean \nvalue and 6 dB accounts for the ICAO aviation safety margin. \n14. Interference from other UA and GRS within the vicinity is accounted for by \nincluding the 6 dB ICAO aviation safety margin in the calculation of the minimum \"Desired Signal\", Dmin.",
    "## Operational Restrictions/Exclusion Zones\n\nIn order to keep the U/D ratios within tolerable values, operational limitations are imposed on the use of CNPC Link Systems to ensure that there is compatible operation when multiple UAS operate in close proximity.  The operational limitations are described in Section 1.6.4 of this MOPS.",
    "Figure R-2 provides an illustrated description of the C Band operational restrictions and exclusion zones described in Section 1.6.4 of this MOPS.  The C Band operational restrictions have been determined from the analyses presented in this Appendix and supplemented by the C Band link budgets presented in Appendix L.",
    "The L Band operational restrictions (maximum range coverage and minimum distance to a GRS) described in Section 1.6.4 of this MOPS are based on the L Band link budgets presented in Appendix L.",

Consequently, for C Band, the flight tests show that the normative requirements were validated",
    "L Band Assessment Figure S-3 (copied from the Low Power L Band Hilly Terrain sequences in Appendix O) shows, on the left side, a flight sequence where the aircraft flew directly away from the location of the GRS at a constant altitude of approximately 11,000ft AGL and on the right side a sequence where the aircraft flew broadside to the GRS at a range of 20NM and an altitude of 11,000ft AGL. Based on the left side plots, when the Signal Strength is increased by 9.1dB to account for the combined",
    "on the left side plots, when the Signal Strength is increased by 9.1dB to account for the combined variances discussed above, there should be no periods of significant Subframe Error Rate until at least 25NM range.  This is confirmed by the right side plots which show that with a 9.1dB increase in the Signal Strength, to account for the variances, it is unlikely that any Subframe Errors would have occurred. The left side plot also indicates that at ranges greater than 25NM the Signal Strength",
    "occurred. The left side plot also indicates that at ranges greater than 25NM the Signal Strength rises again.  This fade at 25 NM range is almost certainly due to a ground reflection multipath null occurring at this specific frequency and altitude. Review of all of the other Low Power L Band data in Appendix O confirms the above assessment at all ranges flown (0-56NM) specifically, that, after the variances were taken into account, as long as terrain obstruction did not occur, then the required",
