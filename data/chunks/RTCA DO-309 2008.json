    "## Executive Summary",
    "A review of a ten-year period (1994 thru 2004) of data has indicated that controlled flight into terrain",
    "(CFIT) has been a major contributor of helicopter accidents, especially those resulting in fatalities.  The data suggests that CFIT accidents can happen during day and night under both visual meteorological conditions (VMC) and instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The application of a Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) (originally developed for fixedwing aircraft) in helicopter operations offers great promise in reducing the number of CFIT accidents.",
    "However, helicopters operate in widely diverse environments, including under visual and instrument flight rules (VFR and IFR) and in both on- and off-airport operations, often with significant low altitude exposure. Existing TAWS performance standards are insufficient to support these diverse operations.",
    "Subsequently, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requested that RTCA Inc. form a committee to develop a Minimum Operational Performance Standard (MOPS) for a Helicopter Terrain Awareness and Warning System (HTAWS) in an effort to reduce the helicopter accident rate.  RTCA created the Special Committee SC- 212 to meet this goal. In order to develop a MOPS with the most beneficial alert/warning functions that support the unique helicopter VFR/IFR operational conditions, a",
    "alert/warning functions that support the unique helicopter VFR/IFR operational conditions, a ten-year period of existing helicopter CFIT accident data was analyzed to provide a basis for testing and to aid in the development of the MOPS. Emphasis was placed on helicopter VFR operations into and out of remote and/or unimproved locations without runways, lighting, or navigational aids.  Nine representative test scenarios were extracted from the CFIT",
    "accident cases as representative examples.  Appendix A of this document contains summaries of these accident cases. Emphasis was also placed on minimizing nuisance alerts during normal helicopter operations. With collective experience from across the helicopter industry, RTCA SC-212 developed this Minimum Operational Performance Standard (MOPS) for Helicopter Terrain Awareness and Warning System (HTAWS).  The CFIT accident cases were used as a basis to develop the test scenarios. This MOPS",
    "(HTAWS).  The CFIT accident cases were used as a basis to develop the test scenarios. This MOPS defines the most beneficial alert/warning functions that support the unique flight characteristics of helicopters while at the same time attempting to minimize nuisance alerting.",

    "## 1.1.1 Compliance",
    "In this document, the term \"shall\" is used to indicate a requirement of the HTAWS",
    "equipment.  The term \"should\" is used to denote a recommendation that would improve the HTAWS equipment, but does not constitute a requirement.  The term \"may\" is used to denote a permissive situation. An approved design should comply with every requirement which shall be verifiable by inspection, test, analysis, or demonstration. Compliance with these standards is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will perform its intended functions(s) satisfactorily under all conditions",

    "The HTAWS, as defined within this document, is an alerting system. It is intended to provide terrain and obstacle aural and visual alerts. HTAWS is designed to reduce the risk of CFIT accidents by providing increased situational awareness of the surrounding terrain and obstacles, mainly during the cruise phase in Visual Meteorological Condition (VMC) and in Instrument Meteorological Condition (IMC) under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). HTAWS is not intended to be used as an aid for navigation.",

The order of tests specified suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design, and design qualification, into operational use. For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2 shall have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section 3.",

    "A CFIT accident occurs when an airworthy aircraft, experiencing no contributory systems or equipment problems, under the control of a certificated, fully qualified flight crew not suffering from any impairment, is flown into terrain (or water or obstacle) with no demonstrated prior awareness of the impending collision on the part of the crew.  Or, if the flight crew was aware of the impending collision, they were unable to prevent it.",

    "Of the 44 passengers and crewmembers involved in these 9 accidents, 31 (70%) were killed; 3 (7%) were seriously injured; 1 (2%) suffered minor injuries, and 9 (21%) were uninjured. Most CFIT accidents have in common a chain of events leading to what human factors experts term \"lack of situational awareness\" on the part of the flight crew.  Conditions of limited visibility (due to darkness or weather or both) are typically a major contributing factor.  Other such contributing factors include",

Data in these reports relevant to this study included some of the following:",

All accidents selected clearly met the following CFIT classification criteria:",
    "a. the helicopter was engaged in routine, cross-country flight at the time of the \naccident; \nb. the helicopter was in controlled flight at the time of impact; c. all systems on the helicopter were operating normally at the time of impact; and d. the flight crews of the accident helicopter were not impaired",
