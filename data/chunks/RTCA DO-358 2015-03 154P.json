    "(or the most current published revision) *Software Consideration in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification*, should be considered.",
    "## 1.2 System Overview",
    "The FIS-B service provides meteorological and aeronautical data to the cockpit.  The high-level data flows supporting FIS-B are illustrated in Figure 1-1. The FIS-B Ground System Control Station (CS) ingests meteorological and aeronautical data and broadcasts generated sets of products specific to the location of a radio station. These products are broadcast over the UAT radio frequency link so pilots have timely information of regional meteorological and aeronautical information, including",
    "pilots have timely information of regional meteorological and aeronautical information, including National Airspace System (NAS) status/changes that might impact flight.",
    "## 1.2.1 Document Hierarchy\n\nHigher-level end-to-end system requirements are described in RTCA DO-267A Minimum Aviation System Performance Standard (MASPS) for Flight Information Services-\nBroadcast (FIS-B) Data Link, dated April 29, 2004.  RTCA DO-267A documented both MASPS and MOPS for FIS-B.  This MOPS was created to separate and update the MOPS portion of RTCA DO-267A for FIS-B with UAT. \n\n## 1.3 Operational Application(S)",
    "The goal of the FIS-B system codified in this MOPS is to provide weather (Wx) and aeronautical information to pilots in a manner that will enhance their awareness of the flight conditions and enable better strategic route planning consistent with guidance provided by Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) and corporate policy.  The information provided through FIS-B is considered non-binding advice provided to assist in the safe and legal conduct of flight operations.  With this information,",
    "provided to assist in the safe and legal conduct of flight operations.  With this information, general aviation (GA) pilots and air carrier flight crews will be better able to assess the need to consider alternative route and altitude selection. Currently, when adverse Wx conditions are present, the Very High Frequency (VHF) radio frequencies designed to facilitate the exchange of Wx and flight data information",
    "--``,,,,,,```,``,`,,,,`,``,`,`,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---",
    "## 4",
    "become saturated to the point that near real-time exchange of information is troublesome. It is envisioned that FIS-B products will be continuously received and stored to be readily available as needed or when requested by the pilot.",
    "This FIS-B system is not intended to replace existing voice networks, Flight Service Station (FSS) services or usurp any joint duties or responsibilities required by aircraft operators.  Loss or non-receipt of FIS-B service would have no regulatory impact. FIS-B products are to be used only for strategic/planning purposes and not for crew alerting.  This is due to the fact that FIS-B products may have significant latency between the observation of a Wx phenomenon, the issuance of a forecast or",
    "have significant latency between the observation of a Wx phenomenon, the issuance of a forecast or the change in airspace status and the display of that information in the cockpit.  In addition, because their update rates are relatively low, FIS-B products should not be used for tactical maneuvering of the aircraft and should not be the sole basis for immediate corrective action by the pilot. FIS-B products are intended to enable pilots to determine if action should be taken well before it is",
    "products are intended to enable pilots to determine if action should be taken well before it is required and should be used in conjunction with other information sources to support in-flight decisions. It is expected that FIS-B will offer operational advantages to all types of airspace users. For Part 121 airline operations, the ability of flight crews to access information in-flight previously available only during pre-flight will greatly enhance the collaborative decision making process of",
    "available only during pre-flight will greatly enhance the collaborative decision making process of pilot-in-command and aircraft dispatcher. The general aviation community will benefit from FIS-B by having better in-flight access to information on Wx phenomena that may pose a danger to the flight.  In addition, because many GA flights are single-pilot operations, FIS-B will enable GA pilots to gain a more comprehensive Wx picture than currently obtainable via voice radio, thereby enabling",
    "to gain a more comprehensive Wx picture than currently obtainable via voice radio, thereby enabling better in-flight strategic decision-making.  Finally, with the creation of Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) becoming more prevalent due to national security concerns, FIS-B offers another means to increase the GA pilot's awareness of the status of airspace.",
    "## 1.4 Intended Function\n\nThe equipment shall perform its intended function, as defined by the manufacturer.  The equipment shall process and display the FIS-B products identified in this MOPS. \n\n## 1.5 Operational Goals\n\nThe operational goal is to display the FIS-B products on the flight deck in order to enhance pilot awareness of meteorological conditions and airspace constraints along the route of flight. \n\n## 1.6 Assumptions",
    "## 1.6 Assumptions\n\nThis MOPS is written under the assumption that FIS-B avionics receives its data from a UAT. Reference RTCA DO-282B Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast \n(ADS-B). \n\n## 1.6.1 Fis-B Implementation\n\nThe requirements in the MOPS are based on the implementation of FIS-B provided by the FAA in the United States (U.S.) and its territories.",
    "It should be noted that the requirements reflect the operational status of the FIS-B Ground System at the time this MOPS was published.  Evolution of the FIS-B service and/or the source of the data, such as changes from providers of data input to Surveillance and Broadcast Services System (SBSS) (e.g., National Weather Service (NWS)) may in fact affect these requirements and would need to be addressed. Anticipated near-term updates to FIS-B are described in 0.",
    "## 1.6.2 Coordinated Universal Time (Utc) Time Access\n\nIt is assumed that the FIS-B avionics can access current UTC time including month, day, hour, minute and seconds. \n\n## 1.7 Test Procedures",
    "The test procedures specified in this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the performance requirements defined in Section 2.2. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred.  These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures.",
    "herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. Users of this document should not infer performance requirements based on Test Procedures. The order of tests specified suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design, and design qualification, into operational use.  For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2 shall have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the",
    "of Section 2 shall have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section 3.",
    "## 1. Environmental Tests",
    "Environmental test requirements are specified in Section 2.3.  The procedures and their associated limits are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations. Unless otherwise specified, the environmental conditions and test procedures contained in RTCA DO-160G/EUROCAE ED-14G, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, will be",
    "ED-14G, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, will be used to demonstrate equipment compliance.",
    "2. Bench Tests \nBench test procedures are specified in Section 2.4. These tests provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Section 2.2.  Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance, for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design.",
    "3. Installed Equipment Considerations",
    "Tests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. The installed equipment test procedures and their associated limits are specified in Section 3.  Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included in the installed equipment test, their successful completion is a precondition to completion of the installed test.  In certain instances, however, installed equipment tests may be used in lieu of bench test",
    "test.  In certain instances, however, installed equipment tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics,",
    "## 6\n\ninterference from or to other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc.  Installed tests are normally performed under two conditions: \n\na. With the aircraft on the ground and using simulated or operational system inputs. \nb. With the aircraft in flight using operational system inputs appropriate to the \nequipment under test. \nTest results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the intended operational environment. \n\n## 1.8 Definition Of Terms",

Each binary source file provided as part of this MOPS contains one (1) UAT Ground Uplink Message.  These files are aggregated into a stimulus through a Comma-Separated Values (CSV or \"*.csv\") file that associates each binary source file with a time. Those Ground Uplink Messages with the same time",
    "associates each binary source file with a time. Those Ground Uplink Messages with the same time can be replayed in any order. The test procedures in this section are based on 18 \"Test Groups\" where each Test Group verifies all the requirements from Section 2.2 that are covered by a common stimulus. Each requirement maps to one Test Group. Each Test Group section identifies those Section 2.2 requirements verified.",
    "Note: These 18 Test Groups are specific to Section 2.4 of this MOPS and are not to be confused with the three (3) groupings of the environmental procedures discussed in Section 2.3. \n\n## 2.4.2 Definitions Of Terms And Conditions Of Test\n\nThe following are definitions of terms and the conditions under which the tests described in this section should be conducted.",
    "1. Power Input Voltage—Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be conducted with \nthe power input voltage adjusted to design voltage, plus or minus 2%.  The input voltage shall be measured at the input terminals of the equipment under test. \n2. Power Input Frequency \na. In the case of equipment designed for operation from an alternating current (AC) \nsource of essentially constant frequency (e.g., 400 Hz), the input frequency shall be adjusted to design frequency, plus or minus 2%.",
    "b. In the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC source of variable \nfrequency (e.g., 300 to 1000 Hz), unless otherwise specified, tests shall be conducted with the input frequency adjusted to within 5% of a selected frequency and within the range for which the equipment is designed. \n3. Each UAT Ground Uplink Message is stored in its own \"*.bin\" file. Each bin file \ncontains 432 byte uplink in its native encoding format starting at the UAT Ground Uplink Header.",
    "contains 432 byte uplink in its native encoding format starting at the UAT Ground Uplink Header. \n4. Test Functionality—There are three basic test functions needed for the conduct of \nthese tests. \na. A playback function for the injection of the stimulus files. b. A timing function that allows for the ability to control time as provided in the test \ncase. \nc. A location function that allows for geo-locating the unit under test, if necessary.",
    "case. \nc. A location function that allows for geo-locating the unit under test, if necessary. \nAdditionally, if the FIS-B processing and display functions are tightly coupled with the UAT receiver, a test point will be required for injection of the stimulus data at the output receiver. An alternative would be for the manufacturer to playback the stimulus files into a test transmitter built for that purpose, thus allowing the stimulus to flow \"end-to-end.\" See Figure 2-1.",
    "1. Ambient Conditions—Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be made within the \nfollowing ambient conditions: \na. Temperature: +15 to +35 degrees C (+59 to +95 degrees F). b. Relative Humidity: Not greater than 85%. c. Ambient Pressure: 84 to 107 kPa (equivalent to +5000 to -1500 ft) (+1525 to  \n-460 m). \n2. Connected Loads—Unless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed with the \nequipment connected to loads having the impedance values for which it is designed.",
    "## 2.4.3 Detailed Test Procedures\n\nThe test procedure overviews below provide a brief description of what will be tested and the requirements associated with those elements. Manufacturers may decide to create their own test stimulus to verify requirements. In those cases, the compliance to each Section 2.2 requirement must be defined by the manufacturer. \n\n## 2.4.3.1 Test Group 1",

The tiering strategy was developed to deliver FIS-B products to aircraft at different altitudes with different look-ahead ranges, while subject to the limitations of channel capacity and co-channel interference.  Details and concepts are subject to change as the strategies for management of the ground system Radio Stations and their allocated channel capacities may be modified to",
    "of the ground system Radio Stations and their allocated channel capacities may be modified to meet future changes in the scope of FIS-B products delivered or their requirements. The UAT schema provides 32 logical channels to the ground for the uplink of data to aircraft as described in APPENDIX G.  Of these, logical channels 1 through 31 are allocated to the uplink of FIS-B data.  Channel 32 is allocated for other purposes.  FIS-B data products are delivered from ground Radio Stations, each",
    "allocated for other purposes.  FIS-B data products are delivered from ground Radio Stations, each using 1, 2, 3 or 4 data channels. If a receiver is within radio coverage of two Radio Stations transmitting on the same logical channel it encounters co-channel interference. If the signal from one Radio Station is not sufficiently stronger than that of the interfering Radio Station the signal will be garbled and neither signal will be successfully received. Therefore, careful selection of Radio",

Therefore, careful selection of Radio Station channel assignments is necessary in order to ensure that whenever Radio Stations are in view of an aircraft receiver, at least one station must be free of co-channel interference in order to ensure delivery of FIS-B data. This appendix describes the means used for Radio Station data channel assignment.",
    "## D.2 Cellular And Tiering Concept D.2.1 Cellular Channel Reuse",
    "A standard method of channel reuse is accomplished by using a cellular reuse pattern. Each Radio Station covers a cell and is assigned a set of channels to use. Neighboring cells, a portion of which are also visible, are assigned different channel sets, so locations where multiple Radio Stations are seen have at least one Radio Station without cochannel interference. An example of regular cell arrangement with a three cell reuse factor is depicted in Figure D-1. Special considerations are",
    "arrangement with a three cell reuse factor is depicted in Figure D-1. Special considerations are necessary in an airborne environment since the distance at which Radio Stations are visible varies considerably depending upon the aircraft altitude. As an aircraft's altitude increases, the number of visible Radio Stations increase, therefore, Radio Stations that do not exhibit co-channel interference at a low altitude could receive interference at a high altitude. A three-dimensional cellular",
    "at a low altitude could receive interference at a high altitude. A three-dimensional cellular approach is necessary to ensure full coverage.",
    "## D.2.2 Tiered Cellular Assignment D.2.2.1 Tier Altitude Range",
    "Given a nominal cell spacing, there exists an altitude range in which at least one radio station is expected to be visible. A notional two-dimensional example is shown in Figure D-2. The floor and ceiling are determined at the cell boundary. The floor is the lowest altitude at the cell boundary at which both a radio station and its nearest neighbor radio station are visible. The ceiling is the altitude at the cell boundary at which the nearest radio station with the same channel assignment is",
    "at the cell boundary at which the nearest radio station with the same channel assignment is visible. Note that these are not hard boundaries at either the floor or the ceiling. There is still a great deal of coverage slightly above the ceiling or below the floor. Deviations from the nominal spacing will have the effect of lowering the ceiling and raising the floor.",
    "## D.2.2.2 Tier Implementation D.2.2.2.1 High Tier",
    "Three separate tiers are designed to ensure coverage from the specified FIS-B service ceiling of 24,000 ft MSL. Starting at the high tier, cell spacing is chosen to reach a nominal ceiling of 36,500 ft MSL, and nominal floor of 9100 ft AGL, allowing for deviations due to radio station location and terrain blockage. The high tier has a cellular reuse factor of three, and the high tier channel assignments are designated as H1, H2 and H3, as seen in Figure D-3. \n\n## D.2.2.2.2 Medium Tier",
    "The medium tier is designed with a cellular reuse factor of 4, and is illustrated in Figure D-4. Three of the channel assignments are designated as M1, M2 and M3. The remaining channel assignment set is taken by a high-tier radio station, (H1, H2, H3) rather than M4. This requires that the high-tier radio stations transmit a superset of the mid-tier radio station data. The medium tier has a nominal ceiling of 13,800 ft AGL, for a considerable overlap with the high tier. This tier has a nominal",
    "ceiling of 13,800 ft AGL, for a considerable overlap with the high tier. This tier has a nominal floor of 2250 ft AGL.",
    "## D.2.2.2.3 Low Tier",
    "The low tier is designed with a cellular reuse factor of 3, and is illustrated in Figure D-5. Two of the channel assignments are designated as L1 and L2. The third channel assignment is taken by a medium- or high-tier station. Finally, a channel assignment L3 is used to assign to radio stations that do not fit within the tiered structure. The floor of the low tier is the system coverage floor. The low tier has a nominal ceiling of 3050 ft AGL, overlapping the medium tier.",
    "## D.2.2.2.4 Surface Assignments\n\nIn addition to the tiers described in this section, radio stations are located at airports providing service to aircraft and vehicles on the airport surface. These surface radio stations are not included in the tiering structure described. Surface radio stations have channel designations S1, S2, S3 and S4. Additionally, channel designations L4 and L5 may service the airport surface where the FIS-B data load requires additional capacity.",
    "## D.3 Data Channel Assignments",
    "There are a total of 31 channels available for delivery of FIS-B data, and the amount of data any single radio station can deliver is limited by the number of channels assigned to that radio station. Channels have been allocated such that high-tier stations are assigned four channels each, medium-tier stations are assigned three channels each, low tier stations two channels each and surface stations are assigned a single channel. In general, an aircraft's altitude is correlated with its speed",
    "are assigned a single channel. In general, an aircraft's altitude is correlated with its speed and expected flying distance; high-flying aircraft typically fly faster and farther than low-flying aircraft. This is reflected in the increased look-ahead range and data products used in the high tiers over the low tiers. In addition, each channel set assignment is assigned a Site ID, which may be used by the FIS-B avionics to identify the tier and data channels used by the radio station. See",
    "be used by the FIS-B avionics to identify the tier and data channels used by the radio station. See Sections A.3.3.3.4.2 and A.3.3.4.4.2 for AIRMET and SIGMET Site ID information, respectively.",
    "1. Since the tiering and channel assignments are adjusted to meet the changing \ndynamics of the FIS-B product load and requirements, the relationship of Site ID \ndesignation with channel assignments will be maintained apart from this MOPS. \n2. The tiering and channel assignments can be known by the avionics with the algorithm \nin Section 2.2.10.  \n \n\n## Appendix E Background On The Nexrad Uplink Products E.1 Nexrad Network",
