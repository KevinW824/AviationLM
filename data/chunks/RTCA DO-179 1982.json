    "This document considers a configuration of airborne receiving equipment including: \nAntenna system(s), transmission lines, radio receiver, receiver control unit and a bearing indication display. \n\nAdditional functions and components that refer to expanded capabilities are identified as optional features. \n\nFeatures that are beyond the scope of this document may be developed in future RTCA activities. \n\nThe word \"system\" \nas used in this document refers to the NDB/ADF system.",
    "The word \"system\" \nas used in this document refers to the NDB/ADF system. \n\nIt includes all portions of both the NDB \nground transmitter and the ADF equipment. \n\nThe word \"equipment\" \nas used in this document includes all components necessary for the equipment to properly perform its intended function. \n\nFor example, ADF receiving \n\"equipment\" may include an antenna, a receiver unit, a control unit, a bearing indicator, a shock mount, etc.",
    "In the case of this example, all of the foregoing components or units comprise the \"equipment.\" \nIt should not be inferred from this example, however, that every receiving equipment will necessarily include all of the foregoing components. \n\nThis will depend on the design used by the equipment manufacturer. \n\n## 1.2 System Overview 1.2.1 Basic System Description\n\nThe NDB/ADF system consists of airborne direction finders \n(ADF) \nand ground stations called nondirectional beacons \n(NDB).",
    "The ADF senses and automatically indicates the direction of arrival of the NDB signal. \n\nDirection is indicated to the pilot as a magnetic bearing or as a relative bearing to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, depending on the type of indicator installed in the aircraft. \n\nThe equipment may be used to monitor MCW or CW transmissions. \n\nA typical example of this operation is the reception of the NDB station identifier. \n\nThe NDB \nis a ground station transmitting omni-directional signals.",
    "The NDB \nis a ground station transmitting omni-directional signals. \n\nWhen the NDB \nis operational, it transmits a station identifier using either MCW or CW modulation. \n\nWhen the NDB \nis installed as a part of the instrument landing system \n(ILS), it is normally called a compass locator. \n\nsources of interfering signals, and combinations of interfering signals, under all conditions.",
    "sources of interfering signals, and combinations of interfering signals, under all conditions. \n\nThe relative signal levels that are specified in Section 2.0 realistically represent conditions that will be encountered. \n\nHowever, they may be exceeded in small volumes of airspace.",
    "However, they may be exceeded in small volumes of airspace. \n\nWhen the conditions specified in Section 2.0 are exceeded, the aural identification will be garbled and there is a high probability that the source of the interference will not be \n90 degrees from the desired station. \n\nThus, the probability is high that the bearing information provided may be within the accuracy specified.",
    "In any event, the garbled identification signal provides a warning that the bearing information should not be used. \n\n## Spurious Response, Cross Modulation And Intermodulation 1.4.3\n\nEquipment spurious responses, cross modulation effects or intermodulation effects should not inhibit the pilot from receiving the NDB within the NDB coverage volume \n(see paragraphs \n2.2.13, \n2.2.14 and 2.2.15). \n\n## Bearing Accuracy 1.4.4",
    "## Bearing Accuracy 1.4.4\n\nThe basic purpose of an NDB \nis to allow a pilot to fly from one point to another and to stay within a given volume of airspace in the process. \n\nIn designing procedures which use an NDB, the designer ensures obstacle clearance in the protected airspace, Total system accuracy then should permit a pilot to stay within this airspace. \n\nA portion of the total bearing accuracy error budget is allocated to the avionics.",
    "A portion of the total bearing accuracy error budget is allocated to the avionics. \n\nThe avionics should be capable of meeting this bearing accuracy even if antenna impedances are changed, as might occur during in-flight icing conditions, or if the receiver is slightly detuned, as might occur during in-flight temperature changes. \n\nThe equipment should provide a means for quadrantal error correction. \n\n## Assumptions\n\n1.5 \nThe following assumptions were used in preparing this MOPS.",
    "## Assumptions\n\n1.5 \nThe following assumptions were used in preparing this MOPS. \n\n## 1.5.1 Field Strength\n\nA \n50 microvolts per meter signal is the minimum field strength at the coverage limits in the U.S. \n\n(70 microvolts per meter minus \n3 dB allowable degradation in beacon transmitter power). \n\nA receiver sensitivity which provides a \n3 dB signal-plusnoise to noise ratio is acceptable at \n50 microvolts per meter.",
    "Measurement methods are more accurate with a \n6 \ndB signal-plusnoise to noise ratio. \n\nTherefore, system performance is established with a \n70 microvolts per meter field strength corresponding to a \n6 \ndB signal-plus-noise to noise ratio.",
    "For a definition of rated coverage of NDBs under various noise conditions in other areas of the world, see paragraph \n6.3.3, Attachment C \nto Part \n1 \nof the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) publication, \"Aeronautical Telecommunications Annex \n10, Third Edition of Volume I, July, \n1972.\" \n\n## 1.5.2 Selectivity",
    "## 1.5.2 Selectivity\n\nThe selectivities in paragraphs \n2.2.11 \nand 2.2.12 assume that a \n10 dB minimum desired/undesired signal ratio at the input to the detector will provide no more than \n3 degrees bearing error. \n\n(Reference: \nThe Technique of Radio Design by E. \n\nE. \n\nZepler) \n\n## 1.5.3 Warnings And Flags\n\nUnlike some other navigational aids, the NDB/ADF system does not require a warning or a flag if the received signal is deficient in level or quality.",
    "The pilot must determine whether the received signal is reliable by listening to the identification and observing the needle movements. \n\nThe reception of two identification signals or the lack of any identification means that the ADF bearing may be unreliable. \n\nSimilarly, unusual needle variations are also an indication of unreliable bearing.",
    "Similarly, unusual needle variations are also an indication of unreliable bearing. \n\nIf the NDB/ADF system does not provide a warning or flag, the pilot should monitor identification and needle variation while making use of the ADF bearing. \n\n## 1.6 Test Procedures\n\nThe test procedures and associated limits specified throughout this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the minimum acceptable performance parameters.",
    "Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the test activity. \n\nThese alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information. \n\nIn such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures.",
    "Test results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the environment in which the equipment is intended to operate, In addition, the ground test procedures may be used as an optional check of equipment performance following corrective maintenance. \n\n1.6.4 \n\n## Operational Tests\n\nThe operational tests are specified in Section 4.0.",
    "1.6.4 \n\n## Operational Tests\n\nThe operational tests are specified in Section 4.0. \n\nThese test procedures and their associated limits are intended to be conducted by operating personnel as one means of ensuring that the equipment is functioning properly and can be reliably used for its intended function. \n\n## Definitions Of Terms\n\n1.7",

    "For equipment including a fixed amount of quandrantal error compensation, the indicated bearing shall be corrected by the amount of quandrantal error compensation so included. \n\nFor equipment including an error compensating device which is adjustable, this device may be set prior to testing the equipment so as to obtain a minimum bearing error. \n\nHowever, no adjustment of this device shall be made during conduct of the test.",
    "However, no adjustment of this device shall be made during conduct of the test. \n\n'This requirement shall be met using both unmodulated signals and signals modulated up to a depth of 80% from 400 \nto 1000 Hz. \n\n## 2.2.6 Station Passage - (Adf Function)\n\nWhen the direction of arrival of a signal is abruptly changed through \n175 degrees, the bearing indicator shall indicate a corresponding 170-degree change in less than seven seconds. \n\n## 2.2.7 Audio Frequency Response",
