    "Mixing cells or batteries with different part numbers, made by different manufacturers, or from different sources, is not an acceptable practice.  Cells or batteries may have different capacities and voltage characteristics, because they have different designs, manufacturing processes or storage, use or age histories.  Cells or batteries of different capacities in series connection may result in the lower capacity battery(ies) being driven into a detrimental deep discharge (forced discharge) or",
