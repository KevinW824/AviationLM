    "## 3.2 Composite Materials",
    "Each structural composite material used shall conform to a specification. The purpose of that specification is to ensure the composite materials used in production maintain consistency with the materials used in, or reflected by, the design data, the test articles used for material qualification and/or the proof-of-structure certification test article(s).

    "A material specification for a composite material may require some unique content compared to specifications for other commonly used aerospace materials.  See Appendix A for references and guidance regarding the content of a composite material specification.   \n\n## 3.2.1 Composite Structural Considerations",
    "Experimental evidence should be provided to demonstrate that the material design values or allowables are attained with a high degree of confidence in the appropriate critical environmental exposures to be expected in service.  The structural static strength substantiation of a composite design should include effects of environment, material and process variability, non-detectable defects or any defects that are allowed by the quality control, manufacturing acceptance criteria, and service",
    "any defects that are allowed by the quality control, manufacturing acceptance criteria, and service damage allowed in maintenance documents of the end product.  The static strength of the composite design should be demonstrated in the appropriate environment using one of the three approaches below:",
    "1) In the first approach, the full scale static test should be conducted on structure conditioned to simulate the \ncritical environmental exposure and then tested in that environment. \n2) The second approach relies upon coupon, element, and subcomponent test data to determine the effect of",
    "environmental exposure on static strength. This characterization should be performed for all structural materials.  The critical degradation characterized by these tests should then be accounted for in the full scale static strength demonstration test (e.g., overload factors), or in analysis of these results (e.g., showing a positive margin of safety with design values that include the degrading effects of environment). The necessary",
    "experience to validate an analysis may include previous ultimate load tests with similar designs, material systems, and load cases. \n3) In practice, aspects of the first two approaches may be combined to get the desired result (e.g., a full scale \nstatic test may be performed at critical operating temperature with a load factor to account for moisture \nabsorbed over the aircraft structure's life).",
    "## 3.3 Standard Fastenings\n\nAll bolts, pins, screws, and rivets used in the structure shall be of a type the suitability and dependability of which have been demonstrated by experience or tests. The use of a suitable and dependable locking device or method is required for all such bolts, pins, and screws. Self-locking nuts shall not be used on bolts subject to rotation. \n\n## 3.4 Protection",
    "## 3.4 Protection\n\nAll members of the structure shall be suitably protected against deterioration or loss of strength in service due to weathering, corrosion, abrasion, or other causes. Special precautions should be taken against corrosion from salt water, particularly where parts made from materials with different electronegativity potentials are in close proximity. Adequate provisions for ventilation and drainage of all compartments of the structure shall be made.",

    "Each float must have enough watertight compartments to provide reasonable assurance that the aircraft will stay afloat, without capsizing, in case of a likely float flooding.  Likely flooding should take into consideration the potential for striking objects in the water, including, but not limited to: contact with an object at a bulkhead in a multi-compartment float which results in the flooding of adjacent compartments, and; contact with an object that results in the flooding of a",
    "flooding of adjacent compartments, and; contact with an object that results in the flooding of a longitudinally proximate compartment of each float.",
    "## 4.2 Strength 4.2.1 Material Strength Properties",
    "The strength properties of the materials used shall be based on a sufficient number of tests of material to establish design values on a statistical basis. The design values shall be so chosen that the probability of any structure being under-strength because of material variations is extremely remote. The structure shall be designed, in so far as practicable, to avoid points of stress concentration where variable stresses above the fatigue limit are likely to occur in normal service.",
    "## 4.2.2 Loads",
    "Strength requirements are specified in terms of limit and ultimate loads. Limit loads are the maximum loads anticipated in service. Ultimate loads are equal to the limit loads multiplied by the factor of safety. Unless otherwise described, loads specified are limit loads. All such loads shall be distributed in a manner conservatively approximating or closely representing actual conditions. If deflections under load would change significantly the distribution of external or internal loads, such",
    "under load would change significantly the distribution of external or internal loads, such redistribution shall be taken into account.",
    "## 4.2.3 Factor Of Safety\n\nThe factor of safety shall be 1.5 unless any of the conditions of sections 4.2.3.1 through 4.2.3.4 apply. In those cases, the factor of safety of 1.5 shall be multiplied by the highest pertinent safety factors prescribed in sections 4.2.3.1 (special factors) through 4.2.3.4 (fitting factor).  \n\n## 4.2.3.1 Special Factors",
    "## 4.2.3.1 Special Factors\n\nWhere there may be uncertainty concerning the actual strength of particular parts of the structure, or where the strength is likely to deteriorate in service prior to normal replacement, increased factors of safety shall be provided to ensure that the strength and reliability of such parts is not less than the rest of the structure.",
    "4.2.3.2 \nCasting Factors \na) \nIf visual inspection only is to be employed, the variability factor shall be 2.0. \nb) The variability factor may be reduced to 1.25 for ultimate loads and 1.15 for limit loads if at least three \nsample castings are tested to show compliance with these factors, and if all sample and production castings have been determined to be acceptable upon completion of a visual and radiographical inspection. \n\n## 4.2.3.3 Bearing Factors",
    "## 4.2.3.3 Bearing Factors\n\nThe factor of safety in bearing at bolted or pinned joints shall be 2.0 for joints subject to rotation, or shock or vibration, or 2.5 for joints subject to rotation and shock or vibration.  For joints subject to neither, the factor of safety shall be 1.15. \n\n## 4.2.3.4 Fitting Factor",
    "Fittings are defined as parts such as end terminals used to join one structural member to another. A factor of safety of at least 1.15 shall be used in the analysis of all fittings the strength of which is not proved by limit and ultimate load tests in which the actual stress conditions are simulated in the fitting and the surrounding structure. This factor applies to all portions of the fitting, the means of attachment, and bearing on the members joined. The fitting factor need not be applied",

    "## 4.2.3.5 Structural Bonds\n\nWhere load carrying components of the float are structurally bonded together, the effects of disbonds and voids located within the bonded joint shall be considered. \n\n## 4.2.4 Strength And Deformation",
    "The structure shall be capable of supporting limit loads without suffering detrimental permanent deformations. At all loads up to limit loads, the deformation shall be such as not to interfere with safe operation of the aircraft on which the float is used. The structure shall be capable of supporting ultimate loads without failure for at least 3 seconds, unless proof of strength is demonstrated by dynamic tests simulating actual conditions of load application.",
    "The effects of material and manufacturing variability, environmental conditions, and in-service wear and abuse should be considered.  The ultimate load capability of the structure shall be demonstrated with manufacturing defects (such as disbonds and voids) up to the threshold of detectability, and may include service damage. \n\n## 4.3 Water Loads",
    "## 4.3 Water Loads\n\nThe floats and float supporting structure shall be investigated for all critical distributions of water pressures occurring during the design conditions defined herein. \n\n## 4.3.1 Design Weights\n\nThe design weight used in the water landing conditions shall be the design landing weight of the airplane on which the float is to be used. \n\n--`,`,,``,,,,,``,```,``,,`````,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\n\n## 4.3.2 Design Landing Conditions",

    "The following limit load factors shall be used in the design of the structure as a whole. In applying the loads resulting from the load factors prescribed in 4.3.3, it is acceptable to distribute them over the float bottom so as to avoid excessive local shear loads and bending moments at the point where the resultant water load is located.
