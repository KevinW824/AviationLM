    "## Executive Summary",
    "Since the last revision to DO-220, there have been many technological advances in the field of airborne weather radar. DO-220A incorporates updates and corrections to the previous version. In addition to modernizing the requirements and test procedures for the weather, ground mapping, and predictive windshear functions set out in its predecessors, SC-230 has added specifications for radar detection of turbulence and atmospheric threat awareness. Any of these functions may be implemented",
    "detection of turbulence and atmospheric threat awareness. Any of these functions may be implemented individually or in combination with any others. DO-220A has been designed such that the requirements and test procedures for each function are grouped into distinct sections to facilitate testing and showing of compliance. Change 1 of this document implements the following changes:",

Most radar installations will share a multipurpose display such as an Electronic Flight Instrument System. For airborne radar systems with this",
