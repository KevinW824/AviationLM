    "6.1  Intended use.  The intent of this document is to define the electric power quality requirements for DoD aircraft, however it may also be used with commercial aircraft or other types of vehicles.  Other industry documents such as SAE-AS1212 and ISO 1540 also define aircraft electric power quality requirements.  These documents are generally not appropriate for use with military aircraft because they do not address all of the areas of concern with military aircraft electric power quality and",
    "they do not address all of the areas of concern with military aircraft electric power quality and often require wider limits compared to this document due to the differences in the types and sizes of aircraft covered.  In addition, they do not always take into account legacy DoD aircraft electrical power systems or legacy DoD utilization equipment.",
    "The power characteristics requirements of this document also apply to commercial and nondevelopmental utilization equipment purchased in accordance with the policy described in the SD-2, \"Buying Commercial & Nondevelopmental Items: A Handbook\".

Utilization equipment specifications should never",

Utilization equipment specifications should never specify operating ranges that are narrower than those specified herein nor waive compatibility with the electric power characteristics specified herein, since that could result in failure of the equipment to perform as required.

Historically users of MIL-STD-704 interpret or view the electrical power quality characteristics limits in this document as they would those of a typical power source/generator.
