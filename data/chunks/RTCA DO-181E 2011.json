    "## 1.2 System Overview 1.2.1 The Function Of Mode S",
    "Mode S is a cooperative surveillance and communication system for air traffic control.  It employs ground-based and airborne sensors (interrogators) and airborne transponders.",
    "Ground-air-ground data link communications can be accommodated integrally with the surveillance interrogations and replies.  Mode S has been designed as an evolutionary addition to the Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) to provide the enhanced surveillance and communication capability required for air traffic control automation.  To facilitate the introduction of Mode S into the ATCRBS system, both ground and airborne Mode S installations include full ATCRBS capability.  Mode S",
    "interrogators provide surveillance of ATCRBS-equipped aircraft, and Mode S \ntransponders will reply to ATCRBS interrogators.  In addition, the data link potential of Mode S permits use of the transponder for a number of air traffic control (ATC) and aircraft separation assurance (ASA) functions.",
    "The monopulse techniques used in Mode S surveillance allow improved position determination of ATCRBS targets while reducing the number of required interrogations. This reduction of ATCRBS interrogations and replies improves the radio frequency (RF) interference environment.",
    "A principal feature of Mode S that differs from ATCRBS is that each aircraft is assigned a unique address code.  Using this unique code, interrogations can be directed to a particular aircraft and replies unambiguously identified.  Channel interference is minimized because a sensor can limit its interrogations to targets of interest.  In addition, by proper timing of interrogations, replies from closely-spaced aircraft can be received without mutual interference.  The unique address in each",
    "closely-spaced aircraft can be received without mutual interference.  The unique address in each interrogation and reply also permits the inclusion of data link messages to or from a particular aircraft.",
    "## 1.2.2 Major Operating Characteristics",
    "In order to facilitate a smooth transition from the existing ATCRBS system, Mode S uses the same frequencies for interrogations and replies as ATCRBS (1030 and 1090 MHz, respectively).  The Mode S waveforms (modulation techniques) have been chosen to reduce the interference between ATCRBS and Mode S.  The Mode S interrogation is transmitted using binary differential phase shift keying (DPSK).  With proper demodulation, the information content is detectable in the presence of overlaid ATCRBS",
    "With proper demodulation, the information content is detectable in the presence of overlaid ATCRBS signals.  The modulation of the downlink transmission from the transponder is pulse position modulation (PPM) which is inherently resistant to ATCRBS random pulses.  The information content of both uplink and downlink transmissions is further protected by parity check bits generated by a cyclic coding algorithm.",
    "Each Mode S interrogation contains a 24-bit discrete address which allows a very large number of aircraft to operate in the air traffic control environment without occurrence of a redundant address.  The overlaying of the parity check bits on the discrete address assures that a message will be accepted only by the aircraft addressed and that the probability of an erroneous message being accepted is extremely small.",
    "Because the interference resistance of the Mode S system relies on the DPSK modulation process on the uplink and the PPM format on the downlink, the DPSK demodulation processor within the transponder must be designed carefully, and precise timing of the downlink pulses is required. \n\n## 1.2.3 System Performance 1.2.3.1 Surveillance Performance",
    "The Mode S interrogator provides surveillance of all beacon-equipped aircraft (both ATCRBS and Mode S) within its line-of-sight coverage.  The nominal maximum range is \n200 NM.  The Mode S interrogators can provide surveillance of a large number of aircraft with better accuracy than ATCRBS.  With the capability to reinterrogate a target within an antenna scan, the overall surveillance reliability of Mode S is greater than 99 percent. \n\n## 1.2.3.2 Data Link Performance",
    "Mode S can provide for ground-to-air, air-to-ground and air-to-air data link.  The critical nature of many of the messages carried by Mode S will require a high degree of message integrity.  Error-detecting codes in both interrogations and replies are designed to produce an undetected error rate of better than one in 107.  By requiring technical acknowledgment of a correct message receipt, along with the sensor's capability to re-interrogate, if necessary, a message delivery reliability of",
    "with the sensor's capability to re-interrogate, if necessary, a message delivery reliability of greater than 99 percent in one antenna scan is achieved.  The Mode S data link capacity exceeds the maximum data load expected to exist in the foreseeable future.",
    "## 1.2.4 Basic System Protocol",
    "As an aircraft equipped with a transponder enters the airspace served by a Mode S interrogator, it receives an ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogation which has a waveform that can be understood by both ATCRBS and Mode S transponders.  ATCRBS transponders reply with a standard ATCRBS reply format, while Mode S transponders reply with a Mode S format that includes their discrete (24-bit) Mode S address.  This address, together with location of the Mode S aircraft, is entered into a file (put on",
    "This address, together with location of the Mode S aircraft, is entered into a file (put on rollcall), and on the next scan the Mode S-equipped aircraft is discretely addressed.  Since azimuth and range are known for all aircraft on roll-call, they are interrogated according to a precomputed schedule.  Within this schedule are ATCRBS/Mode S All-Calls which permit the tracking of known ATCRBS aircraft and the acquisition of additional ATCRBS and Mode S aircraft entering the served airspace. The",
    "and the acquisition of additional ATCRBS and Mode S aircraft entering the served airspace. The discrete interrogations of a Mode S-equipped aircraft contain a command field that may lock out the Mode S transponder to further ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations",
    "(Mode S lockout).  ATCRBS interrogations originating from ATCRBS interrogators are not affected by this lockout; Mode S transponders reply to ATCRBS interrogations under all circumstances.  As a Mode S aircraft flies into airspace served by another Mode S interrogator, the first Mode S interrogator may pass position information and the aircraft's discrete address via ground lines to the interrogator now providing service.",
    "Thus, the need to unlock the Mode S transponder may be eliminated, and the second interrogator immediately schedules discrete roll-call interrogations for the aircraft.  In regions where Mode S interrogators are not connected via ground lines, a protocol exists that permits the Mode S transponder to be in a lockout state for only those interrogators which have the aircraft on roll-call.  Therefore, as the aircraft flies into airspace served by a new Mode S interrogator, the new interrogator may",
    "as the aircraft flies into airspace served by a new Mode S interrogator, the new interrogator may acquire the aircraft via its reply to an All-Call interrogation.  The Mode S-Only All-Call is used by interrogators if Mode S",
    "targets are to be acquired without eliciting replies from ATCRBS targets that may be present. The destination address of this interrogation consists of all ONEs.  All Mode S transponders will reply to this interrogation giving their discrete address.  In turn, an ATCRBS-Only All-Call is used by the interrogator if ATCRBS targets are to be acquired without eliciting replies from Mode S targets.",
    "Aircraft are tracked by the interrogator throughout its assigned airspace.  A Mode S aircraft reports in its replies either its altitude or its ATCRBS 4096 code depending on the type of discrete interrogation received.  During each scan, interrogations of ATCRBS aircraft are made in both Mode A and Mode C. If, on scanning through a Mode S-equipped aircraft's location, the interrogator does not receive a valid reply, it can re-interrogate a limited number of times.  Interrogators normally",
    "not receive a valid reply, it can re-interrogate a limited number of times.  Interrogators normally interrogate at low power and re-interrogate at high power when the low power attempt fails.",
    "Several ATCRBS/Mode S All-Call interrogations are transmitted during the time each ATCRBS target is in the beam.  Thus both ATCRBS and Mode S aircraft are served when flying through the system with a minimum of RF channel loading.",

    "--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\nAll discrete Mode S interrogations (56-bit or 112-bit) and replies (except the All-Call reply) contain the 24-bit discrete address of the Mode S transponder upon which 24 errordetecting parity check bits are overlaid.  In the All-Call reply, the 24 parity check bits are overlaid on the Mode S interrogator's address, and the transponder's discrete address is included in the clear in the text of the reply. \n\n## 1.2.5.2 Surveillance",
    "## 1.2.5.2 Surveillance\n\nThe primary function of Mode S is surveillance.  For the Mode S transponder, this function can be accomplished by use of \"short\" (56-bit) transmissions in both directions. In these transmissions, the aircraft reports its altitude or ATCRBS 4096 code as well as its flight status (airborne, on the ground, alert, Special Position Identification [SPI], etc.).",
    "There are two types of squitter transmissions, i.e., transmissions spontaneously generated by the transponder.  The short (56-bit) squitter has the format of an All-Call reply \n(DF=11) and is transmitted by a transponder approximately once every second.  This squitter is received and used by aircraft equipped with TCAS to detect the presence and 24-bit address of Mode S equipped aircraft within signal range.  The extended (112-bit)",
    "squitter (DF=17) contains the same fields as the short squitter, plus a 56-bit message field that is used to broadcast Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) data approximately four times per second.  The Extended Squitter is used by TCAS or other air-air applications, and ground ATC users for passive air and surface surveillance.",
    "\"Special surveillance\" interrogations from airborne collision avoidance systems are addressed to Mode S-equipped aircraft based upon the address extracted from squitter signals.  These interrogations are used for Mode S target tracking and collision threat assessment.",
    "## 1.2.5.3 Data Link Communications",
    "The discrete addressing and digital encoding of Mode S transmissions permit their use as a digital data link.  The interrogation and reply formats of the Mode S system contain sufficient coding space to permit the transmission of data.  Such data transmissions may be used for air traffic control purposes, air-to-air data interchange for collision avoidance, or may be used to provide flight advisory services such as weather reports, Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS), etc. Most Mode S",
    "services such as weather reports, Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS), etc. Most Mode S data link transmissions will be handled as one 56-bit message included as part of \"long\" (112-bit) interrogations or replies.  These transmissions include the message in addition to surveillance data and thus will generally be used in place of, rather than in addition to, a surveillance interrogation and/or reply. An efficient transmission of longer messages is accomplished by the extended length",
    "and/or reply. An efficient transmission of longer messages is accomplished by the extended length message (ELM) capability.  Using this capability, a sequence of up to 16 80-bit message segments (each within a 112-bit transmission) can be transmitted, either ground-to-air or air-to-ground and can be acknowledged with a single reply/interrogation.  ELMs do not contain surveillance data and thus cannot substitute for a surveillance interrogation-reply cycle.",
    "## 1.3 Operational Goals",
    "Mode S is a combined secondary surveillance radar and a potential ground-air-ground data link system capable of providing aircraft surveillance and communications necessary to support automated ATC in the dense traffic environments expected in the future.  It is capable of common-channel interoperation with the ATC beacon system and thus may be implemented over an extended ATCRBS to Mode S transition period.  In supporting ATC automation, Mode S is capable of providing the reliable",
    "S transition period.  In supporting ATC automation, Mode S is capable of providing the reliable communications necessary for data link services.",
    "## 1.4 Operational Applications\n\n \n\n## 1.4.1 The Atcrbs Environment\n\nA great majority of the combined civil and military aircraft fleets are equipped with ATCRBS transponders.  In terms of exposure to the ATC system, this implementation is estimated to be greater than 90 percent of the hours flown.",
    "Because of operating requirements, approximately one half of transponder-equipped civil aircraft have altitude reporting (Mode C) capability. Requirements for operation in high altitude airspace and in specific high density terminal control areas have caused an increase in the number of aircraft equipped with Mode C. \n\n \n\n## 1.4.2 The Mode S Environment",
    "## 1.4.2 The Mode S Environment\n\nMode S offers more options for the aircraft operator than ATCRBS.  Different levels of service may be available to satisfy varying user requirements. \n\n## 1.4.3 Mode S Transponder Levels Mode S Transponders Provide For Both Ground-To-Air And Air-To-Air Surveillance.",
    "The data link function of Mode S transponders provides for information transfer in both directions between ground and air and between airborne units.  Data link implementation varies and depends on the amount of information to be exchanged. Possible implementation configurations and additional transponder features are summarized in the following paragraphs. \n\n## 1.4.3.1 Level 1 Transponders",
    "## 1.4.3.1 Level 1 Transponders\n\nThe Level 1 Transponder supports the surveillance functions of both ATCRBS and Mode S ground sensors and the surveillance functions of airborne interrogators.  This transponder can also reply to an airborne interrogator thereby making its presence known; \nto do this, it need only handle short interrogations and replies.",

    "This subsection includes tests to verify the transponder's processing functions.  (The tests described in Subsection §2.4 verify transponder performance as a receiver and transmitter of signals.)  The nature of these processing tests is such that some means of automatically controlling, sequencing and evaluating the tests is necessary if the tests are to be practical.  It is assumed that an automatic capability is available for executing these tests.",
    "The only exception is a technique for manual testing of Mode S parity, which is included as a simple procedure for verifying the proper implementation of the parity codes.",
    "## Transponder States:",
    "Upon receipt of an interrogation, the action of a Mode S transponder is dependent upon the interrogation type and format, and the \"state\" of the transponder at the time of receipt. The address of the interrogation must be correct, the format must be one the transponder is equipped to receive, and the reply format requested must be within the capability of the transponder.  If all of the above criteria are met, and if the transponder is not locked out to the interrogator identity, the",
    "above criteria are met, and if the transponder is not locked out to the interrogator identity, the interrogation will be accepted.  The content of the reply will depend not only on the content of the interrogation but also on control inputs to the transponder, such as Alert and SPI, and on data existing at the transponder interfaces such as the altitude code and waiting messages.",
    "The overall state of a Level 1 transponder is determined by the status of 82 timers: Suppression, Lockout, Alert, SPI, and 78 selective lockout timers. Data link transponders have additional possible states defined by data link reservation timers and the condition of link protocol status registers.",
    "A Level 1 transponder could receive 256 ≈ 7x1016 different interrogation patterns, of which about 33 million must be accepted because they are of the correct address and format.  Of these, about 200 require that a correct reply, as specified in Subsection §2.2",
    "of this document, be returned.  The corresponding numbers for data link transponders are proportionally larger. Certain interrogation patterns are illogical and should never be transmitted by an interrogator.  It is also physically impossible for certain combinations of timer and register conditions to occur simultaneously in a correctly functioning transponder.",
    "However, if any illogical interrogation pattern is inadvertently transmitted, the transponder must not respond inappropriately or transition to an improper state.  Thus, tests are included to subject the transponder to specific illogical interrogation patterns to verify that it reacts as specified in Subsection §2.2.",
    "## Logic Tests:",
    "Many of the specifications of Subsection §\n2.2 involve \"sufficient condition\" logic.  That is, taken in the context of the entire document, the statement \"On receipt of PC=1 the transponder **shall** be locked out,\" means: \"If and only if PC=1, the transponder **shall** be locked out.\" The tests then must verify that PC=1 causes the lockout state, and also that other signals (some of which may include other messages in the same location used for the PC field) do not cause this state.",
    "Exhaustive tests would have to combine all possible interrogation patterns with all possible transponder states; verify that the transponder takes the specified action for specified combinations of interrogation patterns and transponder states; and verify that it takes no action for all other combinations. The number of possible state-pattern combinations makes it impossible to perform exhaustive tests within a reasonable time period.  A practical test procedure separates required tests into",
    "tests within a reasonable time period.  A practical test procedure separates required tests into two categories: Positive tests and negative tests.",
    "Positive tests verify that the transponder acts as required by the specifications in Subsection §2.2 and the accompanying flowcharts.  For example, PC=1 received in the correct format must cause lockout for the specified time. Negative tests verify that the transponder does not react to unspecified codes or patterns.  \nFor example PC=1 must not cause lockout.",
    "The positive tests included are exhaustive in the sense that every action specified in Subsection §2.2 is tested.  Negative tests have been chosen according to the seriousness of a possible malfunction.  For example, negative tests of the lockout protocol are important because a malfunction can make the transponder invisible to a sensor.  Thus, all PC codes are tested. \n\n## Tests For Data Flow:",
    "Data flow must also be verified.  However, totally exhaustive testing of data flow is not practical.  Tests for data flow cannot be clearly classified as positive or negative.  They are designed such that all connections between input and transponder action are verified. The procedures are intended to identify the most probable failure modes. Accuracy of data transfer by the transponder in either direction is verified by these tests. That is, message patterns entering must be identical with",
    "direction is verified by these tests. That is, message patterns entering must be identical with message patterns leaving the transponder.",

For this reason, each bit for a Register is cleared if data becomes unavailable (see ICAO Doc 9871, §A.2.5.4.1) and set again when data insertion into the Register resumes.   \n2.

The autopilot will try to reach this MCP/FCU selected altitude using different selectable vertical modes: constant vertical rate (e.g., V/S), Flight Level change at a given airspeed (e.g., FL CH), vertical path given by the FMS (VNAV), and maintain it using the altitude hold mode (ALT HOLD). \n--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---",

    "The Flight Management System (FMS or FMC for Flight Management Computer) is a computer onboard aircraft that controls the navigation, performance, flight planning, and guidance aspects of flight.  The FMS navigation component determines where the aircraft is.  The FMS performance component calculates necessary performance data.

This is known as FMS selected altitude.  These selected altitudes are used to control the aircraft in specific \nmodes of autopilot for example when Vertical Navigation mode (VNAV) is selected on MCP/FCU.  VNAV mode is the highest level of vertical profile automation, and maximizes fuel economy.",

    " Priority of MCP/FCU selected altitude on FMS selected altitude: \nThe MCP/FCU selected altitude is the altitude that the aircraft shall not violate and therefore it has always priority on FMS selected altitude.",
    "## Example For The Loading Of Data In Register 40Hex",
    "Hypothesis on information available to transponder The FMS selected altitude (calculated by the FMS) and the target altitude source information are available on aircraft buses (this is not necessary the case today) as well as the MCP/FCU mode bits. Bits 48 and 54 are set to 1 all the time with this hypothesis. The reverse hypothesis would require bits 48-51 and bits 54-56 to be all set to 0 and the FMS selected altitude field to be all zeroed.",
    "## Explanation Of The Different Steps In Figure B-4-1:\n\nGenerally, Figure B-4-1 shows a theoretical sequence of cases which should not be considered as a real operational sequence.  For example, some steps may be more realistic when the aircraft is in descent. \n\nStep 1: The MCP/FCU selected altitude has been set to first cleared flight level (FL100).",
    "Step 1: The MCP/FCU selected altitude has been set to first cleared flight level (FL100). \n\nThe Autopilot/Flight Director is engaged and the aircraft is holding the latest MCP/FCU selected altitude which has been reached before Step1.  The target altitude is the MCP/FCU selected altitude.  VNAV mode is not engaged.  The FMS selected altitude is not the target altitude.",
    "Step 2: A new clear flight level has been allocated to the aircraft by ATC.  The pilot has entered this value into the MCP/FCU resulting in a new MCP/FCU selected altitude. The pilot has engaged the VNAV mode.  The aircraft speed/path is determined by the FMS.  The FMS contains a flight path with an altitude restriction at a given waypoint (FL250).  The FMS selected altitude corresponds to the associated altitude restriction. This FMS selected altitude is less than the MCP/FCU selected altitude",
    "altitude restriction. This FMS selected altitude is less than the MCP/FCU selected altitude and therefore becomes the target altitude to which the aircraft is climbing.",
    "Step 3: There is an altitude restriction associated with a waypoint.  The aircraft has captured and is maintaining the FMS selected altitude until crossing the way point.  The VNAV mode remains active.  In an operational environment, aircrew should also set the MCP/FCU altitude to the intermediate levels on a stepped climb SID if workload permits.",
    "Step 4: The waypoint with restricted altitude is passed.  A new FMS selected altitude is now valid.  The aircraft resumes its climbing to try to reach this new FMS selected altitude.  VNAV mode is still engaged.  Although the aircraft is trying to reach the FMS \nselected altitude (FL350) it will level-off at the MCP/FCU selected altitude which is lower than the FMS selected altitude therefore the selected altitude is the MCP/FCU selected altitude.",
    "Step 5: The MCP/FCU selected altitude is lower than the FMS selected altitude.  The aircraft therefore first approaches this MCP/FCU selected altitude which is a limit to not violate.  This MCP/FCU altitude is captured and held by the aircraft.  This automatically disengages the VNAV mode.",
    "Step 6: The flight crew has disengaged the autopilot and is flying the aircraft manually.",
    "The target altitude is not known.  However on an operational point of view it must be noted that such mode would not be allowed in regulated airspace unless the aircrew had declared an emergency or had obtained a new ATC clearance.  In the latter case the ATC clearance should be entered in the MCP/FCU.  It is more probable that this case may happen on a \"descent when ready\" profile.  In all cases the MCP/FCU selected altitude may still be useful because it should be the value used in the",
    "cases the MCP/FCU selected altitude may still be useful because it should be the value used in the altitude alerter.",
    "Step 7: The pilot selects altitude hold (Alt Hold or equivalent mode) making the current altitude equivalent to the target altitude.  Note that although MCP/FCU selected altitude could become the same (pilot entering the new flight level in the MCP/FCU) this is not mandatory and therefore only altitude represents with full confidence the level the aircraft is maintaining.",
    "## B.4.4.1.1 Target Altitude Summary\n\nIf MCP/FCU altitude is between your current altitude and FMS Selected Altitude, then the target altitude is MCP/FCU.  If VNAV is engaged and the previous case is not in effect, then FMS is the target altitude.  If Alt Hold is selected and the current altitude is not equal to either of the selected altitudes, then target altitude is altitude. \n\n \n\n## B.4.4.1.2 Possible Uses Of Selected Altitude And Target Altitude",
    "## B.4.4.1.2 Possible Uses Of Selected Altitude And Target Altitude\n\n1. MCP/FCU selected altitude will be downlinked as an additional read-back in order to \ncheck that the cleared flight level has been correctly understood and entered in the airborne system by the pilot.   \n2. Target altitude and associated mode of flight may be of interest to reduce the Short \nTerm Conflict Alert false alarm rate.   \n \n\n## B.4.4.1.3 Target Altitude Implementation Difficulties",
    "## B.4.4.1.3 Target Altitude Implementation Difficulties\n\nIt is recognized that all information to determine which altitude is the target altitude or which mode of flight is currently used may not always be available to the transponder in the current airborne implementation.  In addition it may be very dependent on the platform.  It is therefore preferable to set to ZERO (0) the corresponding bits of Register \n4016 rather than sending wrong information.",

    "Dataflash is a service which announces the availability of information from air-to-ground on an event-triggered basis.  This is an efficient means of downlinking information which changes occasionally and unpredictably. A contract is sent to the airborne application through the Mode S transponder and the ADLP using an uplink Mode S specific protocol (MSP) (MSP 6, SR = 1) as specified in ICAO Doc 9871, Appendix A.  This uplink MSP packet contains information specifying the events which should be",

    "## C.4.10.3 Contract Request For A Transponder Register Not Serviced By The Airborne Installation",
    "On the receipt of a dataflash service request, a downlink dataflash message should immediately be announced to the ground regardless of any event criteria.  This message is used by the ground system to confirm that the service has been initiated.  The message will only consist of one segment.  In the case of a service request for an unavailable transponder register, the message sent to the ground should only contain bits 1 to 40 of the downlink message structure with a CI field value of 2.",
    "should only contain bits 1 to 40 of the downlink message structure with a CI field value of 2.  This value will indicate to the ground system that the service request cannot be honored because of the unavailability of the transponder register.

This will indicate to the ground that the transponder register is not serviced anymore.  The related contract is terminated by the airborne application, and the ground system should notify the user which",

An alternative means for the ground system to detect that the transponder register is not serviced any longer is to analyze the resulting transponder register 1016 which will be broadcast by the transponder to indicate to the ground system that transponder register",
    "1716 has changed.  The Mode S sensor should then extract transponder register 1716 and send it to the ground application.  The ground application should then analyze the content of this transponder register and should notice that the transponder register monitored by a dataflash contract is no longer supported by the airborne installation.",
    "## C.4.10.4 Service Continuity In Overlapping Coverage With Radars Using The Same Ii Code\n\nDepending on the system configuration the following guidance should be taken into account to ensure service continuity in overlapping coverage of radars working with the same II code.",
    "C.4.10.4.1 \nRadar with the dataflash application embedded in the radar software",
    "For this configuration it is necessary to manage the contract numbers which will be used by each station and to ensure that the same contract number for the same transponder register is not used by another sensor having overlapping coverage and working with the same II code.  The reason for this is that a sensor has no means of detecting if a contract it has initialized has been overwritten by another sensor using an identical dataflash header.  Also one sensor could terminate a contract",
    "by another sensor using an identical dataflash header.  Also one sensor could terminate a contract because an aircraft is leaving its coverage and no other sensor would know that this contract had been closed.  For this reason, no dataflash contract termination should be attempted by either sensor in order to ensure a service continuity. When two ground stations with overlapping coverage and having the same II code each set up dataflash contracts with the same transponder register for the same",
    "the same II code each set up dataflash contracts with the same transponder register for the same aircraft, it is essential to ensure that the contract number is checked by each ground station prior to the closeout of any AICB which is announcing a dataflash message.",
    "C.4.10.4.2 \nUse of an ATC centre-based dataflash application",
    "The ATC system hosting the dataflash application should manage the distribution of contract numbers for sensors operating with the same II code.  This ATC system will also have the global view of the aircraft path within the ATC coverage to either initiate or close dataflash contracts when appropriate.  This is the preferred configuration since a central management of the contract numbers is possible which also allows a clean termination of the contracts.",
    "C.4.10.5 \nGround management of multiple contracts for the same transponder register \nThe ground system managing the dataflash application must ensure that when it receives a request from ground applications for several contracts to monitor different parameters, or different threshold criteria, related to the same transponder register for a particular aircraft/II code pair, it assigns a unique contract number for each contract sent to the aircraft. \n\n \n\n## C.4.10.6 Service Termination",
    "## C.4.10.6 Service Termination\n\nThere are three ways to terminate a dataflash service (one from the ground initiative, two from the airborne installation):",
    "1. The ground can send an MSP with the ECS field set to 0 which means that the \nservice is to be discontinued by the airborne installation. \n2. The airborne installation will terminate the service with no indication to the ground \nsystem if any message is not extracted from the transponder by a ground interrogator \nwithin 30 seconds following the event specified in the dataflash contract (TZ timer). \n--`,``,````,`,`,``,``,````,`````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---",

When the transponder has not been selectively interrogated by a Mode S interrogator \nwith a particular II code for 60 seconds (this is determined by monitoring the IIS subfield in all accepted Mode S interrogations), all dataflash contracts related to that II code will be cancelled with no indication to the ground system.",
    "The termination from the ground initiative is the preferable way to terminate the service since both the ground and the airborne systems terminate the service thanks to a mutually understood data link exchange.  This termination should nevertheless not be allowed in certain configurations especially with adjacent sensors (with the dataflash application embedded in the sensor software) working with the same II code as explained in §C.2.1. If the termination of the contract by a ground system is",
    "the same II code as explained in §C.2.1. If the termination of the contract by a ground system is to be exercised, it should also be noticed that the ground system should anticipate the exit of the aircraft from its coverage to send the close-out message.",
    "## C.4.10.7 Dataflash Request Containing Multiple Contracts\n\nIt is possible to merge several contracts into one single dataflash request.  If multiple events occur which are related to several contracts of the initial dataflash request, one downlink message for each individual event should be triggered containing the associated transponder register.  Each of these downlink messages should use the air initiated protocol. \n\n## C.4.10.8 Transponder Register Data Contained In The Downlink Message",

The transponder register data may be up to 1 aerial scan old since the event may occur just after the illumination of the aircraft.
