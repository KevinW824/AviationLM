    "and continued to zero ground speed.\n5.3.3.5\nWithin 20 s of completion of the stop, or brake pressure release in accordance with 5.3.3.4, the \nbrake pressure shall be adjusted to the brake rated maximum parking pressure (BRPPMAX) and \nmaintained for 3 min.",

Rotation of the wheel must be resisted by a reaction force transmitted through the brake, or brakes, by an application of at least brake rated maximum  pressure \n(BRPMAX), or equivalent.  If such pressure or its equivalent is insufficient to prevent rotation, the",
    "friction surface may be clamped, bolted, or otherwise restrained while applying the pressure. The brake wear condition imposing the greatest wheel load shall be used for this test. \n5.3.4.2\nFor landing gears with only one wheel per landing gear strut, the torque load is 1.2 x  wheel rated radial load (S) x wheel rated tire loaded radius (R).\n5.3.4.3",

The pistons shall be adjusted so that 25,000 cycles are performed at each of the four positions where the pistons would be at rest when adjusted for 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the wear limit. The brake shall also be subjected to 5000 cycles of the brake rated maximum pressure (BRPMAX).",
    "For rotorcraft, 50,000 cycles of application and release of brake rated design landing pressure \n(BRPDL) are required with 12,500 cycles at each wear limit position. The brake should then be subjected to 2500 cycles of the brake rated maximum pressure (BRPMAX)\n\n5.4.2    (Continued):\nLeakage at static seals shall not exceed a trace. Leakage at moving seals shall not exceed one drop per inch of peripheral length at each condition of wear limit or 5 cc total.",
