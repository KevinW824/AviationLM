    "MHz) and L5 (1176.45 MHz) frequencies with a double-sided bandwidth as indicated in Table 2-1. These signals may be augmented by other systems/equipment/techniques as appropriate to meet the performance requirements for enroute, terminal, non-precision, and precision approach phases of flight and surface operations.  An active antenna is one integrated with a preamplifier.",
    "Section 1.0 of this document provides information and assumptions needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated in the remaining sections.  It describes typical equipment applications and operational goals, and forms the basis for the standards stated in Sections 2.0 through 4.0. Section 2.0 contains the minimum performance standards for the equipment.  These standards define required performance under standard operating conditions and stressed",
    "These standards define required performance under standard operating conditions and stressed physical environmental conditions.

The GNSS also includes ICAO SARPS compliant Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) and Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS).",
    "This antenna MOPS is applicable to the GPS L1 and L5 frequencies [RD2, RD3] as well as the Galileo E1 and E5a [RD1] frequencies. Details on multiband antennas that receive the GLONASS signals are listed in Appendix B. However, reception of signals from the GLONASS constellation is not covered by the requirements listed in this MOPS.",
    "Appendix B is included for informational purposes alone and is not intended to be invoked as part of any TSO that may reference this MOPS. Any references made to constellations other than GLONASS in Appendix B are superseded by the relevant sections in the main body of this antenna MOPS.",
    "## 1.3 Operational Applications\n\nThe GNSS active antenna equipment is intended to be used in all phases of aircraft operation, including on the surface, approach and landing, departure, terminal, and enroute. \n\n## 1.4 Intended Function",
    "The airborne GNSS navigation system can be used as a means of navigation system in an aircraft when approved and an operational GNSS navigation satellite system is available. Incorporated within these standards are equipment characteristics that should be useful to users, designers, manufacturers, and installers of the equipment.  This document defines the performance for antennas that will be used with GNSS receiver equipment in the L1",
    "and L5 frequency bands. Throughout this document, the terms L1 and L5 frequencies are used to denote the GNSS signals with center frequencies and bandwidths as described in Table 2-1.",
    "## 1.5 Operational Goals\n\nThe operational goal for the GNSS antenna is to provide adequate GNSS satellite signals under a wide range of environmental conditions and installations that will assure safe flight operations.

    "## 1.7 Test Procedures\n\nThe test procedures specified in this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the performance requirements.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred.  These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures.",
    "The order of tests specified suggests that the antenna be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design, and design qualification, into operational use.  For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2.0 need to be demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed systems tests of Section 3.0. \n\nFour types of test procedures are specified.  These include: \n\n## A. Environmental Tests",
    "Environmental test requirements are specified in Section 2.3.  The procedures and their associated limit requirements are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the antenna under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations.

    "## B. Bench Tests\n\nBench Test procedures are specified in Section 2.4.  These tests provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Section 2.2.  Test results may be used by antenna manufacturers as design guidance, for monitoring compliance, and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of antenna design.  \n\n## C. Installed Equipment Tests",
    "Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included in the installed antenna tests, their successful completion is a precondition to completion of the installed tests.  In certain instances, however, installed antenna tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from, or to, other antenna installed on the aircraft, etc.  Installed tests are normally performed under two conditions:",
    "i.With the aircraft on the ground and using simulated or operational system inputs. \nii.With the aircraft in flight using operational system inputs appropriate to the antenna \nunder test. \nTest results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the intended operational environment. \n\n## D. Operational Tests",
    "## D. Operational Tests\n\nThe operational tests are specified in Section 2.4.

    "According to the FAA, Service and Equipment Profile (FSEP) data of inventory of NAS Operational Infrastructure, there are 908 DME facilities in the CONUS, 51 in Alaska and 9 in Hawaii.  In addition, there are a total of 668 Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) systems of which 31 in Alaska, and 10 in Hawaii.  TACAN operates in the frequency band of 960- 1215 MHz.  While the FSEP database is not accessible for public use, anyone can obtain information on specific navigation aid facility through",

    "The closest on-board DME channel to the E5/L5 band is 126X/Y, which has a center frequency of 1150 MHz. This channel has a distance of 16 MHz to the band edge of the E5/L5 band at 1166 MHz, and a distance of 26.45 MHz to the carrier frequency of E5A/L5 of 1176.45 MHz. Except during acquisition, the maximum rate at which an airborne DME",
    "interrogator can generate pulse pairs is assumed to be 48 pulse pairs per second. During acquisition, DME interrogators employ higher transmission rates, as high as 150 pulse pairs per second, for brief intervals.",
    "The performance specifications for interrogators EUROCAE ED-54 and RTCA DO-189 \nlimit their peak power to 2 kW (63 dBm). The peak power in any 0.5 MHz bandwidth channel more than 2 MHz from the channel on which the airborne interrogator is transmitting is required to be at least 38 dB below that (63 dBm - 38 dB = 25 dBm). This results in a peak level of -15 dBm for an assumed isolation between antenna ports of E5/L5 and DME antennas of 40 dB. \n\nThis Page Intentionally Left Blank",
