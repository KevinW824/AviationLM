    "In some instances it will be practical to use image recordings of sufficient resolution to record information that is not readily available to the ADRS or CARS (e.g. secondary displays, pilot's selections, data link messages or weather radar).

The use of image recordings is considered an acceptable means of compliance when it is the",

    "iii. \nPilot's Privacy Issues",
    "Misuse and privacy issues with respect to recorded voices, images and to some extent data, remain of significant concern to the aviation community.

    "While accident investigators recognise and share the privacy and misuse concerns, the need to record the image of the general cockpit environment is nonetheless considered fundamental.

    "IV-6.1 \nINTRODUCTION \nThis chapter specifies ADRS installation characteristics and performance with procedures for verifying that performance when the system is installed in an aircraft. Installed performance criteria are generally the same as those contained in Chapter II- 3, which were verified through bench and environmental tests. However, certain performance parameters may be affected by the physical installation and can only be confirmed after installation.",
    "IV-6.2 \nGENERAL",
    "A schedule of tests should be prepared by the equipment installer. For the prototype installation, a comprehensive programme of tests should be performed, as described in paragraphs IV-6.3 and IV-6.4. Following the testing of each new DLRS installation, the recording so obtained shall be evaluated to confirm adequate message recording accuracy and synchronisation with other recording devices both on the aircraft and on the ground. Similarly it will be necessary to evaluate recording obtained",
    "on the aircraft and on the ground. Similarly it will be necessary to evaluate recording obtained from in-service flying to ensure this accuracy is maintained and the system has sufficient capacity to preserve all messages received over the required recording duration.",
    "NOTE: \nThe recording performance test can be conducted in a laboratory environment or in the real aircraft environment.",
    "An analysis shall be performed by the equipment installer to identify the \"subsystems\" where the serviceability or accuracy could be degraded and remain undetected. Maintenance tasks shall take account of this analysis by requiring the appropriate calibration checks at suitable intervals. During introduction to service of a new component in the DLRS, in order to test the correct operation of the overall recording system, a scenario has to be developed.

In the course of the scenario, one or more procedures, involving the pilots of an aircraft, a ground station such as an ATC centre (or a simulation thereof) should be exercised.
