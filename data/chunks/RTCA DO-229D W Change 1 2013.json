    "This document contains minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) for airborne navigation equipment (2D and 3D) using the Global Positioning System (GPS) augmented by Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS); which, in the U.S. is the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).   DO-229 only provides standards for single frequency airborne navigation equipment.  A separate document will be created in the future to address standards for dual frequency equipment.   These standards are intended",
    "in the future to address standards for dual frequency equipment.   These standards are intended to be applicable to other SBAS providers, such as European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and Japan's Multi-functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) Satellite-based Augmentation System (MSAS). In this document, the term \"shall\" is used to indicate requirements.  An approved design should comply with every requirement, which can be assured by inspection, test, analysis, or",
    "design should comply with every requirement, which can be assured by inspection, test, analysis, or demonstration.  The term \"must\" is used to identify items that are important but are either duplicated somewhere else in the document as a \"shall\", or are considered to be outside the scope of this document.  The term \"should\" is used to denote a recommendation that would improve the SBAS equipment, but does not constitute a requirement.",

    "The standards define minimum performance, functions and features for SBAS-based sensors that provide position information to a multi-sensor system or separate navigation system.  They also address SBAS-based Area Navigation (RNAV) equipment to be used for the en route, terminal, and Lateral Navigation (LNAV) phases of flight. These standards are based upon a nominal allocation of the aircraft-level requirements in RTCA/DO-236B, Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards: Required Navigation",
    "requirements in RTCA/DO-236B, Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards: Required Navigation Performance for Area Navigation, accounting for the unique issues associated with SBAS and GNSS navigation service and minimizing the need for pilot training.

    "(LNAV/VNAV), Localizer Performance without vertical guidance (LP), and Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance (LPV) instrument procedures.  The standards cover SBAS-based equipment that is designed to serve combinations of the above phases of flight.

    "satisfactorily perform its intended functions under conditions encountered in routine aeronautical operations, and will ensure a basic compatibility with the requirements defined in RTCA/DO-236B.

The",
    "these RNAV standards, but are not expected to be eligible for a Class Gamma TSO authorization. The regulatory application of these standards is the responsibility of appropriate government agencies. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has published a Technical Standard Order (TSO) for GPS/WAAS equipment to reference the requirements and bench test procedures in Section 2.",
    "The word \"equipment\", as used in this document, includes all components or units necessary (as determined by the equipment manufacturer or installer) to properly perform its intended function. For example, the airborne \"equipment\" may include:",
    "sensor(s), a computer unit, an input-output unit that interfaces with existing aircraft displays/systems, a control unit, a display, shock mount(s), etc. In the case of this example, all of the foregoing components or units constitute the \"equipment\".  It should not be inferred from this example, however, that all GPS/SBAS navigation equipment will necessarily include all of the foregoing components or units.

The turn radius is defined among a small set of predetermined values: 22.5 NM above FL195 (High altitude) and 15.0 NM at or below FL195 as defined in ICAO RGCSP \"Guidance material for RNP\" document. The parameters necessary to define a fixed radius turn are the definition of the transition waypoint and the fixed path transition requirement associated with the route or transition.",
    "Note: This type of turn may be used to space two parallel routes close together.  When \nthis is used, the turn will be published and denoted as a high altitude or low altitude turn.

When the final waypoint in the flight plan is the active waypoint, the equipment shall automatically switch to \"FROM\" operation at the active waypoint.",

    "Bench testing of some requirements necessitate test conditions where the simulated aircraft position (RF signals output from the simulator) differs from the active Gamma equipment flight plan.  For example, to test nonnumeric display deviations of aircraft position, the simulated output positions from the simulator deviate from the processed flight plan.  This difference will provide an aircraft course deviation from the flight plan and permit verification of appropriate display requirements.",

    "The Space-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) uses satellites (initially geostationary satellites (GEOs)) to broadcast Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) integrity and correction data to GNSS users.  The GEOs also provide a ranging signal that augments the GNSS, which is made up of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS) systems. This appendix defines the service to be provided by the SBAS.  It provides specifications for SBAS ranging signal",
    "defines the service to be provided by the SBAS.  It provides specifications for SBAS ranging signal characteristics, and contents and format for SBAS integrity and corrections data.  This appendix also defines certain user equipment functions necessary to correctly interpret and apply SBAS data.",
    "## A.2 Signal Characteristics\n\nThe signal broadcast via the SBAS GEOs to the SBAS users is designed to minimize standard GPS receiver hardware modifications.  The GPS frequency and GPS-type of modulation, including a Coarse/Acquisition (C/A) PRN code, will be used.  In addition, the code phase timing will be maintained close to GPS time to provide a ranging capability. \n\n## A.2.1 Carrier Frequency\n\nThe SBAS broadcast will consist of a single carrier frequency of 1575.42 MHz (GPS L1).",
    "The SBAS broadcast will consist of a single carrier frequency of 1575.42 MHz (GPS L1). \n\n## A.2.2 Spurious Transmissions\n\nSpurious transmissions will be at least 40 dB below the unmodulated carrier power over all frequencies.   \n\n## A.2.3 Modulation",

    "GPS-type modulation will be used for the code and the data.  Message symbols at a rate of 500 symbols per second (sps) will be added modulo-2 to a 1023-bit PN code, which will then be bi-phase shift-keyed (BPSK) modulated onto the carrier at a rate of 1.023 M- chips per second.  Code/carrier coherence will be maintained as described in Section A.2.6.4.  Code/data coherence will be maintained as described in [1].  The 500 sps will be synchronized with the 1 kHz C/A code epochs.",
    "## A.2.4 Carrier Phase Noise\n\nThe phase noise spectral density of the unmodulated carrier will be such that a phase locked loop of 10 Hz one-sided noise bandwidth will be able to track the carrier to an accuracy of 0.1 radians rms. \n\n## A.2.5 Signal Spectrum",
    "## A.2.5 Signal Spectrum\n\nThe broadcast signal will be at the GPS L1 frequency of 1575.42 MHz.  At least 95% of the broadcast power will be contained within a 12 MHz band centered at the L1 frequency.  The bandwidth of the signal transmitted by a SBAS satellite will be at least 2.2 MHz. \n\n## A.2.6 Signal Characteristics Modified Relative To Gps A.2.6.1 Doppler Shift",
    "## A.2.6 Signal Characteristics Modified Relative To Gps A.2.6.1 Doppler Shift\n\nThe Doppler shift, as perceived by a stationary user, on the signal broadcast by SBAS \nGEOs will be less than 40 meters per second ( Hz at L1).  The Doppler shift is due to the relative motion of the GEO.",
    "Note: The maximum Doppler shift is provided to bound acquisition time and should not otherwise be used as an indication of validity of the GEO signal. Furthermore, Doppler shifts experienced at high latitudes and from a GEO in a high inclination orbit may be as large as ±450 Hz. Equipment operating in areas where the Doppler shift exceeds ±210 Hz may not meet SBAS satellite acquisition requirements that specify a time constraint. \n\n## A.2.6.2 Carrier Frequency Stability",
    "## A.2.6.2 Carrier Frequency Stability\n\nThe short-term stability of the carrier frequency (square root of the Allan Variance) at the input of the user's receiver antenna will be better than 510-11  over 1 to 10 seconds, excluding the effects of the ionosphere and Doppler. \n\n## A.2.6.3 Polarization\n\nThe broadcast signal will be right-handed circularly polarized.  The ellipticity will be no worse than 2 dB for the angular range of 9.1 from boresight.",
    "## A.2.6.4 Code/Carrier Frequency Coherence\n\nThe lack of coherence between the broadcast carrier phase and the code phase will be limited.

Over the long term (< 100 seconds), the difference between the change in the broadcast code phase, converted to carrier cycles by multiplying the number of code chips by 1540, and the change in the broadcast carrier phase, in cycles, will be within one carrier cycle, one sigma.  This does not include code/carrier divergence due to ionospheric refraction in the downlink propagation path.",
    "## A.2.6.5 User Received Signal Levels\n\nThe received radiated power level into a 0 dBi Right-Hand-Circularly-Polarized (RHCP) antenna from a SBAS GEO on or near the surface of the earth will be greater than -131 dBm at elevation angles greater than 5 degrees.  The maximum received power level will be -119.5 dBm in such an antenna. \n\n## A.2.6.6 Correlation Loss",
    "## A.2.6.6 Correlation Loss\n\nCorrelation loss is defined as the ratio of output powers from a perfect correlator for two cases: 1) the actual received SBAS signal correlated against a perfect unfiltered PN reference, or 2) a perfect unfiltered PN signal normalized to the same total power as the SBAS signal in case 1, correlated against a perfect unfiltered PN reference.",

    "## A.2.6.7 Maximum Code Phase Deviation\n\nThe maximum uncorrected code phase of the broadcast signal will not deviate from the equivalent SBAS Network Time by more than can be accommodated by the GEO time correction provided in the GEO Navigation Message (2-20 seconds).  The maximum corrected code phase deviation will be limited in accordance with the overall signal-inspace performance requirements. \n\n## A.3 Sbas C/A Codes A.3.1 Requirements",
    "## A.3 Sbas C/A Codes A.3.1 Requirements\n\nThe following is the definition of the C/A codes (herein called the SBAS codes) to be used by SBAS GEOs broadcasting a GPS look-alike signal.  The requirements imposed on these selected codes are as follows:",
    "a) They must belong to the same family of 1023-bit Gold codes as the 37 C/A \ncodes reserved by the GPS system and specified in the Navstar Global Positioning System Interface Specification (IS-GPS-200D) [1].  The first 32 are assigned to GPS satellites, while the last 5 (of which two are the same) are reserved for other uses. \nb) They must not adversely interfere with GPS signals. \n\n## A.3.2 Identification Of Sbas Codes\n\nThe SBAS codes are identified in three ways:",
    "## A.3.2 Identification Of Sbas Codes\n\nThe SBAS codes are identified in three ways: \n\na) PRN number, b) G2 delay in chips, c) Initial G2 state \nThe definition of either the G2 delay or initial G2 setting is required for implementation of the generation of the selected codes.

The parameter, 2\nGIVE, is the variance of a Normal distribution associated with the residual ionospheric vertical error at an IGP for an L1 signal. \n\n## A.4.2 Principles And Assumptions",
    "Certain principles and assumptions are used as a guide in the definition of the format and data contents.  First of all, the signal data bandwidth should have the necessary capacity to broadcast both integrity and corrections data simultaneously for the entire service region.  Next, information common to both the integrity and corrections data should not be repeated in order to minimize the required data rate.  Note that the delivered level of accuracy can be controlled by adjusting the",
    "required data rate.  Note that the delivered level of accuracy can be controlled by adjusting the accuracy of the corrections, but integrity is always provided.",
    "## A.4.2.1 Data Rate",
    "The baseline data rate will be 250 bits per second.  The data will always be rate 1/2 convolutional encoded with a Forward Error Correction (FEC) code.  Therefore, the symbol rate that the SBAS receiver must process is 500 symbols per second (sps).  The convolutional coding will be constraint length 7 as standard for Viterbi decoding, with a convolutional encoder logic arrangement as illustrated in Figure A-3.  The G1 symbol is selected on the output as the first half of a 4 millisecond data",
    "in Figure A-3.  The G1 symbol is selected on the output as the first half of a 4 millisecond data bit period.  (If soft decision decoding is used, the bit error rate (BER) performance gain of this combination of coding and decoding is 5 dB over uncoded operation.)  As an example, the algorithms for the implementation of this decoding are described in George C. Clark and J. Bibb Cain, Error Correction Coding for Digital Communications, Plenum Press, New York, 1981 [2].",

If corrections are not applied, then the solution will be with respect to a composite GPS/SBAS Network Time, and the resulting accuracy will be affected by the difference between the two.  SBAS Network Time will be within 50 nanoseconds of GPS system time.  Estimates of the time difference between SBAS Network Time and Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) and GLONASS system time will be provided in an appropriate data message (Type 12).",

    "There will be two types of correction data - fast and long-term.  The fast corrections are intended to correct for rapidly changing errors such as GNSS clock errors, while the long-term corrections are for slower changing errors due to the atmospheric and long term satellite clock and ephemeris errors.

    "the users are provided with ephemeris and clock error estimates for each satellite in view (Message Types 24 and 25).  Although long term satellite clock errors are common to all regions, they are slow-varying and Issue of Data (IOD) dependent.  Therefore, they are best accommodated as part of the slower corrections.  Separately, users are provided with a wide-area ionospheric delay model and sufficient real-time data to evaluate the ionospheric delays for each satellite using that model",

    "The principle of integrity protection resides in the presence of a CRC for each data block.  The CRC is added to the data block when it is generated.  The airborne equipment verifies the data integrity by generating the CRC as part of the procedure design process and comparing it to the CRC of the data block supplied by the authority. A perfect match indicates the data is not corrupted and can be used.  The use of a CRC",
    "provides a theoretical bound on the probability of undetected error of  2-r, where r is the number of bits of the CRC.  For this format a 32 bit CRC is used.  The corresponding upper bound for the 32 bit code is 2.3283 x 10-10.  The CRC, CRC-32Q(Q for Qualcomm) was chosen [1].  It has proven well behaved at all the bit error rates for message length of the same order magnitude as the ones likely to occur for the data blocks. ILS and MLS certifying authorities commission ground installations and",
    "occur for the data blocks. ILS and MLS certifying authorities commission ground installations and create approach procedures for landing using the facility.  The integrity is ensured by proper alignment of the transmitting antennas, flight checks and integrity monitors on the transmitted signal. For approaches based on data, the integrity of the approach rests on the data describing the approach path.  Likewise the integrity is ensured by the certifying authorities when they issue the data",
    "path.  Likewise the integrity is ensured by the certifying authorities when they issue the data block for use.  They design the approach procedure, calculate the parameters, organize the data block and calculate the CRC.

The integrity is ensured when the airborne equipment making use of the data successfully passes the CRC on the data block.  It is allowed to reformat the data blocks for the purpose",

However the on-board equipment must be able to recover the original format bit-for-bit without any exception. The original CRC should be transferred as is without any transformation.",
    "## D.6.2 Approach Path Selection\n\nAnother element key to the integrity of approaches based on data is the approach selection.  The CRC verification does not guarantee that the proper approach has been selected.  It is the responsibility of the pilot to verify proper approach path selection. This may be accomplished through the approach identifier, or a combination of the airport, runway, and route indicators. \n\n## D.6.3 Data Block Generation",
    "The data generation typically starts with a precise survey of both ends of the runway to be served. The geodetic coordinates are based on the WGS-84 system.  The landing threshold point/fictitious threshold point (LTP/FTP) and flight path alignment point (FPAP) are determined from these surveyed points, and will usually be coincident with the runway threshold at both runway ends.  The TCH and glidepath angle are determined by the obstacle avoidance criteria in use for the operations to be",

Once the FPAP geodetic coordinates are determined, the FPAP position can be expressed by the difference of coordinates with respect to the LTP/FTP.

For the calculations onboard the aircraft and for the procedure",
    "the lateral deviation reference.  For the calculations onboard the aircraft and for the procedure designer, the FPAP is defined to be at the same ellipsoid height as for the LTP/FTP. The data block is then finalized by adding the other data and by calculating the CRC.",
    "The data block is then entered into flight inspection equipment for validation. The authorities fly the approach and validate the data and CRC.  They must also ensure that the data to be published on the approach plates correspond to the data block. The data is then issued to the industry for distribution. \n\n## D.6.4 Database Formatting And Distribution",
    "Data blocks need to be transferred to the data providers preferably on electronic media. A transportation layer compatible with the media must be defined. A standard textual-based version of the binary data needs to be defined to be able to share data whenever transfer of the binary data block is not possible.  Care must be taken to ensure that transformation to and from binary and textual format can be done such that every bit can be recovered.  This ensures a successful CRC. The same",

There should be no transformation that truncates or rounds numbers.  In addition, the original CRC must be transferred unchanged throughout the distribution",
    "numbers.  In addition, the original CRC must be transferred unchanged throughout the distribution chain.

    "One of the most important considerations as the NAS evolves from a station-referenced navigation system to an earth-referenced navigation system is the earth model (datum) used for Aviation Information Publications (AIPs) and air navigation systems.  This appendix describes the geometry of the WGS-84 ellipsoid, and defines the geodetic latitude and longitude of a point on that ellipsoid.  An example algorithm is then given for solving the following, which is called the inverse problem of",
    "example algorithm is then given for solving the following, which is called the inverse problem of geodesy: Given the geodetic latitude and longitude of two points on the WGS-84 ellipsoid, find the range and bearing of the shortest path between them. This path is called a geodesic. A related problem is the direct problem of geodesy: Given the departure geodetic latitude and longitude, the geodesic path length, and the departure bearing on the WGS-84 ellipsoid, find the arrival latitude,",
    "geodesic path length, and the departure bearing on the WGS-84 ellipsoid, find the arrival latitude, longitude and bearing. The corresponding problem on the surface of a sphere has the following well-known and elementary solution.  Suppose that one is given a pair of distinct, nonantipodal points on the surface of a sphere.  (Recall that two (distinct) points on the surface of an ellipsoid are said to be antipodal if they are located symmetrically with respect to the center of the ellipsoid).",
    "to be antipodal if they are located symmetrically with respect to the center of the ellipsoid). Then these two points, together with the center of the sphere, determine a plane.  This plane intersects the surface of the sphere in two circular arcs which together form a circle called a great circle.  The shorter of these two circular arcs is the shortest path on the surface of the sphere  that joins the prescribed points. For two antipodal points on the surface of a sphere, there are infinitely",
    "the prescribed points. For two antipodal points on the surface of a sphere, there are infinitely many planes that contain both of those points and which also contain, the center of the sphere.  Any of the circular arcs determined by the intersection of one of these planes with the surface of the sphere will be a geodesic.  Hence, the problem does not have a unique solution in this case.",
    "On a nonspherical, ellipsoid, the situation is considerably different.  (It is therefore inappropriate to refer to geodesics on a nonspherical ellipsoid as \"great circles\").  In particular, the only geodesics that are plane curves are those that lie along a meridian or along the equator [1].  Furthermore, the geodesic can in general be computed to an arbitrary level of accuracy only iteratively.  The iterative algorithms presented here were published in [2], and will yield accuracy to within",
    "The iterative algorithms presented here were published in [2], and will yield accuracy to within fractions of a millimeter if the termination criterion",
    " is taken to be 10-12 (unless the two points are antipodal, or nearly antipodal.  The geodesic is nonunique or highly sensitive to small changes in the problem data, respectively, in that case).  This accuracy is generally obtained in no more than six iterations.  Compared to \"closed-form\" approximate solutions, such as that in [3], the algorithm presented here is simpler to implement in software.  Further discussion of various algorithms may be found in [4].",
    "## L.2 Definitions Of Terms",
    "Throughout this appendix, the term ellipsoid will specifically refer to an ellipsoid of revolution, obtained by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis.  The points at which the minor axis intersects the surface of the ellipsoid are called the North and South poles.  The plane which passes through the center of the ellipsoid and which is normal to the minor axis is called the equatorial plane.  The equatorial plane intersects the surface of the ellipsoid in a circle, called the equator. The",
    "The equatorial plane intersects the surface of the ellipsoid in a circle, called the equator. The geodetic latitude of a point on an ellipsoid is the angle between the equatorial plane and the outward normal vector at that point on the ellipsoid.  This angle is taken to be positive in the Northern Hemisphere and negative in the Southern Hemisphere. Any plane that is orthogonal to the equatorial plane and that passes through the center of the ellipsoid intersects the surface of the ellipsoid in",
    "and that passes through the center of the ellipsoid intersects the surface of the ellipsoid in an ellipse, called a meridian.  One of these meridians is arbitrarily selected as a reference, and is called the Greenwich meridian. The longitude of a point on the ellipsoid is determined by the angle between the plane that contains the meridian passing through that point, and the plane which contains the Greenwich meridian.  (The longitude of either pole is undefined).  Longitude is customarily",
    "the Greenwich meridian.  (The longitude of either pole is undefined).  Longitude is customarily expressed in degrees, measured Eastward from the Greenwich meridian. A curve that is traversed in a specified direction is said to be oriented.  The bearing of an oriented smooth curve on an ellipsoid describes the direction of the tangent vector to that curve, at a particular point on that curve.  Bearing is usually expressed in degrees, measured clockwise from local North.  (Local (true) North at a",

The reason is that the EGM-96 model integrity has not been established in these MOPS. Establishing the integrity of the EGM-96 model and establishing the equivalence between EGM-96 and the QNH pressure altitude is beyond the scope of these MOPS. Despite this, the EGM-96 model is a reasonable",

NASA anticipates releasing an update to the Earth Gravitational Model in the fall of 2006 that will be EGM-06.  The 1996 Model will still be maintained on the website listed above along with the 2006 version.  Either EGM-96 or EGM-06 can be used as a reasonable approximation to the MSL altitude.",

    "Aircraft altitude may be obtained from a pressure altimeter, a radar altimeter, or a GPS/SBAS sensor. Although these instruments produce an altitude measurement, they are not measurements of the same fundamental quantity and therefore, these measurements cannot be used inter-changeably. As mentioned above, the primary altitude instrument in the aircraft is the pressure altimeter, the SBAS sensor altitude is not recognized at this time as the primary altitude sensor.",

    "surface is done by measuring the earth's gravity with satellites and developing a mathematical model of an average and constant gravity surface. This constant gravity surface defines the MSL zero-altitude surface and is referred to as the geoid. The geoid is a complicated surface and is described by formidable set of functions and is provided by the above referenced website.",

    "a) QNH mode: the standard pressure altitude is corrected using local correction \ndata, typically from a nearby weather station, usually located at the destination airport \nb) QNE mode: the standard setting of 29.92 in.Hg (1013.2 millibars) is used as the \nMSL zero altitude (the standard atmospheric model) \nc) QFE mode: the altimeter is set to read zero when on the airport surface thereby \nshowing height above the airfield.",
    "At and above a transition altitude, all aircraft use the standard QNE altimeter setting, and altitudes are termed flight levels (FL). For example, 29,000 ft becomes FL290. The transition altitude in United States airspace is 18,000 ft (FL180) or 5500 m. Regardless of how the actual air pressure changes in the atmosphere, the QNE barometric altitude has the same definition (and conversion from air pressure to altitude) for all aircraft. Note that QNE altitude is not true MSL altitude. However,",

    "## N.1.4 Radar Altitude\n\nAll radar altimeters measure the smallest range between the terrain immediately below the aircraft and the aircraft radar altimeter antenna. The radar altimeter is intended for instrument approaches that require accurate height above the landing runway threshold. Most radar altimeters do not operate at heights greater than 2500 ft (750 m) above ground. \n\n## N.1.5 Gps Altitude",
