Additional requirements have been derived by analysis of operational intent and direct allocation of",
    "requirements have been derived by analysis of operational intent and direct allocation of performance requirements between airborne and ground systems.  Throughout this document, the term \"LAAS\" is used as a generic reference to ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS) as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as the requirements in this standard are intended to comply with the ICAO",
    "Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for the GBAS aircraft element.",
    "Note: \nAt the time of this writing, the ICAO SARPs (through Amendment 82) \nhave not been updated to include requirements for GBAS to support a type of service appropriate for conducting CAT II/III operations. Consequently, some requirements in this MOPS are beyond the \nrequirements in the SARPs.",
    "requirements in the SARPs. \nThe standards in this document define minimum performance requirements, functions and features for LAAS airborne equipment to support multiple types of service that are intended to support precision approach operations for all weather minimums.  This standard also covers the computation and output of position, velocity, and time (PVT) to support area navigation and other applications.",
    "Note: \nThe requirements for area navigation systems continue to evolve.  \nApplicable \nstandards \ninclude \nRTCA/DO-236(), \nRTCA/DO-229(), \nRTCA/DO-187() [as amended by TSO-C115()] and RTCA/DO-208() [as amended by TSO-C129()]. \nCompliance with these standards by manufacturers, installers and users is recommended as a means of assuring that the equipment will satisfactorily perform its intended functions under conditions encountered in routine aeronautical operations.",
    "The regulatory application of these standards is the responsibility of appropriate government agencies.  In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has published two Technical Standard Orders (TSO) for GPS/LAAS equipment, one for the LAAS VHF Data Broadcast (VDB) receiver function (TSO-C162) and another for the LAAS Position And Navigation (PAN) function",
    "(TSO-C161).  The FAA plans to update these TSOs.  These updated TSOs will continue to reflect the requirements in this MOPS consistent with supporting Category I approaches and the positioning service only.  Requirements for Airborne Equipment Class D will be addressed by a subsequent TSO revision or an additional TSO after validation of these requirements. The word \"equipment\", as used in this document, includes all components or units necessary (as determined by the equipment manufacturer or",
    "includes all components or units necessary (as determined by the equipment manufacturer or installer) to properly perform its intended function.",
    "In this document, the term \"shall\" is used to indicate requirements.  An approved design would comply with every requirement, which can be assured by inspection, test, analysis, or demonstration.  The term \"must\" is used to identify items which are important but are either duplicated somewhere else in the document as a \"shall\", or are considered to be outside the scope of this document.",
    "The term \"should\" is used to denote a recommendation that would improve the LAAS equipment, but does not constitute a minimum requirement.",
    "This document facilitates traceability by identifying each specific requirement with a requirement designator.  The notation \"*[LAAS-xxx]*\", where xxx is a threedigit number, identifies each specific requirement for traceability purposes.",
    "Section 1 of this document provides information and assumptions needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated in the remaining sections.  It describes typical equipment applications and operational goals and forms the basis for the standards stated in Sections 2 \nthrough 4.",
    "Section 2 contains the equipment performance requirements and test procedures for the VDB receiver function and the PAN function.  These standards define required performance under standard operating conditions and stressed physical environmental conditions.",
    "Section 3 describes those additional requirements and tests that ensure that the LAAS equipment performs its intended function in a particular installation. Tests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. \n\nSection 4 describes the characteristics of installed LAAS equipment, and the expected pilot reactions to specified displays.",

It also indicates requirements that have been added. \n\nAppendix C contains an example of Final Approach Path and deviation calculations. \n\nAppendix D defines the GPS interference environment for which the PAN \nequipment is required to operate.",
    "Appendix E is reserved. Appendix F is reserved. Appendix G defines rotorcraft specific requirements for LAAS equipment. Appendix H discusses test considerations. Appendix I discusses GBAS Approach Service Types, Facility Classifications, Airborne Equipment Classifications, and Approach Facility Classifications. \n\nAppendix J gives an example of how airborne geometry screening requirements can be derived based on ground monitor requirements and airplane performance for one airplane integration.",
    "## 1.2 System Overview\n\nThe GPS/LAAS consists of three primary subsystems as shown in Figure 1-1:",
    "a) \nThe satellite subsystem, which produces ranging signals.  This standard \nexplicitly addresses the use of GPS and Satellite Based Augmentation \nSystem (SBAS) satellites. \nb) \nThe ground subsystem, which provides a VDB containing differential corrections and other pertinent information. \nc)",
    "c) \nThe airborne subsystem, which encompasses the aircraft equipment used to receive and process the GPS/LAAS signal in space in order to compute and output a position solution, deviations relative to a desired reference path, and appropriate annunciations.",
    "##",
    "The GPS and SBAS satellites provide both the airborne subsystem and the ground subsystem with ranging signals.  The ground subsystem produces groundmonitored differential corrections and integrity-related information as well as data including the definition of the final approach path, a geometric path-in-space to which the aircraft on approach will navigate.  The final approach path is a straight line that extends indefinitely; other paths may be defined in the future.",
    "These data are transmitted on a VDB to the airborne subsystem.  The data and format of the data provided via the VDB are defined in RTCA/DO-246(), GNSS- Based Precision Approach Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) Signal-in- Space Interface Control Document (ICD).",
    "The airborne subsystem uses the GPS/LAAS signal in space to calculate a differentially corrected position estimate and generate deviation signals with respect to the final approach path.  These deviations are formatted as angular measurements from reference surfaces similar to the deviations currently provided by ILS receivers.  In addition, provisions have been made for rectilinear deviations, to support new and more advanced airplane integrations.  The airborne subsystem also provides",
    "to support new and more advanced airplane integrations.  The airborne subsystem also provides appropriate annunciation of system status and performance (e.g., alerts) and a position-velocity-time (PVT) output.",
    "Note: \nThe interface for the minimum equipment is specified with angular \ndeviations that are intended to mimic current ILS outputs.  This is done to facilitate integration of LAAS equipment into existing airplanes with a minimum of disruption. \n\n## 1.3 Operational Goals",
    "The operational goal of LAAS as specified in this document is to augment GPS to satisfy the requirements to support all categories of precision approach operations, area navigation in the terminal area, and automatic dependent surveillance.  It is also anticipated that LAAS will support surface guidance and other operational needs in the future.  This document will be updated if necessary as requirements to support these further operations are matured. The LAAS signal provides the augmentation",
    "to support these further operations are matured. The LAAS signal provides the augmentation to GPS to obtain the required performance for the operations supported.  The operations supported will be dependent on the user's equipment, the LAAS Ground Facility (LGF), and the capabilities of the airplane integration.",
    "## 1.3.1 Gbas Approach Service Types",
    "A GBAS ground station may provide multiple types of approach service simultaneously to many users who may have different operational objectives.  To facilitate interoperability and consistent, predictable performance, the airborne and ground subsystem performance requirements are organized into matched sets that are intended to be used in conjunction.  These matched sets of performance and functional requirements are referred to collectively as GBAS Approach Service Types (GAST).  The specific",
    "requirements are referred to collectively as GBAS Approach Service Types (GAST).  The specific requirements for the Ground and Airborne subsystems are then organized by Ground Facility Classifications (GFC) and Airborne Equipment Classifications (AEC).  A discussion of the relationship between Approach Service Types and Facility Classifications is given in Appendix I.  The requirements in this MOPS for such approaches are organized according to the AEC and/or by the GAST being supported by the",
    "for such approaches are organized according to the AEC and/or by the GAST being supported by the equipment.",
    "## 1.3.2 Notable Changes From Previous Version\n\nThis version of the MOPS incorporates changes relative to DO-253B and previous versions that alter or augment the operational use of LAAS in some ways that are important to note:",
    "- \nThe GBAS maximum use distance (captured by the parameter Dmax) now only applies to the positioning service rather than for both the positioning and approach services.  Operationally, this change allows for \nthe pilot flying an approach to get feedback that the system is functioning",
    "properly at greater distances.  The GBAS deviations may be observed by the pilot as soon as valid deviations can be calculated, generally expected to be 50-100 NM from the airport depending upon the aircraft altitude, the line-of-sight to the VDB transmitter, and the transmitted power. Service providers ensure the transmitted signal-in-space complies with the necessary requirements within a defined precision approach coverage region.  Although similarly named, this region is different than the",
    "precision approach region (PAR) used by various functional requirements within this airborne receiver MOPS.  The service provider's precision approach coverage volume must encompass all PARs associated with active approaches at an airport. \n- \nThe requirement to compute and output a vertical protection level for the positioning service has been eliminated.  The horizontal protection level has been retained as a minimum output.  This change was implemented",
    "to allow the maximum usable distance, Dmax, to be set to a much larger value. \n- \nVelocity accuracy requirements and optional velocity figures of merit have been specified that will allow, for example, integration with position and velocity reporting applications. \n-",
    "- \nA new Approach Service Type was added and intended to support Category II/III operations.  The service type includes several unique additional requirements and a different approach for allocation of performance between air and ground functions. \n- \nVDB authentication protocols have been added as a required capability \nfor avionics supporting the new Approach Service Type. \n- \nGPS tracking constraints for receivers that use Double Delta delay lock",
    "- \nGPS tracking constraints for receivers that use Double Delta delay lock \nloop discriminators have changed since last version. \n- \nAirborne equipment classifications have been added as described in \nSection 1.3.1.",
    "## 1.4 Laas Airborne Equipment Functions",
    "The functions provided by LAAS airborne equipment are shown in Figure 1-2.",
    "All LAAS equipment includes the VDB receiver function and the Position and Navigation (PAN) function.  Up to three additional functions, all necessary at the aircraft system integration level, may be included within the LAAS equipment: the GPS antenna, the VHF antenna, and the LAAS equipment controller function. Requirements for the GPS antenna are defined in RTCA/DO-301(), Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Airborne Active Antenna Equipment",
    "Standards for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Airborne Active Antenna Equipment for the L1 Frequency Band.  If included within the LAAS equipment, the requirements for the VHF antenna and LAAS equipment controller function defined in Section 2.2.10 and Section 2.3.4, respectively, apply.  This figure is shown for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to imply a requirement for a specific implementation, architecture, or design.",
    "There is multiple LAAS ground system types defined in Section 1.5.6.  The airborne equipment specified in this MOPS is interoperable with all types of LAAS ground systems. \n\n## \n\nShown in Figure 1-3 is a representative functional block diagram for the VDB \nreceiver.

    "Several assumptions have been made in developing this document and are identified below. \n\n## 1.5.1 Gps Signal-In-Space\n\nIt is assumed that GPS satellites transmit signals that comply with the GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) Performance Standard (dated September \n2008) and *Navstar GPS Space Segment / Navigation User Interfaces* [IS-GPS-\n200D with IRN-200D-001] (dated March 7, 2006). \n\n## 1.5.2 Sbas Signal-In-Space",

    "## 1.5.4 Gps/Laas Applications\n\nInitially, it is envisioned that aircraft using the GPS/LAAS signal will maintain conformance to applicable approach and terminal instrument procedures, as well as current airway or other airspace separation requirements.  Over time, it is anticipated that these requirements and procedures will be revised and/or extended to take greater advantage of the GPS/LAAS performance capabilities. \n\n## 1.5.5 Applicability",
    "## 1.5.5 Applicability\n\nThe requirements of this document are applicable to GPS/LAAS equipment installed in aircraft. \n\n## 1.5.6 Laas Ground Subsystem",
    "## 1.5.6 Laas Ground Subsystem\n\nIt is assumed that the LAAS ground subsystem is operating in conformance with the requirements stated in the ICAO Annex 10 Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs).

    "For non-RNAV equipped aircraft, the LAAS equipment may sequence based on an input commanding missed approach or by automatic sequencing to missed approach guidance.  The automatic sequence will occur when all of the following conditions are satisfied: 1) the aircraft position is past the LTP/FTP (i.e., when the bearing to the LTP/FTP is more than ±90 deg from the FAS bearing), 2) the aircraft altitude is greater than the touchdown zone elevation (TDZE) (or LTP/FTP altitude) plus 200 feet, and",
    "is greater than the touchdown zone elevation (TDZE) (or LTP/FTP altitude) plus 200 feet, and 3) the proportional vertical deviation is fullscale fly down (≥ 150 μAmps).",
