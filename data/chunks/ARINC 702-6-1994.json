    "## 1.0 Introduction And Description 1.1 Purpose\n\nThis document sets forth the characteristics of a Flight Management Computer System specifically designed for installation in new generation commercial transport aircraft.\n\nThe system is not designed for retrofit in any aircraft other than those utilizing ARINC 700 series equipment.\n\n## 1.2 Summary Of Operational Characteristics",
    "## 1.2 Summary Of Operational Characteristics\n\nThe Flight Management Computer System\n(FMS)\ndescribed herein is designed to provide performance data and fuel management display and control functions, and navigation and guidance to a desired flight plan based on energy efficient profiles.",
    "NOTE: This Characteristic describes an FMS which is\ncapable of providing performance management and navigation/guidance functions from take-off to final approach. It is recognized, however, that a need also exists for a simpler version of the system\ndesigned\nto\nprovide\nperformance\nmanagement combined with limited navigation and guidance.\nThe intent in developing the",
    "performance\nmanagement combined with limited navigation and guidance.\nThe intent in developing the\nsimpler system is to achieve a lower cost system with reduced operating logistics compared with the more sophisticated system described.\nIt is\nanticipated that equipment cost may be reduced by: a. Less complex software design b. Minimum bulk data storage requirements c. Simpler Control Display Unit (CDU)\nOperating logistics impact may, in turn, be reduced by:",
    "a. Minimized bulk data cost\nb. Less frequent data update c. Reduced crew training needs\nIt is not the intent herein to develop a\n\"Characteristic within a Characteristic\", nor is it intended to describe two separate systems.\n\nManufacturers wishing to develop the simpler system should decide which functions are needed for such a system, and design the system in accordance with the relevant sections of this Characteristic.",
    "It should be emphasized, however, that all systems should conform to the interchangeability standards set forth in Section 2 of this Characteristic.\n\nThe energy management functions performed by the FMS includes the computation of target parameters, flight profiles and guidance commands to optimize performance during all phases of flight. The optimization should, by selection, be based on cost, time, fuel or range.",
    "Provisions should also be included to enable overall modification of these computations by a factor based on individual airline operating economics, local fuel costs, etc. To achieve this performance optimization within the constraints of the air traffic environment, the energy management functions are integrated with a three dimensional, earth oriented navigation system employing mixing of available navigation sensor system inputs. Primary data for this function are IRS/AHRS, GNSS, air data,",
    "navigation sensor system inputs. Primary data for this function are IRS/AHRS, GNSS, air data, and bearing and distance data derived from ground based VORTACS and VOR and/or DME facilities, with provisions for growth inputs from additional sensors. The system provides for the automatic selection and tuning of VOR, DME and ILS systems.",
    "The FMS",
    "receives continuous inputs of altitude, airspeed, ground speed, fuel flow and fuel quantity, Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) or revolution (N1), airplane configuration, etc. as required to support the energy management calculations. A data base is stored in the Flight Management Computer (FMC) unit which may include performance and limit data for a variety of engine types and airplane configurations and navigation data to support the airline requirements. Lateral guidance is computed with respect",
    "and navigation data to support the airline requirements. Lateral guidance is computed with respect to great circle paths defined by the flight plan, and to transitional paths between the great circle paths, or to a preset heading or course.",
    "Vertical guidance is computed with respect to altitudes assigned to waypoints, or to paths defined by stored or computed profiles.\n\nSpeed control along the desired path is provided during all phases of flight. Lateral and vertical guidance and speed/thrust commands are computed for automatic control through the Flight Control Computer System (FCCS) and Thrust Control Computer System\n(TCCS).",
    "Deviation signals are computed for display on flight instruments. Engagement of the FMS modes for automatic flight via the FCCS and TCCS is controlled through the FCCS Controller on the Mode Control Panel (MCP).",
    "Flight planning data entry and flight performance mode selection for FMC\nuse is performed through the FMS\nControl/Display Unit (CDU). The system should be designed with growth potential to add real-time constraints to the guidance modes to provide a four-dimensional (4D) guidance capability. The system also has the optional capability to provide all the necessary signal processing the input/output functions to support a multi-function electronic display.\n\n## 1.3 Brief Description Of The System",
    "## 1.3 Brief Description Of The System\n\nThe ARINC 702 Flight Management Computer System (FMS) comprises two units, one a rack-mounted computer unit and the other a cockpit-located control and display unit. The computer unit provides storage capability for all data needed for system operation.\n\n## 1.0 Introduction And Description (Cont'D) 1.4 Unit Description 1.4.1 Flight Management Computer (Fmc) Unit",
    "The Flight Management Computer (FMC) unit should contain all of the components, electronic circuitry, memory, etc. incident to the functioning of the system. The unit should also contain, as a minimum, sufficient data storage for all required active engine and airplane performance data, all navigation data required to support the active flight plan, and any alternate flight plan which may have been entered into the system. The design goal should be that the FMC should be capable of storing all",
    "entered into the system. The design goal should be that the FMC should be capable of storing all data required by the system.",
    "The computer should be designed such that normal and abnormal power switching transients and other primary power interruptions as defined in RTCA Document DO-160 do not cause essential memory contents to be lost.",
    "Provisions should be made in the design of the computer to allow for future growth of the system. Expanding the capabilities of the computer should be possible with a minimum of rework and at a minimum cost to the airline customer. Section 3.6 of this Characteristic describes some possible \"growth features\".\n\n## 1.4.2 Control/Display Unit (Cdu)",

In addition, it should display various computer outputs as well as for the verification of data entered into memory.",
    "Certain annunciations related to system operation may also be included. When the FMC is used in conjunction with an IRS and/or GNSS Sensor, the CDU may also be used to control this equipment.",
    "Series control may be employed; i.e., the CDU interfaces only to the FMC and all communications with the IRS and/or GNSS are made via the FMC/IRS and/or FMC/GNSS interface. NOTE: This method of series control may also be applied to other systems inputs, such as Omega, referred to in Section 3.6 of this Characteristic.\n\n## 1.4.3 Flight Data Storage Unit (Optional)\n\nSection deleted by Supplement 2.\n\n## 1.5 Interchangeability 1.5.1 General",
    "Section deleted by Supplement 2.\n\n## 1.5 Interchangeability 1.5.1 General\n\nOne of the primary functions of an ARINC Equipment Characteristic is to designate, in addition to certain performance parameters, the interchangeability desired for aircraft equipment produced by various manufacturers. The degree of interchangeability considered necessary is specified in the pertinent ARINC\nEquipment Characteristic.\n\n## 1.5.2 Interchangeability Desired For The Arinc 702 Flight Management Computer System",
    "## 1.5.2 Interchangeability Desired For The Arinc 702 Flight Management Computer System\n\nSystem interchangeability of the FMC and the CDU with respect to the standard aircraft installation is desired, regardless of the manufacturing source.\n\nThe standards necessary to ensure this level of interchangeability are set forth in Section 2 of this Characteristic.\n\n## 1.5.3 \"Generation Interchangeability\" Considerations",
    "## 1.5.3 \"Generation Interchangeability\" Considerations\n\nThe air transport industry desires that future evolutionary equipment improvements and the inclusion of additional functions in new equipments during the next few years do not violate the interwiring and form factor standards set forth in this document.\n\nProvisions to ensure forwardlooking \"generation interchangeability\" (as best can be predicted) are included in this document to guide manufacturers in future developments.",
    "## 1.6 Integrity And Availability\n\nSince it is anticipated that this equipment may become the primary means of navigation on some aircraft, the utmost attention should be paid to the need for integrity and availability in all phases of system design, production, and installation.\n\n## 1.7 Regulatory Approval",
    "## 1.7 Regulatory Approval\n\nThe equipment should meet all applicable regulatory requirements. This Characteristic does not and cannot set forth the specific requirements that an equipment must meet to be assured of approval. Such information must be obtained from the appropriate regulatory authority.\n\n## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards 2.1 Introduction",
    "This section of this Characteristic sets forth the specific form factor, mounting provisions, interwiring, input and output interfaces and power supply characteristics desired for the complete Flight Management Computer System. These standards are necessary to ensure the continued independent design and development of both the equipment and the airframe installations. Manufacturers should note that although this Characteristic does not preclude the use of different form factors and interwiring",
    "although this Characteristic does not preclude the use of different form factors and interwiring features, the practical problem of redesigning what will then be a standard aircraft installation to accommodate some special system could very well make the use of that other design prohibitively expensive for the customer. They should recognize, therefore, the practical advantages of developing equipment in accordance with the form factor, interwiring and signal standards of this document.",
    "## 2.2 Form Factor, Connectors And Index Pin Coding 2.2.1 Flight Management Computer\n\nThe FMC should comply with the dimensional standards in ARINC Specification 600, \"Air Transport Avionics Interfaces\" for the 8 MCU form factor. The FMC should also comply with ARINC 600 with respect to weight, racking attachments, front and rear projections and cooling. As an alternative, the 4 MCU form factor may be used. Equipment packaged in the 4 MCU form factor should be designated\n\"ARINC\n702S\".",
    "The same functional guidelines and interwiring apply. The FMC should be provided with a low insertion force, size 2 shell ARINC 600 service connector.",
    "This connector should be located on the center grid of the FMC\nrear panel, and index code 04 should be used. The top and center inserts of the connector (TP and MP) should each provide 150 socket-type contacts. The lower insert (BP) should provide 11 pin-type contacts and spaces for two small diameter coaxial contacts. Attachment 1A to this document shows the connector arrangement.",
    "Attachment 2 shows the pin assignments. If functions not assigned pins on the service connector in Attachment 2 to this document are needed to be brought to the \"outside world\" to facilitate testing the FMC, they should be assigned pins on an auxiliary connector whose type and location is selected by the equipment manufacturer. The manufacturer should refer to ARINC Specification 600 when choosing the location for this connector and note that, other than to accommodate the needs for equipment",
    "the location for this connector and note that, other than to accommodate the needs for equipment identification by the ATE described in this document, he is free to make whatever pin assignments he wishes.",
    "The airlines do not want the unassigned (\"future spare\") pins of the service connector used for functions associated solely with ATE use.\n\n## 2.2.2 Control/Display Unit (Cdu)",
    "The CDU should be packaged as a standard dzus-mounted control panel 9\" high by 5.75\" wide. The depth behind the panel should not exceed",
    "10.5\", excluding the connector. A connector type M83723/72R18-31N should be used having pin assignments as shown in Attachment 2. Outline drawings showing the connector location are included in Attachment 1B to this Characteristic. More details on CDU design may be found in Section 5.0. NOTE: As stated in Section 1.2 of this Characteristic, a need exists to allow manufacturers the flexibility to develop FMC systems with differing levels of capability in an effort to reduce airline cost and",
    "to develop FMC systems with differing levels of capability in an effort to reduce airline cost and logistic problems.",
    "Part of the system cost reduction may be achieved by developing a smaller, simpler CDU. Differing feelings exist in the industry concerning the relative merits of dedicated key versus shared function alphanumeric keyboards, and also on the trade-off between the amount of keyboard area versus display area.",
    "Thus, equipment manufacturers may be asked by their airline customers to supply CDUs of less than 9\" panel height. Airframe manufacturers, however, should design cockpits to accommodate CDUs of the standard 9\" height.\n\n## 2.2.3 Optional Flight Data Storage Unit (Fdsu)\n\nSection deleted by Supplement 2.\n\n## 2.3 Interwiring",
    "Section deleted by Supplement 2.\n\n## 2.3 Interwiring\n\nThe overall interwiring for the ARINC 702 Flight Management Computer System is set forth in Attachment 2. The interwiring for a given installation, however, need only ensure interconnection with the sub-systems chosen to support operation of the FMC system.\n\nWiring associated with alternate sub-systems shown in Attachment 2 need not be installed.",
    "Wiring associated with alternate sub-systems shown in Attachment 2 need not be installed.\n\nEquipment manufacturers are cautioned not to rely on special wires, cabling or shielding for their particular units because they will not exist in an ARINC 702 installation.\n\n## Commentary Why Standardize Interwiring?",
    "## Commentary Why Standardize Interwiring?\n\nThe standardized interwiring is perhaps the heart of all ARINC Characteristics. It is this feature which allows the airline customer to complete his negotiations with the airframe manufacturer so that the latter can proceed with engineering and initial fabrication prior to airline commitment on\n--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\n\n## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards (Cont'D) 2.3 Interwiring (Cont'D)\n\na specific source of equipment.",
    "a specific source of equipment.\n\nThis provides the equipment manufacturer with many valuable months in which to put the final \"polish\" on his equipment in development.",
    "--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\nThe reader's attention is directed to the interwiring guidance in ARINC Report 414, Section 5.0. This material defines all of the basic standards utilized in airframe wiring installations and all equipment manufacturers should make themselves familiar with it. The reader's attention is also directed to the guidance in Section\n2.2.1\nand Appendix\n1\nof ARINC",
    "2.2.1\nand Appendix\n1\nof ARINC\nSpecification 429 concerning the basic standards for digital interfaces in airframe wiring installations.",
    "## 2.4 Power Circuitry 2.4.1 Primary Power Input\n\nThe FMC and the CDU should be designed to use 115 volt 400Hz single phase power from a system designed for Category\n(A)\nutilization equipment per ARINC\nSpecification 413A. The primary power inputs to the FMC and the CDU will each be protected by a circuit breaker of the size shown in Attachment 2 to this Characteristic.",
    "Installation designers should note that the FMC circuit breaker should also be capable of handling the current drain of an ARINC 603 data loader.",
    "When such a device is used with the FMC, it derives its power from the FMC power source. The equipment designer should be aware that severe switching and other transient interruptions to primary power occur during normal aircraft operations. He should ensure that such interruptions do not cause the computer to lose the contents of its memory or impose the need to provide an external battery to maintain operations.",
    "No pilot action should be needed to cause the system to return to normal operation following such normal power interruptions. NOTE: Airframe installation designers should verify that the aircraft power systems satisfy the primary power interruption criteria of ARINC\nSpecification 413A.\n\n## 2.4.2 Power Control Circuitry",
    "## 2.4.2 Power Control Circuitry\n\nThere should be no master on/off power switching within the FMC system. Any user desiring on/off control should provide, through the medium of an external switching function installed in the airframe, a means of interrupting the primary AC power to the system.\n\n## 2.4.3 The Common Ground",
    "## 2.4.3 The Common Ground\n\nThe wire connected to the FMC connector pin labelled \"Chassis Ground\" should be employed as the DC ground return to aircraft structure. It is not intended as a common return for circuits carrying heavy AC currents, and equipment manufacturers should design their equipment accordingly.\n\n## 2.4.4 The Ac Common Cold",
    "## 2.4.4 The Ac Common Cold\n\nThe wire connected to the FMC connector pin labelled \"115 VAC Cold\" will be grounded to the same structure that provides the DC chassis ground but at a separate ground stud. Airframe manufacturers are advised to keep AC ground wires as short as practicable in order to minimize noise pick-up and radiation.\n\n## 2.5 Environmental Conditions\n\nThe FMC and CDU should meet the requirements of RTCA Document DO-160.",
    "The FMC and CDU should meet the requirements of RTCA Document DO-160.\n\nAttachment 5 of this Characteristic tabulates the relevant environmental categories.\n\n## 2.5.1 Thermal Interface And Design 2.5.1.1 Fmc",
    "The FMC should be designed to utilize, and the airframe installation should provide, cooling air in the manner described in Section 3.5 of ARINC Specification 600. The airflow rate provided to the FMC in the aircraft installation should be 44 Kg per hour and the pressure drop of the coolant airflow through the equipment should be 25 ± 5 mm of water at this rate. The unit should be designed to expend the pressure drop in a manner to maximize the cooling effect within the equipment. Adherence to",
    "the pressure drop in a manner to maximize the cooling effect within the equipment. Adherence to the pressure drop standard is needed to allow interchangeability of equipment.",
    "The FMC should be designed such that loss of cooling air flow does not produce immediate failure. Having made this statement, the airlines wish to remind airframe manufacturers that they may not interpret it as a release from the need to provide cooling air for the FMC as specified above.\n\n## 2.5.1.2 Cdu\n\nThe internal power dissipation of the CDU should not exceed 92W.\n\nThe CDU cooling and thermal design should be in accordance with ARINC Specification 408A, Sections 2.3, 3.6 and 3.10.",
    "These sections define case temperature limits, the equipment cooling method, the thermal appraisal procedure and expected high temperature exposure conditions which should be considered for the equipment design.\n\nARINC 408A defines the standard interface between the aircraft and indicators; however, the thermal interface described should also be applied to the CDU.\n\n## 2.6 Weights",
    "## 2.6 Weights\n\nSystem manufacturers should take note of the guidance information on weights contained in ARINC Specification 600.\n\n## 2.0 Interchangeability Standards (Cont'D) 2.7 System Functions And Signal Characteristics\n\nA complete list of the system functions and signal characteristics required to ensure the desired level of interchangeability is set forth in Sections 3.0 and 4.0.\n\n## 2.8 Grounding And Bonding",
    "## 2.8 Grounding And Bonding\n\nThe attention of equipment and airframe manufacturers is drawn to the guidance material in Section 3.2.4 of ARINC Specification 600 and Appendix 2 of ARINC Specification 404A on the subject of equipment and radio rack grounding and bonding.",
    "A perennial problem for the airlines is the location and repair of airframe ground connections whose resistances have risen as the airframe aged. A high resistance ground usually manifests itself as a system problem that resists all usual approaches to rectification, and invariably consumes a wholly unreasonable amount of time and effort on the part of maintenance personnel to fix.",
    "Airframe manufacturers are urged, therefore, to pay close attention to assuring the longevity of ground connections.\n\n--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\n\n## 3.0 System Design Considerations 3.1 System Configurations\n\nThree different configurations of the ARINC 702 Flight Management Computer System illustrated in Attachment 3 to this Characteristic are described in this section. The FMC\nis expected to be capable of operating interchangeably in all three.",
    "## 3.1.1 Single System Configuration",
    "In this configuration, the FMC accepts inputs from one, two or three ARINC 704 IRS or ARINC 705 AHRS, one or two ARINC 743A GNSS Sensors, two each ARINC 706 Air Data System, ARINC 711 VOR, and ARINC 709 DME and one ARINC 710 ILS to compute the lateral and vertical navigation functions. Inputs of fuel quantity, fuel flow and engine and airplane configuration parameters and inputs from the thrust control computer combined with the air data inputs are used to compute the performance data and fuel",
    "computer combined with the air data inputs are used to compute the performance data and fuel management display or control outputs. Initial condition inputs may be inserted manually via the CDU or automatically from airplane sensor systems.",
    "## 3.1.2 Single System/Dual Cdu Configuration\n\nIn this configuration, the interface is the same as for the single system, with the addition of a second CDU. Both CDUs will have the capability of requesting and displaying data independently, and simultaneously on a time shared basis. NOTE: The question of which CDU is in command, particularly when changing data related to the engaged mode or active leg is one which requires study.",
    "Control authority may be delegated by means of a cockpit mounted switch or by software determination through keyboard action. Manufacturers are urged to review the thoughts of airlines and airframe manufacturers on this subject before a design decision is made. Most airlines will not want the switch, but for those that do, a discrete has been reserved for this function and is defined in Section 4.3.2.2 of this Characteristic.\n\n## 3.1.3 Dual System Configuration",
    "## 3.1.3 Dual System Configuration\n\nThe basic interface for each FMC is the same in the dual configuration as in the single system configuration, except that there is two-way intersystem bus communication between the two FMCs.",
    "This bus permits intersystem comparison for self-test and reasonableness test purposes and also allows retrieval of second system data following loss of a single input sensor. It also provides the means for loading data into both FMCs from entries through one CDU. This configuration should be considered basically as two separate systems, each relating its inputs and outputs to the No. 1 and No. 2 FMCs of the airplane, respectively. Section 4.4 of this document provides guidance concerning the",
    "2 FMCs of the airplane, respectively. Section 4.4 of this document provides guidance concerning the design of the FMC intersystem communications interface.",
    "The vertical and speed/thrust guidance commands will be limited to prevent the airframe and engine limits from being exceeded. The speed limits VMO and MMO will be supplied to the FMC from the Air Data System and the VMin limit from the TCC. The airplane altitude limitations will be stored in the FMC performance data base. The engine limit data will be resident in the TCC and this will be the master reference source for this data. Limit data may also be stored in the FMC for its computation.",
    "It is expected that certain parameters relating to the airplane configuration will be received from another system, such as the TCC, rather than provide individual inputs to the FMC. These parameters are included in Attachment 4 to this Characteristic.\n\n--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\n\n## 3.2 Basic System Functions 3.2.1 Performance Management 3.2.1.1 General",
    "The Flight Management Computer should have the capability to calculate parameters for display or control purposes, compute the flight profiles and provide the guidance outputs for airplane performance in all phases of flight, including climb, cruise, holding, and descent. These computations may be optimized based on such criteria as:",
    "minimum trip fuel, minimum trip cost, minimum trip time, maximum rate of climb or descent, maximum angle of climb or descent and maximum holding endurance, either singly or in combination. The FMC may also provide data for turbulence penetration and engine-out conditions. These functions will be integrated with the flight planning function of the FMC (see Section 3.3.2 of this Characteristic).",
    "All performance data computations may be modified according to the Cost Index function defined in Section 3.4.1.2.6 of this document.\n\n## 3.2.1.2 Performance Data Base\n\nThe FMC should store in its internal memory, a data base which includes aerodynamic and propulsion performance characteristics for one or more airframe/engine combinations.",
    "Provisions should also be included to enable modification of lift-drag characteristics, time and fuel flow, due to degradation during the lift of the airframe. If made, the changes should be annunciated to the crew members and other operational personnel. The pertinent data for a particular installation should be addressed by means of program pins reserved for this purpose as shown in Attachment 2 to this Characteristic.\n\n## 3.2.1.3 Optimum Flight Path",
    "## 3.2.1.3 Optimum Flight Path\n\nThe FMC should compute a flight path using as a baseline the planned lateral path and any established altitude requirements, together with the selected mode or modes of operation as referenced in Section\n3.2.1.1\nof this Characteristic. Guidance to this path will be implemented by means of a combination of lateral, vertical and speed/thrust commands.\n\n## Commentary 3.0 System Design Considerations (Cont'D) 3.2.1.4 Performance Data Control And Display",
    "The CDU should provide the means for selecting the particular submode of performance data operation required, i.e., maximum rate climb, economy cruise, etc. The CDU should also provide the means for manual entry of any data parameters which are required and are not available via the digital interfaces.",
    "Possible initial data entries are defined in Section 3.4.1.2 of this Characteristic. The CDU should provide the means for selecting the required mode of operation. Performance parameters to aid the flight crew in flight planning, aircraft operation, and optimum flight profile control, will be displayed on the CDU.\n\nThese parameters may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:",
    "These parameters may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:\n\nTakeoff Data Altitude Intercept Distance Altitude Intercept Time Top of Descent Maximum Altitude Optimum Altitude Range Capability to Reserve Fuel Level Range Capability to Empty Tanks Endurance Time Fuel Remaining Over Destination Engine-Out performance Turbulent Air Performance Approach Speeds\n\n## 3.2.2 Lateral Navigation And Guidance 3.2.2.1 Lateral Navigation",
    "## 3.2.2 Lateral Navigation And Guidance 3.2.2.1 Lateral Navigation\n\nPosition should be computed in terms of latitude and longitude for display on the CDU.

    "## 3.2.2.2 Lateral Guidance\n\nInformation related to aircraft position and velocity vector with respect to the desired lateral path should be developed for display on the CDU\nand cockpit instrumentation, as well as for use by the flight control computer system.\n\nSuch information will include crosstrack deviation, track angle error and a roll angle steering command.",
    "The desired path may be defined from a waypoint sequence or other procedure specified by the flight plan or by any lateral path computed from pilot entry at the CDU.\n\nMeans may be provided for lateral path modification, such as a select heading or course input.\n\n## 3.2.3 Vertical Navigation And Guidance 3.2.3.1 Vertical Navigation",
    "## 3.2.3 Vertical Navigation And Guidance 3.2.3.1 Vertical Navigation\n\nThe primary signals for vertical navigation computation should be baro-corrected altitude, CAS/Mach, vertical velocity, and along track distance to the bisector. Other data such as flight path angle and vertical acceleration, may also be available.\n\n## 3.2.3.2 Vertical Guidance\n\nDeviation and steering commands with respect to the desired vertical profile should be developed for guidance and display purposes.",
    "The system should also continuously compute the vertical profile (and, optionally, the vertical path angle) necessary to achieve the altitude required at the 'to' waypoint. NOTE: The waypoint altitude requirement applies at the lateral track bisector.\n\nThe vertical track deviation signals should be suitable for display on flight instruments.\n\nA vertical steering command should be computed for use by the flight control computer system.",
    "A vertical steering command should be computed for use by the flight control computer system.\n\nThe vertical steering command parameter has not yet been selected, but is expected to be one of the following: vertical speed, vertical acceleration, pitch altitude.",
    "NOTE: System designers must take into account the\nintegration required between lateral, vertical and performance functions in all phases of operation. This is particularly applicable when any changes made to the lateral or vertical path have effect on the performance computation required to achieve the required flight profile.\n\n## 3.2.4 Thrust Axis Control",
    "## 3.2.4 Thrust Axis Control\n\nThe FMC should generate thrust axis limit data and commands consistent with the lateral and vertical navigation and performance specifications of this Characteristic.\n\nThis information should include limit mode selection and N1/EPR commands for the TCC and CAS/Mach commands for the FCC and the TCC.\n\nIntegration of the vertical and thrust axes is specified in order to prevent excessive throttle activity.\n\n## 3.2.5 4D Guidance (Growth Option)",

For the sake of completeness, however, wiring is also shown to enable the FMC to operate with a second CDU (see Section 5.7 of this document), and for a cross-talk bus between this FMC and another one.",
    "2\nShield Grounds\nDigital data bus shield grounds should be grounded to aircraft structure at both ends and on both sides of each production break.\n\n3\nOff-Side CDU Enable Discrete\nPer Section 4.3.2.2 of this document, this discrete tells the FMC which CDU has control of data entry in dual CDU installations in which either may perform this function.",

When the wire is connected to ground by means of a cockpit-located switch, or equivalent, the \"other\" CDU has control.\n\n## 4 Fmc Master/Slave And Manual Auto Tune Discrete\n\nThis discrete is used in dual FMC installations to tell one of them that it has control of the navaid autotune function and that the other does not. The use of the function is controlled by the Manual/Auto discretes, as described in Section 4.3.2.6.",
    "## 5 Source/Destination Identifier (Sdi) Encoding",
    "Pins MP1K, MP3K and MP5K are assigned for encoding the location of the FMC in the aircraft (i.e., \"system number\") per Section 2.1.4 of ARINC Specification 429. If the SDI function is used, the following encoding scheme should be employed, the pins designated being either left open circuit or connected, on the aircraft-mounted half of the connector, to pin MP5K. The wiring of these pins should cause bit numbers 9 and 10 of each digital word transmitted by the FMC to take on the binary states",
    "cause bit numbers 9 and 10 of each digital word transmitted by the FMC to take on the binary states defined in ARINC Specification 429. When the SDI function is not used, both pins MP1K and MP3K should be left open circuit such that bit numbers 9 and 10 are always binary \"zeros\".",

    "The foregoing describes the SDI\nfunction performed by a data source. ARINC Specification 429 also discusses the data identification function to be performed by sinks whose \"system numbers\" are encoded in this way. In summary, the FMC should recognize and accept data words in which bit numbers 9 and 10 are either both \"zeros\" or form the code defined by pins MP1K and MP3K. All other data may be discarded.\n\n## 6 Wire Sizes",
    "## 6 Wire Sizes\n\nThe \"I-R\" values define the maximum current (I) in amperes and effective resistance (R) in ohms for which the installation and equipment should be designed.",
    "It is anticipated that installation designers will use these figures, together with the lengths of the cable runs in a given airframe, to calculate the gauge of each wire in the installation. Where their calculations reveal the possibility of using higher gauge numbers than #22 AWG, they are asked to stop and consider whether the mechanical strength of this wire is adequate for the installation before deciding to use it.",
    "The airlines report recent sad experiences with such wire, and although they are, of course, interested in the weight saving its use affords, they will quickly point out that these savings are rapidly nullified by maintenance costs if frequent breakages occur.\n\nNOTE:\nWire for which a \"D\" symbol is shown in place of a current rating may be used for any function ranging from \"Dry Circuits\" (hence \"D\") to 5 ampere applications.",
    "Both installation and equipment designers should give due regard to special cases wherein parallel or series-parallel connected circuits may result in higher currents or voltage drop\n(effective resistance) than in simple circuits.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the current limit set forth applies to all elements of parallel or series-parallel circuits.\n\n## Attachment 2 (Cont'D) Notes Applicable To The Standard Interwiring 7 Data Loader Interface",
    "## Attachment 2 (Cont'D) Notes Applicable To The Standard Interwiring 7 Data Loader Interface\n\nIt is expected that the airframe manufacturers will provide, at some convenient location on the aircraft, a connection point for an external data loader of the type described in ARINC Report 603.",
    "This Attachment shows wiring from the FMC to a connector type MS24264-18B-31S or MS24265- 18B-31S\nfor this purpose, with which the MS24266R-18B-31P connector at the aircraft end of the data loader's pendant cable will mate. Note that the Attachment does not show the 115 VAC and aircraft ground wires to this connector needed in a practical installation.",
    "The reader is referred to ARINC Report 603 for information on these needs. Note also that the three FMC data load enable discrete functions are connected to the data loader's discrete outputs as follows:",

    "For successful\n\"automatic mode\"\ndata loader operation with the FMC, therefore, users must ensure that navigation data base update information appears on track #1 of the data tape, operating program update information on track #2 of the tape and performance data base update information on track #3.",
    "Track #4 should not be used.\n\nIn the\n\"control mode\" of data loader operation, in which the FMC assumes management of the loading process, these restrictions on tape track use do not apply but other considerations do.\n\nSee ARINC\nReport 603 for full details.\n\n## Connector Insert Pin Layouts* A.

    "The FMC should provide the facility to perform an \"end-to-end\" error check on messages received and transmitted via ACARS. This is accomplished by designating the four characters preceding the suffix character (ETX) of the final block of the message as the \"text-imbedded\" error control field. This field will be used to verify successful transfer of each message to which the end-to-end error check applies. The allowable character set on which the end-to-end check is performed is defined in",
    "check applies. The allowable character set on which the end-to-end check is performed is defined in Attachment 10 to this Characteristic, entitled \"ISO Alphabet No. 5 Subset for Ground Computer/Airborne Computer Message Exchange Via ACARS\". In addition, bit patterns of the characters appended to the message by the error checking procedure must be encoded per this ISO subset. The pad bit for each 7-bit character in the message is set to a binary zero prior to encoding or decoding of the error",
    "7-bit character in the message is set to a binary zero prior to encoding or decoding of the error check. The error check to be used in the verification of end-to-end message integrity is a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), described in Section 3 of this attachment, \"Character-oriented CRC Calculation\". The CRC generator polynomial is the same CCITT polynomial introduced into ARINC Specification 429 by Supplement 12.",
    "The end-to-end error check provides an assurance that a message composed on the ground has been correctly reconstructed by the FMC (and vice versa for messages originated by the FMC). It supplements the message integrity assurance provisions which are employed at various levels during the transfer of data from originator (e.g., the host airline computer) to the FMC. The normal message integrity checks which, on-board the aircraft, include BCS, word count check, parity check, etc. should",

    "# Supplement 1 To Arinc Characteristic 702 Flight Management Computer System\n\nPublished: January 29, 1980\nPrepared by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee Adopted by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee: August 29, 1979\n--`,,``````,,,,,`,,`,``,,,,`,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\n\n## A. Purpose Of This Document",
    "This Supplement adds an FMC/map display interface specification to Characteristic 702 and re-designates the applications of certain FMC digital data input and output ports to match the selected map display system architecture. The Supplement also adds guidance material to the Characteristic on computer crosstalk in dual FMC installations and on FMC data base loading. ARINC STAFF NOTE:",
    "Because AEEC adopted this Supplement before Characteristic 702 had been published, its incorporation into the first printing of the Characteristic proved possible.",
    "Thus, no separate distribution of the Supplement will be made.\n\nThe changes to the Characteristic made by the Supplement are identified by \"¢-1\" indicators in the margins of the pages on which they appear.\n\n## B. Changes To Characteristic 702 Introduced By This Supplement",
    "## B. Changes To Characteristic 702 Introduced By This Supplement\n\nThis section presents a complete tabulation of the changes and additions to the Characteristic introduced by this Supplement. Each change or addition is identified by the title and section number currently employed in the Characteristic, or by the title and section number that will be employed when the Supplement is eventually incorporated.",
    "In each case there is included a brief description of the addition or change, and, for other than very minor revisions, any text originally contained in the Characteristic is reproduced for reference.\n\n## 2.2.2 Control Display Unit (Cdu)\n\nCDU connector type changed from MS3112E18-32PX to M83723/72R1831N.\n\n## 3.1.3 Dual System Configuration\n\nSentence added to refer reader to Section 4.4 for guidance concerning the design of the intersystem bus interface.\n\n## 3.2.4 Thrust Axis Control",
    "## 3.2.4 Thrust Axis Control\n\nLimit mode selection, N1/EPR and CAS/Mach commands specified as thrust axis control commands to the FMC and the TCC.\n\n## Original Text Follows:\n\nThe FMC should generate thrust axis limit data and commands consistent with the lateral and vertical navigation and performance specifications of this Characteristic. This information should include a thrust axis command, limit mode selection for the TCC and command for the N1/EPR indicators.",
    "The thrust axis command parameter has not yet been selected. The choice of this parameter should take into consideration the need for a fuel-efficient cruise mode.\n\nThis mode may require integration of the vertical and thrust axes in order to prevent excessive throttle activity. AEEC Letter 78-099/SAI-74 refers.\n\n## 3.6 Growth Features",
