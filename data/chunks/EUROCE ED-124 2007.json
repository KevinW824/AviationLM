    "## Executive Summary",
    "The use of Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) is rapidly expanding and is found in all classes of aircraft.  In recognition of this rapid growth EUROCAE established Working Group 60 (WG-60) and RTCA established Special Committee 200 (SC-200) to jointly develop a document that could be used as guidance in the design, development, and application of IMA.  Participants in the development of the document included government, industry, and academic personnel. IMA is a shared set of flexible,",

IMA is a shared set of flexible, reusable, and interoperable hardware and software resources that, when integrated, form a platform that provides services, designed and verified to a defined set of safety and performance requirements, to host applications performing aircraft functions. This document provides guidance for IMA developers, integrators, applicants, and those involved in the approval and continued airworthiness of IMA",
    "integrators, applicants, and those involved in the approval and continued airworthiness of IMA systems.  It provides specific guidance for the assurance of IMA systems as differentiated from traditional federated avionics. The development of this document is based on earlier EUROCAE/RTCA documents, for example EUROCAE ED-12/RTCA DO-178, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification and EUROCAE ED-80/RTCA DO-254, Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic",
    "Certification and EUROCAE ED-80/RTCA DO-254, Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware.  Concepts from other EUROCAE and RTCA documents, as well as SAE and ARINC documents, also guided the document preparation.",
    "## Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Purpose",
    "This document contains guidance for Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) developers, application developers, integrators, certification applicants, and those involved in the approval and continued airworthiness of IMA systems in civil certification projects. The guidance describes the objectives, processes, and activities for those involved in the development and integration of IMA modules, applications, and systems to incrementally accumulate design assurance toward the installation and approval",
    "and systems to incrementally accumulate design assurance toward the installation and approval of an IMA system on an approved aviation product as differentiated from traditional federated aviation system architectures.",
    "IMA system concepts are presented, including the platform and modules, and their relationships to the hosted applications and avionics functions used in an aircraft installation. This includes the description of how the developers and integrators can accumulate incremental acceptance of the modules, platform, and application integration which will provide a means for applicants to achieve design assurance of an IMA system on an approved aviation product. During the IMA system development the",
    "assurance of an IMA system on an approved aviation product. During the IMA system development the certification applicant for a Type Certificate (TC) or Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) program should develop an effective system of communication among the module and platform developers and system integrators.  This is especially important when these suppliers are from different companies.  Otherwise, there may be a misunderstanding of the implementation during final integration and approval",
    "there may be a misunderstanding of the implementation during final integration and approval of the IMA system installation. Six tasks define the incremental acceptance of IMA systems in the certification process:",
    "- \nTask 1: Module acceptance. \n- \nTask 2: Application software or hardware acceptance. \n- \nTask 3: IMA system acceptance. \n- \nTask 4: Aircraft integration of IMA system - including Validation and Verification \n(V&V). \n- \nTask 5: Change of modules or applications. \n- \nTask 6: Reuse of modules or applications.",
    "- \nTask 6: Reuse of modules or applications. \nApproval of an IMA system installation may be based on the accumulation of incremental acceptance, culminating in the complete design assurance needed to demonstrate that the installed system and functions comply with the applicable regulations and guidance. The incremental acceptance, if appropriate, may be granted in the form of an acceptance letter, stamped type design data, or other means for the specific project.",
    "## 1.2 Scope\n\nThis document is applicable to all parties involved in the development, integration, verification, and validation of IMA systems. The guidance in this document is focused on IMA-specific aspects of design assurance. As such it relies on other recognized documents that provide additional guidance on overall aircraft certification, system development, software assurance, and hardware assurance.",
    "As defined in this document, IMA is described as a shared set of flexible, reusable, and interoperable hardware and software resources that, when integrated, form a platform that provides services, designed and verified to a defined set of requirements, to host applications performing aircraft functions.  Key IMA and certification terms are described in Section 2.2 and in the glossary.",
    "The primary industry-accepted guidance for satisfying airworthiness requirements for IMA components is included in Section 1.5. The ability to obtain incremental acceptance of individual items of the IMA platform (including the core software) and hosted applications enables the reduction of follow-on certification efforts without compromising system safety. This document describes application properties as they relate to their integration with a platform; however, it does not address the",
    "properties as they relate to their integration with a platform; however, it does not address the specific functionality of applications nor specific Technical Standard Order (TSO)/European Technical Standard Order (ETSO) requirements, Minimum Operational Performance Specifications (MOPS), or Minimum Aviation System Performance Specifications (MASPS).",
    "## 1.3 Background",
    "The evolution of software and microelectronics technology enables the introduction of new aircraft functions, new capabilities, and increased levels of complexity. The need to perform these complex functions necessitates the use of high-performance computing platforms that can host multiple applications on a single processor or a distributed network of processors. Aircraft functions are increasingly being implemented by electronic systems. IMA is a means to accommodate this increase and reduce",
    "being implemented by electronic systems. IMA is a means to accommodate this increase and reduce the number of units per aircraft.",
    "Additional benefits are reduced weight and volume of aircraft systems and equipment. The IMA platform should be capable of providing robust partitioning and other protection means that allow multiple applications to share a platform and its resources, or to support functions distributed across a fault-tolerant network. An IMA platform may be provided by the system integrator or by a third party supplier. Likewise, IMA applications may be provided by the platform supplier or third party",
    "party supplier. Likewise, IMA applications may be provided by the platform supplier or third party suppliers. Economic factors, including the needs to provide cost-effective upgrade paths, introduce new operational capabilities (e.g., CNS/ATM functions), fast and efficient maintenance, and to avoid premature obsolescence are the primary incentives for the IMA concept. In light of this background, this document describes a set of processes and guidance to be used for the development and",
    "this document describes a set of processes and guidance to be used for the development and certification of IMA systems.",
    "## 1.4 Relationship To Other Documents",
    "In addition to the airworthiness regulations and requirements, various national and international standards for software, avionics, complex electronics, and safety are available. In some communities, compliance with these standards may be required. However, it is outside the scope of this document to invoke specific national or international standards, or to propose a means by which these standards might be used as an alternative or supplement to this document.",
    "Where this document uses the term \"standards\" it should be interpreted to mean the use of project-specific standards as applied to the aircraft systems, equipment, and engines. Such standards may be derived from general standards produced or adopted by the applicant for their certification activities. \n\n## 1.5 References\n\nThe latest version of the following documents apply:",

    "This section provides guidance for continued airworthiness of IMA systems related to training, maintenance, and post-certification modifications of aircraft with IMA systems installed.  Although this guidance is not specific only to an IMA system, the increased level of integration, interdependency, and complexity has the potential to introduce new areas of concerns when maintenance and modification procedures are conducted.  Therefore, the guidance for continued airworthiness becomes of",
    "procedures are conducted.  Therefore, the guidance for continued airworthiness becomes of greater concern than in a federated system architecture and should be thoroughly addressed in the initial design of an IMA system, as well as in the continued airworthiness process.",
    "## 6.1 Training",
    "To maintain the continued airworthiness of an IMA system, maintenance personnel and appropriate flight operations personnel should receive training for the specific IMA system. During the development of an IMA system, a human factors assessment should be performed to address the practicalities of operations with the system in normal and degraded configurations and in recovery situations (see Section 3.10).  Training should ensure that flight operations personnel understand the effects of",
    "Section 3.10).  Training should ensure that flight operations personnel understand the effects of degraded mode operations, cascading failures, multiple messages, and aural alerts.",
    "Cascading failures in an IMA system have the potential to hide the primary cause of failure, and the required flight crew actions may not always be obvious.  Therefore, training for the flight crew of well-defined processes for failure identification, recovery actions (if appropriate), and failure reporting is required.",
    "The reporting by the flight crew of IMA system failures or anomalous behavior and the retrieval of fault diagnostic reports (see Section 3.6.5) are important for maintenance.",
    "These reports should be accurate and complete and should reference the applicable fault codes. Due to the increased integration, interdependency, complexity, and potential for latent and cascading failures (which can be very difficult to isolate and may not always be obvious to determine by traditional methods), the training of maintenance personnel is very important to the continued airworthiness of an IMA system.  The information and procedures provided to the maintenance personnel (i.e.,",
    "of an IMA system.  The information and procedures provided to the maintenance personnel (i.e., instructions, fault diagnosis, repairs, verification, confirming the IMA configuration after maintenance work, etc.)",
    "should be well planned, accurate, complete, and easy to understand.  For example, identification and diagnosis of faults or failures in an IMA system may be difficult due to cascading or latent failures, which may hide the primary cause of failure.  Therefore, the training required for fault identification and correction should be thorough and comprehensive, and may be more encompassing for an IMA system than for a federated system architecture.",
    "## 6.2 Maintenance\n\nFor continued airworthiness, flight operations, and maintenance, the IMA system should be capable of displaying the status, version, and currency of the loaded software and data. The configuration of the components of the IMA system should be available to make repairs and perform any tests or inspections to determine conformance of the system to the approved type design.",
    "Since software can be loaded independently from hardware on the aircraft, the operator should establish a process for maintaining and recording the IMA system configuration (identification and revision status of hardware and software components and modules).  This information should be current and maintained as part of the aircraft records.",
    "When loading field-loadable hardware or software, there should be a robust process established to ensure correct and complete loading, to confirm the hardware or software loaded is approved, and to verify the upload has not been corrupted (e.g., verification with an appropriate data transfer integrity check).  This process should include checks before and after loading into the IMA system and to annunciate any failures of the loading.  The operator should also be able to confirm the",
    "and to annunciate any failures of the loading.  The operator should also be able to confirm the compatibility and intermixability of hardware and software loads with other components.",
    "A human factors analysis (see Section 3.10) of the maintenance interface and procedures should be included in the IMA system design data.  Clear and unambiguous fault identification and diagnostic procedures should be addressed in the maintenance manuals.  The IMA system should provide a means to detect and identify failures to facilitate maintenance of the system. \n\n## 6.3 Post-Certification Modifications",
    "Modifications to an IMA system after initial certification should reference the design data and certification criteria established by the certification applicant. This also applies where the applicant is not the original certification applicant.  Post-certification modifications should include reviews of the human factors assessment (both flight crew and maintenance procedures - see Section 3.10), the safety assessment (see Section 5.1), and certification requirements of the installation for",
    "the safety assessment (see Section 5.1), and certification requirements of the installation for changes that have an impact on the certified aircraft configuration and type design.",
    "Due to the increased level of integration, interdependency, and complexity of an IMA system, post-certification modifications should be developed and accomplished with consideration to the impact on the aircraft safety assessment, IMA system safety assessment, and aircraft certification basis. When a modification is proposed, a change impact analysis should be performed (see Section 4.6.4).  This change impact analysis should determine whether the proposed change could adversely affect safe",
    "change impact analysis should determine whether the proposed change could adversely affect safe operation and continued airworthiness of the IMA system, aircraft, or engine.",
    "An area of particular concern with an IMA system is when there is a failure that results in numerous failure or alert messages being displayed (see Section 3.6) and/or aural alerts occurring simultaneously.  These messages should be displayed in a clear and prioritized manner.  The priority of aural alerts should be established (i.e., status, caution, warning, immediate pilot action). In a post-certification modification, these prioritization hierarchies should be analyzed for continued",
    "post-certification modification, these prioritization hierarchies should be analyzed for continued airworthiness compliance and to minimize flight crew workload.  Under no circumstances should a flight crew be expected to determine the priority of these messages and alerts and the order in which they should be addressed, because this could lead to an unacceptable delay in dealing with failures and may result in an unacceptable safety of flight situation.",
    "## Annex A Objective Tables",
    "The objectives are used to plan and ensure that the installed IMA system complies with the guidance of this document.  Objectives should be addressed during the planning process of the aircraft certification program (e.g., Aircraft and/or IMA System Certification Plans, Platform Acceptance Plan, Module Acceptance Plan, Hosted Application Acceptance Plans). Since multiple stakeholders will typically be involved in the acceptance and certification efforts, the plans should clearly delineate who",
    "be involved in the acceptance and certification efforts, the plans should clearly delineate who is responsible for achieving each objective.  Plans should also indicate the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder when more than one stakeholder is involved in the satisfaction of an objective and how compliance with that objective will be demonstrated and by whom. Evidence of compliance with these objectives (full, partial, or none) should be provided in the compliance documentation (e.g.,",

    "## Annex D Ima System Design Examples\n\nThis annex contains examples of various system designs.  Each example shows how some subset of the IMA characteristics may be implemented in a typical design. These examples are supplied for information only. \n\n## D.1 Example 1: Single Lru Platform D.1.1 Purpose Of This Example\n\nThis example illustrates the sharing of computational and I/O resources within a single Line Replaceable Unit (LRU).  Key IMA characteristics include:",
    "- \nHosting of multiple applications. \n- \nSharing of processing, memory, and I/O within the LRU and sharing of a \nnetwork. \n- \nPlatform configuration data and data loading. \n- \nDefined API between the platform and hosted applications. \nAt one level, this example illustrates a single platform providing core computational resources.  At another level, this example illustrates a module to be used within a larger IMA platform. \n\n## D.1.2 Definition Of Platform And Modules",
    "The platform for this example is a single LRU that provides shared computational resources and hosts multiple software applications.  These resources include the CPU (Central Processing Unit), MMU (Memory Management Unit), FPPU (Floating Point Processing Unit), co-processors, specific hardware mechanisms to support robust partitioning, physical memory, access to the aircraft network and I/O channels.  A configuration table determines the specific purpose of a LRU.  The LRU is field loadable,",
    "A configuration table determines the specific purpose of a LRU.  The LRU is field loadable, e.g. ARINC 615A.  The core software provides an ARINC 653 API to ensure portability and robust partitioning of applications.",
    "- \nHardware: CPU, MMU, network interface and I/O \n- \nSoftware: Core software and partitioned application software \n- \nConfiguration tables: partition definition, network port allocation, I/O mapping \n\n## D.1.3 Key Characteristics Of Ima Found In This System",
    "This LRU may be independently accepted as a platform providing core computational resources for multiple avionics functions.  It may be accepted as a stand-alone platform, or as a module for use within a larger IMA system. In order to isolate multiple partitions within this platform, the platform-specific hardware (MMU, watchdog timers, etc.) provides the core software with the ability to manage shared memory space, shared processing time, and access to shared I/O. The core software manages",
    "shared memory space, shared processing time, and access to shared I/O. The core software manages multiple software partitions, and provides robust partitioning between applications. Other things to note are the robust partitioning of the network interface when integrated with other platforms by a deterministic profile of ARINC 664 to meet bandwidth limitations and the mitigation of network failures by replication of the channels. The LRU is adapted to ensure the CPU time, memory and I/O",
    "failures by replication of the channels. The LRU is adapted to ensure the CPU time, memory and I/O requirements of each software application. Embedded configuration tables provide this configuration capability which, together with the core software, can activate or de-activate appropriate software functions or provide adequate parameters to the core software. Another key characteristic is a high level of internal fault/failure detection.",
    "## D.2 Example 2: Distributed Ima Platform D.2.1 Purpose Of This Example",
    "This architecture example illustrates how a fault-tolerant, distributed platform for realtime applications can be established based on robust partitioning of the communication network resource. Based on a strict TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) pattern the communication platform provides robust partitioning either between LRUs (on a sub-system bus, distributed throughout the aircraft) or between LRMs (on a backplane bus, within a cabinet).  The platform is designed to provide a robustly",
    "LRMs (on a backplane bus, within a cabinet).  The platform is designed to provide a robustly partitioned communication service to hosted applications, even in the event of a single, arbitrary software or hardware fault within any of the applications or the communication network itself. The platform allows for the assembly of an application-specific, fault-tolerant network from a set of standard, configurable hardware boards (top-level, combined HW/SW",
    "modules of the platform) linked using a partitioned fault-tolerant digital communication network as shown in Figure D-2.",
    "## D.2.2 Definition Of Platform And Modules\n\nThe platform in this example consists of three standard hardware boards (see Figure D-2), each designed to provide a defined set of functions when assembled in accordance with the modular system architecture: \n\n- \nThe General Processing Module (GPM). \n- \nThe Power Supply Module (PSM). \n- \nThe I/O Module (IOM). \nEach of these boards could be instances of a Single LRU platform as discussed in Example 1.",
    "In this example, all boards share a common structure (see Figure D-3), containing: \n\n- \na Processor Module (potentially partitioned as described in Example 1). \n- \na Communications Module (robust partitioning of communication resource). \n- \na functional block (application-specific to each of the hardware board). \nThe platform also uses *core software components*, which provide a uniform API to applications:",
    "- \na real-time operating system module (potentially partitioned as in Example 1). \n- \na fault management. \n- \na health-monitoring component.",
    "- \na health-monitoring component. \nUsing this general platform, one or several applications can be integrated, using multiple instances of the basic modules interfacing with the core software components as required. This architecture and its modules is highly composable: Applications based on this platform can be developed independently of each other according to strict interface definitions supported by the partitioning mechanism. The resulting integration effort is usually minimal.",
    "## D.2.3 Key Characteristics Of Ima Found In This System Sharing Of Resources, Robust Partitioning:",
    "The distributed platform is designed to provide robust partitioning at the communication level. It is based on a synchronous, redundant data bus to establish this property. Access to the communication channels is enabled by a dedicated communication module, which autonomously executes a static communication schedule. The proper operation of these modules is further monitored by independent guardian units deployed in the network. These units only grant a module access to the shared communication",
    "units deployed in the network. These units only grant a module access to the shared communication resources at their assigned times. A partitioning analysis using formal correctness proofs, as well as validation and verification by testing shows, that arbitrary node failures can be tolerated with such an architecture: The distributed platform will isolate a single fault in any hosted application (hardware or software fault) and prevent any interference with the configured (hard real-time)",
    "(hardware or software fault) and prevent any interference with the configured (hard real-time) communication activities of another application.",
    "## Hosting Of Multiple Applications, Re-Qualification Impact:",
    "Since the partitioning requirements of the distributed platform have been developed to meet Level A (ED-12/DO-178 (Ref. [2])), multiple applications of varying levels of criticality can be implemented independently and integrated on the platform. A timetriggered communication module supports a precisely defined interface in the time as well as in the value domain for all communication on the network. This interface can be frozen early in the design. Subsequently individual applications can then",
    "This interface can be frozen early in the design. Subsequently individual applications can then be implemented according to this interface specification. Interactions with other applications can be simulated based on precisely the same interface specification that will be used in the final system. Integration will thus not change the interface properties in terms of timing and values of the platform, when another application is integrated on the platform. The verified service of previously",
    "when another application is integrated on the platform. The verified service of previously integrated applications should, therefore, not suffer any impact by the integration or modification of an additional application on the platform.",
    "## Api Between Platform And Applications:\n\nThe applications are provided with a simple, configurable, state message based API to with well-defined and verifiable timing and value properties to the fault management and health management components of the platform. \n\n## Platform Configuration Data:\n\nThe platform is configured with configuration tables for the operating system component, the communication module, the fault management and health management component.",
    "## Fault Management, Health Monitoring:",
    "While communication faults are dealt with by the robust partitioning mechanisms, node failures can be masked by active replication of applications on redundant hardware modules. The communication module of the platform provides a redundant, deterministic message transmission service. Built on this basic service, redundant modules may be integrated on the platform. Applications are relieved from fault management by a core software component available for this purpose. It also reports health",
    "fault management by a core software component available for this purpose. It also reports health information about hardware modules and application components hosted by them.",
    "## D.3 Example 3: Identifying Bounds Of A Distributed Complex Ima System D.3.1 Purpose Of This Example\n\nThis example identifies boundaries of a distributed complex IMA system and presents considerations for fault management and reporting. Figure D-4 provides an example of a distributed complex modular avionics system. \n\n## D.3.2 Definition Of Platform And Modules",
    "The main architectural elements of the system are the computing resources, data transfer network, and remote I/O Units. The network consists of the network switches located both remotely in the aircraft and at resource centers, the end node interfaces, and the underlying transport protocol. The RIU (Remote I/O Unit) and IOM (I/O",
    "Module) are similar devices where one is located remotely and the other at the resource center. Each of these modules could be instances of single LRU platforms as discussed in Example 1. As a point of clarity, Figure D-4 does not imply a specific implementation of functional interface.  There are a number of ways aircraft systems can use the distributed, complex MA system resources.  The actual methodology of resource utilization for a particular aircraft system or function will be dependent",
    "methodology of resource utilization for a particular aircraft system or function will be dependent on the requirements of that system or function.",
    "## D.3.3 Key Characteristics Of Ima Found In This System Fault Management, Health Monitoring",
    "One element of significant interest is flight deck effects in the presence of failures within the distributed, complex MA system.  The situation can be decomposed into a condition where a cascading set of failures are reported by the distributed, complex MA system, multiple applications hosted on the CPM, and possibly by other distributed, complex MA systems or federated systems.  As one begins to look at issues such as this, it becomes necessary to look at a hierarchy for information that is",
    "to look at issues such as this, it becomes necessary to look at a hierarchy for information that is reported to the flight deck and or logged for maintenance action.",
    "Figure D-5 is presented to show a possible hierarchy of fault reporting and management.  The intention of this figure is to illustrate the following.",
    "- \nThere are complex interactions between MA systems, aircraft system functions \nand MA hosted applications and federated systems that in time of failure will result in multiple failure indications.  Left unchecked this will produce an increase in workload for the flight crew and confusion for maintenance \npersonnel. \n- \nThere is a need to provide functionality that correctly determines the messages,",
    "personnel. \n- \nThere is a need to provide functionality that correctly determines the messages, \nalerts and affects that appear on the flight deck and the messages that appear in maintenance logs. \n- \nThe aircraft-level fault reporting functionality is not part of a particular complex \nMA System.",
    "## D.4 Example 4: Software Designed Radio Example D.4.1 Purpose Of This Example",
    "This example illustrates a software designed radio (SDR) platform architecture.",
    "Radios include 8.33 kHz and Mode S transponders, for example. It is expected that different companies in different time frames will develop these platforms and the applications implementing these radios. This SDR platform concurrently supports many different radios within broad frequency bounds from a large available collection of radio applications.  A detailed specification is developed to accommodate re-hosting of applications that has the flexibility to satisfy special requirements of radio",
    "re-hosting of applications that has the flexibility to satisfy special requirements of radio functions. This example illustrates two levels of robust partitioning; reconfiguration using applications stored in memory, use of high performance interfaces to satisfy specific demanding interface requirements, and architecturally compatible interfaces for less demanding requirements.",
    "## D.4.2 Definition Of Platform And Modules",
    "The architecture consists of an intra-platform logical bus and several channel modules, as shown in Figure D-6.  This intra-platform bus includes physical and logical interfaces to the channels, core processing and memory, system health monitor, and system configuration data.  A general-purpose data communications module accommodates application rehosting11;",
    "a high performance data communications interface is provided for those instances where the general-purpose module is inadequate, i.e., tight real-time control is needed.",
    "Common modules and applications, with their corresponding APIs, are included in the basic platform and are accepted with the platform.  These may include Ethernet or ARINC 429, RF signal interfaces, and audio frequency interfaces.",
    "A platform has several channel modules that are robustly partitioned from one another.  A channel module conceptually supports a single radio function, but this is not a requirement. A channel includes modules that provide data and radio frequency I/O applications and APIs, multiple general purpose processing capabilities, and a robust partition monitor that monitors the applications, APIs, and general purpose processing partitioning.",
    "11 The common object request broker architecture (CORBA) may be used as an approach \n\n## D.4.3 Key Characteristics Of Ima Found In This System Robust Partitioning - Into Channels",
    "The partitioning into channels simplifies implementation of multiple radio functions. The allocation of a radio function on the platform is independent of the channel assignment because each of the channels has the same resource requirements.  The architecture specifies robust partitioning of the channel resources. In every case, channel operation and control is through the intra-platform bus.  There is no specification that only one radio is accommodated on a channel at one time, but this is",
    "There is no specification that only one radio is accommodated on a channel at one time, but this is recognized as the conceptual norm.  Channel sharing is possible and some radios may require more than one channel.",
    "## Robust Partitioning - Within A Channel\n\nA channel is separated into partitions.  The separate partitions in a channel module allow parts of the radio transmit or receive processing to be performed totally isolated from one another.  The military, for example, may apply this feature for classified and unclassified data separation.  Multiple I/O modules support multiple RF and data ports for reception, transmission, data, and control. \n\n## Reconfiguration Using Applications Stored In Memory",
    "## Reconfiguration Using Applications Stored In Memory\n\nA collection of available radio applications may be stored in memory with the general purpose processing capability.  These stored radios applications may be made operational by providing the needed channel space, loading the radio application from memory into the partition, updating the system configuration, and activating the radio. \n\n## Data Communication - High Performance And General-Purpose Interfaces.",
    "## Data Communication - High Performance And General-Purpose Interfaces.\n\nThe general-purpose data communications interface is used whenever possible to increase application re-hostability.  The high performance interfaces are used when the general-purpose interface cannot satisfy the performance requirements of the radio. \n\n## List Of Working Group 60 Members\n\nChairman EVELEENS \nRene NLR \nSecretary BROWN \nDavid AIRBUS UK",
