    "that will support the requirements for generation of collision advisory information. \nSpecifically, TCAS II will generate a surveillance track in range and altitude on a target-of-interest at the range and with the track probability and range \naccuracy specified below.  This is to ensure that a correct resolution advisory can be issued in time for the pilot to maintain adequate vertical separation at closest-point-of-approach.",
    "TCAS II will also generate, whenever possible, a surveillance track in range and altitude on a target-of-interest at the range and with the track probability \nand range accuracy specified below such that a correct traffic advisory can be issued as a precursor to the resolution advisory. \nIn addition to the surveillance requirements to support generation of resolution and traffic advisories, TCAS II will display the range and, if available, the",

    "It is acceptable to limit the output of TCAS intruders to the display to those within 3000 feet of own altitude when own aircraft is on the ground.  This is permitted (but not required) so that the altitude surveillance volume for TCAS Mode C intruders can be consistent with the Mode S surveillance altitude limits modified in RTCA/DO-185B Change 2 (section 2.2.4.6.2.2.1).
