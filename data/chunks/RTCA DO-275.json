    "## 1.2 System Overview The Night Vision Imaging System (Nvis) Consists Of The Following:\n\n•\nNVG\n•\nInterior and exterior lighting\n•\nCockpit transparencies (e.g., windshield, windows, chin bubbles, etc.)\n•\nCrewstation design and components (e.g., location of structural components that may\nhinder use of NVGs, aircraft displays, etc.)\n\n## 1.2.1 Night Vision Goggle",
    "## 1.2.1 Night Vision Goggle\n\n1.2.1.1\nBinocular Assembly The binocular assembly contains two monocular assemblies. It may house the adjustment mechanisms for interpupillary (eyespan) adjustment, eyepiece and objective lens focus, fore and aft adjustment, and tilt adjustment. It may also contain a breakaway feature at its interface with the head or helmet mount.",
    "1.2.1.2\nMonocular Assembly The monocular assemblies contain the electro-optical components that gather the available light, amplify that light and present that light to the human eye. Each monocular assembly contains one or more intensifier channels. Each channel consists of an objective lens, image intensifier tube, and eyepiece lens. Available light from the night sky and other sources is reflected off scene objects, creating the input to the NVG.",
    "1.2.1.3\nObjective Lens Assembly The objective lens assembly (See Figure 1-1) collects the available energy and focuses it on the photocathode (the first part of the image intensification tube). It is housed in an assembly that is used for distance focusing. A coating is placed on the inside portion of the lens that filters out specific wavelengths, thus allowing the use of properly designed interior lighting without degrading the NVG image of the outside scene.",
    "1.2.1.4\nImage Intensifier An image intensification tube greatly amplifies available energy to provide an imaging capability at night. It consists of a photocathode, microchannel plate, phosphor screen, and fiber optic twist. Embedded circuitry is designed to protect the tube from bright light sources, and to automatically adjust the gain in response to varying light input levels by controlling the electron flow through the microchannel plate.",
    "1.2.1.5\nEyepiece Lens The eyepiece lens assembly is designed to provide some adjustment for the user that compensates for minor vision deficiencies (i.e., diopter adjustment). However, the assembly does not correct for all eye deficiencies and does not replace the need for wearing prescribed spectacles or contact lens.",
    "1.2.1.6\nPower Source Assembly The power source for each tube can be provided by a variety of methods including for example duplicated battery compartments, individual batteries mounted on each tube, aircraft supplied with automatic switching to battery or aircraft back up power supply, or any other method providing a sufficiently reliable source of power. A suitable means of indicating to the user actual or impending power source problems would normally be provided.",
    "1.2.1.7",
    "Helmet or Head Mount The mount assembly serves as the mounting point for the binocular assembly. It may be affixed to an assembly that serves as a head mount (e.g., hair net mount), or it may attach to a helmet. The mount may contain a vertical adjustment and a means for connecting the binocular assembly to system power. The design may include a breakaway feature for the binocular assembly and/or the binocular assembly/mount combination. The mounting system shall provide a stable platform for",
    "the binocular assembly/mount combination. The mounting system shall provide a stable platform for the NVG during all flight conditions, and shall be designed not to interfere with the operator's ability to look beneath or around the binocular assembly when viewing inside or outside the cockpit using unaided vision.",

    "1.3\nOperational Application This document establishes equipment requirements for the use of NVGs during night VFR operations. The minimum operating performance standards set forth in this document are intended to provide a system that will be compatible with both existing and future airspace operations.",
    "1.4\nIntended Function The fundamental purpose of a NVG is to provide the operator with a means of acquiring an enhanced view of the scene outside the aircraft, thus enhancing situation awareness.

    "General Guidelines When developing and incorporating a NVIS lighting system it is always important to keep in mind the main goals: instrument readability shall not be degraded, and NVG compatibility shall be maintained. This is particularly applicable to primary flight instruments. Modifying a lighting system for NVG compatibility does not reduce or eliminate the need to use sound cockpit lighting design principles. If anything, cockpit lighting should be better when using NVGs than when not",
    "design principles. If anything, cockpit lighting should be better when using NVGs than when not using them in order to ensure instruments can be read easily when quickly scanned and to help reduce the added workload created by the use of NVGs. The lighting modification should include instrument panels, overhead panels, consoles, switches, circuit breakers, magnetic compass, secondary (emergency) lighting, cabin lighting, etc.",
    "E.2\nEliminating or Reducing Glare and Reflections Secondary to Interior Light Sources\nMinimize use of floodlights (excessive stray light can cause reflections from such things as clothing, seat belts, knee-boards, and floorboards that interfere with unaided viewing of the outside scene).",
    "If flood lighting is used, ensure correct positioning to eliminate stray light and to provide best instrument readability. Use of non-reflective near-IR paint in the cockpit may help reduce reflections that adversely affect NVG performance (remember - NVGs are mostly sensitive to near-IR energy). It is important to test the paint for near-IR reflectivity before applying. Even some black paints may contain substances that do not reflect visible light but may be good near-IR reflectors. Use of",
    "may contain substances that do not reflect visible light but may be good near-IR reflectors. Use of non-reflective mats/covers may help reduce unwanted reflections.",
    "Note:\nFlammability regulatory requirements shall be met.",
    "Use of louver film or filters may help reduce unwanted reflections by directing the light in desirable directions, while reducing stray radiation. Glare shields may be used to block stray energy from light sources within the cockpit, thus reducing potential unwanted reflections. Replacing crazed/scratched windscreens may help minimize the effects of reflections. Crazing and scratches can cause what would normally be a small area of reflected energy to spread (diffuse) over a much larger area.",
    "E.3\nEliminating or Reducing Glare and Reflections Caused by Exterior Light Sources Consider an exterior light design that is less offensive to NVG performance. Normally this means designing and producing exterior lighting that continue to meet the FARs for unaided viewing while reducing the adverse effect on NVGs. One way this can be accomplished is by filtering out the IR energy being emitted by the light source, while allowing the visible wavelengths to pass.",
    "Consider blanking/blocking the portion of external light source that introduces light into cockpit area. Consider repositioning of the offending exterior light source. Glare shields may be used to block energy from light sources outside the cockpit, thus reducing potential unwanted reflections. Consider limiting operational use of the offending exterior light source. Consider limiting the flight envelope of the aircraft so there are no effects from the light source (e.g., keep well away from",
    "envelope of the aircraft so there are no effects from the light source (e.g., keep well away from clouds, remove NVGs prior to landing, etc.).",

The regulatory requirements for the use of exterior lighting shall be followed.\n\n## E.4 Eliminating Light Leaks Proper Use Of Potting Material, Gaskets, Etc. May Help Eliminate Light Leaks.\n\nConsider an alternate source of illumination when a light leak cannot be eliminated.",
    "Consider an alternate source of illumination when a light leak cannot be eliminated.\n\nNotes:\n1. NVGs can be used to identify the source and location of light leaks.\n2. It is a good operating practice to scan the cockpit area with NVGs prior to\ntaking off to identify light leaks. It is possible that light leaks that are not noticeable to the unaided eye can still adversely affect NVG performance.",
    "## E.5 Improving Daylight Readability Of Instruments And Annunciators Increasing The Power To Existing Light Sources, Adding Additional Lamps, Or Changing To New Light Sources (E.G., Leds, Etc.) May Help Improve Daylight Readability.\n\nConsider trying different types of filters. Reducing the use of color will help avoid the potential problems associated with daylight readability.",
    "Notes:\n1. Only those components modified for NVIS compatibility should be assessed\nfor daylight readability.\n2. Components with pre-existing daylight readability problems will likely be\nmade worse when filtering for NVIS compatibility.\n3. The regulatory requirements for the use of color shall be followed.\n\n## E.6 Modification Of Warning, Caution And Advisory Lights Use Of Nvis Red, Yellow, Green And White Filter Material Is Recommended For Warning, Caution And Advisory Lights.",
    "Colors must be distinguishable from each other (e.g., red versus amber). If any of the warning or caution lights are blocked from the unaided field of view when scanning the outside scene with the NVG (i.e., blocked by the physical presence of the goggle), consider moving the lights or ensuring that, when illuminated, the warning/caution lights are visible in the NVG image, but without adversely affecting performance.",

Inspection of the helmet should be the same as for unaided flight.\nHowever, particular attention should be paid to helmet fit due to the extra weight and forward center of gravity caused by the mount, goggle and battery pack.\n2.\nInspect Mount. Ensure the mount is not cracked and that all contacts are clear and\nclean, and check wiring for integrity. Test all controls for smooth operation.\n3.\nLoad Battery Compartment.

Consequently, each monocular may move slightly when gently moved, but the movement should not be excessive. Rotate the objective and diopter controls to ensure freedom of movement.

    "5.\nInspect and Clean Lenses. Inspect the objective and eyepiece lenses for scratches or\nother damage. Clean the lenses with lens paper or equivalent material and not with a flight suit or a tee shirt. A single thumbprint on one of the lenses may degrade visual acuity by as much as thirty percent.\n6.\nSet Diopter. Set the diopter on each monocular to zero. Doing so will help ensure the\nresolution chart will be initially viewable when beginning the focusing procedures.\n7.",

Position the binocular assembly as far forward (away from the eyes) as possible. This will avoid damage to spectacles and placement of oil on the lens from\neyebrows or eyelashes when the NVG is attached to the mount and rotated to the operating position.",
    "Note:\nThe operational eye relief position varies person to person and is dependent on a number of factors. Essentially, the selected position should allow the user to easily view the cockpit area when looking around or below the\ngoggle without sacrificing the full field of view.\n8.\nCenter Tilt. Set the tilt adjustment to the centered position (determined by aligning\nthe tilt lever with bottom portion of the bridge). Ensure the IPD adjustments do not move when manipulating the tilt lever.\n9.",
    "9.\nSet IPD. Actuate the IPD controls to ensure the mechanisms move freely and that the\ntilt lever does not move as the monoculars track along the bridge.\n10. Adjust Vertical. Ensure the mechanism tracks smoothly to the upper and lower limits\nof movement, and ensure the thumb wheel moves freely. Leave the adjustment in the centered position.",
    "11. Don Helmet. The helmet should be donned in order to check for proper fit and to prepare for attaching the NVG. Fasten and adjust the chinstrap. The chinstrap will help stabilize the helmet when the NVG is attached.\n12. Attach and Remove Binocular Assembly. Attach the binocular assembly to the mount",

Do not exert excessive force. If too much force is required, it is an indication that the bearings are not properly aligned and the binocular assembly may fail to seat properly or become jammed in the mount.",
    "Do not release the binocular assembly until confirming that it will lock securely in the stowed position. This action confirms two important points: it indicates that the binocular assembly is properly seated in the mount, and that the assembly has not been mounted backwards.

Once the binocular assembly has been properly seated, press the lock release button and rotate the assembly to the",

    "Note:\nNever turn on the NVGs in brightly lighted areas. Repeated exposure to bright light will result in a reduction in the life of an intensification tube.\nThe following is a recommended order of procedures for obtaining a proper alignment. Using the same procedures in the same order will, over time, help ensure that none of the steps are inadvertently omitted. The procedures are conducted with the helmet on, and the NVG attached and in the operating position.",
    "1.\nVertical Adjustment. Adjust the vertical position of the binocular assembly using the\nvertical adjustment control. The binocular assembly should be located directly in front of the eyes.\n2.\nTilt Alignment. Adjust the tilt so the optical axis of the binocular assembly is perfectly aligned with the visual axis of the eyes. Changes in tilt usually require a correction in the vertical adjustment, and vice versa.\n3.",
    "3.\nEye Relief Adjustment. If necessary, move the binocular assembly closer to the eyes.\nAs discussed earlier, eye relief should be positioned to maximize the field of view without unnecessarily reducing the ability to see around the NVG to view cockpit displays or perform other tasks. It is especially important that the goggle never be positioned so close to the face that the eyepiece lens contact spectacles or eyelashes.\n4.",
    "4.\nIPD Adjustment. Close one eye and center the image in front of the opposite eye\n(e.g., close the left eye and, using the right IPD control, center the image in front of the right eye). Repeat for the opposite eye. With both eyes open, the two images should overlap to form a single image. Small adjustments may be necessary to form a single image.\n5.\nEvaluate Image. When the goggles are correctly aligned, there should be no shading",
    "of any part of the image. If shading is present, attempt to eliminate it by making adjustments in the direction of the shading. If there is insufficient travel in the goggle adjustments, move the entire helmet in the direction of shading. If proper alignment can only be made by moving the helmet, it is an indication that the mount assembly is not properly positioned on the helmet. In this case an attempt should be made to reposition the mount.\nG.2.3",
    "G.2.3\nFocus Procedures (For NVGs having variable focus objective lenses)",
    "These procedures are performed with the lights off. Stand at the appropriate distance from the resolution chart and turn on the NVG. The objective is to be able to see the grids well enough to determine whether the lines are horizontal or vertical. Every line in the grid may not be perfectly clear, but the direction of the lines should be readily apparent. Start by using the coarser grids, and then move to the finer grids as the adjustment process continues.",
    "1.\nObjective Focus. With one eye closed or one tube covered, turn the objective lens\n(outer ring) of the opposite tube while viewing one of the coarser grids. Attempt to bring the lines into sharp focus. Do not spend a great amount of time with this initial focus, as the purpose is to obtain an image that is adequate for permitting a suitable diopter adjustment.\n2.\nDiopter Focus. Next, turn the diopter focus adjustment (inner ring) counterclockwise",

Pause for one to two seconds to allow the eye muscles to relax, and then turn the diopter adjustment clockwise until the image first becomes quite sharp.

    "counterclockwise until the image blurs, then clockwise to the predetermined point of first image sharpness. Two or more of these exercises may be necessary in order to correctly set the diopter.",
    "Performed correctly, this procedure focuses the image on the retina of the eye without accommodative effort by the eye muscles. Rotating the diopter adjustment beyond the point of first sharpness forces the eye muscles to actively work to keep the image focused. Over time, the eye muscles will become fatigued and unable to maintain focus. This results in a gradual loss of visual acuity and depth perception and often causes severe eyestrain and/or headache.",
    "Note:\nThe diopter adjustment is the one most misunderstood, and if maladjusted can result in degraded visual acuity. It is essential to understand what the adjustment accomplishes and how to properly perform the procedure.",
    "3.\nReadjustment of Objective Focus. Once the diopter has been adjusted, fine-tune the\nfocus by readjusting with the objective adjustment to bring into focus as many of the grids as possible. This accomplishes two things. First, it assures the user that the diopter adjustment has been satisfactorily performed. Second, it allows for an accurate assessment of NVG performance.",
    "At first it may take several attempts going back and forth between the diopter and objective adjustments to obtain the best focus. However, once comfortable with the procedure and when familiar with the visual picture, focusing can be accomplished accurately and consistently with ease.",
    "4.\nFocus of Opposite Monocular. After focus of the first monocular is accomplished, the\nsame procedures are employed to focus and evaluate the remaining monocular. Do not be concerned if one side is slightly beter than the other. Slight differences in the performance of individual intensification tubes are common.",

    "1.\nEvaluate Visual Acuity. Visual acuity obtained with both eyes should always be at\nleast as good as that obtained by either side. If this is not the case, the goggles should be returned and another pair obtained. The minimum acceptable visual acuity will be established by the operator, but is always best to maximize NVG performance.\n2.\nEvaluate Image Quality. A number of image peculiarities and defects exist, some\nacceptable and others not acceptable. The most common include the following:",
    "acceptable and others not acceptable. The most common include the following:\na.\nShading. Appears as a shaded or indistinct area along the edge of the image. If it\ncannot be eliminated by adjusting the IPD or by moving the goggle toward the shading, the defect is likely within the optics and the NVG should not be used.\nb.\nEdge glow.

    "Note:\nNewer intensification tubes have improved signal to noise capability. Consequently, scintillation may be subtler and may not occur until darker conditions. If used to a certain level of scintillation under specific conditions, the use of an NVG with newer tubes may lead to an assumption that conditions are better than actual.",
    "## G.3 Procedures At The Aircraft Perform The Following Procedures Prior To Takeoff:",
    "1.\nFocus the NVG at Optical Infinity. If the NVG was focused to 20 feet in the eye lane,\nit will be necessary to refocus at infinity before flight using only the objective lens (unless the diopter setting has been inadvertently moved). This can be accomplished\nby focusing on an object at least 150 feet distant, preferably one with well developed",
    "by focusing on an object at least 150 feet distant, preferably one with well developed\nvertical or horizontal features. It must be illuminated well enough to be easily seen with NVGs but not so brightly lit that the image blooms or washes out. Avoid focusing on incompatible lights because the halo effect they create makes it difficult to discern when the image is in precise focus. Stars are excellent point light sources that do not cause halos and provide for a good endpoint for focusing.\nNote:",
    "Note:\nIf unable to perform this procedure prior to launch (e.g., takeoff during daylight), use the same guidelines in finding something to use for focusing to infinity while airborne.\n2.\nSet Aircraft Lighting and Display Intensity. Set lighting and display intensity so",
    "information can be easily interpreted when looking around or below the NVG. When the NVG is turned on, the brightness of the image will cause unaided night vision to be adversely affected. This will require cockpit lighting and display intensity to be increased in order to be able to immediately interpret information they present. If the lighting is set at a dimmer level, more heads-down time will be required to interpret the information, which may result in loss of situational awareness or, at",
