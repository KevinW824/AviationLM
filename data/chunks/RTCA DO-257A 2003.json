If an EMD is intended to be used as part of the\nnavigation system (e.g., if it is a required component for complex RNP procedures), the loss of that function could be a major failure condition. Similarly, the failure condition may be less severe depending on the intended function and resulting impact to the aircraft and flight crew.",

Equipment manufacturers shall document the intended function(s) of the EMD, within\nthe installation instructions and operating manual.\n3. For equipment that may not fully display curved path procedures, a note shall be\nadded to the AFM indicating that: curved path procedures (e.g. DME arcs) may not be\ndisplayed and to refer to the user documentation for further explanation.",
    "displayed and to refer to the user documentation for further explanation.\n4. For equipment that may not fully display curved path procedures, the user\ndocumentation shall provide textual and graphical explanations of what the pilot can expect the EMD to display, including a directive to use the CDI for guidance through\nthe turn.\nNote:    One means of compliance is to include a table listing known supported external equipment and the curved path depictions that will be displayed.",
    "5. Equipment using raster aeronautical charts (RAC) shall not be used for navigation\nwhile the RAC data is being displayed because inaccuracies in chart symbol placement and distortions are introduced by the production process.\n\n## 3.2 Installed Equipment Performance Requirements\n\nThis section contains operational and performance requirements that may influence the installation, physical location, and integration of the EMD equipment in the aircraft.\n\n## 3.2.1 Display Readability",

Operation of the equipment shall not be adversely affected by aircraft maneuvering\nencountered in normal flight operations.\n2. Operation of the equipment shall not interfere with the usability of other flight deck\ndisplays.",
    "## 3.2.3 Ammd System Installed Equipment Performance Requirements",
    "1. The total system accuracy shall be sufficient for the intended operation, and shall not\nexceed 100 meters (95%). The installed system should be evaluated to confirm compliance with the requirement in section 2.3.1.\n1.",
    "1. \nThe accuracy is sufficient for the intended function if, when the aircraft is on a runway or taxiway, the AMMD displays the ownship on that runway or taxiway.  This may mean that the symbol itself is depicted overlapping the true aircraft location, or that the aircraft's true location\nstays within the depicted accuracy circle.\n2.",
    "stays within the depicted accuracy circle.\n2. \nThe accuracy includes the effects of how latent data manifests itself into ownship position errors at the time of display. This includes the effects of a) not compensating vehicle movement during the latency period, b) not completely compensating (e.g., partial compensation), and/or c) errors\nin the compensation.\n3. \nThe accuracy includes the effects of the aircraft reference point, defined",
    "in the compensation.\n3. \nThe accuracy includes the effects of the aircraft reference point, defined\nas the accuracy of the location on the aircraft used to position the ownship symbol, or used in a surveillance position report.\n4.",
    "4. \nIt is understood that the most significant error source of the total system error is the available survey data for airports.  The achieved accuracy of the data is primarily an operational issue.  More accurate survey data will eventually become available, and errors in the existing survey data will be culled as error reports are generated and resolved as described in section 2.3.5.\n5. \nThe total system accuracy requirement is consistent with the runway",
    "5. \nThe total system accuracy requirement is consistent with the runway\nseparation criteria for large airports (see Appendix I). An example error\nallocation is: position accuracy of 36 meters (see section 2.3.1.1.1), data accuracy of 65 meters (taxiways, section 2.3.1.1.2), latency effects of 4.5 m, display errors of 0.5 m, and aircraft reference point bias of 25 m.  The resulting total system accuracy under these assumptions is:\n[(36 m) 2 + (65 m) 2 + (4.5 m) 2 + (0.5m) 2]½   + 25 = 100 m",
    "These values are only an example, and errors can be allocated differently (e.g., runway database accuracy can be less stringent if the aircraft reference point accuracy error is a smaller value). The runway and taxiway criteria in Appendix I can be used to establish accuracy objectives for specific operations typically indicates position accuracy is less than 15 meters, and the aircraft reference point error can be eliminated through calibration.",

    "## B.1 Glossary\n\nThe following is a glossary of terms in the document.  Additional words that have a special or unique meaning in this document are contained in section 1.8.\n\nAccuracy: a degree of conformance between the estimated or measured value and the true value. Note: for measured positional data, the accuracy is normally expressed in terms of a distance from a stated position within which there is a defined confidence of the true position falling. (Reference ICAO Annex 141).",
    "Note: relative accuracy is defined with reference to a geodetic datum.\n\nActive Fix: The fix or waypoint that is the current navigation reference for the host aircraft. Aerodrome (Airport): a defined area on land or water (including any buildings, installations, and equipment) intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure, and surface movement of aircraft. (Reference ICAO Annex 141).",
    "Aerodrome Moving Map Display: An EMD which depicts the aerodrome and ownship position on the airport surface. Aeronautical Database: any data that is stored electronically in a system that supports airborne or ground based aeronautical applications.  An Aeronautical Database may be updated at regular intervals. (Reference DO-200A/ED-7641)\nAltitude Tape:  A fixed-pointer moving-scale linear altimeter display.",
    "Analysis: Analysis is the method of verification which consists of comparing hardware or software design with known scientific and technical principles, technical data, or procedures and practices to validate that the proposed design will meet the specified functional and performance requirements.",
    "Bearing: The horizontal direction to or from any point, usually measured clockwise from true North, magnetic North, or some other reference point through 360 degrees. (Definition from the Airman's Information Manual) Data Quality: a degree or level of confidence that the data provided meets the requirements of the data user in terms of accuracy, resolution and integrity. (Reference ICAO Annex 152).",
    "Demonstration: Demonstration is the method of verification where qualitative versus quantitative validation of a requirement is made during a dynamic test of the equipment. In general, software functional requirements are validated by demonstration since the functionality must be observed through some secondary media. Desired Path: The path that the flight crew and air traffic control can expect the aircraft to fly, given a particular route, leg, or transition. Desired Track: The planned or",
    "the aircraft to fly, given a particular route, leg, or transition. Desired Track: The planned or intended track between two waypoints.  It is measured in degrees either magnetic or true North.  The instantaneous angle may change from point to point along the great circle track between waypoints.",
    "Display Scale: The relative proportion of the linear dimensions of objects on a display to the dimensions of the corresponding objects and distances being represented (e.g., 1 inch = 100 nautical miles) Fix: A generic name for a geographical position. A fix may be referred to as a fix, waypoint, intersection, reporting point, etc. Flight Plan: Refers to any sequence of fixes that are interconnected by the desired path. Flight plans may range from the simplest that include only the aircraft's",
    "by the desired path. Flight plans may range from the simplest that include only the aircraft's present position, the active waypoint, and the desired path in between, to more complicated plans that include departure and destination airports with multiple intermediate fixes.",
    "Flight Plan Mode:  See section 2.4.1.",
    "Horizontal Positional Accuracy: The difference between a target's measured horizontal position and its true horizontal position.  It is specified in terms of the 95 percent horizontal performance accuracy. Map Orientation: Refers to the rule that determines the directional relation of the map to the upper part of the display depiction. Thus, using a North-up rule, the North side of the map would be toward the top of the display and the south side of the map would be at the bottom. Using a",
    "be toward the top of the display and the south side of the map would be at the bottom. Using a desired path-up rule, the map would be oriented so that the desired path would be vertical on the map and pointing straight up toward the top of the display.",
    "Map Range: The geographic extent of the map region (e.g., the distance covered by the map representation in either the vertical or horizontal direction). Metadata: Metadata describe the content, quality, condition, and other characteristics of data. Metadata help a person to locate and understand data. Next Fix: The waypoint or fix immediately following the active fix in a flight plan or published flight procedure. Navigation:  The process of planning, recording, and controlling the movement of",
    "flight procedure. Navigation:  The process of planning, recording, and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another.    ****    (ICAO definition)",
    "Ownship: The aircraft in which the EMD function is resident.",
    "Plan view:  Conventional horizontal top down birds's eye view map display. Required Navigation Performance (RNP): A statement of the navigation performance accuracy necessary for operation within a defined airspace.  Note that there are additional requirements, beyond accuracy, applied to a particular RNP type.  See RTCA DO-236A45\n(Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards: Required Navigation Performance for Area Navigation).",
    "Runway: A defined rectangular area on a land aerodrome prepared for the landing and take-off of aircraft. [ICAO Annex 141]\nTaxiway: A defined path on a land aerodrome established for the taxiing of aircraft and intended to provide a link between one part of the aerodrome and another, including\n(RTCA DO-27248):",
    "a. *Aircraft stand taxilane.* A portion of an apron designed as a taxiway and intended to provide access to aircraft stands only. b. *Apron taxiway.* A portion of a taxiway system located on an apron and intended to provide a through taxiway route across the apron. c. *Rapid exit taxiway.* A taxiway connected to a runway at an acute angle and designed to allow landing aeroplanes to turn off at higher speeds than are achieved on other exit taxiways thereby minimizing runway occupancy times.",
    "higher speeds than are achieved on other exit taxiways thereby minimizing runway occupancy times. Track:  The projection on the earth's surface of the path of an aircraft, the direction of which is usually expressed in degrees from North (true, magnetic or grid) (ICAO definition).  The actual flight path of an aircraft over the surface of the earth (Reference the Airman's Information Manual).",

    "## Appendix F Raster Aeronautical Charts F.1 Introduction",
    "This appendix contains guidance and information related to Raster Aeronautical Chart",
    "(RAC) accuracy, processing, and metadata.  The most common application of a raster dataset is the display of scanned aeronautical charts.  However, it is not the intent of this appendix to determine which raster data sources are appropriate for use on EMD systems. Provided that the requirements for data content and legibility are met by the resulting system, the primary goal in the use of raster data is that the data be presented accurately with respect to the aircraft symbol, and with respect",
    "data is that the data be presented accurately with respect to the aircraft symbol, and with respect to any other data that may be overlaid.  The following requirements and guidelines are intended to provide assistance with this goal.",
    "## F.2 Validity\n\nIf aeronautical data is included in the raster image, then the following also apply:\n\n- \nThe source material must be approved for use in flight\n- \nThe EMD must annunciate the use of data from an expired source\n \nNote: this annunciation need not be continuously displayed.\n \nIf non-aeronautical charts are used as source material, the following should be considered:",
    "- \nReliability of the source - should be a government organization or maintain equivalent or better standards\n- \nAccuracy standards of the provider - charts should not contain gross errors or inconsistencies\n- \nSuitability of the chart contents - should be suitable for use in flight\n- \nCurrency of map or chart contents: data should not be significantly outdated (for\nexample, USGS Topographic Maps have an update cycle which is often 10-20 years,\ndata this outdated will likely be unacceptable",
    "## F.3 Accuracy\n\n \nThe accuracy of the raster dataset is dependent on a number of factors: the accuracy of the source data, the quality of the digitizing process, the accuracy of the geo-referencing process, and the correctness and sophistication of any warping and palette reduction applied.  Errors significant to navigation are likely to exist in any RAC dataset. It is important that the inherent inaccuracies of RAC displays be made apparent to the user.",
    "The recommended method for accomplishing this is to depict a \"circle of uncertainty\" around the aircraft symbol. This circle of uncertainty serves to remind the user that the depicted position is subject to a certain degree of doubt, and further to provide a quantitative indication of this uncertainty.",
    "The radius of the circle should consider feature placement standards of the originating charting agency and errors introduced by the processing steps. It is recommended that the radius indicate a 2-sigma (95%) confidence level based on a numerical analysis of the inherent errors.",
    "In addition, accuracy is affected by the position sensor.  It is assumed that Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) or equivalent will be used as the position sensor for RAC displays.  When this is the case, sensor error need not be considered because GNSS",
    "position errors will be insignificant in comparison with map errors.  If a position source other than GNSS is used, the position error inherent in the position sensor system must be taken into account and a corresponding increase of the radius of the circle of uncertainty may be required.",
    "In addition to the above technique, it is recommended that manufacturers include text similar to the following in the user manual and/or on a product identification screen.\n\nNote:  Discrepancies [of up to Xnm] in the placement of airport and navigational aid symbols are known to exist in the source material.  This product is not intended for navigation guidance.\n\n## F.3.1 Chart Accuracy",
    "## F.3.1 Chart Accuracy\n\n \nThe producers of paper charts generally allow a tolerance in the placement of chart symbols.  This enhances readability and the determination of proximate relationships\n(e.g. an airport symbol may be moved slightly so that it is clearly shown to be adjacent to a river or road).  Such movement of features is restricted by policies implemented by the chart producer.\n\n \nOther errors in the source charts may include cartographic error and projection error.",
    "Other errors in the source charts may include cartographic error and projection error.\n\nSuch errors are likely to be small in comparison to those introduced by feature placement.\n\nThe applicant should determine the symbol placement and accuracy standards of the supplier and apply these to the calculation of the \"radius of uncertainty\"\n \nAs an example, the following limits apply to VFR charts produced by the Federal Aviation Administration:",
    "- \nWorld Aeronautical Charts (1:1,000,000) should have a 3 NM radius.\n- \nSectional Aeronautical Charts (1:500,000) should have a 1.5 NM radius.\n- \nTerminal Area Charts (1:250,000) should have a .75 NM radius.\n- \nHelicopter Route Charts (1:125,000) should have a  .375 NM radius.\n\n## F.4 Processing",
    "## F.4 Processing\n\nThe manufacturer of an EMD system using RACs is likely to be involved in the production of data for the system. This may be as extensive as receiving paper charts and producing an electronic raster dataset, or as minimal as receiving the processed data from a third-party supplier. In either case there is a standard of quality and formal process definition that must be observed and followed by the manufacturer.",
    "RTCA DO-200A/EUROCAE ED-7641 defines a standard for the processing of aeronautical data.  This document was written to support vector data.  The following guidelines have been developed to supplement RTCA DO-200A/EUROCAE ED-7641 and address the processing of RAC data.

    "- \nScanning: The scanner must be calibrated and in good working order, with no\nscratches or other blemishes on the scanning surface. Scan resolution should be sufficient to ensure important details on the chart (e.g. text labels) are not made illegible in the raster dataset.  Similarly, the scanner will need to use enough colors to make possible a faithful reproduction of the chart's content.  The suggested minimum scanning resolution is 125 dots per inch.\n-",
    "- \nGeoreferencing: A sufficient number of georeferencing points should be placed\nwith sufficient accuracy to ensure an accurate mathematical fit can be computed for\nthe data. The maximum error between the computed fit and the raw data points (generally reported by the georeferencing tool) should not be greater than 2 pixels.\n-",
    "- \nProjection (warping): Image warping modifies the scanned image to make it conform to the computed mathematical fit, and may involve projection to a different coordinate system. Such a process should not reduce the legibility of the image to the degree where chart details are illegible.\nThe warping stage improves accuracy but may not be necessary if the target system can use the chart's native projection, and can fit the raw georeferencing data at runtime.",
    "Select: Refers to the selection of a subset of the entire data set, usually based on geographic regions. This step may occur after the format phase. Format: Takes the results of the assemble/translate phase and formats the data for use on the target system. This phase may not be necessary if the assemble/translate phase produces target-ready data. Generally this phase will include such steps as conversion to a target-readable graphics format, application of palette reduction and/or other",
    "as conversion to a target-readable graphics format, application of palette reduction and/or other compression techniques, and generation of data validity checks (e.g., checksum).

    "As required by DO-200A/EUROCAE ED-7641, each step will need to include some form of validation. Due to the reliance on software tools in the assemble/translate and format phases, it is important that a final, thorough verification is carried out on the final image prior to distribution. Due to the raster nature of the image, this would ideally include viewing of the entire image using the target software, with a number of spot-checks to verify that positional accuracy is within tolerance.
