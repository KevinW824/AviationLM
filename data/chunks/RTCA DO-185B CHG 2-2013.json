Specifically it reduces unnecessary TCAS interrogations when operating on the airport surface. These changes reduce initial TCAS interrogation power by 10 dB when TCAS is powered-on, and ensures that TCAS aircraft on the ground do not interrogate other on-ground TCAS aircraft while maintaining proper NTA3",
    "on the ground do not interrogate other on-ground TCAS aircraft while maintaining proper NTA3 and NTA6 counts for TCAS aircraft approaching an airport.  The Mode S surveillance volume is also limited to ± 3000 feet while the TCAS unit is operating on the ground.

    "Specifically, TCAS II will generate a surveillance track in range and altitude on a target-of-interest at the range and with the track probability and range accuracy specified below.  This is to ensure that a correct resolution advisory can be issued in time for the pilot to maintain adequate vertical separation at closest-point-ofapproach. \n--``````,,,``,,`,`,`,,`,,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---",
    "TCAS II will also generate, whenever possible, a surveillance track in range and altitude on a target-of-interest at the range and with the track probability and range accuracy specified below such that a correct traffic advisory can be issued as a precursor to the resolution advisory. \nIn addition to the surveillance requirements to support generation of resolution and traffic advisories, TCAS II will display the range and, if available, the altitude",

    "Whenever the TCAS aircraft determines that it is on the ground, TCAS \ninterrogations shall be limited by setting the NTA count in the interference limiting inequalities to a value three times the measured value.  This value will ensure that a TCAS operating on the ground does not add unnecessary",
    "interference by transmitting at power levels greater than is necessary to provide local area surveillance prior to departure.  The modified value of NTA will provide an approximate surveillance range of 3 NM in the highest density terminal areas to support reliable ground TCAS surveillance of local airborne traffic and a 14 NM range in very low density airspace to provide wide area surveillance in the absence of an SSR.

In order to provide timely acquisition of targets that transition the altitude surveillance boundary, the altitude of targets that are indicated to be outside of ±10,000 ft of own altitude when TCAS II is airborne, or outside of ±3,000 ft of own altitude when TCAS II is on the ground, shall continue to be monitored using DF=0 or DF=4 replies or, in the absence of such replies, by interrogating once",
