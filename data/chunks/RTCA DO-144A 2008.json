    "This document sets forth Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) airborne equipment.  Incorporated within these standards are system characteristics that will be useful to users of the system as well as designers, manufacturers and installers.  These performance standards represent a consolidation of performance requirements from two sources; RTCA/DO- 144, \"*Minimum Operational Characteristics for Airborne ATC Transponder Systems,\"*",

    "required to achieve at least that minimum performance, on which control and separation of aircraft is based, and to insure against derogation of service to other users of aviation navigation and communication services.  These MOPS are applicable to all users of airborne ATC transponder systems who are required by regulation to participate in the ATC system, or who voluntarily choose to do so.",
    "Note: The use of \"**shall**\" in the body of this document indicates a requirement.  The \nuse of \"**should**\" indicates a characteristic that is highly recommended, but is not \nrequired.",
    "It is recognized that any regulatory application of these standards is the responsibility of appropriate government agencies. Because the measured values of equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the measurement method, standard test conditions and methods of test are recommended in this document. This document considers an equipment configuration consisting of:  transponder, control panel, antenna and interconnecting cables.  It should not be inferred that all ATCRBS",

It should not be inferred that all ATCRBS airborne equipment will necessarily include all of the foregoing components as separate units; this will depend on the design configuration chosen by the manufacturer. If the equipment implementation includes a computer software package, the guidelines contained in the most current issue of RTCA/DO-178, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, should be considered.",
    "## 1.1.1 International Standards\n\nThe performance standards of this document also reflect current International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 10, Volume IV, Amendment 82, Chapter 3 requirements for airborne systems having only Mode A and Mode C capabilities. \n\n## 1.1.2 Preparation Of Minimum Operational Performance Standards For Airborne Systems",
    "The Federal Aviation Administration is the responsible agency for certain aviation standards.  However, FAA's regulatory effort is vastly improved by intelligent utilization of government/industry working arrangements, by which a variety and wealth of talent may be brought to bear on the development of a particular minimum requirement. Therefore, to implement the concepts that have been outlined, RTCA established Special Committee 209 to update the Minimum Operational Performance Standards for",

Accordingly, RTCA SC-209 was directed to consider such system characteristics that exist and to",

    "## 1.2 The Atcrbs Secondary Surveillance Radar (Ssr) Environment",
    "Although the trend towards equipage of ATCRBS/Mode Select (S) capable transponders is increasing, a large number of aircraft are still equipped with ATCRBS-only capable transponders.  Since Mode S transponders are required on aircraft with TCAS, Mode S transponders are installed on a large segment of the aircraft population.  However, General Aviation aircraft continue to represent the largest percentage of the aircraft in the airspace and ATCRBS transponders are still the dominant equipage for",
    "of the aircraft in the airspace and ATCRBS transponders are still the dominant equipage for these aircraft. The primary purpose of the ATCRBS transponder is to support ATC secondary surveillance radar (SSR) requirements. The ATCRBS SSR environment consists of the airborne ATCRBS transponders, ground interrogator-receiver, processing equipment, and an antenna system.  The antenna may or may not be associated with, or slaved to, a primary surveillance radar.  In operation, an interrogation",
    "not be associated with, or slaved to, a primary surveillance radar.  In operation, an interrogation pulse-pair transmitted from the interrogator-transmitter unit, via an antenna assembly, triggers each airborne transponder located in the direction of the main beam, causing a multiple pulse reply group to be transmitted from each transponder.  These replies are received by the ground receiver and, after processing, are displayed to the controller.  Measurement of the round-trip transit time",
    "and, after processing, are displayed to the controller.  Measurement of the round-trip transit time determines the range (rho) to the replying aircraft while the mean direction of the main beam of the interrogator antenna, during the reply, determines the azimuth (theta).  Based on the time spacing of the interrogation pulse-pair transmitted, the airborne transponder provides a multiple-pulse reply that represents either an individualized identity code (Mode A reply) or the aircraft's current",
    "that represents either an individualized identity code (Mode A reply) or the aircraft's current pressure altitude",
    "(Mode C reply). The ATCRBS transponder also replies to airborne Mode A and Mode C interrogators, thereby making its presence known to aircraft that are equipped with Traffic Advisory and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) or Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS). Additional information on ground and airborne interrogator characteristics is contained in Â§2.1.10.",
    "## 1.3 Assumptions\n\nThis document defines the basic surveillance and link characteristics of ATCRBS transponders.  Adherence to the requirements of this document will meet the needs of the airspace for surveillance of aircraft so equipped.  There is no upgrade path for the ATCRBS system going forward as surveillance needs of the future may rely on different technologies. \n\n## 1.4 Equipage Classes",
    "## 1.4 Equipage Classes\n\nClass A equipment is intended for installation in aircraft which operate at altitudes above 15,000 feet.  Additional information on Class A equipment is contained in Â§2.2.3.2.1. Class B equipment is intended for installation in aircraft which operate at altitudes not exceeding 15,000 feet.  Additional information on Class B equipment is contained in Â§2.2.3.2.2.   \n\n## 1.5 Test Procedures",

In such cases, the procedures cited should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures.",

The order of tests suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of different tests as it moves from design and design qualification into operational use.
