    "## 1.2 System Overview",
    "TCAS with hybrid surveillance is used as a means to decrease Mode S interrogations. Hybrid surveillance allows TCAS to use passive surveillance instead of active surveillance to track intruders that meet certain criteria and are not projected to be nearterm collision threats.  Passive surveillance is surveillance performed using data broadcast from other aircraft. Passive surveillance data is provided by an on-board navigation source that is typically based on GPS. For the TCAS hybrid",
    "is provided by an on-board navigation source that is typically based on GPS. For the TCAS hybrid surveillance defined in this document, the passive surveillance data is broadcast and received through the use of Mode S extended squitter, i.e., 1090 MHz ADS-B, which is described in Ref. C. Active surveillance uses the standard TCAS/transponder interrogations/replies that provide range, bearing and altitude to the intruder. There are two passive surveillance techniques: the first is called",
    "and altitude to the intruder. There are two passive surveillance techniques: the first is called 'extended hybrid surveillance' and can be used when an intruder's ADS-B position data meets certain quality and power requirements. The second technique, called 'hybrid surveillance' or 'standard hybrid surveillance,' must use TCAS active interrogations to validate the passive surveillance position. Figure 1 - 1 illustrates how the system transitions from extended hybrid surveillance through hybrid",
    "1 - 1 illustrates how the system transitions from extended hybrid surveillance through hybrid surveillance to active surveillance as a function of collision potential. When the intruder is far from being a threat, it is tracked with passive surveillance. If the intruder meets all conditions for extended hybrid surveillance, the intruder is tracked using ADS-B data exclusively.  Otherwise hybrid surveillance is used, and the passive surveillance position is validated every 10 to 60 seconds with",
    "is used, and the passive surveillance position is validated every 10 to 60 seconds with a TCAS active interrogation.  When the intruder comes close to being a collision threat in altitude and range (referred to in this section as a near threat), it is tracked with active surveillance at a 1 Hz interrogation rate. The conditions that determine that an intruder is a near threat ensure that the system transitions to active surveillance in time to issue a traffic advisory (TA) and a resolution",
    "system transitions to active surveillance in time to issue a traffic advisory (TA) and a resolution advisory (RA) if needed.",
    "Figure 1 - 2 and Figure 1 - 3 are flow diagrams illustrating possible transitions between surveillance methods for surface and airborne operation. Figure 1 - 2 illustrates the transitions between the three surveillance techniques (active, hybrid, and extended hybrid) when own ship is Taking Off/Airborne (Â§2.2.8). Intruder tracks can be established either exclusively by extended hybrid surveillance or exclusively by active surveillance. The system initiates an intruder track with extended hybrid",
    "or exclusively by active surveillance. The system initiates an intruder track with extended hybrid surveillance (Â§2.2.5.2) when own and intruder data meet data quality requirements (Â§2.2.5.2.1) and the intruder's signal strength is lower (weaker) or equal to the extended hybrid surveillance MTL (Â§2.2.5.2.3, Â§2.2.5.2.4). In all other cases the system initiates an intruder track using active surveillance.",
    "Once under active surveillance, if an intruder is not a near threat in both altitude and range and its passive position data is successfully validated (Â§2.2.6.1.2, Â§2.2.6.3), the intruder can be tracked using hybrid surveillance, and the passive surveillance data is revalidated regularly (Â§2.2.7.5). If revalidation fails, the intruder transitions to active surveillance. The intruder transitions from hybrid to extended hybrid surveillance (Â§2.2.7.2.2.2) if own and intruder data meet data quality",
    "hybrid to extended hybrid surveillance (Â§2.2.7.2.2.2) if own and intruder data meet data quality requirements (Â§2.2.5.2.1) and the intruder's signal strength is lower or equal to the extended hybrid surveillance MTL (Â§2.2.5.2.3). Once the intruder is tracked passively (extended hybrid or hybrid surveillance), the hybrid threat status is monitored once per second (Â§2.2.6.1.4). If an intruder becomes a near threat in range and altitude, it transitions to active surveillance. When the passive data",
    "a near threat in range and altitude, it transitions to active surveillance. When the passive data are available but not qualified, or the intruder's signal strength is higher (stronger) than the extended hybrid surveillance MTL (Â§2.2.5.2.3, Â§2.2.5.2.4), the intruder transitions from extended hybrid surveillance to hybrid surveillance (Â§2.2.7.1.3).",
    "A track is maintained under extended hybrid surveillance (Â§2.2.7.2.1) as long as own and intruder data meet data quality requirements, (Â§2.2.5.2.1) and the intruder's signal strength is lower or equal to the extended hybrid surveillance MTL and the intruder is not a near threat in range and altitude.",
    "Figure 1 - 3 illustrates the transitions between the three surveillance techniques when own ship is operating on the surface (Â§2.2.8).  In contrast to airborne operation (Figure 1 - 2), strong signal level does not require active surveillance acquisition (Â§2.2.5.2), and signal level is not a factor in determining transitions between extended hybrid and hybrid surveillance (Â§2.2.7.2.2.2, Â§2.2.7.1.3). Data quality (Â§2.2.5.2.1) is the only and sufficient condition for transition to extended hybrid",

    "The intended function of a TCAS with hybrid surveillance as defined in this minimum performance specification includes all the functionality of TCAS defined in Ref. A with the addition of the hybrid surveillance function.

While TCAS is operating on the airport surface airborne intruders will be displayed as Non-Threat or Proximate traffic, but not as a Traffic Advisory.

Although the operation of TCAS on the airport surface has become common practice, such use was not intended.

Loss of the hybrid surveillance function does not degrade the minimum TCAS function defined in Ref. A.",

    "The second error effect is the difference between the uncorrected barometric altitude and the true (corrected) altitude above mean sea level (above the geoid). This is due to atmospheric pressure variations.

At sea level, the pressure varies with altitude at a rate of 3.5 mbar per 30 m (Ref. F); these pressure differences would give altitude errors (reported - true) in the range of - 523 m to +317 m (-1716 ft to +1040 ft).",

Frequency regulators and civil aviation authorities in congested airspace are concerned about increased use of the 1030/1090 MHz radio frequency bands used for transponder-based aircraft surveillance. Reducing active interrogations through the use of hybrid surveillance helps to ensure that transponder occupancy times will not increase to the point where there would be degradation in such surveillance.

A secondary benefit of hybrid surveillance is that the flight crew may see more targets on the TCAS display in congested traffic. TCAS performs interference limiting in congested airspace, which can have the effect of reducing the number of targets that are displayed. Reduced spectrum use lessens the need for TCAS to limit the surveillance targets.",

If no targets qualify for passive surveillance, TCAS operates exactly as it does today. If some targets do qualify for passive surveillance, TCAS will reduce the number of active interrogations against those targets and reduce spectrum use.  \n\n## D.1.1.4 Aircraft Impact",

Valid tracks may be updated by active surveillance position reports once per second, in which case",

One way that the CAS range track for an intruder under hybrid TCAS might be substantially different from the track for the same intruder under non-hybrid TCAS is if hybrid TCAS was permitted to use passive surveillance data to generate advisories (that is, if passive surveillance reports were passed as NORMAL surveillance reports rather than as REDUCED surveillance reports).",

It is also assumed that, given a successful revalidation, the range rate estimated from previous passive position reports",

Finally, it is assumed that the TCAS aircraft and the intruder can accelerate toward each other at an acceleration of at most 1/3 g (11 ft/s2).

Such constant acceleration is not realistic in many aircraft geometries, as aircraft typically accelerate by turning rather than by substantial speed changes.

It could optionally be further quantized to the set of values 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 seconds used in the table of validation intervals.",

Another observation is that the equation in step 2 of the above procedure could also be used for the third time segment, ignoring the t2 boundary. That would correspond to the assumption that the intruder's acceleration does not stop when the closure rate reaches 1200 kt, allowing the closure rate to grow larger than that. The resulting times will be smaller than",

Hence, safety will not be compromised, but slightly higher interrogation rates will result.

    "The principle motivation for updating DO-300 to Version A was to modify the hybrid surveillance algorithms to reduce the TCAS use of the 1090 MHz channel. A number of algorithm changes were proposed by members of the SC-147 Surveillance Working Group (SWG). These proposed changes were evaluated using a Lincoln Laboratory TCAS surveillance simulation to understand the associated impact on the 1090 MHz channel. This appendix provides a high level description of the changes to the surveillance",

    "## F.2 Simulation And Input Data Set",
    "A high fidelity TCAS surveillance simulation has been developed and updated over the last two decades to analyze the impact of changes to the TCAS surveillance algorithms. The simulation takes as input aircraft position tracks with associated transponder equipages (ie, ATCRBS, Mode S only, and Mode S with TCAS). The surveillance activity for each TCAS aircraft present in the dataset is simulated in one second intervals. The TCAS surveillance metrics of interest are output for each aircraft,",
    "in one second intervals. The TCAS surveillance metrics of interest are output for each aircraft, such as number of interrogations and surveillance range for TCAS aircraft and reply rates and transponder utilization for victim transponders. The most important area in which to analyze reduction in RF channel usage by TCAS is a dense terminal region. Hybrid surveillance can make the greatest impact here as this type of an environment would experience particularly high levels of RF interference.",
    "here as this type of an environment would experience particularly high levels of RF interference. The analysis was therefore focused on the New York City area as this airspace has been noted as being one of the most dense aircraft environments in the country. An input data set was generated from radar tracks covering a circular area centered about the JFK radar with a radius of 120 NM. These radar tracks were taken from Sunday, November 29, 2009 between 17:00 and 18:00 EST as this hour was",
    "radar tracks were taken from Sunday, November 29, 2009 between 17:00 and 18:00 EST as this hour was observed to be of particularly high Mode S density.",
    "The following assumptions were made in the simulation for this analysis: \n1. All TCAS in the simulated scenario are equipped with the surveillance modification \nunder test \n2. For the hybrid surveillance modifications, all Mode S aircraft are ADS-B equipped 3. TCAS does not perform altitude monitoring using DF=0 and DF=4 FRUIT messages \n(Ref. A, Â§2.2.4.6.2.2.1)",
    "(Ref. A, Â§2.2.4.6.2.2.1) \n4. There is no upper limit on the number of aircraft TCAS instantaneously tracks 5. Information in airborne position messages (lat/lon/alt) is always valid and is always \naccurate",

Any aircraft marked as being non-crosslink capable is tracked actively 9. Aircraft on the ground at an airport are able to communicate with all other aircraft on \nthe ground at the same airport",
    "## F.3 Evaluate Algorithm Changes\n\nMany changes to the surveillance algorithms were proposed by members of the SWG. A number of these proposed changes were removed from consideration due to minimal impact on the 1090 MHz channel and/or difficulty to implement. The following subsections summarize those algorithm changes that were picked to be incorporated into Change 2 of DO-185B and Version A of DO-300.",
    "## F.3.1 Algorithm Changes To Do-185B F.3.1.1 Reduced Surveillance Volume When Operating On Airport Surface",
    "There were two parts that contributed to this algorithm change. First was a change that reduced the full TCAS interrogation power by 10 dB when TCAS is powered on. Prior to DO-185B Change 2, TCAS units were initialized to full interrogation power (maximum surveillance range) when TCAS was first powered-on. This initialization value lengthened the amount of time required for a newly powered-on TCAS in a busy environment to decrease its power, through interference limiting, to the proper level.",
    "in a busy environment to decrease its power, through interference limiting, to the proper level. For example, it would take a TCAS unit 104 seconds (13 steps Ã 8 seconds freeze time per step) to reach the maximum 13 dB on-ground attenuation in a busy terminal environment. While the TCAS unit was \"frozen\" between eight second steps, interrogations would have been sent to all aircraft within communication range, resulting in increased utilization of those aircraft's transponders. The issue was",
    "range, resulting in increased utilization of those aircraft's transponders. The issue was exacerbated by the fact that aircraft powering on TCAS on the ground are usually located at the peak of local aircraft density (the busy airport surface). The second part of this algorithm change was to reduce the relative altitude threshold for targets of interest while TCAS is operating on the ground. While it was intended for TCAS to be activated only immediately prior to taking the active runway,",
    "While it was intended for TCAS to be activated only immediately prior to taking the active runway, analysis of surveillance data had indicated that many aircraft were activating their TCAS well before reaching the active runway (Ref. M, Appendix B). Although RTCA DO-185B limits TCAS interrogation more significantly while own aircraft is on the ground than when airborne, even with severe interference limiting DO-185B requires a TCAS to interrogate aircraft that are within Â±10,000 ft of own",
    "limiting DO-185B requires a TCAS to interrogate aircraft that are within Â±10,000 ft of own aircraft. Reduction of TCAS altitude surveillance volume to Â±3000 ft while on the ground was found to reduce unnecessary interrogations while on the ground without significant loss of situational awareness.",
    "## F.3.1.2 Eliminating Range Monitoring Interrogations To On-Ground Tcas Aircraft When Own Tcas Is On The Ground",
    "The interference limiting algorithms described in DO-185B require that a TCAS unit adjust its receiver sensitivity and interrogation power level based upon, among other parameters, the number of other TCAS equipped aircraft within 3 and 6 NM (NTA3 and NTA6). A TCAS unit above 2000 ft AGL includes only airborne TCAS in the NTA3 and NTA6 values; a TCAS unit â¤ 2000 ft AGL includes both airborne and on-ground TCAS in the NTA3 and NTA6 values. TCAS typically determines these values by simply",
    "and on-ground TCAS in the NTA3 and NTA6 values. TCAS typically determines these values by simply counting the number of TCAS equipped aircraft that are currently under track and within the specified range. However, DO-185B does not allow TCAS to actively track other aircraft on the ground. Therefore to include TCAS aircraft operating on the airport surface in the NTA3 and NTA6 calculations, a TCAS unit â¤ 2000 ft AGL is required to monitor other TCAS aircraft on the ground through an",
    "a TCAS unit â¤ 2000 ft AGL is required to monitor other TCAS aircraft on the ground through an interrogation every 5 seconds. It was found that when own TCAS is on the ground, these monitoring interrogations for determining NTA3 and NTA6 were an unnecessary use of the RF spectrum as other interference limiting procedures exist to restrict interrogations by TCAS operating on the airport surface.  This modification precludes TCAS operating on the airport surface from interrogating other TCAS",
    "This modification precludes TCAS operating on the airport surface from interrogating other TCAS operating on the airport surface.",
    "## F.3.2 Algorithm Changes To Do-300 F.3.2.1 Passively Monitor Tcas Aircraft When Below 2000 Ft Agl",
    "This algorithm change was based on the same principle described in Â§F.3.1.2 where DO-",
    "185B required TCAS below 2000 ft to interrogate other TCAS aircraft on the ground for the sole purpose of determining NTA3 and NTA6. With the change in Â§F.3.1.2, when own TCAS is on the ground, these interrogations were eliminated to reduce TCAS use of the 1090 MHz channel. However, a TCAS with Hybrid Surveillance could continue to monitor such targets through the passive reception of ADS-B messages. Therefore a change was made to the TCAS Hybrid Surveillance algorithms such that monitoring",
    "Therefore a change was made to the TCAS Hybrid Surveillance algorithms such that monitoring interrogations for the calculation of NTA3 and NTA6 would be replaced with the passive monitoring of these targets.",
    "## F.3.2.2 Two Validation Attempts",
    "To ensure that a target would always be tracked actively prior to an alert, the original version of DO-300 required that any failure to validate a passive track would require an immediate transition to active tracking. The cause for such a failure could include TCAS not receiving a reply to the validation interrogation. Since failing to receive a reply to an interrogation attempt is not uncommon, it was observed that this safeguard could prematurely and undesirably require TCAS to transition a",
    "it was observed that this safeguard could prematurely and undesirably require TCAS to transition a valid passive target to active tracking. To avoid passive tracks unnecessarily transitioning to active tracking, the validation algorithms were changed such that the transition to active tracking would only occur if validation replies were not received for multiple consecutive surveillance cycles. The simulation performed for this analysis assumed that this transition would occur after two",
    "The simulation performed for this analysis assumed that this transition would occur after two consecutive surveillance cycles; however the requirement specified in Â§2.2.7.5 of this document allows validation to be attempted in up to five consecutive surveillance cycles.",
    "## F.3.2.3 Variable Validation Rate",
    "The original version of DO-300 required that all passively tracked targets have their ADS-B position information periodically validated with a TCAS interrogation. The requirements were that an ADS-B equipped target close in either range or altitude (but not both) be validated once every 10 seconds while a target neither close in range nor altitude be validated once every 60 seconds. It was determined that a reduction in TCAS use of the 1090 MHz channel could be achieved by simply modifying",
    "that a reduction in TCAS use of the 1090 MHz channel could be achieved by simply modifying these validation rates. New logic to determine the validation rate for a passive track was developed to still remain within the constraints of the existing DO-300 safety study. Notionally, this new logic is the following: if an ADS-B equipped target is close in both altitude and range, the target should be tracked with active surveillance (i.e. only use TCAS active interrogations to calculate the relative",
    "with active surveillance (i.e. only use TCAS active interrogations to calculate the relative position of the target). If the target is not close in altitude, then the target should be validated once every 60 seconds. If the target is close in altitude but not range, the target should be validated at a rate between 10 and 60 seconds with this variable rate based on a 'worst case' calculation. This calculation is considered 'worst case' as it assumes the other aircraft will accelerate toward own",
    "calculation is considered 'worst case' as it assumes the other aircraft will accelerate toward own ship with the TCAS MOPS defined maximum for combined acceleration of 1/3 g. The variable validation rate is given in this document as both an equation and a table in Â§2.2.7.5.",
    "## F.3.2.4 Use Of Short Replies For Validation",
    "With the original version of DO-300, validation was performed using crosslink interrogations which elicited replies containing the ADS-B position of the target aircraft. This allowed for a very straightforward validation technique as the ADS-B position information included in the reply could be directly compared with slant range and bearing derived from the active interrogation; i.e., no interpolation or time alignment of passive and active position was necessary. While this validation",
    "interpolation or time alignment of passive and active position was necessary. While this validation technique was simple to implement, it had a negative side effect from the point of view of 1090 MHz channel use.",
    "The reply elicited by a crosslink interrogation is twice the length of a reply to a standard TCAS interrogation. Therefore the use of crosslink interrogations for validation purposes negated some of the benefit yielded by hybrid surveillance. It was determined that a reduction in 1090 MHz channel use could be achieved by requiring TCAS to perform validation using standard interrogations which elicit replies that are half the length of those from crosslink interrogations. The additional",
    "elicit replies that are half the length of those from crosslink interrogations. The additional processing required to perform this alternative validation technique (i.e., extrapolation for time alignment) was determined to be negligible.",
    "## F.3.2.5 Extended Hybrid Surveillance",
    "The original version of DO-300 contained two requirements that were eliminated in DO- 300A. The first was that a TCAS with Hybrid Surveillance had to acquire a target with the procedure described in DO-185B (i.e., acquisition using active interrogations) before that target could be tracked passively. The second was that all passive tracks were required to be validated with a periodic interrogation. It was determined that a reduction in the TCAS use of the 1090 MHz channel could be accomplished",
    "It was determined that a reduction in the TCAS use of the 1090 MHz channel could be accomplished by relaxing these requirements for target aircraft that are considered non-threatening and reporting high quality ADS-B information.",
    "This surveillance algorithm change was achieved by allowing a TCAS with Hybrid Surveillance to passively acquire and track qualified ADS-B equipped target aircraft without validation. Surveillance of such aircraft was governed by rules that became known as Extended Hybrid Surveillance. In the most basic sense, a target aircraft would qualify for Extended Hybrid Surveillance if it was reporting high quality ADS-B information and its squitters were received at a power level below -68 dBm. Since",
    "quality ADS-B information and its squitters were received at a power level below -68 dBm. Since received power level can be considered a rough surrogate for range, this change allowed for distant ADS-B equipped targets to be acquired passively without any interrogations. Furthermore, this change eliminated the need to periodically validate ADS-B equipped aircraft that were far away and non-threatening.",
    "## F.3.2.6 Passive Only Surveillance On The Ground",
    "As noted in Â§F.3.1.2, data collections showed that many more TCAS were operating on the airport surface than previously expected. While the algorithm changes described in \n--``````,,,``,,`,`,`,,`,,,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---",
    "Â§F.3.1.1, Â§F.3.1.2 and Â§F.3.2.1 reduced the number of interrogations used by TCAS when on the ground, it was recognized that a TCAS with Hybrid Surveillance could eliminate most interrogations by performing only passive surveillance on targets that are reporting high quality ADS-B information.  Prior to DO-300A, the TCAS Hybrid Surveillance requirements did not distinguish between airborne operation and operation on the ground. While this modification to the Hybrid Surveillance MOPS was",
    "operation and operation on the ground. While this modification to the Hybrid Surveillance MOPS was evaluated in simulation as an independent change, it was considered part of Extended Hybrid Surveillance during the MOPS modification process due to a large similarity in the requirements.",
    "## F.4 Results\n\nThe surveillance algorithm changes described in Â§F.3 were evaluated using the simulation described in Â§F.2. These algorithm changes were compared against two baseline scenarios to understand the relative impact on the 1090 MHz channel. The first baseline scenario assumed all TCAS aircraft were equipped with a DO-185B compliant unit while the second baseline assumed all TCAS aircraft were equipped with a DO-300 compliant unit.",
    "The metric chosen to understand the impact of each algorithm change was the 1090 MHz Receiver Occupancy. This metric describes the percentage of time a receiver with a minimum triggering level (MTL) of -74 dBm is occupied due to the decoding of TCAS \ngenerated replies. The calculation is performed through the summation of relevant replies received multiplied by the length of the reply. For example, if an antenna received 100",
    "short reply messages (each 64 Ps in length) and 50 long reply message (each 120 Ps in length) the  1090 MHz Receiver Occupancy would be (100*0.000064) + (50*0.000120) = 1.24%.",
    "Within the simulation, the 1090 MHz TCAS Receiver Occupancy was calculated for those TCAS aircraft that were less than 30 NM from the JFK sensor. This metric was then averaged over all such TCAS aircraft and over the entire hour of the input data set. This averaging resulted in one value of 1090 MHz Receiver Occupancy for the scenario under consideration. Results were then compared against the baseline cases to highlight the relative reduction in 1090 MHz Receiver Occupancy. The relative",
    "the baseline cases to highlight the relative reduction in 1090 MHz Receiver Occupancy. The relative reduction provided by each surveillance algorithm change is provided in the second and third columns of Table F-1. As an example, Table F-1 indicates that Extended Hybrid Surveillance provided a 26% reduction in 1090 MHz Receiver Occupancy when compared against a baseline of DO-185B (column 2, row 9) and an 11% reduction when compared against the original version of DO-300 (column 3, row 9).",
    "As it was understood that multiple surveillance algorithm changes would be reflected in the final version of DO-300A, several combinations of algorithm changes were also examined. The bottom two rows of Table F-1 are the relative reduction in 1090 MHz Receiver Occupancy provided by a combination of multiple surveillance algorithm changes. The algorithm changes included in each group are indicated by shaded cells. As an example, Group A included the two modifications that were specific to",

This group provided a 24% reduction in 1090 MHz Receiver Occupancy when compared against a baseline of DO-185B. Column H of Table F-1 most closely represents the modifications that were included in Version A of DO-300.  This column and the requirements in this document differ in only two manners.
