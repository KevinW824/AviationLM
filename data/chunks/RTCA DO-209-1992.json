    "## Simultaneous Voice Transmissions Purpose And Scope 1.0 Introduction 1.1\n\nThis document sets forth minimum operational performance standards for systems that minimize blocked transmissions used in Air traffic Control (ATC) two-way radio voice communications due to simultaneous transmissions. \n\nIncorporated within these standards are system characteristics that should be beneficial to users of the systems as well as to designers, manufacturers and installers.",
    "Compliance with these standards is recommended as a means of assuring that the equipment will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in routine operations. \n\nAny regulatory application of this document is the sole responsibility of appropriate government agencies.",
    "Because the measured values of equipment performance characteristics may be a function of the measurement method, standard test conditions and methods of test are recommended in this document. \n\nThis document considers an equipment configuration consisting of: \ntransmitter, receiver, power supply, microphone, control panels, antenna, interconnecting cables, and related accessories.",
    "It should not be inferred that all equipment will necessarily include all of the foregoing components as separate units. \n\nThis will depend on the specific design configuration chosen by the manufacturer. \n\nAdditional functions and components that may refer to expanded equipment capabilities that exceed the stated minimum requirements are identified as optional features. Equipment features that are beyond the scope of this document may be developed in future RTCA activities.",
    "If the equipment implementation includes a computer software package, the guidelines contained in RTCA/DO-178A, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, shall be considered. \n\n## System Overview 1.2",
    "## System Overview 1.2\n\nThe aviation communications system includes ground-based and airborne receiving and transmitting equipment which provides air-to-ground, ground-to-air, air-to-air and ground-to-ground voice and data communications. The equipment addressed in this document provides the means for reducing simultaneous transmissions that adversely affect two-way voice radio communications.",
    "Disruption to voice communications in the ATC system presents the potential for degrading flight safety. Although these communication disruptions may occur in areas where traffic density is low, the growth of air traffic (and communications) \nhas increased the number of disruption incidents.",
    "The FAA has concluded, as early as 1968, that the occurrence of communication disruptions presented serious problems, e.g., the loss of separation standards between aircraft, near mid-air collisions, delays, and potentially disastrous disruptions of traffic flow. \n\nVarious educational programs and advisory material issued by the FAA have not reduced the problem. \n\nIn fact, subsequent surveys have indicated that the problem has intensified.",
    "In fact, subsequent surveys have indicated that the problem has intensified. \n\nIn 1984, the FAA was petitioned to enact rulemaking requiring two-way radio communication systems employing anti-blocking and stuck microphone protection circuitry. The FAA subsequently published the petition for rulemaking for public comment. \n\nThe majority of responses to the petition for rulemaking were favorable.",
    "Because an industry standard for such devices was not available, the FAA deferred further action on the petition for rulemaking and requested that RTCA, Incorporated, establish a Special Committee to develop appropriate guidance and equipment standards. As a result of the FAA's request, RTCA established Special Committee 163 to develop design criteria and guidance information pertaining to unintentional or simultaneous transmissions that adversely affect two-way radio communications and to",
    "or simultaneous transmissions that adversely affect two-way radio communications and to develop minimum operational performance standards",
    "(MOPS) \nfor devices that minimize unintentional and/or simultaneous voice transmissions.",
    "This MOPS only addresses simultaneous transmissions. \n\nThis is defined as the occurrence of two or more operators transmitting on the same frequency at the same time. \n\n## 1,3 Operational Application\n\nThis specification is applicable to ground-based, ground-mobile and airborne twoway UHF and VHF radio voice communications equipment used for control of air traffic. \n\nThese standards apply to three different methods of incorporation: \nretrofit, modification and new designs.",
    "## 1.4 Operational Goals\n\nThese devices are intended to minimize communication disruptions caused by simultaneous voice transmissions that are detrimental to the safety and efficiency of flight operations. \n\nEquipment designers, manufacturers and installers are encouraged to provide indications or annunciations to the pilot of transmitter operation, or of impending or existing actions by the equipment to inhibit transmitter operation.",
    "Refer to Appendix A for an analysis of the effectiveness of the devices intended to minimize communication disruptions caused by simultaneous voice transmission. \n\n## Assumptions Simultaneous Transmissions\n\nSimultaneous voice transmissions are generally considered detrimental to communication. \n\nThus the initiation of a voice transmission on an occupied frequency is undesirable and should be inhibited.",
    "However, there are environments or conditions when simultaneous transmissions are normal operational occurrences, for example: \n\na. \nUNICOM \nb. \nMULTICOM \nC. \nCommon Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) \nd. \nFlight Service Station Frequencies \ne. \nFlight Watch Frequency \nThese environments exist because a single frequency is assigned to several facilities in the same geographical area. \n\n## Normal Atc Communications 1.5.1.1",
    "## Normal Atc Communications 1.5.1.1\n\nWhen human monitoring is used to determine channel availability, simultaneous voice transmissions are inevitable, even when proper radio communication procedures are followed by all users. \n\nThis situation creates a potential to adversely affect flight safety. \n\nFurthermore, this potential is increased by frequency congestion caused by a large demand for a specific frequency, especially in areas of high traffic density.",
    "## Emergency Communications 1.5.1.2\n\nAn emergency condition may require unrestrained radio operation, therefore, provisions must be made to override transceiver-inhibiting circuits. \n\n## Offset Carrier Communications 1.5.1.3",
    "## Offset Carrier Communications 1.5.1.3\n\nThe devices described in this document may be less effective in preventing conflict between an aircraft and an offset carrier ground station than in preventing conflict between an aircraft and a single carrier ground station. The effectiveness of the device is dependent on the design of the activity detector. \n\n## Activity Detector 1.5.2",
    "## Activity Detector 1.5.2\n\nIn the context of this specification, receiver activity is defined as response to a signal strength normally associated with reception of voice transmissions from ATC or other aircraft. \n\nAny circuitry that inhibits transmissions should not be activated by reception of insufficient signal power to \n\"lift squelch\" \nof the associated receiver.",
    "Activity detectors which measure AGC voltage are likely to inhibit transmission \n~ \nmore often than necessary if set for weak signals. \n\nThose which measure noise level may fail to inhibit the transmitter when multiple carriers are present in the passband.",
    "Operationally, and with any means of simultaneous voice transmission prevention, it is acceptable to ignore weaker received signals and to respond only to those levels of signal normally found in radio communication exchanges. In reality, any device that does this will prevent those simultaneous voice transmissions that may be disruptive and, therefore, hazardous to communication.",
    "The time required for the detection of activity on the frequency is an important factor in determining the probability of conflict transmission prevention. The time required to detect inactivity on the frequency is important in preventing unwanted or spurious inhibition of the transmitter. \n\n## 1.5.3 Transmitter Delay Time\n\nThe longer the delay time between keying the transmitter and RF output the greater the likelihood of conflicting with other transmissions.",
    "Transmitters with shorter delay times produce fewer conflicts for their operators, because they are more likely to be in the process of transmitting when other radios test for activity. \n\n## 1.6 Test Procedures\n\nThe test procedures specified in this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the performance requirements. Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred.",
    "These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information. \n\nIn such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one Criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures. \n\nThe order of test specified suggests that the equipment be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design and design qualification into operational use.",
    "For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2.0 \nshall have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section 3.0. \n\nThree types of test procedures are specified. \n\nThese include: \n\n## A. Environmental Tests\n\nEnvironmental test requirements are specified in Subsection 2.3.",
    "## A. Environmental Tests\n\nEnvironmental test requirements are specified in Subsection 2.3. \n\nThe procedures and their associated limit requirements are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions expected to be encountered in actual operations.",
    "Unless otherwise specified, the environmental conditions and test procedures contained in RTCA/DO-160C, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment, will be used to demonstrate equipment compliance. \n\n## B. Bench Tests\n\nBench test procedures are specified in Subsection 2.4. These tests provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Subsection 2.2.",
    "Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design. \n\n## Cc. Installed-Equipment Tests\n\nThe installed-equipment test procedures and their associated limits are specified in Section \n3.0.",
    "Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included in the installed-equipment tests, their successful completion is a precondition to completion of the installedequipment tests. \n\nIn certain instances, however, installed-equipment tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from or to other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc. \n\nInstalled-equipment tests are normally performed under two conditions:",
    "Installed-equipment tests are normally performed under two conditions: \n\n(1) \nwith the aircraft on the ground and using simulated or operational \nsystem inputs, and \n(2) \nwith \nthe \naircraft \nin \nflight \nusing \noperational \nsystem \ninputs \nappropriate to the equipment under test. \nTest results may be used to demonstrate functional performance in the intended operational environment. \n\n## Definitions Of Terms 1.7",

White \n\n## Simultaneous Voice Transmissions Introduction 1.0\n\nMany aspects of the problem of simultaneous voice transmissions were considered. \n\nin developing the minimum operational performance standards. \n\nIt was recognized that there are basically two different types of simultaneous voice transmissions:",
    "Type A: \nThis type occurs when an operator activates a transmitter on a \nfrequency that already has activity. \nOne example \nis when an \noperator misinterprets \na momentary voice pause by a controller as \nthe end of a transmission. \nThe devices specified in this document are expected to provide nearly complete protection from Type A simultaneous voice transmissions.",
    "Type B: \nThis \ntype occurs when two \nor more operators activate \ntheir \ntransmitters at essentially the same time, on what they perceive to \nbe a clear frequency; for example, in a busy terminal area when a \ntransmission has ended, and two operators begin transmitting at \nalmost the same time. \nThis Page Intentionally Left Blank \n\n## 2.0 Analysis Of Effectiveness Of Devices To Prevent Type B Simultaneous Voice Transmissions",
    "## 2.0 Analysis Of Effectiveness Of Devices To Prevent Type B Simultaneous Voice Transmissions\n\nThis analysis assumes that all users of a given frequency are equipped with a device as described in this document. \n\n## 2.1 Types Of Delays",
    "## 2.1 Types Of Delays\n\nThere are four time delays that determine the operational effectiveness of devices to prevent Type B \nsimultaneous voice transmissions: \nPTT response time, transmitter rise time, activity detector response time and activity detector decay time. The time for RF propagation is negligible compared to the other delays and is ignored. \n\n## 2.2 Time Delay Effects",
    "## 2.2 Time Delay Effects\n\nTime delays affect the operation of a device to prevent Type B simultaneous voice transmissions (where no signal is present at the beginning of the sequence) in the following manner: \nUntil transmitter #1 has caused operation of the activity detector of transceiver #2, a PTT action by operator #2 will result in a conflict. \n\n## 2.3 Determination Of Time Delays 2.3.1 Ptt Response Time\n\nA test was conducted to determine nominal values for PTT response time.",
    "A test was conducted to determine nominal values for PTT response time. \n\nA subject, wearing headphones, adjusted the level of a continuous 1000 Hz tone to a comfortable level. The subject was instructed to press the PTT switch on a standard aircraft-type hand microphone as soon as the 1000 Hz tone was removed. \n\nThe tone was on for random periods of 10 to 20 seconds.",
    "The tone was on for random periods of 10 to 20 seconds. \n\nThe time from tone removal until activation of the PTT by the subject was measured by means of a digital storage oscilloscope triggered by the tone removal. Five different subjects were tested, with each subject performing the test 10 times. \n\nThe fastest response time was 200 milliseconds with the slowest 420 milliseconds. \n\nEach subject had responses in that range with no subject consistently fast or slow.",
    "Each subject had responses in that range with no subject consistently fast or slow. \n\nBased on these tests, it was concluded that the time difference between activation of two PTT circuits by two operators, concentrating on activating the PTT \nfollowing cessation of an on-going transmission, would range from near zero to \n220 milliseconds.",
    "NOTE: \nIn other tests using pilots in a simulated flight environment and with random transmission background traffic, approximately \n50 percent of the measured PTT response times fall between \n340 ms and 740 ms, i.e., a PIT response time spread of about \n400 ms. \n\nIn this 400-ms time span, the data more closely approximates a uniform distribution. \n\n## 2.3.2 Transmitter Rise Time\n\nSC-163 surveyed RTCA members who manufacture avionics equipment for data on transmitter rise time.",
    "This data was requested for transmitters considered representative of those currently in use by the aviation community. \n\nResponses were received from \n10 manufacturers covering \n13 \ndifferent models. \n\nThe transmitter rise times ranged from 2 to 70 milliseconds. \n\nIt was noted that there are no transmitter rise time limits specified in RTCA or EUROCAE VHF transceiver MOPS. \n\n## 2.3.3 Activity Detector Response Time",
    "## 2.3.3 Activity Detector Response Time\n\nThe operation of an activity detector was viewed as very similar to voice squelch circuits in use in most aircraft receivers.",
    "In order to determine a minimum and maximum response time that would be practical and yet still provide immunity from false operation, the committee surveyed RTCA members who manufacture avionics equipment. This survey was for data on squelch attack and decay times, at 10 microvolt and 1000 microvolt levels for receivers considered representative of those currently in use by the aviation community.",
    "The attack times ranged from 2 to 75 milliseconds. Shorter activity detector response times will improve the effectiveness; however, too short a response time may produce unreliable operation. \n\n## Activity Detector Decay Time 2.3.4\n\nThe survey described in paragraph 2.3.3 above indicated values from 4 to 108 \nmilliseconds for squelch decay times.",
    "Activity detector decay time has the following effects on simultaneous voice transmission prevention: \nType A conflicts - Activity detector decay time is not a factor in Type A conflicts. \n\nType B conflicts - Activity detector decay time is not a factor in effectiveness as long as the decay time is less than the PTT response time. \n\nIf the decay time is longer than the PTT response time, it becomes a modified Type B conflict (with a random clock).",
    "Type B conflicts (with a random clock) - The decay time determines when the random clock timer begins and influences conflict prevention effectiveness. \n\nExcessive decay times can result in first-syllable clipping due to delays in transmitter activation after a PTT action. \n\nThis Page Intentionally Left Blank\n\n## 2.4 Analysis Of Effectiveness For Type A And B Simultaneous Voice Transmissions Using Surveyed Transceiver Data 2.4.1 Type A",

    "The results of the analyses taken are listed in Tables A-1 \nand A-2. \n\nThe distribution reflected is approximately uniform, and the applicable paragraphs are noted below each simulation number. As a result of additional tests to determine PTT response times that more closely simulate actual cockpit conditions during the flight, take-off, en route and landing phases (see Appendix A, paragraph \n2.3.1), Table A-1 was reanalyzed, and the results are depicted in Table A-3.",
    "## Effectiveness Summary\n\nThe analysis of the effectiveness of devices to prevent simultaneous voice transmissions in this MOPS deals only with Type B conflicts and, therefore, does not provide overall effectiveness rates that can be expected if the devices are implemented in air traffic control communications. \n\nEven though good radio discipline is maintained and operators wait for frequencies to clear, conflicts can occur.",
    "Timing has a major influence on effectiveness such that any two transmitters that are activated at exactly the same time with the same response times cannot be kept from interfering with each other. \n\nHowever, because there are variations in the inherent time delays of various radios and operator PTT reaction times, a measure of protection can be obtained from Type B simultaneous voice transmissions.",
    "A uniform distribution was Chosen because it was not expected that a different distribution would give widely varying results.",
    "However, for example, in Appendix A paragraph 2.4.2, use of a Gaussian distribution yielded 18 percent as opposed to an effectiveness of 48 percent when uniformly distributed time values were used. Similarly, a PTT \nresponse time difference of 220 ms was assumed, but a broader spread of PTT \nresponse time when applied to the analysis (see NOTE to Appendix A, paragraph \n2.3.1) resulted in a higher predicted effectiveness (see Table A-3).",
    "Limited information on response times, equipment delay times and an accurate knowledge of the number and types of communication conflicts which have occurred and the number of different types of equipment in the field have made it impossible to accurately determine overall effectiveness.",
    "However, the devices in this document provide nearly complete protection from Type A simultaneous voice transmissions. Therefore, the total effectiveness of the devices will increase in direct proportion to the number of Type A conflicts. The greater the number of Type A conflicts, the greater the overall effectiveness of the devices. \n\nUse of new generation transmitters, with improved rise time, is anticipated to increase combined effectiveness.",
    "Further improvement may be achieved by reducing the activity detector response time. \n\nThe efficiency of the ATC voice communication system will improve because the number of conflicting messages will be minimized, thus reducing the need for retransmissions.",
