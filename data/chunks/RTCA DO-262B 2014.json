Equipment and services operating in radio spectrum designated as (R) are historically accorded special measures of protection from interference and normally are used only for communications related to the safety and regularity of flight.  In the case of AMS(R)S, non-safety communications are also permitted on a non-interference basis when priority and preemption can guarantee the precedence of safety communications.  The term Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service, AMSS,",

The term Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service, AMSS, without the (R), is often used (e.g., in ICAO documentation) and is considered to comprise both AMS(R)S and the non-safety aeronautical services, which can include specialized government and administrative communications as well as public correspondence.",
    "End-to-end AMS(R)S data communications are provided by several subnetworks (aircraft user, avionics, satellite, terrestrial and ground user) as shown in Figure 1-1. This MOPS \naddresses only the avionics portion of a subsystem which consists of satellites, Aeronautical Earth Stations (AESs), Ground Earth Stations (GESs), radio-frequency propagation paths, and associated ground facilities including a Network Control Center (NCC) function.",
    "Figure 1-1 depicts a single satellite served by multiple GESs for illustrative simplicity only.  Depending on the architecture of a particular system, multiple satellites may be in view of an aircraft; and a satellite may not require any GES in its own view by maintaining connectivity via intersatellite links.",
    "Ownership and operation of the satellites, aeronautical stations, ground stations and network control functions may be responsibility of one or several organizations or corporate entities.",
    "An important element of the system architecture is the NCC function.  Again depending on the architecture of a given system, this function may be entirely contained in the ground segment, comprising GES(s) and control centers; or the NCC functionality may be shared between the ground segment and the satellite constellation.  It is not assumed that GESs are completely autonomous but it is expected that  a system's GESes conform to common operating policies and rules and utilize with some form of",
    "that  a system's GESes conform to common operating policies and rules and utilize with some form of intersite communication.  The NCC function could be distributed among a domain's GESs and/or satellites; however, it is expected that all NCC functions have some form of intercommunication.",

    "## 1.3.1.4 Satellites",
    "This document does not assume a particular type of NGSS satellite constellation for AMS(R)S use.  Satellite constellations are typically characterized by their orbital parameters, and are generally segregated into four groups: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO), and near-Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO). LEO systems contain a multiplicity of satellites in orbits between 500 km and 1500 km altitude.  The Low-Earth nature of the orbits dictates that the",
    "orbits between 500 km and 1500 km altitude.  The Low-Earth nature of the orbits dictates that the velocity of the satellites is much greater than the platform velocity of even high-performance aircraft, thus the system design must compensate for relatively high Doppler shifts at all times.  Typical LEO communications systems depend on a multiplicity of antenna spot beams to service the user service link.  Some LEO systems require continuous connectivity between the satellite providing service",
    "link.  Some LEO systems require continuous connectivity between the satellite providing service and an associated Ground Earth Station, while others allow for indirect connectivity by means of intersatellite radio links. MEO systems rely on constellations with orbits in the range of 1500 km to 15,000 km altitude.  Because the higher orbit permits coverage of a larger portion of the Earth's surface by each satellite, MEO constellations generally have fewer satellites than LEO constellations.",
    "by each satellite, MEO constellations generally have fewer satellites than LEO constellations.  Most MEO constellations are likely to use a \"bent pipe\" communications technique that requires continuous connectivity between the satellite providing service and an associate Ground Earth Station. HEO constellations are designed to allow each satellite to service a particular region of the Earth's surface for long periods of time.  A typical HEO orbit has a perigee in the range of 1000 km and an",
    "surface for long periods of time.  A typical HEO orbit has a perigee in the range of 1000 km and an apogee of approximately 10,000 km.  Satellites in HEO orbits may be used as a supporting element of LEO, MEO or GEO constellations.",
    "GEO constellations consist of satellites at an orbital altitude of 35,800 km.  At this altitude, the orbital period is 24 hours, and the ground track of the satellite varies only slightly with time.  From the viewpoint of a user aircraft, the satellite is nearly stationary. Typical GEO constellations consist of only four or five satellites in equatorial orbits, spaced nearly uniformly in longitude.  The AMS(R)S/AMSS communications described in ICAO Chapter 4 SARPs and in the current version of",
    "The AMS(R)S/AMSS communications described in ICAO Chapter 4 SARPs and in the current version of DO-210 utilize such a constellation of GEO satellites.  This document specifically allows for the possibility of future GEO constellations that comply with the more generic requirements of NGSS, vice the original requirements detailed in Chapter 4 SARPs and in DO-210.",
    "## 1.3.1.5 Satellite System Coverage",
    "The coverage area of a satellite system is determined by the aggregation of all servicelink beams formed by all satellites in its constellation.  In current AMSS systems, coverage of an individual beam can range from that portion of the Earth's surface within line of sight of a given satellite (roughly one-third of the Earth's surface for a GEO",
    "satellite) to a portion of the Earth's surface as small as 800 km in diameter.  These beams can be stationary (as in GEO system) or can be continuously moving over the Earth's surface (as in a LEO/MEO system).",
    "This document defines coverage area as that airspace over a delineated portion of the Earth's surface, within which all service/performance criteria are met by a given Satellite Subsystem.  It is the responsibility of the Satellite Subsystem service provider to define, declare, and verify its coverage areas.  Information on the service area provided by a specific NGSS system can be found in the applicable technique-specific appendix to this MOPS. \n\n## 1.3.2 Communications Protocols",
    "## 1.3.2 Communications Protocols\n\n--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\nThe Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN) is being implemented on a worldwide basis to provide a common set of interfaces and protocols for aeronautical data communications (see also Section 1.4.1).  The requirements of this document are based on the assumption that NGSS data services will be constituent subnetworks of the ATN.",
    "The ATN is based on the Open System Interconnect (OSI) data communications model.",
    "The OSI Reference Model defines seven such functional layers with responsibilities ranging from control of data transfer on the physical media (radio, wire, fiber, etc.) to control of the application user interface.  The seven layers are named: (1) Physical, (2) Data Link, (3) Network, (4) Transport, (5) Session, (6) Presentation and (7) Application. Each layer provides communication services to the layer above it.  The particular protocol for a given layer may be optimized for the environment",

    "Each layer incorporates well-defined operations designed to optimize control and information flow across the layer boundaries.  To carry out its function, each layer may add protocol control information fields to the service-data-unit supplied by the layer above.  However, each layer leaves the control information added by previous layers intact, treating it as data to be passed on unaltered.  The aircraft avionics and its counterpart of the ground station implement either the lowest two or the",
    "aircraft avionics and its counterpart of the ground station implement either the lowest two or the lowest three layers of the OSI model to provide packet-mode data services. This document recognizes two potential modes of data operation.  These modes are referred to as Data-2 and Data-3, to be consistent with existing industry standards (see RTCA/DO-210D).  Data-2 operation provides transparent data communications by enveloping the packets received from a higher-layer entity (HLE) without using",
    "communications by enveloping the packets received from a higher-layer entity (HLE) without using internal network layer protocols.  Data-3 operation provides to the user a packet-switched subnetwork that implements the lowest three layers of the OSI model (physical, data link and network) and is intended for use with the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN).  One proven means of providing an OSI compliant interface for ATN data is by using the standard interface defined in ISO-8208. At",
    "an OSI compliant interface for ATN data is by using the standard interface defined in ISO-8208. At initial operational capability, it is anticipated that all equipment compliant with this standard will support Data-2, with Data-3 available when ATN equipment and procedures are established.",
    "## 1.4 Operational Applications",
    "Applications for the NGSS satellite communications include both safety and non-safety services.  Safety services are always given priority, and can, if necessary to secure system resources, preempt non-safety traffic.

Current procedures provide AOC services via both voice and data networks. In addition to safety communications, the equipment specified herein may also support the following non-safety communciations:",

    "Aeronautical Public Correspondence (APC) - Non-safety communications between an aircraft passenger and party/parties on the ground or in another aircraft for the passenger's private or business use.  APC services are provided via both voice and data networks. \n\n## 1.4.1 Compatibility And Interoperability",
    "NGSS satellite communications must be compatible and interoperable with external avionics systems and external terrestrial communications networks for users ranging from private aircraft through widebody commercial jet transports.  This requires implementation of well-defined interfaces and peer-to-peer protocols; therefore, a NGSS",
    "satellite system must provide standard end-user subnetwork interfaces among satellite systems and associated terrestrial systems on a global basis.  One such standard is the ISO/IEC 8208 mobile sub-network dependent convergence function.  Other standard interfaces are permissible.

    "For worldwide ATN compatibility among these constituent subnetworks, a common routing and addressing scheme is required.  The twenty-four (24) bit International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aircraft identification numbers will be recognized by the NGSS systems.  Translation from ICAO standard address to an identity number consistent with the number used internally by the satellite subnetwork  is performed in a manner transparent to airborne and ground users.",
    "NGSS equipment is intended to co-exist with AMSS equipment specified by DO-210D at least to the extent that use of either type of equipment within a given airspace will not preclude use of the other type of equipment.  Certain protection separations may apply, but these separations will be well within the standards established for routine aircraft operations within the airspace in which NGSS operations are permitted.

    "The reference model of Figure B-1 will be used throughout this appendix. In keeping with the structure of the main body of these MOPS, this appendix has been organized so that the requirements of each sub-paragraph of Section 2 are verified by the procedures described in the corresponding sub-paragraph of Section 3.  For example, the priority mapping requirements of 2.1 are verified by the procedures of 3.1.  As a result of this mapping, this appendix does not contain a verification cross",

    "## 1.1 Assumptions On Higher Layer Packet Data Interfaces",
    "To support the evolving ATN/ATM environment, this MOPS emphasizes data communications.  As noted earlier, one proven means of supporting an ATN-compliant \ninterface is by use of ISO-8208 compatible interfaces.  ISO-8208 operations are defined \nin terms of a user application, also known as a Higher Level Entity (HLE).  For the purpose of specifying these interfaces, Appendix B of this document assumes the HLE",
    "performs the the following functions: a. Supports the operations of the DTE as specified in The ISO-8208 standard. b.  Is able to initiate, accept and terminate calls via the interface. c.  Is prepared to accept error messages from the AES . \n \nd. Monitors the AES operation in case of unrecoverable error conditions and reinitializes \nthe AES as necessary.",

    "Note: It is recommended, but not required, that packets received at AES with SNC_Priority of 4, 9, 10, 12, and 14 be transparently transmitted across the satellite network, and that packets with these SNC_Priority received from the network be transparently transmitted to the HLE. \n\n \n\n## 2.2 Iso-8208 Protocol Implementation Conformance",
    "The interface between the Higher Level Entity (HLE) and the AES shall conform to the ISO-8208 standard with the following characteristics.  It shall provide for the following: a.  A User Data Field (in the CALL REQUEST, DATA, CLEAR REQUEST and CALL ACCEPTED packets) of up to 128 octets. b.  Expedited Data Delivery, i.e., the use of INTERRUPT packets with a User Data Field of up to 32 octets. c.  Called and Calling Address Extension Facilities. d.  Fast Select (without restrictions). e.

ISLLC has contracted The Boeing Company to operate and maintain its satellite constellation. The Iridium constellation, gateway facilities, testing and development laboratories, TTAC facilities, as well as overall network and system health, are continuously monitored.  ISLLC",
    "manufactures its subscriber equipment, satellite handsets, L-band3 Transceivers (LBT) 95xx, and Short Burst Data (SBD)-only Transceivers 96xx. The LBT and SBD devices are installed in the Iridium SATCOM Data Units (SDUs).",
    "Multiple tests and analyses have demonstrated satellite constellation longevity to provide service through the transition plan of the next generation constellation.   Plans are underway for manufacture and launch of the next generation constellation starting in 2015 with completion planned for full operation by 2017. Continuity of service is core part of the satellite transition with fully backward compatibility.   \n\n## 1.2.2 International Telecommunication Union (Itu) Frequency Assignment",
    "The Iridium network uses radio frequency assignments that have been coordinated and notified in accordance with the provisions of the Radio Regulations under the aegis of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). ITU RR5.367 states that AMS(R)S can be provided on a primary basis after completion of coordination under RR9.21. At this time, coordination required under RR9.21 for AMS(R)S on a primary basis pursuant to RR5.367 is completed except for 8 countries.",
    "## 1.2.3 System Architecture\n\nThe Iridium Satellite Network is a satellite-based, wireless personal communications network, based on Global System for Mobile Communications standard (GSM), providing voice and data services to virtually any destination on earth.",
    "The Iridium communication system comprises three principal components: the satellite network, the ground network and the Iridium subscriber products.  The design of the Iridium network allows voice and data to be routed virtually anywhere in the world.  Voice and data calls originated by a terrestrial user to an aircraft AES are relayed from the Gateway (GES) to the satellite communicating directly with the  Gateway through a series of satellites until the call is received at the Aircraft Earth",
    "with the  Gateway through a series of satellites until the call is received at the Aircraft Earth Station (AES), which includes the Iridium transceiver.  For aircraft to ground communications, the system functions in the reverse.",
    "The key elements of the Iridium communication system are illustrated in Figure 1-1. \n\n\n## 1.2.4 Space Segment",
    "The Iridium space segment utilizes a constellation of 66 operational satellites in low-Earth orbit, as shown in Figure 1-2.  The satellites are located in six distinct planes in near-polar orbit at an altitude of approximately 780 km and circle the Earth approximately once every 100 minutes, travelling at a rate of roughly 27,088 km/h.  The 11 mission satellites within each plane are spaced approximately every 32.7 degrees and perform as nodes in the communications network.",
    "Satellite positions in adjacent odd and even numbered planes are offset from each other by onehalf of the satellite spacing.  This constellation ensures that every region on the globe is covered by at least one satellite at all times.  As of July 2008 there were 10 additional satellites in-orbit spares ready to replace any unserviceable satellite in case of a failure.",
    "Each satellite communicates with the AES, which includes the SDUs, through tightly focused antenna beams that form a continuous pattern on the Earth's surface.  Each satellite uses three phased-array antennas for the user links, each of which contains an array of transmit/receive modules.  The phased-array antennas of each satellite create 48 spot beams arranged in the configuration shown in Figure 1-3 covering a circular area with a diameter of approximately",
    "4,700 km.  These arrays are designed to provide user-link service by communicating within the \n1616-1626.5 MHz band.",
    "The near-polar orbits of Iridium satellites (commonly referred to as space vehicles or satellites) cause the satellites to be closer together as the sub-satellite latitude increases, as illustrated in Figure 1-2.  This orbital motion, in turn, causes the coverage of neighbouring satellites to increasingly overlap as the satellites approach the poles.  A consistent sharing of load among satellites is maintained at high latitudes by selectively deactivating outer-ring spot beams in each",
    "is maintained at high latitudes by selectively deactivating outer-ring spot beams in each satellite.  This beam control also results in reduced inter-satellite interference and increased availability in high latitudes due to overlapping coverage.",
    "The Iridium Satellite Network architecture incorporates certain characteristics which allow the Space Segment communications link with subscriber equipment to be transferred from beam to beam and from satellite to satellite as such satellites move over the area where the subscriber is located.  This transfer is transparent to the user, even during real-time communications.",
    "Each satellite has four cross-link antennas to allow it to communicate with and route traffic to the two satellites that are fore and aft of it in the same orbital plane, as well as to neighbouring satellites in the adjacent co-rotating orbital planes.  These inter-satellite links operate at approximately 23 GHz.  Inter-satellite networking is a significant technical feature of the Iridium Satellite Network that enhances system reliability and capacity and reduces the number of gateways or",

    "The System Control Segment is the central management component for the Iridium system.  It provides global operational support and control services for the satellite constellation, delivers satellite-tracking data to the Iridium Gateways, and performs the termination control function of messaging services. The System Control Segment consists of three main components: five TTAC sites, the Operational Support Network (OSN), and the SNOC.  The primary linkage between the System Control Segment,",
    "Support Network (OSN), and the SNOC.  The primary linkage between the System Control Segment, the satellites, and the gateways is via control feeder links and inter-satellite cross-links throughout the satellite constellation.",
    "The Iridium Gateway provides call processing and control activities such as subscriber validation and access control for all calls.  The gateway connects the Iridium satellite network to ground communication networks, such as the terrestrial Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs) and Public Switched Data Networks (PSDNs), and communicates via ground-based antennas with the gateway feeder-link antennas on the satellite.  The gateway can also serve as a gateway to the aeronautical",

The gateway can also serve as a gateway to the aeronautical telecommunication network (ATN) for forwarding ATN messages from the aircraft to the required Air Traffic Command (ATC) or Aircraft Operational Communication (AOC) unit or vice versa.  The gateway includes a subscriber database used in call processing activities such as subscriber validation, keeps a record of all traffic, and generates call detail records used in billing.",
    "## 1.2.6 Channel Classifications",
    "Each Iridium communications channel consists of a time-slot and a carrier frequency.  Channels provided by the system can be divided into two broad categories: system overhead channels and bearer service channels.  Bearer service channels include traffic channels and messaging channels, while system overhead channels include ring alert channels, Broadcast Channels, acquisition and synchronization channels.  A specific time-slot-and-frequency combination may be used for several types of",
    "channels.  A specific time-slot-and-frequency combination may be used for several types of channels, depending on what specific activity is appropriate at each instant.  Each time-slot-and-frequency combination is only used for one purpose at a time.  Figure",
    "1-4 illustrates the hierarchy of Iridium channel types.  Iridium aeronautical services utilize only the indicated channel types.  \nIn the discussions that follow, the term \"channel\" will always refer to a time-slot-and-frequency combination. The terms \"frequency\" or \"frequency access\" will denote the specific radio frequency of an individual channel.",

    "--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---",
    "The Ring Channel is a downlink-only channel used to send ring alert messages to individual subscriber units.  Its downlink frequency is globally assigned in order to be the same known frequency throughout the world.  The Ring Channel uses a time division format to send ring alert messages to multiple subscriber units in a single frame. Broadcast Channels are downlink channels used to support the acquisition and handoff processes. These channels provide frequency, timing, and system information",
    "acquisition and handoff processes. These channels provide frequency, timing, and system information to SDUs before they attempt to transmit an acquisition request.  In addition, Broadcast Channels provide downlink messages which acknowledge acquisition requests and make channel assignments.  Finally, Broadcast Channels are used to implement selective acquisition blocking to prevent local system overloads.",
    "Acquisition channels are uplink-only channels used by individual subscriber equipment to transmit an acquisition request.  These channels use a slotted ALOHA random access process. The time and frequency error tolerances are larger for an Acquisition Channel to allow for initial",
    "frequency and timing uncertainties.  SDUs determine which Acquisition Channels are active by monitoring the Broadcast Channel. The Synchronization Channel is a duplex channel used by the SDU to achieve final synchronization with a satellite before it begins traffic channel operation.  The Synchronization Channel occupies the same physical channel time slots and frequency accesses as the traffic channel that the SDU will occupy when the synch process is complete.  During the synch process, the",
    "channel that the SDU will occupy when the synch process is complete.  During the synch process, the satellite measures the differential time of arrival (DTOA) and differential frequency of arrival (DFOA) of the uplink synch burst and sends correction information to the SDU in the downlink synch burst.  A synchronization channel is assigned to an SDU by the satellite.  The synchronization procedure is accomplished by the SDU transmitting an uplink burst which the satellite measures for time and",
    "is accomplished by the SDU transmitting an uplink burst which the satellite measures for time and frequency error relative to the assigned channel.  The satellite sends time and frequency corrections for the latest uplink burst over the downlink channel.  This process is repeated until the satellite determines that both the SDU transmit time and frequency are within the tolerance for a traffic channel.  When this occurs, the satellite transmits a message to that effect to the SDU and",
    "traffic channel.  When this occurs, the satellite transmits a message to that effect to the SDU and reconfigures the channel for traffic channel operation.",
    "1.2.6.2 Bearer Service Channels The Iridium subscriber link provides two basic types of bearer service channels: traffic channels and messaging channels. Messaging channels support downlink only simplex messaging service.  This service carries numeric and alphanumeric messages to Message Termination Devices. Traffic channels support duplex services which include portable mobile telephony and a variety of duplex bearer data services.  Each traffic channel consists of an associated uplink and",
    "variety of duplex bearer data services.  Each traffic channel consists of an associated uplink and downlink channel.  A duplex user has exclusive use of the assigned channels until service terminates or until handed off to a different channel.",
    "## 1.2.7 Channel Multiplexing",
    "Channels are implemented in the Iridium Satellite Network using a hybrid Time Division Multiple Access/Frequency Division Multiple Access (TDMA/FDMA) architecture based on Time Division Duplex (TDD) using a 90 millisecond frame.  Channels are reused in different geographic locations by implementing acceptable co-channel interference constraints.  A channel assignment comprises both a frequency carrier and time slot.",
    "1.2.7.1 TDMA Frame Structure The fundamental unit of the TDMA channel is a time-slot.  Time-slots are organized into TDMA \nframes as illustrated in Figure 1-5.  The frame consists of a 20.32 millisecond downlink simplex time-slot, followed by four 8.28 millisecond uplink time-slots and four downlink time-slots, which provide the duplex channel capability.  The TDMA frame also includes various guard times to allow hardware set up and to provide tolerance for uplink channel operations.",
    "The simplex time-slot supports the downlink-only, ring and messaging channels.  The Acquisition, Synchronization, and Traffic channels use the uplink time-slots.  The Broadcast, Synchronization, and Traffic channels use the downlink duplex time-slots. There are 2250 symbols per TDMA frame at a channel burst modulation rate of 25 Kilosymbolsper-second (25 ksps).  A 2400 bps traffic channel uses one uplink and one downlink time-slot per frame.",
    "1.2.7.2 FDMA Frequency Plan The fundamental unit of frequency in the FDMA structure is a frequency access that occupies a 41.667 kHz bandwidth.  Each channel uses one frequency access.  The frequency accesses are divided into the duplex channel band and the simplex channel band.  The duplex channel band is further divided into sub-bands.",
    "1.2.7.3 Duplex Channel Band The frequency accesses used for duplex channels are organized into sub-bands, each of which contains eight frequency accesses.  Each sub-band, therefore, occupies 333.333 kHz (8 x 41.667 kHz).  In duplex operation, the Iridium Satellite Network is capable of operating with up to 30 \nsub-bands, containing a total of 240 frequency accesses.  Table 1-1 shows the band edges for each of the 30 sub-bands.  Iridium's current band usage includes sub-bands 8-30.",

Compliance with these requirements and test procedures is intended to provide one means of providing evidence for certification or other approval of an AES for SwiftBroadband AMS(R)S.  Alternative means of compliance that provide equivalent information are acceptable.",
    "The performance requirements for the end-to-end communications network, as shown in Figure 1-1, are contained in the MASPS [6].  The MASPS aims to comply with data link requirements in the ICAO Global Operational Data Link Document (GOLD) [7] document and the voice link requirement in the ICAO \nSatellite Voice Guidance Material (SVGM) [8].   This appendix aims to define requirements for the AES which are harmonized with the MASPS, GOLD and SVGM documents.",
    "The focus of this appendix is on ensuring that the AES will functionally deliver the intended services over the AMS(R)S network, without necessarily exploring all the detail of the underlying mechanisms which enable the service.",
    "A graphical representation of the requirements for the AES is shown in Figure 1-2.  The focus in this appendix is on ensuring correct behavior of the AES at the services interfaces, where the user avionics interact with the AES, and at the signals-in-space interface, where the AES has desired interaction with the network, and potentially undesired interaction with other aircraft systems and the outside world.  For this reason this appendix contains much detail on the radio characteristics at",
    "outside world.  For this reason this appendix contains much detail on the radio characteristics at the physical layer.  Likewise, there is ample detail of the observable behavior of the AES at the AMS(R)S service application level. The details of the protocol layers (Layers 2 and 3) between the physical layer and the service applications are defined in great detail in the Inmarsat SDM [1], and verified by performing Inmarsat MTRs [2].  These layers are verified as part of the Inmarsat Type",
    "verified by performing Inmarsat MTRs [2].  These layers are verified as part of the Inmarsat Type Approval process.  Evidence of Inmarsat's approval is considered sufficient evidence that these layers operate correctly.  Furthermore, the verification at service level which is provided by this appendix gives further evidence that the underlying layers are operating as intended.",
    "Key aspects of the MASPS [6] deal with various parameters related to availability and latency of the communication capabilities offered by the end-toend network.  Portions of these key parameters have been allocated to the AES, and are specified in this appendix.  Referring to Figure 1-1, these allocated parameters apply between points B and C in forward (ground-to-air) direction and points F and G in the return (air-to-ground) direction. AES management functions (see Figure 1-2) which are",

The main functions are discussed in the remainder of this section.",
    "Antenna  \nFor a SwiftBroadband AES, the antenna is required to have directional gain, and therefore a steered beam is required.  The amount of gain required depends on the class of AES.  The beam is pointed at the satellite despite changes in the aircraft's position and attitude.  Typically the AES receives position, altitude, attitude and velocity data from the aircraft's avionics.  Antennas are typically either steered mechanically or electrically using a phased antenna array.",
    "DLNA \nThe SwiftBroadband system uses full duplex communications - transmitting and receiving simultaneously in different frequency bands, as shown in Figure 1-7.",
    "The diplexer is a pair of filters which prevent the transmitter from interfering with the operation of the receiver.  The low-noise amplifier is typically closecoupled with the receive filter in the diplexer to achieve a low noise figure.  The diplexer also provides out-of-band rejection which prevents mutual interference between the AES and other radio systems on or near the aircraft, for example the GNSS systems on the aircraft.",
    "High-Power Amplifier (HPA) \nThe HPA amplifies the transmitted signal to the appropriate power level.  The output power is carefully managed to achieve near-constant received power density levels at the satellite.  The HPA is linear, to allow transmission of complex modulation schemes.  In the case of a multi-channel AES, increased linearity is required from the HPA to suppress intermodulation products that may be formed in the HPA.",
    "Modem The modem performs the modulation and demodulation functions in the AES. For SwiftBroadband the modem is required to be agile, switching on command between frequencies, modulation modes and forward error correcting codes.  The modulator is required to transmit bursts of data according to the return burst schedule allocated by the network.  This agility allows the BGAN network to dynamically allocate spectrum and other resources on demand.  It also allows the network to assign resources to",
    "allocate spectrum and other resources on demand.  It also allows the network to assign resources to priority services, even when demand is high.",
    "The radio bearer handled by the modem may be used to transfer a multiplexed data stream, providing multiple services like voice, ACARS and IP data over one transmit and one receive bearer at a time. An AES6 or AES7 may have one or more modems for single or multi-channel operation as required.  An AES4 only contains one modem.  Priority services only require one modem.  Additional modems typically provide non-priority services.",
    "ACARS Gateway The ACARS Airborne Gateway (AAGW) is typically a software function in the AES.  In the air-to-ground direction the AAGW encapsulates ACARS messages sent from the aircraft avionics into data packets which are then sent to the modem for transmission to the ACARS Ground Gateway (AGGW).  The data packets contain additional information for error checking and time stamping of messages. Data packets containing ACARS messages are sent through a dedicated priority background PDP context.",

    "In the ground-to-air direction the reverse operation is performed by the AAGW.",
    "Time stamping of data packets allows measurement of latency between the AAGW and the AGGW. The aircraft avionics only send one ACARS message at a time, and then waits for confirmation from the ground.  The ACARS gateway in the AES therefore does not arbitrate on priority of different ACARS messages.",
    "VoIP Gateway Every SwiftBroadband modem provides a single circuit-switched voice channel using an AMBE+2 voice codec.   Furthermore, at least one voice channel using Voice over IP (VoIP) technology is provided per AES.  These two voice channels enable two voice  calls (telephone calls) for the flight deck. The VoIP facility is provided by a VoIP gateway in the AES, which connects to a VoIP gateway on the ground.  The airborne VoIP gateway sets up a background priority PDP context at start-up",

Ethernet ports are typically used to interface IP data to the AES.  Other formats such as Wi-Fi are also possible.",
    "Voice Interfaces An industry-standard interface between the AES and the flight deck audio system is described in ARINC 781.  The interface emulates, in broad terms, the speaker / microphone / PTT interface of a VHF radio transceiver.  Additional discrete lines provide for visual and audible indication of incoming calls.  Other interfaces are possible.",
    "Avionics Interfaces Other interfaces to aircraft avionics may be required for the AES to receive information such as aircraft speed, position and attitude, weight on wheels etc. Additional functions like built-in testing, software loading etc. may be supported. These functions may vary in different AES designs, and are not prescribed in this appendix.",
    "AES Control The AES control function is responsible for internal AES management, including such tasks as initializing and assigning modem resources, controlling high power amplifier output power, controlling or directing antenna steering, self-test, fault isolation, etc.  The actual implementation of these functions is manufacturerdependent.
