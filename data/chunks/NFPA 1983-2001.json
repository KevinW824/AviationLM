    "This edition of \n                  NFPA 1983, Standard on Fire Service Life Safety Rope and System Components, \nwas prepared by the Technical Committee on Special Operations Protective Clothing and \nEquipment, released by the Technical Correlating Committee on Fire and Emergency Ser­\nvices Protective Clothing and Equipment, and acted on by the \n                                                              National Fire Protection Asso­\nciation, Inc., at its",

It was \nissued by the Standards Council on January 13, 2001, with an effective date of February 9, \n2001, and supersedes all previous editions. \n   This edition ofNFPA 1983 was approved as an American National Standard on February 9, \n2001.",
    "## Origin And Development Of Nfp A 1983",
    "The Technical Committee on Protective Equipment for Fire Fighters (then renamed as the Technical Committee on Fire Service Protective Clothing and Equipment) began work on this standard in 1982 in answer to requests from the fire service to establish requirements for rope used by the fire service to perform rescues. During the development of this standard, it became necessary to include harnesses and hardware that are used with the rope in rescue operations. The work was completed in the spring",
    "and hardware that are used with the rope in rescue operations. The work was completed in the spring of 1984 and submitted to NFPA for official adoption. The first edition was issued on June 6, 1985.",
    "The Subcommittee on Life Safety Ropes began the revision to the 1985 edition in late 1987 \nand turned over its proposals to the Technical Committee in December 1988. The Technical Committee completed its work on the document in April 1989, and it was submitted for the Annual Meeting 1990 cycle. The second edition was issued on July 20, 1990.",
    "During 1993, \n               NFPA restructured the manner in which committees were organized, and all \nstanding subcommittees were eliminated. Within the Technical Committee on Fire Service \nProtective Clothing and Equipment, the former standing subcommittees were reorganized as \ntask groups to address specific technical issues, and the Technical Committee assumed the \nentire responsibility for \n                      NFPA 1983.",
    "In October 1994, just after the revisions for the third edition were completed, the Stan­\ndards Council appointed the Technical Correlating Committee on Fire and Emergency Ser­\nvices Protective Clothing and Equipment to oversee all fire and emergency services protective \nclothing and equipment issues. The existing Technical Committee on Fire Service Protective \nClothing and Equipment ceased to exist in May 1995, and seven new technical committees,",
    "Clothing and Equipment ceased to exist in May 1995, and seven new technical committees, \neach responsible for a different segment of the fire and emergency services protective cloth­\ning and equipment spectrum, are now in place. The future responsibility for \n                                                                           NFPA 1983 now \nrests with the new Technical Committee on Special Operations Protective Clothing and",
    "rests with the new Technical Committee on Special Operations Protective Clothing and \nEquipment, operating under the Technical Correlating Committee on Fire and Emergency \nServices Protective Clothing and Equipment.",
    "The third edition ofNFPA 1983 was a complete revision to the document. The document \nwas reformatted to present the certification requirements, the product labeling and user \ninformation requirements, the design requirements, the performance requirements, and the \ntesting requirements each in separate chapters. A different approach was taken to life safety \nrope and the various items used in conjunction with the rope. While the life safety rope",
    "rope and the various items used in conjunction with the rope. While the life safety rope \nremained as the key subject of the document, other items used in conjunction with the rope \nwere addressed as system components.",
    "New criteria for personal escape rope were included to cover a type of life safety rope \nthat is carried by fire fighters/ \n                             rescuers and used only for fire fighter/ \n                                                                    rescuer escape or self­\nrescue in critical entrapment situations where the rope would provide the only viable means \nof escape. There also was new criteria, in addition to the harness requirements, for three",
    "of escape. There also was new criteria, in addition to the harness requirements, for three \ntypes of belts: one intended for use to position a fire fighter on a ladder, a second type for \nescape/self-rescue using a life safety rope, or a third type for both applications. Definitions \nwere expanded to provide better understanding of terms. The testing requirements were",
    "greatly expanded to provide the criteria with which to evaluate the performance and deter­\nmine pass/fail. \n\nThe third edition was acted on by the membership of the Association at the Annual Meeting in Denver, Colorado, on May 24, 1995, and was issued with an effective date of August 11, 1995.",
    "This fourth edition of NFPA 1983 adds a new type of rope - a throwline - a floating rope that is intended to be thrown to a person in water, or used as a tether for rescuers dur­",
    "ing water rescue incidents. New requirements for pulleys and portable anchors were also added to the fourth edition as new items of system components. The former terminology for one- and two-person load classifications has been changed to a simpler load classification based on the weight that the rope or system is designed to support.",
    "Testing methods for descent control devices were modified to provide more accurate test­\ning for the three types of descenders. Other testing modifications were made throughout Chapter 6 to clarify testing methods and improve reproducibility of testing results. \n\nNew requirements for improved product quality assurance through manufacturer's being registered as compliant with ISO, and certification laboratory accreditation have been added.",
    "Annual product evaluation, testing, and recertification were also added. All three of these new criteria are directed to raise the bar for product and certification quality and to provide a better level of safety for the end users.",
    "Throughout the document, modifications to existing text were made in the continuing attempt to make the document clearer, less ambiguous, and easier to use by both manufactur­\ners and the certification organizations. This process continues during every revision cycle, and the input received from document users has been very helpful in fixing many of these issues.",
    "This fourth edition was acted on by the Association membership at the Fall Meeting in Orlando, Florida, on November 15, 2000, and was issued with an effective date of February 9, \n2001. \n\n## Technical Correlating Committee On Fire And Emergency Services Protective Clothing And Equipment",
