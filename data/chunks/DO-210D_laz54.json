    "As used in this document, the term \"AES\" includes all components and units necessary for the aircraft system to communicate through a satellite.  The AES comprises multiple components, including antennas, high power amplifiers (HPAs), voice coders/decoders (CODECs) and modulators/demodulators (MODEMs).  A particular AES will not necessarily include all components or units referred to herein but will perform all required functions.",
    "The guidelines contained in RTCA/DO-178B, Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification, should be considered with respect to aircraft AMSS software packages. \n\n## 1.2 System Overview",
    "The AMSS provides worldwide communications directly between aircraft subnetworks and ground subnetworks via aeronautical mobile satellites and their ground earth stations. AMSS will support both data and voice communications between aircraft users and ground-based users such as Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) and aircraft operating authorities (airlines).  Communication services accommodated by AMSS functions include four categories:  Air Traffic Services (ATS), Aeronautical",
    "accommodated by AMSS functions include four categories:  Air Traffic Services (ATS), Aeronautical Operational Control (AOC), Aeronautical Administrative Communications (AAC) and Aeronautical Passenger Communications (APC).  This document concentrates on the first two categories as they pertain to safety and regularity of flight.",
    "## 1.2.1 Amss Architecture",
    "The overall AMSS system will provide circuit-mode data and voice as well as packet-mode data exchanges between ground-based users and airborne users via satellite relay.  The architecture defines system characteristics that are needed to assure a minimum worldwide satellite air-ground communications interoperability.  This has been accomplished for",
    "packet data services to be used by the international civil aviation community through specifying the International Standardization Organization's (ISO) Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.  It is anticipated that AMSS data services will conform in the future with guidelines for the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN).",
    "Initially, all voice transmissions will be digitized at the earth stations (aircraft and ground) for satellite transmission and converted back to analog for use within the aircraft and in the terrestrial subnetworks.  In the future, direct digital transmission through the avionics and ground subnetworks to the user terminus may be employed where practical. \n\n## 1.2.2 Communications Characteristics",
    "## 1.2.2 Communications Characteristics\n\n \nAMSS will operate in frequency bands allocated for satellite-to-aircraft and aircraft-tosatellite communications as well as the bands for \"feeder\" links between the satellite and GES.  AMSS uses both Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) techniques.",
    "Four radio frequency (RF) channel types have been defined which will accommodate all foreseen traffic types.  The \"forward\" direction means from the GES to the AES, while \"return\" direction means the AES to GES. The baseline RF channel types are:",
    "a. \nP-channel:  Packet mode Time Division Multiplex (TDM) channel, used in the forward direction to carry signaling and user data.  Transmission is continuous from each GES. \nb. \nR-channel:  Random access (\"slotted Aloha\") channel, used in burst mode in the return direction to carry the initial signaling data of a transaction, typically request signals, and some short-length packet-mode user data. \nc.",
    "c. \nT-channel:  TDMA channel, used in the return direction to carry packet-mode data. An \"on-demand\" time allocation scheme is used to optimize efficiency and is arbitrated by one GES to which the AES is logged-on. \nd.",
    "C-channel:  Circuit-mode channel, used in both forward and return directions for voice, voice/data, and data-only channels.  The use of the channel is controlled by assignment and release signaling at the start and end of each transaction.  The forward C-channel conserves satellite power by operating in a voice-actuated mode, while the return C-channel is continuously powered when operational.  When used for voice, these channels also may carry multiplexed data for signaling and for future ATC",
    "used for voice, these channels also may carry multiplexed data for signaling and for future ATC and AOC traffic.",
    "Universal signal formats and RF channel formats permit any aircraft to communicate with any GES operating in the AMSS system.  Several different data rates are available for user choice in order to accommodate different installations and service requirements.",
    "Two modulation waveforms for the signals-in-space are defined:  Aviation Binary Phase Shift Keying (A-BPSK) is used for RF channel data rates of up to and including 2,400 bits per second (bps), and Aviation Quaternary Phase Shift Keying (A-QPSK) is used for RF \nchannel data rates above 2,400 bps.  (The term \"aviation\" designates agreed-upon high efficiency filter masks for the modulation.)",
    "## 1.2.3 Operational Service Levels",
    "The levels of service available through the AMSS Satellite Subsystem are determined primarily by the equipage of corresponding AESs and GESs.  The ICAO AMSS Standards And Recommended Practices (SARPs) define four levels of system capability based on AES characteristics, requiring that one or more GESs in the system have the capabilities of operating compatibly with AESs.  All AESs, as a minimum, shall have a Level 1 capability and shall continuously monitor a P channel after log-on to a GES.",
    "Level 1  AESs provide basic packet-mode data communications and are capable of: \n \na. \nreception on a P channel at channel rates of 600 or 1200 bps; and \n \nb. \ntransmission on a T channel or an R channel at channel rates of 600 or 1200 bps (with 2400 bps as an additional recommended rate; simultaneous R- and T- channel transmission is not required). \nLevel 2  AESs have the capabilities of Level 1 systems and additionally for:",
    "a. \nreception on a P channel at a channel rate of 10,500 bps (with 4800 bps as an additional recommended rate); and \n \nb. \ntransmission on a T channel and an R channel at the channel rate of 10,500 bps (simultaneous R- and T-channel transmission is not required).",
    "Level 3  AESs have the capabilities of a Level 2 system and additionally the capability of reception and transmission on one C-channel pair at a channel rate of 8,400 or 21,000 bps (with 10,500 bps as an additional recommended rate).  Simultaneous C-channel operation with either the R or T channel is not required, and simultaneous R- and T-channel transmission is not required, nor the support of both 21,000 and 8,400 bps C-channels in the one AES.",
    "Level 4  AESs have the capabilities of a Level 3 system and additionally the capability for simultaneous operation on one or more C-channel pairs and transmission on an R channel and a T channel.  Simultaneous R- and T-channel transmission is not required; however, it is recommended that the AES have such capability whenever the C-channel operation is not in use. \n \n \nNOTE:",
    "NOTE: \nAn AES with Level 4 capability provides digitized voice capability on the C- channel(s) simultaneously with packet-mode capability on either the R- or T- channel and the P-channel, using two or more receive and two or more transmit \nchannels. \nThis MOPS covers and requires provision and verification of the minimum performance and test requirements for Level 1. \n \nMinimum performance and test and verification requirements are also included in this MOPS for:",
    "a. \nOptional use of the Level 2, 3 or 4 10.5 kbps channel rates for packet-mode data; \n \nb. \nOptional use of the Level 3 or Level 4 8.4 kbps and/or 21.0 kbps channel rate for circuit-mode voice services. \n \n \nNOTES: 1. \nTo satisfy SARPs voice channel access delay requirements, provision and test of the 10.5 kbps channel-rate packet-mode data capability is required for equipment providing Level 3 or Level 4 voice capability for safety \nservices.",
    "2. \nThe optional 2400 and 4800 bps channel rates are neither covered nor \nrequired in this MOPS for any level. \nA description of the INMARSAT AES classes may be found in Reference Document \"B\", Section 2.1.3. \n\n## 1.2.4 Ground Equipment Requirements",
    "Ground equipment is required for satellite system service organizations to provide communications service between the aircraft and land-based end users.  The equipment must conform to standards used in conjunction with the airborne equipment to provide for the integrity, reliability and timeliness required for aeronautical communications associated with safety and regularity of flight.  These characteristics are described in regard only to their service requirements in the RTCA document,",
    "characteristics are described in regard only to their service requirements in the RTCA document, Guidance on AMSS End-to-End System Performance and Verification Requirements (DO-215A).",
    "## 1.2.5 Satellite Requirements",
    "In order to provide worldwide coverage with adequate backup capability, a number of satellites will be required for AMSS.  The satellites use linear, frequency-translating, nonprocessing repeaters (transponders) to provide communications capacity.  Requirements for the high availability and integrity necessary for safety-related mobile satellite services are described in the RTCA document, Guidance on AMSS End-to-End System Performance and Verification Requirements (DO-215A).",
    "## 1.2.6 Service Providers\n\n \nService providers oversee the management of and access to the satellites and terrestrial networks under their control.  In the AMSS system, they must guarantee transponder performance, accept priority rules for allocation of satellite power and supply acceptable system monitoring and control.  Also, voice and data connections to on-board subnetworks as well as ground subnetworks serving Air Traffic Control (ATC), airlines and others should be provided.",
    "## 1.2.7 Communication Protocols",
    "For satellite communications to be effective between many aircraft belonging to different users and various ground end-systems, a single set of transmission protocols is defined.",
    "Packet data protocols are based on universally-accepted and proven OSI models with capabilities to interface with various network protocols without regard to the implementation of the subnetworks and physical media through which the messages pass. Messages traverse hierarchical protocol \"layers.\"  Each layer in an originating subnetwork performs a function paralleled at the destination subnetwork's peer layer.  Possible differences in communicating systems are masked by these standard",
    "peer layer.  Possible differences in communicating systems are masked by these standard interfaces, permitting simplified and reliable interconnection of those systems.",
    "Each layer incorporates well-defined operations designed to optimize control and information flow across the layer boundaries.  To carry out its function, each layer may add protocol control information fields to the service-data-unit supplied by the layer above. However, each layer leaves the control information added by previous layers intact, treating it as data to be passed on unaltered.",
    "The OSI Reference Model defines seven such functional layers with responsibilities ranging from control of data transfer on the physical media (radio, wire, fiber, etc.) to control of the application user interface.  The seven layers are named: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation and Application.  The AES and its counterpart on the ground (GES) implement either the lowest two or the lowest three layers of the OSI model to provide packet-mode data services.  This",
    "lowest two or the lowest three layers of the OSI model to provide packet-mode data services.  This document defines the AES requirements and tests.",
    "The system requirements contained in Section 2.0 of this document support packet-mode communications reflected by the OSI.  Two modes of operation are permitted.  These modes are referred to as Data-2 and Data-3, to be consistent with existing industry standards (see Reference Document \"F\").  Data-2 operation provides transparent data communications by enveloping the packets received from a higher-layer entity (HLE) without using internal network layer protocols.  Data-3 operation provides to",
    "entity (HLE) without using internal network layer protocols.  Data-3 operation provides to the user a packet-switched subnetwork that implements the lowest three layers of the OSI model (physical, data link and network) and is accessed using a standard interface defined in Reference Document \"E\".",
    "## 1.3 Operational Applications\n\n \nMany applications for AMSS are potentially available; however, cost or other factors may limit users' access to all such applications (e.g., voice as well as data).  While applications for service categories will evolve with time, this document defines standards to support minimum implementations of all currently foreseen applications for ATS and AOC. \n \n\n## 1.3.1 Air Traffic Services (Ats)",
    "## 1.3.1 Air Traffic Services (Ats)\n\n \nAir Traffic Services (ATS) include Air Traffic Control (ATC), the Flight Information Service and the Alerting Service.  AMS(R)S will provide an important new capability for ATS and AOC voice and data applications. \n\n## 1.3.1.1 Air Traffic Control (Atc)",

The error procedure consists of performing the actions specified when entering the p7 state (including sending a CLEAR INDICATION Packet \nto the DTE) and additionally sending a CLEAR REQUEST Packet to the SSNIW. \n3. The use of Fast Select Facility with restriction on response prohibits the DTE from sending a CALL ACCEPTED packet.",

Table entries are defined as follows: A = Action to be taken, S = the State to be entered, D = Diagnostic code to be used in packets generated \nas a result of this action, DISCARD indicates that the received packet is to be cleared from the AES buffers.",

The DCE shall take the \nsame actions as the ones taken by the DTE, acting as a DCE, to perform normal processing on the received packet.  If no Section number is referenced, the normal processing is defined in the table entry. \n7. If the packet is acceptable to the state of the logical channel (i.e., Action = Normal), but contains a format error or is otherwise unacceptable,",
    "then the DCE shall initiate a connection release procedure (diagnostic codes that may apply include 34, 38, 39, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 73, 77 and \n82).  If such an error is detected in states p1 or p7, the DCE does not send a CLEAR REQUEST packet to the SSNIW.",

    "The AES shall implement procedures for interworking between the cockpit (e.g., Control/Display Unit (CDU) and \"call lamp/chime\" and \"microphone switch\" discretes where used) and the satellite subnetwork protocol, as required, for the provision of cockpit voice service.

Although the figures show steady call lamps and",
    "or ACP)) are shown in Figures 2-6 through 2-9.  Although the figures show steady call lamps and singlestroke chimes, flashing lamps and/or multistroke chimes may optionally be used.",
    "## 2.2.8.2.1 Call Establishment -- Air To Ground\n\n \nA call may be initiated via a CDU by means of manufacturer-specific user menus.  Call initiation may also optionally require activation of the microphone switch. \n \n \nThe cockpit enters the conversation mode by activating the microphone switch.  This is normally done after the call has been connected and annunciated but may optionally occur as part of the call initiation phase as stated above.",
    "## 2.2.8.2.2 Call Establishment -- Ground To Air",
    "Ground-to-air calls are handled largely by the AMP with little involvement of the CDU. However, the AES may provide call progress information to the CDU (e.g., priority, etc.).",
    "Receipt of the Call Announcement SU triggers the interworking process at the AES.  The AES determines if the call is for the cockpit by analysis of the called-terminal information element within the signal unit.  A called-terminal value of zero indicates that no routing information is present and that the call should be routed according to priority (e.g., non-",
    "public correspondence calls to the cockpit AMS, public correspondence calls either rejected or routed to cabin telephone).  The lamp/chime annunciation occurs once as soon as the satellite voice channel has been assigned and its continuity verified.",
    "The cockpit activates the microphone switch to the \"on\" state to indicate answer of the incoming call; this may optionally be signaled from the CDU.  The AES recognizes the answer signal and sends the Connect SU to the GES. \nCall lights and chimes should be inhibited during take-off and landing flight phases. \n\n## 2.2.8.2.3 Call Termination",
    "For air-initiated call clearing, the cockpit indicates the end of call by use of an End Call control on the CDU.  The end of call may optionally be indicated by the microphone switch.  The AES disconnects the voice channel and sends a series of channel release signal units to the GES to clear the satellite channel.",
    "For ground-initiated call clearing, a channel release signal unit from the satellite channel causes the AES to disconnect the voice channel.  If a microphone switch (latched for the duration of the call) has been optionally used for call initiation and answering, it must be switched off before the call lamp can be extinguished.",
    "## 2.2.8.2.3.1 Call Termination By Cross Talk Detection",
    "An AES shall always compare the AES ID and Application Reference Number fields in the received sub-band SUs (excluding fill-in SUs) against the expected values. The expected values are established during the call set-up phase. In the event of either or both received values being different from the expected ones, the AES shall immediately clear the call and shall immediately inhibit the C-channel transmitter until the call is fully cleared unilaterally by the AES. \n2.2.9",
    "2.2.9 \nRecovery from Primary Power Interruption \nThe AES equipment shall conform to the following requirements after encountering primary power interruptions from any cause. \n \na. \nPower interruptions of less than five milliseconds duration shall be indistinguishable from outages in the RF transmission path of equal duration. \n \nb.",
    "b. \nPower interruptions from five to 200 milliseconds duration shall require no more than five seconds recovery time, beginning from when primary power has been restored.  Recovery is defined as automatically returning to the previous operating state (without user intervention) such that voice and data channels",
    "resume in the same configuration they were in before the power interruption occurred.  This assumes a P-channel signal with at least the minimum quality characteristics specified in Section 2.2.4.1.2.",
    "NOTE: \nIn-transit data service packets which have been acknowledged on either the DTE or DCE interface, but not yet transferred to the opposite interface, may be lost.  Non-AES higher-layer entities that employ end-to-end acknowledgement protocols may choose to retransmit such lost data.  Synchronization and RF output power may be lost during the power interruption and recovery time.  \nThere shall be no more than a momentary effect on cockpit displays. \n\n## 2.2.10 Failure/Status Indication",
    "## 2.2.10 Failure/Status Indication\n\n \nThe AES equipment shall provide, independent of any operator action, an indication of: \n \na. \nFailure of AES equipment resulting in loss of data communications. \n \nb. \nFailure of AES equipment resulting in loss of voice communications. \n\n## 2.3 Equipment Performance -- Environmental Conditions 2.3.1 General Requirements",
    "## 2.3 Equipment Performance -- Environmental Conditions 2.3.1 General Requirements\n\n \nThe environmental tests and their associated performance requirements described in this Section are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under environmental conditions representative of those that may be encountered in actual aircraft operations.",
    "Unless otherwise specified, the test procedures applicable to a determination of equipment performance under environmental test conditions are contained in RTCA Document DO- 160C, *Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment*.  General information regarding the use of the procedures in RTCA/DO-160C is contained in Sections 1.0 through 3.0 of that document.  Also, a method of identifying which environmental tests were conducted and other amplifying information on the",

    "Some of the minimum performance requirements in Section 2.2 of this MOPS are not required to be qualified to all of the conditions contained in RTCA/DO-160C.  Judgment and experience have indicated that these particular performance parameters are not susceptible to certain environmental conditions and that the level of performance specified in Section 2.2 will not be measurably degraded by exposure to these conditions.",
    "Certain environmental tests contained in this Section are identified by the phrase \"when required.\"  These tests need not be performed unless the manufacturer wishes to qualify the equipment for that particular environmental condition.  If the equipment is to be qualified to a particular environmental condition, then these \"when required\" tests shall be performed.",
    "## 2.3.2 Equipment Configurations",
    "This MOPS contains provisions to subject different AES configurations to environmental qualification.  Specific AES performance tests have been included for use in conjunction with the environmental procedures of RTCA/DO-160C.  These tests are a subset of the full AES performance tests contained in Section 2.4 of this MOPS.  Normally, a MOPS does not provide specific equipment performance tests to be used in conjunction with the environmental procedures of RTCA/DO-160C.  However, the large",

However, the large number of performance tests in Section 2.4 indicates that a test procedure that includes all of the performance tests combined with the appropriate environmental procedures would be impractical.  The AES qualification conforms to RTCA/DO-160C.  RTCA/DO-160C shall be used when running the test sequence.",
    "## 2.3.3 Configuration Control\n\n \nNominal environment testing, followed by extreme environment testing, shall be conducted on the AES with the Operational Flight Program (OFP) installed according to the correct software version number as specified in the AES configuration documentation. \n \nTable 2-15 is a compliance matrix that cross-references the RTCA/DO-160C environmental test requirements with the performance requirements.  \n\n## 2.3.4 Specific Environmental Test Conditions",

Adjust the new channel unit output level to be the same as with the first channel. \nStep 4.",
    "Step 4. \nTurn on the first channel unit again so that both units are operating.  Use the spectrum analyzer to measure the intermodulation products resulting from the two signals with the measured single carrier power level as a reference. \nStep 5. \nRepeat Steps 1 through 5 for reduced commanded output levels in 5 dB steps to 15 dB below maximum allowable output. \nStep 6.",

    "Step 8. \nRepeat Steps 1 through 4 with a carrier spacing that would produce a fifth order intermodulation product that falls below the frequency defined in Section 2.2.4.2.6 as the limit on fifth-order products.
