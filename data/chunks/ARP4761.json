    "malfunctions. The FHA should identify the failure conditions for each phrase of flight when the failure effects and classifications vary from one flight phase to another. The FHA also establishes derived safety requirements needed to limit the function failure effects which affect the failure condition classification. The requirements may include such things as design constraints, annunciation of failure conditions, recommended flight crew or maintenance action, etc. Furthermore, these",
    "of failure conditions, recommended flight crew or maintenance action, etc. Furthermore, these requirements may involve single or multiple systems. All safety requirements should be traceable and validated at each level of derivation. A good way to accomplish this is to create a table of derived requirements based on design decisions.

    "All fault trees are composed of two kinds of symbols, logic and event. The general rule with \nregard to symbols is, keep it simple; the fewer the different symbol types used the easier it will be for a person reviewing the fault tree to understand it. Logic symbols are used to tie together the \nvarious branches of the fault tree. Logic symbols should not be directly connected together in the fault tree, their inputs and outputs should always be events.",
    "The two main logic symbols used are the Boolean logic AND-gates and OR-gates. The analyst \nselects an AND-gate when the undesired top level event can only occur when all the next lower conditions are true. The OR-gate is used when the undesired event can occur if any one or more of the next lower conditions are true. The analyst may also use other Boolean logic gates if the system architecture warrants the use of these gate types.",
    "Event symbols most commonly used include a rectangle, triangle, oval, circle, house, and",
    "diamond (see Figure D2). A rectangle contains the description of a logic symbol output or an event. A triangle indicates a transfer of information and is composed of two types. A triangle with a vertical line from its top represents a fault tree section (events and their corresponding probability of occurrence) which is \"transferred in\". A triangle with a horizontal line from its side indicates that the event the triangle is tied to is \"transferred out\" to another branch of the tree. The oval",
    "that the event the triangle is tied to is \"transferred out\" to another branch of the tree. The oval represents a Conditional Event which defines a necessary condition for a failure mode to occur (usually used in conjunction with PRIORITY AND and INHIBIT gates). For example, \"monitor fails first\" is a Conditional Event because it is necessary before corrupt data can be propagated through the system undetected.",
    "The circle, house, and diamond all represent types of Primary Events. A circle signifies a Basic \nEvent. A Basic Event is defined as an event which is internal to the system under analysis, requires no further development (i.e., has the capability of causing a fault to occur), and for hardware elements only, can be assigned a failure rate budget or an actual failure rate from an FMES or other source necessary for quantitative evaluation.",

Often these types of events are added to a fault tree in order to make the fault tree \"complete\" from a qualitative model point of view. Software related Primary Events usually take the form of an Undeveloped Event.",
    "Many FTA computer software packages also have additional symbols which are usually unique to \nthat particular FTA software package. The analyst may use other symbols which do not appear in Figure D2 if the symbols are properly defined. \n \n \nMathematical symbols that are used in the appendix include: \nλ      failure rate per hour (usually per hour of flight, but can be per hour of operation) \nT      check interval",

The boundary will be subjectively based on what the analyst wants or needs to accomplish by performing the FTA. Table D1 lists several possible indenture levels and their potential boundaries. Note that the information presented in the \"FTA Boundary\" column indicates one potential boundary of the analysis (i.e., the lowest level of design detail that the analyst will",

The following item may be considered: what are the system inputs and outputs, what support system detail should be included, should human error be included, should software error be included, etc. \nThe selected FTA boundary ties in closely with how the fault tree evaluation results are reported. D.7 UNDESIRED TOP LEVEL EVENT DETERMINATION:",
    "The analyst should compile a list undesired events. Each undesired event will become the top \nlevel event in a fault tree. Depending on the system indenture level the analyst is dealing with, these top level events can have different origins. Table D2 describes some of the sources based on the safety assessment process diagram presented in the main body of this document. D.8 SYSTEM INFORMATION COLLECTION:",

    "A Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a systematic method of identifying the failure \nmodes of a system, item, function, or piece-part and determining the effects on the next higher",
    "level of the design. The detection method (if any) for each failure mode may also be determined. An FMEA may be a quantitative or qualitative analysis and may be performed on all types of systems (e.g., electrical, electronic or mechanical systems). If a quantitative FMEA is being performed, a failure rate is determined for each failure mode. The results of an FMEA may be used to generate the Failure Modes and Effects Summary (FMES) and are usually used to support the other analysis techniques",

    "An FMEA is performed at a given level (system, item, etc.), by postulating the ways the chosen \nlevel's specific implementation may fail. The effect of each failure mode is determined at the given level and usually the next higher level for each operating mode of the equipment. Sometimes an FMEA may be focused toward a specific operating scenario as required to support a top down FTA, DD, or MA. \nThe FMEA must account for all safety related effects and any other effects identified by the",
    "The FMEA must account for all safety related effects and any other effects identified by the \nrequirements. In cases where it is not possible to identify the specific nature of a failure mode, the worst case effect must be assumed. If the worst case is unacceptable for the fault tree, the",
    "failure modes must be examined at the next lower indenture level. (i.e., If the FMEA is being conducted at the functional level, drop to the piece-part level and exclude components with no effect on the event under consideration. If the analysis is being conducted at a piece-part level, drop to consider specific failure mechanisms within the part. Another option is to redesign to improve redundancy or add monitoring.)",
    "Regardless of the level the FMEA is to be performed to, the major steps of an FMEA include \npreparation, analysis, and documentation. \n \nG.3 FMEA PROCESS: G.3.1 \nFMEA Preparation: \n The preparation of an FMEA includes determining the customer requirements, obtaining current \ndocumentation, and understanding the operation of the function. \n It is important to know the customer's expectations and requirements for the FMEA before",
    "It is important to know the customer's expectations and requirements for the FMEA before \nbeginning. If the FMEA requirements are not known, the FMEA may not meet the needs of the requestor and may have to be redone. \n Requirements for an FMEA usually originate from a PSSA activity such as an FTA, DD, MA.",
    "The analyst needs to know the analysis level (functional versus piece-part), safety related effects, other failure effects and operational modes of interest. An FMEA is used to support the safety assessment process by providing failure rates to quantify the basic event of the FTA, DD, or MA. An FMEA may also be used to support verification of the FTA through a comparison of the FMEA failure modes with the basic events of the fault tree.",

After the analyst has gained sufficient knowledge, failure modes are identified. Every feasible hardware failure mode is postulated at the level of the design being analyzed. Consideration is given to failure modes of the components or functions that make up the given level. Information to aid in determining the failure modes of the",

    "Every identified failure mode is analyzed to determine its effect on the given level and usually on \nhigher levels as well. Failure effect categories are created for each different type of effect and a",

The FMEA worksheet provides a list of failure modes, effects and rates. Examples of FMEA worksheets are provided in the following sections. Each effect category must have only one higher level effect, otherwise the effect categories must be defined in more detail. For example, if the effect category is originally",
    "effect categories must be defined in more detail. For example, if the effect category is originally defined as \"causes signal xyz to be out of specification\" but an out of specification high condition causes a different effect from an out of specification low condition, then the effect category should be split to \"... out of specification high\" and \"... out of specification low\".

Whenever possible,",
    "For a quantitative FMEA, a failure rate is assigned to each failure mode. Whenever possible, \nfailure rates should be determined from failure data of similar equipment already in field use.

Functional FMEAs are typically",

Possible common mode sources, common mode \nerrors and justification/protections have been considered.) \n \nNOTE:  SSA - CCA - CMA (Aircraft) NOTE:  SSA - CCA - CMA (Aircraft) NOTE:  SSA - CCA - CMA (Aircraft) NOTE:  SSA - CCA - CMA (Aircraft)",
    "5.0 CONCLUSION \nThe analysis shows that: \na. no even resulting from a common mode type error has been identified which has a \ncatastrophic effect. \n \nb. those common mode type errors which could lead to a hazardous effect are restrained by \nspecial tests, manufacturing processes, quality assurance means or are acceptable because of their probability."
