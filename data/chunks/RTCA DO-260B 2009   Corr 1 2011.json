When broadcast, the contents of a register are inserted in the 56-bit message field of a 112-bit squitter transmission.  The remaining 56 bits contain the aircraft address as well as required forward error correcting parity information.  Appendix A to this document defines the contents of the various transponder registers.",

    "on 1090 MHz. TIS-B complements the operation of ADS-B by providing ground-to-air broadcast of surveillance data on aircraft that are not equipped for 1090 MHz ADS-B.  The basis for this ground surveillance data may be an ATC Mode S radar, a surface or approach multilateration system or a multi-sensor data processing system.  The TIS-B ground-to-air transmissions use the same signal formats as 1090 MHz ADS-B and can therefore be accepted by a 1090 MHz ADS-B receiver.",
    "TIS-B data content on the 1090 MHz signal does not include all of the parameters, such as the System Design Assurance (SDA) and the SIL Supplement, which are normally associated with ADS-B transmissions from aircraft.  Those parameters that are not broadcast will need to be provided by the TIS-B Service Provider.",
    "TIS-B service is the means for providing a complete surveillance picture to 1090 MHz ADS-B users during a transition period.  After transition, it also provides a means to cope with a user that has lost its 1090 MHz ADS-B capability, as well as a means to provide ADS-B users with information from surface or approach multi-lateration systems.",

    "1. The Mode S Extended Squitters use Compact Position Reporting (CPR) to encode",
    "Latitude and Longitude efficiently into messages.  The resulting messages are compact in the sense that several higher-order bits, which are normally constant for long periods of time, are not transmitted in every message.  For example, in a direct binary representation of latitude, one bit would designate whether the aircraft is in the northern or southern hemisphere.  This bit would remain constant for a long time, possibly the entire life of the aircraft.  To repeatedly transmit this bit in",
    "for a long time, possibly the entire life of the aircraft.  To repeatedly transmit this bit in every position message would be inefficient.",
    "2. Because the higher-order bits are not transmitted, it follows that multiple locations \non the earth will produce the same encoded position.  If only a single position message were received, the decoding would involve ambiguity as to which of the multiple solutions is the correct location of the aircraft.  The CPR technique includes \na provision to enable a receiving system to unambiguously determine the location of",
    "a provision to enable a receiving system to unambiguously determine the location of \nthe aircraft.  This is done by encoding in two ways that differ slightly.  The two formats, called even-format and odd-format, are each transmitted fifty percent of the time.  Upon reception of both types within a short period (approximately 10 seconds for airborne formats and 50 seconds for surface formats), the receiving system can unambiguously determine the location of the aircraft.",
    "3. Once this process has been carried out, the higher-order bits are known at the \nreceiving station, so subsequent single message receptions serve to unambiguously indicate the location of the aircraft as it moves. \n4. In certain special cases, a single reception can be decoded into the correct location",
    "without an even/odd pair.  This decoding is based on the fact that the multiple locations are spaced by at least 360 NM.  In addition to the correct locations, the other locations are separated by integer multiples of 360 NM to the north and south and also integer multiples of 360 NM to the east and west.  In a special case in which it is known that reception is impossible beyond a range of 180 NM, the nearest solution is the correct location of the aircraft.",
    "5. The parameter values in the preceding paragraph (360 and 180 NM) apply to the \nairborne CPR encoding.  For aircraft on the surface, the CPR parameters are smaller by a factor of 4.  This encoding yields better resolution but reduces the spacing of the multiple solutions.",

    "1. This section of Appendix A defines the formats and coding for a Traffic Information \nService Broadcast (TIS-B) based on the same 112-bit 1090 MHz signal transmission that is used for ADS-B on 1090 MHz.   \n2. TIS-B complements the operation of ADS-B by providing ground-to-air broadcast of \nsurveillance data on aircraft that are not equipped for 1090 MHz ADS-B.  The basis for this ground surveillance data may be an ATC Mode S radar, a surface or",
    "approach multi-lateration system or a multi-sensor data processing system.  The TIS-\nB ground-to-air transmissions use the same signal formats as 1090 MHz ADS-B and can therefore be accepted by a 1090 MHz ADS-B receiver. \n3. TIS-B data content on the 1090 MHz signal does not include all of the parameters,",
    "3. TIS-B data content on the 1090 MHz signal does not include all of the parameters, \nsuch as the System Design Assurance (SDA) and the SIL Supplement, which are normally associated with ADS-B transmissions from aircraft.

The basis for the ADS-B \nRebroadcast transmission is the ADS-B Report received at the ground station using a receiver compatible with the alternate ADS-B data link.",
    "3. The ADS-B Rebroadcast ground-to-air transmissions use the same signal formats as \nthe DF=17 1090 MHz Extended Squitter ADS-B and can therefore be accepted by a \n1090 MHz ADS-B Receiving Subsystem, with the exceptions identified in the following sections.",

Such effects are known to be significant in the performance of the existing ATCRBS, Mode S surveillance and collisions avoidance (TCAS/ACAS) systems.

To support surveillance from the ground, ideally an aircraft antenna would provide coverage that is omnidirectional in azimuth, and that maintains signal strength when an aircraft banks and/or pitches.  Furthermore the physical antenna should be small to minimize drag.  Practical antennas installed on aircraft differ from the ideal in several ways.  The most obvious difference is that a single antenna provides good coverage over just one of the two hemispheres.  A bottom mounted",

Typically a top antenna pattern will exhibit a reduction in gain in the aft direction.

In addition to the tail, objects such as other antennas, propeller blades, engines, wheels, and flaps can also cause blockage of 1090 MHz signals.  Furthermore it is possible for reflections from a wing or other flat surface on the aircraft to interfere constructively or destructively with the signal and cause additional fluctuations in signal",

The results are useful in that they extend the cases described in Ref. C-2, providing a much larger number of cases in which to observe the described effects.",

An example of a planned operational surface surveillance system, ASDE-X, is provided to illustrate the implementation of a transition strategy.

The capability of Extended Squitter ground receiving stations was defined in general operational terms.  The purpose of this section is to provide more details on the architecture that might be used to provide Extended Squitter surveillance for ground ATC use.   \n\n## D.2.6.1.2 Overview",
    "## D.2.6.1.2 Overview\n\nThis section begins with a description of the currently implemented Mode S ground interrogators.  This is relevant to Extended Squitter since ADS-B surveillance data can be obtained by a conventional Mode S interrogator via direct readout of the Mode S transponder.  Such readout will likely be the initial technique for ATC use of ADS-B \ndata.  This is followed by a description of the architecture of increasingly more capable Extended Squitter ground stations.",
    "## D.2.6.1.3 Interface Considerations\n\nExtended squitter ground stations will require the ability to interface with other ATC surveillance resources to generate a consolidated surveillance image.  For this reason, these ground stations will be required to conform to an appropriate output interface standard (e.g., the internationally accepted Eurocontrol ASTERIX formats).   \n\n## D.2.6.2 Mode S Ssr Ground Station",

Terminal Mode S SSRs operate with a scan time of 4 to 6 seconds and provide coverage out to 60 to 100 NM.  En route Mode S SSRs operate with scan times of 8 to 12 seconds out to a range of 200 to 250 NM.  A functional diagram of a Mode S SSR ground station is provided in Figure D-1. \n\n##",
    "A Mode S SSR provides surveillance and data link service to Mode S equipped aircraft and surveillance service for Mode A/C equipped aircraft.  Due to the use of monopulse, (a technique for determining the off-boresight angle of received replies) surveillance to a Mode S aircraft is normally provided via a single interrogation per scan.  Additional interrogations are scheduled each scan as needed to provide data link service. One data link service supported by a Mode S SSR is the readout of",

One data link service supported by a Mode S SSR is the readout of transponder data registers that can be loaded by the aircraft to contain aircraft state, intent, weather data, etc.  These registers can be accessed on demand by the Mode S SSR using the ground initiated Comm-B (GICB) protocol.  This protocol is employed to provide the enhanced surveillance capability being mandated by States in the core area of central Europe. Extended squitter information that is",

In addition, it is equipped with a six-sector antenna, with one receiver per antenna beam and a single transmitter that may be switched to any beam as required.

    "Validation and Fall-Back Surveillance:  In addition to increased capacity, the six-sector antenna enables this ground station to provide a higher level of validation than the omni directional configuration.

With this level of position accuracy, backup surveillance is possible.  Backup surveillance refers to an alternative surveillance capability that can be used during an outage of the principal surveillance system that provides equivalent performance to the principle system.",
    "Mode S and Mode A/C Surveillance:  Mode S and Mode A/C surveillance capability can also be provided via active interrogation.  The coarse position information provided by the six-sector antenna would be very useful in eliminating false targets that could otherwise result from performing multilateration on non-discrete Mode A Code replies.",

    "## G.4 Air-Ground Surveillance Applications",
    "For ground-based surveillance applications, initial validation of ADS-B will be supported, where possible, using the existing ground surveillance infrastructure.  For example, it is intended that 1090 MHz ADS-B messages may be correlated against Secondary Surveillance Radars (SSRs) and enhancements made to those radars to support distribution of ADS-B information to appropriate ground-based systems.  Further, transponder-based ADS-B implementations in aircraft are likely to be polled by SSRs",

    "It is recognized that data provided via ADS-B will be used in applications that will be evaluated on an end-to-end basis for each intended use.  Approval of specific operational use will be predicated on the results of an analysis of the total systems involved.

The actual *requirements* on the Report Assembly Function are to be found in Section 2 of this MOPS, particularly subsections Â§2.2.8 and Â§2.2.10.  This Appendix is provided as a narrative guide to those requirements and to how they might be met.",
    "## H.2 Data Flow Into And Out Of The Report Assembly Function",
    "See Figure H-1, which is a copy of Figure 2-20 from Section 2 of this document.  The Report Assembly Function takes ADS-B Messages after they have been received and corrected for possible bit errors by the Message Input Processing.  From these messages it composes ADS-B reports and delivers those reports to the report output storage buffer, from which they can be retrieved by the user application.  The actual interface between the report output storage buffer and the ADS-B user application is",

The requirements on this optional interface have not been specified in this document.  This interface, if present, might be used in the following ways.",
    "a. The Report Control Interface could let the application specify for which ADS-B \nParticipants it desires to receive reports, and for which participants it does not require reports.  For instance, an application might specify, via the Report Control Interface,",
    "that it does not require reports for aircraft that are more than 50 nautical miles away from the own-ship.  Again, the application might use the Report Control Interface to specify that it does not require reports concerning targets that are above (or below) a specified altitude.",
    "b. The Report Control Interface could let the application specify, for specific targets, \nwhich report data elements are required and which may be omitted.  For example, a Paired Approach application (as in RTCA DO-242A, Â§D.1.14) would require more \ninformation about the target with which the own-ship is paired for the approach than a concurrently running Aid To Visual Acquisition application would require for other nearby ADS-B Participants.",

However, the information content is specified by Â§2.2.17.4.6.

    "The purpose of this Appendix is to provide a description of improved squitter reception techniques.  Elements of improved squitter reception include (1) the use of amplitude to improve bit and confidence declaration accuracy, (2) more capable error detection/correction algorithms, (3) more selective preamble detection approaches, and (4) combinations of the above. The improved techniques presented in this Appendix represent one way of achieving the performance requirements specified in Â§2.2.4.4",
    "in this Appendix represent one way of achieving the performance requirements specified in Â§2.2.4.4 for enhanced squitter reception.  The squitter processing configuration used as the basis for these performance requirements is specified in Â§I.5.",
    "The reception techniques, as required in Â§2.2.4.3.4 of these MOPS, are also described in this appendix for comparison with the enhancements. \n\n## I.2 Background",
    "Squitter reception includes the detection of the Mode S 1090 MHz waveform preamble, declaration of the bit and confidence values, error detection, and (if necessary) error correction.  The current techniques for squitter reception are based upon techniques developed for use in Mode S narrow-beam interrogators and for TCAS.  In both of these applications, the rate of Mode A/C FRUIT (see glossary) that is stronger than the Mode S",
    "waveform is relatively low, nominally less than 4000 FRUIT per second.",
    "Early applications investigated for Extended Squitter, prior to the development of this document, included long range air-ground surveillance, surface surveillance and support for TCAS.  Of these three applications, the only one with the potential for operating in significantly higher FRUIT environments was the air-ground application.  For this application, it is possible to use sectorized antennas (6 to 12 sectors) to limit the amount of FRUIT detected by any receiver.",
    "Extended Squitter applications have now been defined in DO-242A, including long range \n(up to 90 NM) air-air surveillance in support of free flight.  This type of surveillance is referred to as Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI).  For this application, sectorized antennas are not an option.  In high-density environments, it is possible to operate with FRUIT rates of 40000 FRUIT per second and higher.",
    "Even with these FRUIT rates, Extended Squitter reception using current techniques will provide useful performance.  However, operation of Extended Squitter in very high Mode A/C FRUIT environments has led to the development of improved squitter reception techniques to support long range CDTI in high-density environments. \n\n## I.3 Current Squitter Reception Techniques",
    "Receiving systems for Mode S replies and squitters are currently implemented operationally in ground based Mode S interrogator/receiver systems and in TCAS avionics.  For TCAS, the current reception techniques are defined in RTCA DO-185B",
    "(EUROCAE ED-143).  These current reception techniques are the basis for the reception requirements in these MOPS (see Â§2.2).  The enhanced techniques that are the subject of this Appendix are not required in this version of the MOPS, but are planned to be required in a future version.",
    "## I.3.1 Overview Of Current Techniques",
    "Extended squitter uses the 112-bit Mode S waveform shown in Figure I-1.  Other than bit assignments, this is the same as the long reply waveform currently used operationally for air-ground replies and for air-air coordination messages in TCAS.  This waveform encodes data using pulse position modulation (PPM).  A chip in the leading half of the bit position represents a binary ONE.  A chip in the trailing half bit position represents a binary ZERO.  Reception of the Squitter begins with the",
    "the trailing half bit position represents a binary ZERO.  Reception of the Squitter begins with the detection of the four-pulse preamble.  At preamble detection a dynamic threshold is set 6 dB below the level of the preamble.  Any signal received below this threshold will not be seen by the squitter reception processor.  This eliminates the effect of low level Mode A/C and Mode S FRUIT on the reception process.",
    "Once all of the bits have been received, error detection is performed using the 24-bit CRC contained in the PI field.  If no error is detected, the squitter is passed on to surveillance processing.  If an error is detected (indicated by a non-zero error syndrome) an error correction technique is applied.  The current error correction algorithm can correct the errors caused by one stronger overlapping Mode A/C FRUIT. \n\n## I.3.2 Current Techniques For Bit And Confidence Declaration",
    "## I.3.2 Current Techniques For Bit And Confidence Declaration\n\nCurrently, bit values are declared by comparing the amplitudes of the centers of the two chips; the chip with the greater amplitude is declared the bit value.  This amplitude comparison technique limits bit errors caused by FRUIT of lower level than the squitter being received (Figure I-2, parts a and b).",

    "## Note:\n\nCurrently confidence for each bit is declared by observing if signals are above threshold on both chips.  If only one chip is above threshold, it is declared to be high confidence since there is no evidence of overlapping FRUIT.  If both chips have amplitude above threshold, low confidence is declared since some form of interference had to be present to cause this condition (Figure I-2, part c).",
    "Since the nominal width of a Mode A/C pulse is 0.45 microsecond, an interfering Mode A/C pulse can affect only 1 of the 2 chips of a Mode S bit position.  If the chip affected is the one with the Mode S pulse, the level of the pulse in the chip will be altered, but since it is the only chip with energy, the bit will be declared as high confidence.  If instead the interfering pulse affects the blank chip, pulses will exist in both positions and the Mode S",
    "bit will be declared as low confidence.  Since the bit decision is based on the larger pulse, if the Mode A/C FRUIT is stronger than the Mode S signal, any such bit will be declared in error, while if the Mode S signal is stronger, any such bit will be declared correctly.",
    "## I.3.3 Current Error Detection And Correction Techniques I.3.3.1 Overview",
    "When a Mode A/C FRUIT interferes with a Mode S Extended Squitter, some of the Mode S bits may be declared in error.  The current Mode S error correction algorithm attempts to correct these errors by locating a string of 24 consecutive bits such that the low confidence bits in the window cover the bits in the corresponding error syndrome [reference I-1].  If such a window is found, all low confidence bits matching the syndrome are flipped, and the message is declared correct.",
    "## I.3.3.2 Sliding Window Technique",
    "This algorithm operates by examining successive 24 bit windows, starting with bits 89- 112 of the message.  In order to achieve a successful error correction, each message bit in the window corresponding to a one (1) in the error syndrome must have its value complemented (i.e., a one is changed to a zero (0) and a zero is changed to a one).  This complementing can only be done if each of the bits is declared to be low confidence.  If so, each of the bits is complemented and the message is",
    "bits is declared to be low confidence.  If so, each of the bits is complemented and the message is declared to be error corrected.  If not, the window is shifted one bit downward, a transformed syndrome is computed and the process repeats.  The process ends when a correctable error pattern has been found, or the sliding window reaches the beginning of the message.  In order to control undetected errors, correction is not attempted if there are more than 12 low confidence bits in the window.",
    "errors, correction is not attempted if there are more than 12 low confidence bits in the window. This technique provides error correction in cases where a Mode S message has been overlaid with one stronger Mode A/C FRUIT (that caused all bit errors) and one or more weaker Mode A/C FRUIT that were above the dynamic threshold (and caused only low confidence bits).  This technique is well suited to the low levels of Mode A/C FRUIT",
    "observed in a narrow-beam Mode S interrogator or a TCAS.  This technique is not appropriate for high FRUIT rate environments since it produces a high undetected error rate; for this reason, its use is prohibited in Â§2.2.4.4.",
    "## I.4 Enhanced Squitter Reception Techniques I.4.1 Enhanced Preamble Detection",
    "Preamble detection identifies the beginning of an Extended Squitter reception.  The process has two outputs: (1) the start time of the signal and (2) the received power level of this signal.  This process includes validation that uses the receptions during the first 5 bits in the data block and several other validation tests.  Following is a description of a particular enhanced preamble detection technique that has been used successfully in achieving the performance required in these MOPS.",
    "## I.4.1.1 Log Video Samples",
    "The preamble detection process described here operates on data in the form of samples of the log video received waveform.  Specifically, the sample rate is 10 samples per microsecond, although other sample rates, including 8 samples per microsecond, have been found to be effective.  In developing these enhanced decoding techniques, both an 8 MHz and 10 MHz sampling rate implementation were tested.  It was determined that the",
    "10 MHz sampling rate yielded better reception performance.  In general, a higher sampling rate will perform better because of more samples for bit and confidence decoding.  For these MOPS, the 10 MHz sampling rate implementation was used to establish the reception performance required for Class A3 equipment, and the 8 MHz sampling rate implementation was used to set the required performance for the Class A2 equipment.",
    "## I.4.1.2 Threshold\n\nThe preamble detection process includes a threshold power level used to discard very weak receptions.  Typical value = -88 dBm (referred to the antenna) for an A3 receiver. The Minimum Triggering Level (MTL), which is the point of 90 percent receptions in the absence of interference, is typically about 4 dB higher than the threshold. \n\n## I.4.1.3 Valid Pulse Position",
    "## I.4.1.3 Valid Pulse Position\n\nA sample that is above threshold and also is followed consecutively by N or more samples above threshold is defined to be a \"Valid Pulse Position.\"  If the sample rate is 10 per microsecond, then N = 3.  This definition has the effect of defining a pulse as an event in which at least 4 consecutive samples are above threshold.  For other sample rates, N is adjusted so that a pulse is declared when the signal is above threshold for more than 0.3 microseconds.",
    "## I.4.1.4 Leading Edge",
    "A Leading Edge is declared for a particular sample if it is a Valid Pulse Position and also has substantial slope in the interval before this sample and less than substantial slope in the next interval.  Substantial slope is defined by the power change between one sample and the next.  The slope threshold is 48 dB per microsecond (applicable to receiver bandwidth of approximately 8 MHz).  Therefore if the sample rate is 10 samples per microsecond, the threshold is 4.8 dB.",
    "## I.4.1.5 Initial Detection Of A 4-Pulse Preamble\n\nThe preamble detection process begins when four pulses have been detected, having the spacing of the Mode S preamble.  The detection criterion is:",
    "- Finding four pulses having timing of 0 - 1.0 - 3.5 - 4.5 microsecond \n- Two or more of these must be Leading Edges. \n- The others can be Valid Pulse Positions - Sample tolerance can be plus or minus 1 (but not both) \nNote that the power levels in the four pulses need not agree.  Note also that trailing edges are not used. \n\n## I.4.1.6 Arrival Time",
    "## I.4.1.6 Arrival Time\n\nThe signal arrival time is initially estimated to be the leading edge of the first of these four pulses.  Subsequently this is adjusted by +1 or -1 sample if two or more of the other three pulses have leading edges with that timing. \n\n## I.4.1.7 Reference Level Generation",
    "A Reference Power Level is generated during preamble detection for use in re-triggering and during demodulation of the data block.  Step 1 is to identify a set of samples to use. Among the four preamble pulses, those whose leading edges agree with the preamble timing are used; samples from the other pulses are not used.  Next, for each pulse used, select the M samples after the leading edge sample.  If the sample rate is 10 per microsecond, then M = 3.  For other sample rates, the value of M is",
    "If the sample rate is 10 per microsecond, then M = 3.  For other sample rates, the value of M is equal to the value of N defined in Â§I.4.1.3.",
    "Step 2 is an algorithm to generate the Reference Level from these samples.  For each sample, compute the number of other samples that are within 2 dB.  Then find the maximum of these counts.  If the maximum count is unique, then the sample used to form that count is taken to be the Reference Level.",
    "Otherwise, when there are two or more samples whose counts are maximum and equal, discard any samples whose counts are less than this maximum.  For the remaining samples, find the minimum power and then discard any samples that are more than 2 dB stronger than that minimum.  Compute the average of the remaining samples.  This is taken to be the Reference Level for the preamble. \n\n## I.4.1.8 Overlapping Signals And Re-Triggering",
    "The preamble detection process is capable of processing multiple overlapped preambles, but the data block processing, which is more extensive, can only accept one signal at a time.  For this reason, a re-triggering function is included.  This function will reject certain preamble detections when a subsequent stronger signal is received. One step in the re-triggering process checks for overlap by later Mode S signals having certain specific timing offsets.  For example, if the subsequent signal",
    "later Mode S signals having certain specific timing offsets.  For example, if the subsequent signal is 1 microsecond later, then two of the preamble pulses in the later signal coincide with preamble pulses in the original signal, which can cause a problem if the later signal is stronger.  The potential problem is that the stronger pulses can cause the power estimate for the first signal to be too high, and therefore prevent re-triggering.  This type of problem can also occur if the timing",
    "too high, and therefore prevent re-triggering.  This type of problem can also occur if the timing difference is 3.5 or 4.5 microseconds.  Figure I-3 illustrates the 1 microsecond overlap that motivates this test.",
    "1-Microsecond Test.  To counter this potential problem, the next step after preamble detection is to check for excessive power in pulse positions 1.0, 2.0, 4.5, and 5.5 microseconds after the start.  For each of these pulse positions, one sample is used to estimate the power of a pulse at that time.  Letting T = 0 denote the time one sample after the leading edge time of the first preamble pulse, then the four pulses are taken to be the samples at times T = 1.0, 2.0, 4.5, and 5.5 microseconds.",
    "then the four pulses are taken to be the samples at times T = 1.0, 2.0, 4.5, and 5.5 microseconds.  From these four power measurements, the minimum is used to compare against the maximum of the samples at T",

    "3.5-microsecond test.  A similar test is performed to protect against overlap by a stronger signal 3.5 microseconds later.  The minimum power in samples at T = 3.5, 4.5, 7.0, and 8.0 is compared against the maximum of the samples at T = 0 and 1.0 microseconds.  If this difference indicates that the preamble under consideration is -3 dB or weaker relative to the other four samples, then this preamble is rejected.",

If this difference indicates that the preamble under consideration is -3 dB or weaker relative to the other four samples, then this preamble is rejected. \n\n## I.4.1.9 Consistent Power Test",
    "## I.4.1.9 Consistent Power Test\n\nAnother test is applied to validate the preamble.  This test asks whether at least two of the four preamble pulses agree in power level with the Reference Level to within +/-3 dB.  If not, this preamble is rejected. \n\n## I.4.1.10 Df Validation",
    "An additional validation is made using the first five bits in the data block.  Each of the five bits is considered to consist of two chips, each of duration 0.5 microseconds.  Pulse detection is carried out for the 10 chips as follows.  For a particular chip, a pulse is detected if a Valid Pulse Position is found at the leading edge time for this chip or within +/-1 sample of the leading edge time.  The preamble is then validated if, for each of these five bits, a pulse is detected either in",
    "The preamble is then validated if, for each of these five bits, a pulse is detected either in the first chip or in the second chip or both and the peak amplitude of the pulse is equal to 6 dB below the preamble reference level or greater.  Otherwise the preamble is rejected.  The peak amplitude is determined by using the highest amplitude sample of the M samples that comprise the pulse (where M = N + 1",
    "for N as defined in Â§I.4.1.3).",
    "## I.4.1.11 Re-Triggering",
    "After a preamble is detected, the preamble detection process continues to be applied searching for later preambles.  All of the steps described above are applied even when detected preambles are overlapped.

Otherwise (if an earlier signal is being processed and the new signal is not stronger by 3 dB or more), the new signal is rejected, so that the earlier signal processing can continue.",
    "## I.4.1.12 Preamble Detection Summary\n\nFigure I-4 summarizes the preamble detection process. \n\n\n## I.4.2 Enhanced Bit And Confidence Declaration I.4.2.1 Overview",
    "The current technique of declaring a bit based upon the higher of the two chips will generate bit errors in cases of higher level overlapping Mode A/C FRUIT (Figure I-2, part c).  The use of amplitude to correlate the received pulse with the preamble pulse level will improve bit declaration accuracy.  Four techniques have been investigated. One is a very simple approach that uses only the amplitude measured at the center of each chip.  The remaining three use a more capable approach that takes",
    "measured at the center of each chip.  The remaining three use a more capable approach that takes advantage of all samples per chip that are taken to establish bit and confidence.  Each of these techniques is described in the following paragraphs. The following description of the center sample technique is intended to provide an example of processing performance needed to meet the requirements of Class A1S and A1 equipment.  This description also serves as an introduction to the three more",
    "of Class A1S and A1 equipment.  This description also serves as an introduction to the three more capable approaches.  The center sample technique will not provide sufficient performance to meet requirements specified for Class A2 and A3 equipment in the test procedures of Â§2.4.4.4. The specified performance for these latter classes of equipment can only be met by an approach that performs equivalently to one of the multi-sample techniques.",
    "## I.4.2.2 Use Of Center Amplitude",
    "An improvement in the declaration of Mode S data bits can be achieved if the actual amplitudes of the center samples of the '1' and '0' chips can be measured for each data position, rather than just a comparison of which chip sample is greater.  All Mode S pulses, including those of the preamble, have approximately the same level (within 1 or 2 dB).  Thus if the preamble level is measured, the expected level of each data pulse will be known.  Then if both center samples of a data position are",
    "level of each data pulse will be known.  Then if both center samples of a data position are above threshold, but only one is within a Â±3 dB band centered at the preamble level, it would be reasonable to assume that the corresponding chip is the correct Mode S pulse location.  This is illustrated in Figure I-2, part d. Figure I-5 illustrates the new data and confidence declaration algorithms that result when the actual sample amplitudes can be measured, and both samples are above threshold.  As",
    "result when the actual sample amplitudes can be measured, and both samples are above threshold.  As shown in Figure I-5, a bit is high confidence when 1 and only 1 of the two samples correlate with the preamble level.  The correlating sample, rather than the larger sample, is declared to be the true data value.  If both samples, or neither sample, correlates with the preamble, a low confidence bit is declared.  In this case, the larger sample is selected as the bit value, as in the current",
    "bit is declared.  In this case, the larger sample is selected as the bit value, as in the current technique.",
    "a. One in window\nb. One in window c. Neither in window, second larger\nd. Both in window, second larger",
    "The major advantage of this scheme is the significant reduction in low confidence and bit errors generated for the Mode S message.  Presently, any data position with both samples above threshold is declared low confidence.  This translates to a low confidence declaration whenever an above-threshold Mode A/C FRUIT overlaps a Mode S empty chip position.  If the Mode A/C signal is of greater power, the bit position is declared in error. With the center amplitude technique, a low confidence bit is",
    "the bit position is declared in error. With the center amplitude technique, a low confidence bit is declared only when the Mode A/C FRUIT is within 3 dB of the Mode S signal.  Mode A/C FRUIT of either lower or higher power in general cause neither errors nor low confidence bits.  Thus the region of concern for Mode A/C aircraft is reduced from all the aircraft at closer range to just those at approximately co-range.  This is particularly significant when the system is attempting to listen to",
    "co-range.  This is particularly significant when the system is attempting to listen to far-range Mode S aircraft. It is occasionally possible for this new algorithm to produce high confidence bit errors. The most likely case occurs when two Mode A/C pulses overlay the same Mode S bit position.  If one overlaps the data pulse, and drives its sample out of the preamble window, then an error will result if the other Mode A/C pulse lands on the other chip and its amplitude is within the preamble",
    "result if the other Mode A/C pulse lands on the other chip and its amplitude is within the preamble window.  Such occurrences will in general create a rejected message, rather than an undetected error.",
    "## I.4.2.3 Use Of Multiple Amplitude Samples",
    "The above amplitude data declaration approach can be improved if all 10 samples (5 per chip) that are taken for each Mode S bit position are utilized in the decision process.  In particular, the event of both center samples within the preamble window can often be resolved. For example, consider the typical such situation depicted in Figure I-2, part e. Although both center samples are within the window, the fact that the earlier chip has all samples within the window, whereas the later chip has",
    "the fact that the earlier chip has all samples within the window, whereas the later chip has several samples below the window suggests that the signal is present in the earlier chip.  This error situation can often be rectified when all 10 samples are examined.  Also, in some cases when an interference pulse overlaps a signal pulse, the small frequency difference will produce variations in amplitude, whereas the signal by itself would be more constant, and such patterns can be useful in",

    "## I.4.2.3.1 Baseline Multi-Sample Technique\n\nThe multi-sample enhanced bit and confidence declaration technique makes use of all 10 samples for each Mode S bit position to determine the bit and confidence values.  Sample amplitudes in each chip are compared to the amplitude reference level established by the preamble to quantify the number of samples in each chip that:",
    "(a) match the preamble amplitude indicating the presence of a pulse, or (b) are significantly lower in amplitude indicating a lack of transmitted energy.",
    "The first step is to establish an amplitude window that will include samples that are within +/- 3 dB of the preamble reference level and a minimum amplitude threshold set to 6 dB below the reference level.  Samples that fall within the window are considered to match the preamble and samples that are below the minimum threshold are considered to indicate a lack of transmitted energy.  The samples are categorized as follows:",
    "A: within the +/- 3 dB preamble window B: below threshold (6 dB or more below the preamble) \nThe second step is to count the number of samples in each chip that are of each category.",
    "Less weight is given to the samples near the transitional areas of each chip (the transitional samples are the first and last samples of each chip).  To facilitate this, samples other than those at each end will count double.  Therefore, with weighting factored in, and a 10 MHz sampling rate, the counts for each category will range from 0 to 8 for each chip (1 sample at each end + 3 samples in-between x 2).  The four counts are summarized as follows:",

For each bit of each trial, the pattern and the correct Mode S bit value are noted.

    "Three new error detection/correction techniques have been developed.  The first, termed the \"Conservative\" technique is a variation on the current Sliding Window technique, intended to reduce the undetected error rate.  The second, termed the \"Whole Message\" technique, models the effect of whole Mode A/C FRUIT on the bit and confidence declarations.  The third, termed the \"Brute Force\" technique, performs a bounded exhaustive search of all combinations of bit reversals for low confidence bits.",
    "performs a bounded exhaustive search of all combinations of bit reversals for low confidence bits.  The following sections describe these techniques in more detail.",
    "## I.4.3.2 Conservative Technique",
    "The sliding window technique is suitable for the low FRUIT environments of a rotating beam antenna (long range, narrow beam) or a TCAS (omni-directional, short range).",
    "However, the FRUIT environment for the long-range air-to-air application (which uses omni-directional antennas) may be very severe and therefore, the sliding window technique cannot be used because of undetected error considerations. For the very severe FRUIT environments, a simpler approach, known as the conservative technique is used.  Using this technique, error correction is only attempted if all of the low confidence bits in the message are within a 24-bit window, and there are no more",
    "if all of the low confidence bits in the message are within a 24-bit window, and there are no more than 12 low confidence bits.  This constraint limits the application of error correction to signals that nominally had only a single overlapping stronger Mode A/C FRUIT.  This is a conservative approach in that the conditions for attempting error correction are much more restrictive than with sliding window.  It produces a lower level of successful error correction since it does not attempt to",
    "window.  It produces a lower level of successful error correction since it does not attempt to correct messages with multiple Mode A/C overlaps.  However, it produces a very low undetected error rate, as intended. If the conditions for applying the conservative technique are met, the error syndrome is generated for the window position and (as for the sliding window technique) a check is made to see if the ones (1) in the error syndrome correspond to low confidence bits in the window.  If so,",
    "see if the ones (1) in the error syndrome correspond to low confidence bits in the window.  If so, error correction is accomplished.  If not, the process is terminated. If the low confidence bits span less than 24-bits, more than one window could be defined to span them.  This will not effect the error correction action, since regardless of the 24-",
    "bit window selected to span the low confidence bits, the ones (1) in the error syndrome will identify the same message bits.  That is, if the window is moved one bit, the error syndrome will shift by one bit. Note that in the above description, there is only one possible successful error correction possibility.  Regardless of the specific 24-bit window position, the same message bits are identified.  All of the bits corresponding to a one (1) in the error syndrome must be complemented.  This",
    "All of the bits corresponding to a one (1) in the error syndrome must be complemented.  This can only happen if they are all low confidence.  Therefore, there is at most, one correctable error pattern that can be achieved with the conservative error correction technique.",
    "## I.4.3.3 Whole Message Error Detection And Correction Technique",
    "The limitation of the current error correction technique described in I.3.3 of being able to handle only a single overlapping Mode A/C FRUIT has led to the development of the Whole Message error correction technique, which can be applied when the Conservative technique has failed.  This technique is designed to handle up to five overlapping FRUIT, provided they do not overlap each other, hence creating \"individual interference regions.\" This technique is applicable only when the center sampling",
    "\"individual interference regions.\" This technique is applicable only when the center sampling technique is used (Â§I.4.2.2). As described in Â§I.3.2, the correctness of low confidence bits depend upon the amplitude of the Mode A/C interference relative to the Mode S squitter:  if the Mode A/C FRUIT is stronger than the Mode S signal, any low confidence bit will usually be declared in error, while if the Mode S signal is stronger, any low confidence bit will usually be declared correctly.  This",
    "if the Mode S signal is stronger, any low confidence bit will usually be declared correctly.  This observation leads to the following hypothesis, which serves as the basis of the Whole Message error correction routine:",
    "For a given Mode A/C interference region, either all low confidence bits will be correct, or all low confidence bits will be wrong.",
    "Although this hypothesis is generally correct, it should be noted that three effects can lead to its violation:",
    "1. If the interfering Mode A/C FRUIT is at approximately the same power level as the \nMode S signal, or \n2. If the interfering Mode A/C FRUIT pulses are wider than 0.50 microseconds (the \nspec allows up to 0.55 microseconds, and some out-of-spec transponders even go \nbeyond this value), or \n3. If the Mode S signal is near enough to the noise level for noise to corrupt some of the \nsamples.",
    "The Whole Message algorithm attempts to divide the Mode S message into disjoint 24-bit regions, one for each presumed Mode A/C interfering FRUIT.  Then the syndrome of each region, assuming all bits to be in error, is generated (see below in Â§I.4.3.4 for an explanation of syndrome generation for bit sets).  Finally, all possible combinations of syndromes are considered.  If one and only one combination matches the Mode S syndrome, all low confidence bits within the interference regions",
    "combination matches the Mode S syndrome, all low confidence bits within the interference regions corresponding to the winning combination are reversed.  Flowcharts for the Whole Message error correction technique are presented in Figure I-6 and Figure I-7.  Figure I-8 presents an example of the application of this method.",
    "## Assume Error Syndrome = B12472\n\nTherefore, Invert All Low Confidence Bits in Regions 1 & 3 \n\n## I.4.3.4 Brute Force Error Correction Technique",
    "If the bit declaration algorithm has performed its function properly, all errors in Mode S data values will reside in bits declared low confidence.  If this is true, a simple approach to error correction is to try all possible combination of low confidence bits, and accept the set that matches the error syndrome (provided only one success is discovered).  For obvious reasons, this method has been named the Brute Force Technique.  It is applicable to any method of data and confidence",
    "has been named the Brute Force Technique.  It is applicable to any method of data and confidence declaration, with or without amplitude.  As illustrated in Figure I-9, Brute Force error correction is applied after the other techniques have failed.",
    "Implementation of this technique depends upon the fact that each Mode S bit position corresponds to a unique syndrome, and that sets of bits produce a syndrome that is the exclusive OR of all individual bit syndromes.  For example, if bit 1 is the only bit declared in error, the error syndrome at the receiver will be hex 3935EA, while bit 31",
    "produces hex FDB444, and bit 111 has syndrome hex 000002.  Thus if those three bits are all declared in error, the error syndrome will be calculated to be hex C481AC.  The table of individual bit syndromes is pre-calculated and stored in the receiver. It is possible for two or more subsets of the low confidence bits to match the syndrome. In such cases, the message is rejected, and no harm is done.  However, if a high confidence bit has been declared in error, and a single subset of the low",
    "done.  However, if a high confidence bit has been declared in error, and a single subset of the low confidence bits matches the syndrome, the message will be \"corrected\" to the wrong message, producing an undetected error.  (If no subset matches the syndrome, it must be true that a high confidence bit error has been made, and the message is rejected.)",
    "Clearly, for processing time and error bounding reasons, the maximum number of low confidence bits to process must be limited.  The number of cases to consider is given by \n2n.  If n low confidence bits exist for a message; this grows exponentially with n (32 at n",
    "2n.  If n low confidence bits exist for a message; this grows exponentially with n (32 at n \n= 5, 4096 at n = 12).  The undetected error rate is proportional to the number of cases, and thus also grows exponentially with n.  Fortunately, the Hamming distance of 6 for the Mode S parity code implies that undetected errors are essentially zero if n</=5 is enforced.  For this reason, a value of n = 5 has been used in the development of the brute force algorithm.",
    "## I.5 Improved Reception Performance In A High Fruit Environment\n\nFor improved reception performance in a high FRUIT environment, the optimum configuration has been found to be:",
    "1. Enhanced preamble detection (Â§I.4.1) 2. Bit and confidence declaration based on the Baseline Multi-sample Technique \n(Â§I.4.2.3.1) \n3.

Second pass error correction using the brute force technique with n=5 (Â§I.4.3.4)",
    "The process proceeds as follows.  Preamble detection and bit and confidence declaration are performed.  Next, Mode S error detection is applied.  If the message passes, the process ends, and the message is delivered.  If an error is detected, then conservative error correction is applied, and if a correction results, then the process ends, and the message is delivered.  If the constraint for conservative correction is not satisfied, then the brute force technique is applied. The above",

In order to form the full state vector some method of state vector reconstruction must be applied.  This may involve filtering the incoming messages to time register a full state vector, reporting latent data in the state vector report, or a combination of both. \n\nTwo methods of state vector reconstruction are analyzed:",

The results in Reference K-1 are consistent with the results given in this Appendix.",
    "## K.3 Scenarios And Results",
    "To evaluate velocity accuracy, Monte-Carlo simulations of a maneuvering scenario were run.  Statistical results on velocity accuracy were then collected using the scenario shown in Figure K-1.  In this scenario, the aircraft travels at 150 knots, and executes 180 degree turn with a turn rate of 3 degrees per second.  This results in an acceleration of slightly less than 0.5 g (where g is the acceleration due to gravity), the ADS-B MASPS defined limit condition for state vector accuracy.",

In addition to the segmented message based results, results for a benchmark full state-vector message are included.  Sending this hypothetical message at an update period of T=3 seconds, and a probability of receipt of 0.95 was simulated.

However, the following analysis",

    "receives position and velocity is not updated.  Applying a Kalman filter to the segmented messages still does not result in compliance with the literal ADS-B MASPS",
    "requirements.  With the segmented message set, the velocity portion of the state vector report lags the actual velocity after receipt of a position message.  Without updating velocity after the receipt of a position message, the velocity is as old as the last velocity received.  Applying a Kalman filter, velocity updates occur whenever a position report is received, but the resulting velocity estimates still lag the true velocity more than the MASPS allows.",
    "Figure K-3 illustrates results of sampling the velocity error in 1 second epochs.  In this case the velocity of a benchmark full state vector update with T=3 seconds will lag the true velocity for several seconds after each update.  Since we do not expect ADS-B",

In this context, the squitter velocity accuracy needs reexamination.  It is observed in Figure K-3 that the Extended Squitter state vector report accuracy is better than the benchmark full state vector curve for required (pd=0.46)",

    "versus ADS-B Version Two (2) Messages.  The following subparagraphs discuss those Mode Status Report parameters that must be processed and/or mapped differently for ADS-B Version One (1) Messages.  The remaining Mode Status Report parameters not specifically addressed in the following subparagraphs will be generated as specified in Â§2.2.8.2 (i.e., using the same mapping as for ADS-B Version Two (2) Messages). The formats of the ADS-B Version One (1) Messages are specified in Figure N-8 through",
    "Messages). The formats of the ADS-B Version One (1) Messages are specified in Figure N-8 through Figure N-17.",

Also ground stations equipped with sector antennas are expected to achieve further improvements",

    "## P.2.2.2 Modifications To The Receiver Performance Model",
    "The FAATC and LL developed and implemented simulations to predict 1090 ES receiver performance using enhanced decoding techniques, including multi-sampling.  Several cases of Mode A/C interference were investigated, which led to detailed results for these cases being available for comparison with the predictions of the receiver performance model.  The model was adjusted to account for these cases, resulting in a \"modified receiver performance model.\"",
    "This modified receiver performance model was discovered to produce optimistic predictions in high-density environments, when compared with the overall results of the FAATC and LL predictions in these environments.  It is not surprising that the results, which were based on a very small sample of the interference space, should differ from what is produced when extrapolated to and averaged over the entire high-density interference space.  It was decided that it is more important to reflect the",
    "entire high-density interference space.  It was decided that it is more important to reflect the overall effects of the entire interference environment than to exactly replicate the few individual cases upon which the revised model was based.",
    "The methodology adopted for this second modification of the receiver performance model was to \"map\" the model results to be consistent with the simulation results of the FAATC or LL, as appropriate.  FAATC results were achieved by feeding video signals into a 1090 ES receiver front end and performing non-real-time software processing to determine message reception in a simulated high-density Mode A/C environment.  The results were presented as the total message success probability as a function",
    "A/C environment.  The results were presented as the total message success probability as a function of the received desired signal level for the total Mode A/C interference environment.  Individual cases were not identified, so a message success probability for a given signal level represents the averaging done over many different individual interference situations which characterize the entire interference environment.",
    "For the A2 receiver, LL results were achieved by software simulation of signals and highdensity interference (including phase and frequency fluctuations) and performing pulseby-pulse non-real-time analysis to determine message reception.  Again, as for the A3 results from the FAATC, the A2 results from LL (see Figure P-19) were presented as the total message success probability as a function of the received desired signal level for the total interference environment.",
    "When compared to the results from the FAATC and LL simulations, which sampled the entire interference environment, the receiver performance model was found to be overly optimistic in its predictions of performance.  In order to compensate for this bias, the receiver performance model was \"mapped\" separately to conform to the results of each of the two simulations, as illustrated for an A3 receiver in a 30000 Mode A/C FRUIT",
    "environment shown in Figure P-1 below.  This mapping was done separately to adjust the receiver performance model to the various interference levels and receiver sensitivities.",
    "Each of the various mappings (corresponding to scenario, FRUIT level, and multisampling type) was used for the appropriate receiver case.  For example, to evaluate Class A3 performance in the 24000 Mode A/C LA scenario, the receiver performance model was mapped to match the FAATC results for the 10 MHz sampling rate enhanced decoder for this FRUIT rate. \n\n## P.2.3 Los Angeles Basin High Density (La) P.2.3.1 La Scenario Description",

This summary will be presented in Section P.2.5.2.  Section P.2.5.1 will first point out a number of considerations that should be taken into account when interpreting the results. \n\n## P.2.5.1 Considerations",
    "## P.2.5.1 Considerations\n\nThe following considerations should be noted when interpreting the results of this analysis:",
    "- \nThe transmit power distribution for A3 transmitters, which was used for this analysis, \nwas uniform from 53-56 dBm.  These MOPS allow for A3 transmitters to extend as low as 51 dBm.  This corresponds more closely to the transmit power distribution assumed for A2 class aircraft in this analysis; therefore, for a class A3 aircraft with a transmit power near the lower limit of the allowed range, it would be expected that performance would be given by A2 transmit results, rather than A3. \n-",
    "- \nThe receiver performance model that was used for this analysis was based on nonreal-time simulation results provided by the FAATC and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Several manufacturer representatives have indicated that they felt that performance equivalent to that required by these MOPS was achievable.  Still, there has been no \ntesting of performance on MOPS-compliant equipment, and until this is done the",
    "testing of performance on MOPS-compliant equipment, and until this is done the \nreceiver performance model has not been validated and remains hypothetical.  In addition, the receiver performance model thus derived was designed to match the average performance predicted by the simulation results discussed above.  This was necessary due to time and resources constraints and may add some additional uncertainty to the results. \n-",
    "- \nThe results of this study should not be directly compared with any analysis not described in this Appendix, without taking into account differences in assumptions and analysis techniques.  For example, the 1090 ES analysis in the TLAT report \n[Reference P-1] assumed different transmit power distributions, receiver decode \nperformance, and Mode A/C interference levels, so it is not surprising that the results of that study differ from those reported here. \n-",
    "Finally, in evaluating expected performance through the use of simulations, it is important to be aware of the inherent uncertainties in results due to the indeterminate nature of the assumptions, as well as the uncertainties in the modeling process itself. This is true for performance predictions resulting from any type of simulation technique.  For example, in this analysis it was assumed that the number of aircraft in the LA Basin would increase by 50%, that most aircraft would be Mode S",
    "the number of aircraft in the LA Basin would increase by 50%, that most aircraft would be Mode S equipped, that a number of TCAS improvements would be universally deployed, and that the A3 transmit power would be as described above.

    "## P.3 Performance Evaluation By Mit Lincoln Laboratory",
    "MIT Lincoln Laboratory employed two simulation tools to determine ADS-B reception performance as a function of range for the LA (as defined in Â§P.2.3.1) and low density scenarios.  The first tool is a pulse-level simulation, whose output gives the probability of correct reception of an Extended Squitter signal as a function of received signal power level.  The second tool is a track-level simulation, whose input is the per-squitter reception probability from the pulse-level simulation, and",
    "whose input is the per-squitter reception probability from the pulse-level simulation, and whose output gives the performance over a time period, such as 12 seconds.  When applied to long-range air-toair surveillance, this simulation can be used to determine the maximum range at which 95 percent or more of the targets are being received sufficiently reliably to be in track and being updated regularly as required by the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A).",
    "## P.3.1 Pulse Level Simulation",
    "The pulse-level simulation generates a sample-by-sample received Extended Squitter signal in the presence of interference, consisting of Mode A/C FRUIT and Mode S \nreplies and squitters, in both long and short formats.  When used in this study, the interfering reception rates and power distributions were selected to match the interference environment in Los Angeles in two cases and the low density environment in the other. The interference rates and power distributions are described below.",
    "## P.3.1.1 Formulation Of The Pulse-Level Simulation",
    "This simulation was originally created for developing enhanced reception techniques for Extended Squitter.  The simulation represents signals and interference as 1090 MHz radio frequency waveforms having amplitude and phase, so that destructive and constructive summation is represented.  Each transponder is assigned a specific carrier frequency, which need not be exactly 1090 MHz.  The frequency offsets were random, uniformly distributed over +/-1 MHz in this study.  Minor pulse width",
    "offsets were random, uniformly distributed over +/-1 MHz in this study.  Minor pulse width deviations were also incorporated in this study.  All pulses have rise times and fall times that correspond to the effects of both transmitter and receiver.  The simulation can be run using different values of receiver bandwidth.  Bandwidth was set equal to 8 MHz in this study.  In addition to the received interference, the simulation also includes receiver noise, whose power was - 100.7 dBm referred to",
    "interference, the simulation also includes receiver noise, whose power was - 100.7 dBm referred to the antenna in this study.",
    "The received waveform, which is a sum of the Extended Squitter signal and all overlapping interference plus noise, is then converted to a log video waveform, which is sampled at a steady rate.  These steps are illustrated in Figure P-16.  The simulation can be run at a sampling rate of 8 samples per microsecond or 10 samples per microsecond.",
    "The rate of 8 per microseconds was used in this evaluation.  The log video samples are then processed using the enhanced reception techniques.  These techniques include an improved form of preamble detection, the 4-4 table method of declaring the 112 bits and associated confidence bits, and the error detection/correction technique called \"Brute Force, n=5\".",
    "8 samples per \nmicrosec.",
    "To generate reception probability as a function of received power level, the process is as follows.  The user assigns a total number of aircraft (1000 aircraft for example) and provides a range distribution.  The simulation generates the ranges of these aircraft using a pseudo-random process, following the given range distribution.  Then for each aircraft, the nominal value of received power level is calculated using the following formula:",
    "Nom. Received power (dBm at antenna) = -83.5 - 20 log10(range/100 NM)",
    "The next step is to apply a random power deviation to account for both transmitter power differences from aircraft to aircraft and antenna gain effects.  The user also assigns a transmission rate for each of the three types of signals.  The simulation is run for a fixed time period set by the user, typically 10 seconds.  For each transmitting aircraft, the transmissions are made random in time, uniformly distributed over the run time.  The reception times are modeled as a Poisson process,",
    "uniformly distributed over the run time.  The reception times are modeled as a Poisson process, having a constant average reception rate for each of the three types of signals. These particular assignments of nominal power and power deviations are used only in the pulse-level simulation, and only for the purpose of generating a FRUIT distribution appropriate for the environment being studied.",
    "As each Extended Squitter is received, it is processed to determine whether the 112 bit message is correctly received, including the effects of error detection/correction.  All such receptions, whether correct or not, are saved in bins according to the received power level.  Five-dB bins were used in this study.  After the full run, which includes several thousand reception opportunities in each of the major bins of interest, the number of correct receptions in compared with the total number of",
    "the major bins of interest, the number of correct receptions in compared with the total number of opportunities.  The probability of correct reception is computed as the ratio:",
    "Probability of correct reception = (no. of correct receptions)/(no. of opportunities)",
    "## P.3.1.2 Interference Rates And Power Distribution",
    "In running the pulse-level simulation for the Los Angeles environments, it was necessary to specify the rates and power distributions of the interfering signals.  For Los Angeles, this was done based on results from airborne measurements in the LA Basin in 1999 and on results from the Volpe simulation [Reference P-3].  It was found that the power distribution of Mode A/C FRUIT from the LA Volpe simulation agrees with the airborne measurements above â75 dBm, except being higher in FRUIT rate,",

The Volpe results were then used to provide the FRUIT-rate input to the Lincoln Laboratory pulse-level simulation.  Figure P-17 shows the Mode A/C and Mode S FRUIT rates and power distributions used as inputs for this study.  This applies to a scenario called \"LA-[24k],\" in which the receiving aircraft is located near LAX",
    "This applies to a scenario called \"LA-[24k],\" in which the receiving aircraft is located near LAX airport at 40000 feet altitude.  Mode S interference is characterized by short Mode S transmissions from each aircraft at a rate of 6 per second, and long Mode S transmission at a rate of 5.4 per second.  The total Mode A/C FRUIT rate when referred to a power level of -84 dBm at antenna is 24000 FRUIT per second, for bottom antenna receptions.  For top antenna receptions the corresponding FRUIT",

The first case called \"LA-[24k]\" has 24000 Mode A/C FRUIT per second, as described above.  The second, more severe case, called \"LA-[30K],\" has 30000 Mode A/C FRUIT per second, with the same Mode S interference as in LA-[24k].

In each run, pseudo random variables are used to generate the antenna gain values and the transmitter power for that particular transmitting aircraft. The TLAT model is used for the statistical variation of aircraft antenna gains.  The scenario considered in these runs applies to altitudes that are nearly the same, and for which the antenna",

Altitude differences were studied separately, as described below. After being generated at random, the antenna gain values are held constant for that particular pair of aircraft.  The cases being addressed in this study apply to antenna diversity on both the transmitting and the receiving aircraft.  Therefore each aircraft pair has four antenna gain values.  These",

Transmitter power is generated at random using a given distribution.  For a Class A3 aircraft, is modeled as uniformly distributed over 53 to 56 dBm referred to the antenna.",

Using the transmitter power and the four antenna gains, the four values of received power are calculated (top-to-top, topto-bottom, bottom-to-top, and bottom-to-bottom).  For each case the probability curve \n(from the pulse-level simulation) is then used to determine the reception probability for that particular antenna combination.",
    "Receiver blanking caused by co-site interference is included at this point.  The values of reception probability calculated as above are now multiplied by 0.93 to account for these effects. To account for receiving antenna diversity, the probability of correct reception is calculated using the following formula:",

    "where **P(top)** and **P(bot)** are the reception probabilities for top only and bottom only.  In other words, only the better of the two receiving antennas is used; the other does not contribute to performance. Subsequently, to account for transmitting antenna diversity, the reception probability is calculated separately for top-transmit and bottom-transmit, and then these two values are averaged.  This averaging is based on the fact that each antenna transmits 50 percent of the squitters.",

For an additional study of altitude effects, the formulation was changed so that the transmitting aircraft has a specific altitude (a parameter entered by the user) while the receiving aircraft is at the fixed altitude of 40000",
    "feet.  Therefore the results depend on the transmitter altitude.  The TLAT model of aircraft antenna gain as a function of elevation angle was used in this study [Reference P-\n1].",
    "The results for several values of transmitter altitude are shown in Figure P-25 and Figure P-26.  The results indicate that performance is somewhat degraded when the transmitter is changed from 40000 feet to 5000 feet.  The degradation is more pronounced at shorter range, which seems reasonable because of the steeper elevation angles.  Beyond 50 NM, performance is not changed significantly.",
    "Note:\n Altitudes marked in the figure apply to the transmitting aircraft.  The receiving aircraft is at 40000 feet.",
    "Looking at intermediate results from the simulation, one can see several reasons why altitude would not be expected to have much effect at long range.  For long range, the elevation angle change is small.  For example, for range of 100 NM and transmitter altitude of 5000 feet, the elevation angles are +/-3.3 degrees.  According to the TLAT \nantenna gain model, this causes a drop by only 1.1 dB for one antenna and a boost by 1.0 dB for the other.  The effects are small and nearly identical.",
    "Figure P-26 indicates that the slope of the performance curves is similar to the slope of the TSR requirement.  As a result, the relatively small degradation in TSR performance in this figure causes the MASPS intersection point to drop more dramatically.  Although the MASPS requirement is not strictly met beyond that point, the performance is only a few seconds different from the requirement. In conclusion, the results from the normal runs, in which altitude differences were not used, have been",
    "the results from the normal runs, in which altitude differences were not used, have been shown to be accurate at long ranges, regardless of the actual altitude of the transmitting aircraft.  The results indicate that performance is not very sensitive to transmitter altitude between 20000 feet and 40000 feet, although sensitivity increases for very low transmitters.",
    "## P.3.4 Higher Fruit La Environment\n\nIn performing the evaluation for the higher-FRUIT case, 30000 Mode A/C FRUIT per second, the same process was followed.  The results are included in Figure P-21 and Figure P-22. \n\n## P.3.5 Low Density Environment",
    "## P.3.5 Low Density Environment\n\nThe Low Density Environment defined in the ADS-B MASPS (RTCA DO-242A) was also evaluated.  The aircraft are uniformly distributed in area over a circle of 400 NM radius.  The total number of aircraft is 360, so the density is 0.0007 aircraft per square NM. \n\n## P.3.5.1 Reception Probability Versus Signal Power",
    "In evaluating performance in this environment, the first step was to determine reception probability as a function of range.  The conclusion is that the MTL curve by itself is an appropriate characterization of reception performance as a function of received power in the low density environment.  The MTL curve used in this evaluation was based on bench tests performed at the FAATC.  The curve satisfies both MTL requirements (90% at -84 dBm and 15% at -87 dBm) and is otherwise the worst-case",
    "satisfies both MTL requirements (90% at -84 dBm and 15% at -87 dBm) and is otherwise the worst-case curve.",
    "## P.3.5.2 Low Density Environment Track-Level Simulation",
    "The track-level simulation was then run, using the same procedure as was used for LA- [24k] except for the probability input curve, which embodies the characteristics of the low density environment.  The runs apply to Class A3 transmissions received by Class A3 aircraft.  Both aircraft have antenna diversity.  A receiver dead time factor of 0.93 was also used. The simulation results are given in Table P-5 and shown in Figure P-27 and Figure P-28.",
    "These results exhibit more statistical fluctuations than in the previous cases, which can be attributed to the abruptness of the MTL curve.  As a result, the simulation was run twice at each range.  Both points were tabulated and plotted, to indicate the degree of accuracy in these results as influenced by the number of trials (1000 aircraft pairs contributing to each point).",

The best documented is one that uses planned aircraft approach speeds for enhancing the capacity of converging runway configurations for airports such as Chicago's O'Hare.

This analysis is currently underway, and may yield capacity benefits of the order of 3 to 4 arrivals per hour for any single runway operation under certain wind conditions. To enable these procedures, the expected or planned speed of the aircraft across the threshold (i.e., the landing speed) must be known at least 10 to 15 minutes prior to touchdown.  In practice, a",

    "CPR was developed for ADS-B messages broadcast on the 1090 MHz Extended Squitter \n(1090ES) data link to reduce the number of bits required to convey participant latitude and longitude.  Position resolution for 1090ES messages is approximately 5.1 meters for airborne participants and 1.3 meters for surface participants (see Section T.3).  The circumference of the earth is approximately 40 000 kilometers so 40 000 000 m/5.1 m =",
    "~7 800 000 discrete position values.  7 800 000 position values would require 23 bits in a message.  Longitude is expressed over a range of 360Â° so longitude would require the full 23 bits.  Latitude is expressed over a range of 180Â° so only 3 900 000 discrete position values or 22 bits would be required.  Following similar reasoning, surface position would require 25 bits for longitude and 24 bits for latitude.  CPR conveys position with 17 bits each for latitude and longitude plus 1 \"CPR",

    "CPR saves 10 bits per position message for airborne participants and 14 bits per position message for surface participants.  Position messages are broadcast twice per second under most conditions so CPR saves 20 bits/second for airborne participants and 28 bits/second for surface participants.  The maximum message transmission rate allowed for each 1090ES ADS-B participant is 6.2 messages/second.  Of the 112 bits in each 1090ES",

CPR saves 6% - 9% \nof the available bits for other uses.",
    "## T.3 Cpr Coordinate System",
    "CPR can be thought of as a coordinate system and a set of coordinate transformation algorithms.  The coordinate system is spherical and comparable to the latitude/longitude reference system commonly used for navigation.  The coordinate transformation algorithms convert between latitude/longitude and CPR coordinates.  The coordinate transformation algorithms are commonly called \"CPR encoding\" and \"CPR decoding.\"",
    "In the CPR coordinate system, the globe is divided into zones.  \"Latitude zones\" start at the equator and go to both poles.  \"Longitude zones\" start at the Prime Meridian and proceed eastward around the globe.  Latitude zones are approximately 360 nautical miles",
    "(NM) in height measured in the north-south direction.  Longitude zones are approximately 360 NM in width measured in the east-west direction.  The number of longitude zones is reduced as one moves from the equator to the poles to maintain approximately constant zone width.",
    "There are two sets of slightly different sized zones in both latitude and longitude.  One set of zones is called \"even\" and the other is called \"odd.\"  Figure T-1 and Figure T-2 depict latitude and longitude zones on a global scale where the red lines represent even zone boundaries and the blue lines represent odd.",
    "Each zone is identified with a zone index number.  Imagine a tailor's tape measure marked with even and odd latitude zones as shown in the left side of Figure T-3.  The tape measure has 4NZ = 60 even zones and 4NZ-1 = 59 odd zones numbered beginning with zone index 0.  The zone boundaries will line up at the beginning and end of the tape measure but nowhere else.  The tape measure is wrapped around the globe starting with zone index 0 extending north from the equator.  The tape passes over the",
    "the globe starting with zone index 0 extending north from the equator.  The tape passes over the north and south poles and returns to the equator as shown on the right side of Figure T-3.",
    "Longitude zone indexing is the same as latitude zone indexing except zone index 0 is just east of the Prime Meridian and the zone numbers increase in the eastward direction.  As mentioned above, the number of longitude zones around the globe varies with latitude and this is reflected in the zone index numbers.",
    "Latitude and longitude zones are divided into bins.  Each zone contains 2Nb equal sized bins.  The value of Nb varies with the type of position being encoded.  Bins are numbered starting with 0 at the southern edge of latitude zones and the western edge of longitude zones.  More details on sizing are provided in the following sections.",

The subscript i has a value of 0 to indicate the height of an even zone or a value of \n1 to indicate the height of an odd zone.  *Dlat*i is defined in terms of the constant NZ.  NZ \nis the number of even latitude zones in one quadrant of the globe and has a value of 15.  \nThe latitude zone size, Dlati\n, is determined with Eq 1.",

Even latitude zones are approximately 360 NM high and odd latitude zones are approximately 366 NM high measured in the north-south direction.   \nThe definition of *Dlat*i is depicted in Figure T-4.",
    "Latitude zones are divided into bins.  There are 2Nb bins in each latitude zone.  Each latitude bin is identified by the integer bin number YZi.  YZi is the bin number relative to the southern edge of the latitude zone (in both the northern and southern hemispheres).

    "Longitude zones and bins are similar to latitude zones and bins.  For a given position type",
    "(i.e., airborne, surface, coarse TIS-B), the number of bins per longitude zone is equal to the number of bins per latitude zone.  The main difference between latitude and longitude zones is that the number of longitude zones circling the globe is a function of latitude. The CPR coordinate system keeps the encoding resolution (i.e., bin width in meters) as close to a constant as possible everywhere on the globe.  Since the number of bins per zone is fixed, the zone width (in NM) must also remain",
    "on the globe.  Since the number of bins per zone is fixed, the zone width (in NM) must also remain close to constant.  The distance around the globe along lines of constant latitude is smaller near the poles than near the equator.  The CPR algorithm keeps the longitude bin and zone width approximately constant by reducing the number of zones as latitude increases.",
    "Note that the linear (not angular) widths of the longitude zones in Figure T-7 are all approximately equal and that the number of zones around the globe decreases as the magnitude of latitude increases.  The number of even longitude zones at a given latitude is called NL.  The latitudes at which the number of longitude zones changes are called",
    "\"NL Transition Latitudes.\"  These are represented by black lines of constant latitude in Figure T-2 and Figure T-7.  NL Transition Latitudes generally do not coincide with latitude zone boundaries.",
    "For all CPR computations, NL is calculated using the \"recovered latitude\" Rlati.  *Rlat*i is obtained by converting a bin number to a bin centerline latitude.  The rationale for this is discussed in Section T.4.

The product is not necessarily an integer so it is rounded to the nearest integer by adding Â½ and taking the floor of the sum.  \nThe third step in the encoding process is to recover the bin centerline latitude of YZ\ni.  \nBecause Eq 5 performs rounding, the bin centerline latitude of YZi will not equal the input latitude in most cases.",

    "## T.5.1.1 Airborne And Tis-B Latitude Global Decoding\n\nA receiver needs to determine the zone index of the target because the zone index is not transmitted in position messages.

    "## V.3.1 Design For Aircraft-Derived Meteorological Data Dissemination Via Mode S 1090 Mhz Extended Squitter (1090Es) V.3.1.1 Introduction",
    "This section will define a proposed mechanism for the dissemination (both air-to-ground and air-to-air) of aircraft-derived meteorological data by means of the Mode S 1090ES broadcast data link.  The proposed mechanism defined in this paper is intended to work in conjunction with the current definition of the Mode S transponder meteorological data Registers (4416 and 4516\n) in the transponder.  The current definition of the Mode S",
    "transponder meteorological Registers is intended to support the extraction of aircraftderived meteorological data by means of addressed interrogations from Mode S surveillance sensors.  However, these two Mode S transponder meteorological Register definitions are not suitable for applications where ground Mode S surveillance sensors are not available (e.g., over the ocean) and they do not provide for air-to-air cross-link of meteorological data (in particular, cross-link of potentially",
    "provide for air-to-air cross-link of meteorological data (in particular, cross-link of potentially hazardous, short-lived phenomena such as turbulence or icing).  In the future ATC environment supported more and more by \"automatic dependent surveillance via broadcast\" (ADS-B), the proposed Mode S squitter data link mechanism will provide a compatible means to disseminate aircraft-derived meteorological data along with the ADS-B surveillance information employing Mode S.  This proposal defines",
    "data along with the ADS-B surveillance information employing Mode S.  This proposal defines two new Mode S meteorological Registers in a format suitable for the Mode S squitter protocol.",
    "It will be demonstrated that the proposed mechanism for meteorological data squitter fits neatly into the existing design for Mode S.  There will be minimal impact on the use of the 1090 MHz spectrum and the proposed design entails minimal extra software processing in the avionics.  Expansion space has been reserved for further meteorological data applications as yet undefined.",
    "Note: There is an existing Mode S protocol intended to be employed by Aircraft Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) units that allows for addressed cross-link between ACAS-equipped aircraft.  This protocol could be employed to directly extract the currently defined aircraft-derived meteorological data Registers (4416",
    "and 4516) from another aircraft.  However, the use of this protocol requires the system to obtain the Mode S addresses of the aircraft from which data is desired, as well as requiring separate interrogations of each target aircraft to obtain the Register contents.  Adding this functionality to existing ACAS units is technically possible, but would probably be too costly to support the meteorological data cross-link application envisaged.  It appears that the use of the Mode S 1090ES",
    "broadcast link might be simpler to implement.",
    "## V.3.1.2 Proposed Meteorological Squitter Register Formats",

The meteorological squitter Register formats defined here differ from those used for \"ground-initiated Comm-B\" (GICB) extraction via an addressed interrogation in that the first 5 bits of the Mode S squitter Register contents must contain a \"format type code\" value which identifies the particular squitter message at the receiver.  This proposal for the application of Mode S squitter to the dissemination of aircraft-derived meteorological data assumes that one of the currently",

The resolution of the static air temperature field from Mode S Register 44\n16\n is \nreduced from 1/8 degree C to 1/2 degree C.

    "As mentioned above, broadcasting ARV data at a low rate, there may be long gaps in ARV reception, whereas applications such as In-Trail following may need to refresh ARV data for airspeed display at a faster nominal rate, say on the order of 5 seconds, for consistency with refresh and display of other state vector data.  Although the wind vector may only need updating at longer intervals, air-reference vector should be updated more frequently due to the presence of aircraft turn maneuvers and",
    "vector should be updated more frequently due to the presence of aircraft turn maneuvers and other acceleration dynamics.  Fortunately, there is a lot of redundancy between the ground vector and the air-reference vector that potentially allows the use of ground vector and the wind triangle as a means of filling in the gaps in ARV reception, i.e., using the high refresh rate ground vector and the slowly changing wind vector to solve for air-reference vector, and reversing the flow in Figure V-3",

    "The primary purpose of this Addendum is to provide equations that relate CAS to Mach and TAS that are appropriate to use for ADS-B receive side derivation of air-reference velocities, consistent with the generating equations used in a standard ADC for subsonic aircraft.  The reason that this appears to be necessary is that most, but not all of the standard atmosphere equations such as those in Ref (8) are valid when using measured static temperature data or non-standard temperature",
    "those in Ref (8) are valid when using measured static temperature data or non-standard temperature approximations such as use of delta_ISA to compute intermediate variables such as pressure ratio (delta) and temperature ratio (theta) for converting CAS to Mach to TAS, and vice-versa.  The appropriate equations for non-standard atmosphere calculations are easily derived from standardized equations used in current ADC equipment.  This assures that equations consistent with the generating aircraft",

    "secondary purpose of this Addendum is to specify computational units that are consistent with the signals transmitted via ADS-B, e.g., knots for CAS, TAS and wind speed, degrees Kelvin for static temperature, mbar for static pressure, and feet for pressure altitude.  The physical constants cited here were checked against those specified in Ref \n(8) and found to be consistent, to the five significant digits cited here.",
    "(8) and found to be consistent, to the five significant digits cited here.   \nIn a conventional Air Data System, there are three fundamental sensor inputs:",
    "* Static Pressure (Ps) - the pressure of the still air surrounding the airplane, \n* Total (pitot) Pressure (Pt) - the pressure of the moving airstream surrounding the \nairplane, and \n* Total Air Temperature (Tt) - the temperature of the airstream surrounding the \nairplane, including airflow frictional heating and compression.",
    "These inputs are transformed by the ADC into CAS and computed Mach (Mc) airspeed outputs, and subsequently into static temperature (Ts) and true airspeed (TAS) outputs for use by various avionics functions.  Also, pressure altitude (hp) is computed, based on the measured static pressure, Ps.  The standardized equations for computing CAS, Mach, TAS and hp can be recast to convert from hp to Ps, and from CAS to TAS or vice-versa by an ADS-B user.  Although the results of this process are well",
