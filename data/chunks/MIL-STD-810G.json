Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. \n\n\n## Foreword\n\n1.  This standard is approved for use by all Departments and Agencies of the Department of Defense (DoD).",
    "Although prepared specifically for DoD applications, this standard may be tailored for commercial applications as well.  While MIL-STD-810F incorporated a significant revision of MIL-STD-810E, MIL-STD-810G not only consolidates the basic -810F with its three change notices to result in one comprehensive document, but also includes a number of corrections, significant changes, and additions to the comprehensive -810F, to include five new test methods, one of which (Method 526) was extracted from",
    "comprehensive -810F, to include five new test methods, one of which (Method 526) was extracted from Method 516.  The primary emphases are still the same - (with the exception of Method 528) tailoring a materiel item's environmental design and test limits to the conditions that the specific materiel will experience throughout its service life, and establishing laboratory test methods that replicate the effects of environments on materiel, rather than trying to reproduce the environments",
    "replicate the effects of environments on materiel, rather than trying to reproduce the environments themselves.  However, the \"G\" revision continues the up-front explanation of how to implement the environmental tailoring process throughout the materiel acquisition cycle.",
    "As in MIL-STD-810F, this revision recognizes that the environmental design and test tailoring process has expanded to involve a wide range of managerial and technical interests.  Accordingly, this revision orients environmental design and test direction toward three basic types of users who have distinctly different, although closely associated, interests:  program managers who, among other responsibilities, ensure proposed concepts and systems are valid and functional in intended operational",
    "ensure proposed concepts and systems are valid and functional in intended operational environments; environmental engineering specialists (EES), who enter the acquisition process early to assist combat and materiel developer tailoring efforts by preparing life cycle environmental profiles and drafting tailored design criteria and test programs; and the design, test, and evaluation community, whose analysts, engineers, and facility operators use tailored designs and tests to meet user needs.",
    "2.  **Part One** describes management, engineering, and technical roles in the environmental design and test tailoring process.  It focuses on the process of tailoring materiel design and test criteria to the specific environmental conditions a materiel item is likely to encounter during its service life.  New appendices support the succinctly presented text of Part One.  Annex A contains complete descriptions of environmental engineering tasks.  These tasks, along with management information",
    "descriptions of environmental engineering tasks.  These tasks, along with management information in Annex B and EES guidance in Annex C, will help to ensure the environmental design and test tailoring process is implemented and documented according to the disciplined, but flexible approach to materiel acquisition called for in Department of Defense (DoD) 5000-series documents (DoDD 5000.1).  Terms used in this standard relating to the materiel acquisition process are limited to terms used in",
    "used in this standard relating to the materiel acquisition process are limited to terms used in the DoD 5000-series documents; to avoid confusion and promote simplicity, service-specific terms/processes are not used.",
    "3.  **Part Two** contains environmental laboratory test methods to be applied according to the general and specific test tailoring guidelines described in Part One.  It is important to emphasize that, with the exception of Method 528, these methods are not to be called out in blanket fashion, nor applied as unalterable routines, but are to be selected and tailored to generate the most relevant test data possible.",
    "To support the tailoring process described in Part One, each test method in Part Two contains some environmental data and references, and identifies tailoring opportunities for the particular method.  Some methods afford a wide latitude for tailoring; some can be tailored up to established limits, and some have relatively few tailoring options. Whenever possible, each method contains background rationale to help determine the appropriate level of tailoring. Each test method supports the test",
    "rationale to help determine the appropriate level of tailoring. Each test method supports the test engineer and test facility operator by describing preferred laboratory test facilities and methodologies.  Any specific tailoring information and values contained in these test methods should be supplanted by more up-to-date field/fleet or program-specific information when available.",
    "When applied properly, the environmental management and engineering processes described in this standard can be of enormous value in generating confidence in the environmental worthiness and overall durability of materiel system design.  However, it is important to recognize that there are limitations inherent in laboratory testing that make it imperative to use proper caution and engineering judgment when extrapolating these laboratory results to results that may be obtained under actual",
    "judgment when extrapolating these laboratory results to results that may be obtained under actual service conditions.  In many cases, real-world environmental stresses (singularly or in combination) cannot be duplicated practically or reliably in test laboratories.  Therefore, users should not assume that a system or component that passes laboratory tests of this standard also would pass field/fleet verification trials.  DoD 5000-series documents call for component technology to be demonstrated",
    "verification trials.  DoD 5000-series documents call for component technology to be demonstrated in relevant environments to reduce risk on components and subsystems that have been demonstrated only in laboratory environments (DoDI 5000.2).",
    "4.  **Part Three** contains a compendium of climatic data and guidance assembled from several sources to include AR \n70-38, \"Research, Development, Test and Evaluation of Materiel for Extreme Climatic Conditions,\" (1979), Draft AR 70-38 (1990) that was assembled using 1987 Air Land Battlefield Environment (ALBE) report information,",
    "\"Environmental Factors and Standards for Atmospheric Obscurants, Climate, and Terrain,\" and MIL-HDBK-310, Global Climatic Data for Developing Military Products.",
    "Part Three provides planning guidance for realistic consideration (starting points) of climatic conditions in the research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) of materiel and materials used throughout their life cycles in various climatic regions throughout the world.  It is intended that this and related documents will help achieve the objective of developing materiel that will perform adequately under the environmental conditions likely to be found throughout its life cycle in the areas",
    "under the environmental conditions likely to be found throughout its life cycle in the areas of intended use. 5.  The US Department of Defense would like to thank the following individuals for their contributions toward the development and publication of MIL-STD-810G:",

In order for this to happen, the effects that environmental conditions have on materiel effectiveness and safety must be determined, considered, analyzed, and integrated into all aspects of the acquisition process as indicated in Part One, Figures 4-1 and 4-2.  The guidance provided here and throughout this entire standard applies to the effects of environments on systems rather than the effects",
    "of systems on environmental quality.  Therefore, the thrust of this standard should not be confused with \nEnvironmental Impact programs that focus on how to preserve and protect flora and fauna from service personnel, their materiel, and their activities.  Conversely, this standard pertains to the effects that environments \nhave on materiel system effectiveness. \nB.  Environments of intended use.",

    "technical areas (e.g., reliability, electromagnetic environmental effects, human factors, and environmental quality), no single section of that series is devoted to addressing natural or induced environmental factors.",

One of the basic policies governing defense \nacquisition covers the need to translate operational needs into stable, affordable programs.  The key to this is using a concurrent systems engineering approach to help ensure reliable performance in all operational environments, when required.  This entails designing a product to perform its assigned mission over time in",

Except for reasons of safety, chamber tests cannot be substituted for field/fleet development tests because unknown synergistic/antagonistic effects",
    "from combined/induced environments cannot be built into chamber/laboratory test methods.  An example where chamber testing may be substituted for field/fleet testing is ammunition conditioning prior to test firing.  \nFollowing are some guidelines for laboratory testing, natural field/fleet development testing, and operational testing.",

This will allow system assessment of synergistic/antagonistic effects of natural environmental factors combined with human factors and induced factors such as shock/vibration, smoke/obscurants and electromagnetic interference.  Use established natural climatic test centers and standard test procedures to obtain data that may be compared to previous/following test data and to develop data bases that may be used for simulations.",
    "3. Operational testing.  Conduct operational testing in natural environments that are as realistic as possible.  \nWhen operational testing cannot subject materiel to the desired ranges of environmental stresses and \ndeterioration that may be encountered during actual operation, storage and transit, development test environmental effects data may be substituted for operational test environmental effects data.",

    "actual systems or hardware prototypes in laboratories or in field/fleet environments.  An EES can help to establish an engineering basis for selecting and implementing such alternatives.  When alternatives to testing actual hardware or prototypes are chosen, Task 401, Environmental Engineering Master Plan, must contain the rationale for their selection including an explanation of the cost savings, other benefits and risks to system effectiveness/safety.

Modeling and simulation (M&S) is useful in representing conceptual systems \nthat do not exist, nascent technologies, and extant systems that cannot be subjected to actual environments because of safety requirements or the limitations of resources and facilities (DoDI 5000.2).  Modeling and \nsimulation techniques should be used only to the extent that their predictive validities have been verified.",
    "They are not intended to be substitutes for tests in natural field/fleet environments.  Simulation can reduce high costs involved in producing and testing hardware prototypes.  Although artificial intelligence and software simulations may be integral parts of models, neither these types of data nor data from laboratory tests should be used to validate models.  The most sound criteria for developing and validating models and simulations come from real world, field/fleet data or knowledge bases.",
    "and validating models and simulations come from real world, field/fleet data or knowledge bases.  To that end, all fields of science and engineering can help to save costs through simulation by developing or contributing to data bases or",
    "knowledge bases that cover the entire domain of environmental effects.  (See Annex C, paragraph B.) \n2. Testing coupon samples.  In some instances, particularly in laboratory tests and natural field/fleet \nexposure/surveillance tests, there may be significant savings by using coupon samples instead of entire \nsystems when specific materials are the central acquisition issue. \n3. Acceptance by similarity.  In cases where materiel considered for testing is nearly identical to materiel",
    "already tested, and there is no reason to believe that the differences between them would pose an environmentally induced problem, the program manager may consider accepting the materiel by virtue of its similarity to the similar materiel already accepted. \nG.  Type classification process.  Environmental considerations influence the type classification process.  For",
    "materiel that is designated by the combat developer to be critical to combat success, type classification or fielding may be barred if environmental testing reveals that environmental effects were not considered \nadequately and incorporated in the design of the system.  Additionally, successful system performance and reliability in natural environments are listed as critical issues in Milestone III (production) decisions.",

    "A.  General.  Environmental tailoring is the process of choosing or altering materiel designs and tests so that a given materiel will be manufactured and tested to operate reliably when influenced by the various environmental factors and levels it is expected to experience throughout its service life.  The tailoring process, broadly speaking, also includes preparing or reviewing engineering task and planning documents to help ensure realistic environments are given proper consideration",
    "task and planning documents to help ensure realistic environments are given proper consideration throughout the acquisition cycle.",
    "1. Objective of tailoring.  Tailoring helps to ensure materiel will be neither under- nor over-designed, \nnor under- nor over-tested with respect to specific environments it is expected to see during its \nservice life.  The tailoring process outlined in Part One, Figure 1-3 shows that it is important not to \ntake design and test criteria directly from natural environment data (descriptions of natural",
    "take design and test criteria directly from natural environment data (descriptions of natural \nenvironmental factors or forcing functions found in NATO STANAG 4370, AECTP 200, Category 230, Section 2311; MIL-HDBK-310, and AR 70-38, but rather from the transformations that such \nforcing functions create as they interact with a platform environment (static or dynamic materiel platforms, including induced environmental changes that result from operating the materiel itself).",
    "2. Tailoring process.  Fundamental to the tailoring process is the ability to apply common",
    "scientific/engineering sense to environmental life cycle \"homework,\" focusing on realistic materiel design and test criteria.  To execute a quality tailoring process, it is necessary to give proper consideration to environments that occur throughout the materiel's life cycle.  Completing Tasks 401 through 406 in Annex A will help program managers and environmental engineering specialists to apply proper environmental considerations throughout the materiel acquisition cycle.  Part One,",
    "Figure 1-1 explains the tailoring process in terms of the environmental engineering tasks (Annex A) required by this standard, thereby serving as a guide for program managers, design engineers, environmental engineering specialists, test engineers, and facility operators.  Use Task 401, Environmental Engineering Management Plan (EEMP), and Task 402, Life Cycle Environmental Profile (LCEP) as the main guides for tailoring.  Careful completion of each of these tasks will help",
    "ensure correct environments are identified for tests, that engineering development as well as qualification tests are phased properly into the materiel's acquisition program, and that environmental test conditions are appropriate and traceable to realistically encountered life cycle conditions.",

    "1. Acquisition personnel.  Acquisition personnel, with the assistance of an EES, should derive \nenvironmental development and operational test plans according to the environmental tailoring process",
    "shown in Part One, Figures 1-1 and 4-1.  All types of environments need to be addressed.

    "antagonistically to influence materiel effectiveness. Therefore, the domain of environmental testing goes beyond the laboratory test methods appearing in Part Two of this standard.

A stationary process may be also ergodic, whereas an ergodic process is always stationary. \no. **Filter.**  Fourier spectrum transformation of a given input time history, x(t), in order to produce a desired \neffect.  Such filtering may be through band limiting the time history spectra through lowpass, highpass, \nbandpass, or bandstop forms of filtering.  Filtering may be performed equivalently in either the time",
    "domain or the frequency domain.  If the filtering transformation preserves the phase relationships \nbetween the input and output frequency components, the filter is referred to as a linear phase filter.

This is particularly the case when more severe shocks are desired, such as for evaluation of safety or initial design, and when extreme values",

    "## Method 504.1 Contamination By Fluids\n\nNOTE:  Tailoring is essential.  Select methods, procedures, and parameter levels based on the tailoring process described in Part One, Paragraph 4.2.2, and Annex C.  Apply the general guidelines for laboratory test methods described in Part One, paragraph 5 of this standard. \n\n \n\n## 1. Scope.",
    "1.1  Purpose.   \nUse contamination by fluids tests to determine if materiel (or material samples) is affected by temporary exposure to contaminating fluids (liquids) such as may be encountered and applied during its life cycle, either occasionally1/, intermittently2/, or over extended periods3/.   \n1.2  Application.",
    "1.2  Application.   \nSelect one of the two procedures described in this method when there is a high probability of fluid contamination during the life cycle of the materiel.  Contamination may arise from exposure to fuels, hydraulic fluids, lubricating oils, solvents, and cleaning fluids, de-icing and anti-freeze fluids, runway deicers, insecticides, disinfectants, coolant dielectric fluid, and fire extinguishants.",
    "WARNING:  THIS METHOD REQUIRES THE USE OF SUBSTANCES AND/OR TEST PROCEDURES THAT MAY HAVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OR BE INJURIOUS TO HEALTH, IF ADEQUATE PRECAUTIONS ARE NOT TAKEN.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN ANNEX A.  REFER TO THE SUPPLIER'S MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET (MSDS) OR EQUIVALENT FOR CHEMICAL COMPATABILITY AND HEALTH HAZARD DATA ON THE VARIOUS CHEMICALS USED, AND COORDINATE WITH LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORITIES.  ENSURE ALL POST-TEST MATERIALS ARE DISPOSED OF IN ACCORDANCE",
    "WITH LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORITIES.  ENSURE ALL POST-TEST MATERIALS ARE DISPOSED OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS.",
    "1.3  Limitations.   \nThis test is not intended to demonstrate the suitability of materiel to perform during continuous contact with a fluid; e.g., an immersed fuel pump, nor should it be used to demonstrate resistance to electrolytic corrosion.   \n\n## 2.  Tailoring Guidance.",
    "2.1  Selecting the Contamination by Fluids Method.   \nAfter examining requirements documents and applying the tailoring process in Part One of this standard to determine where exposure to contaminating fluids is foreseen in the life cycle of the test item, use the following to confirm the need for this method and to place it in sequence with other methods.   \n2.1.1  Effects of the contaminating fluids environment.",
    "2.1.1  Effects of the contaminating fluids environment.   \nDuring its life cycle, materiel may be accidentally or intentionally exposed to one or more fluids that could have an adverse effect on the materiel.  As a result, exposure of materiel to contaminating fluids may either temporarily or permanently impair the operation of the materiel by changing the physical properties of the material(s) composing it.",
    "Consider the following typical examples of problems to help determine if this method is appropriate for the materiel being tested.  The list is not intended to be all-inclusive and some of the examples may overlap.",
    "a. Physical.  \n(1) Shattering of glass vials and optical materiel. (2) Binding or slackening of moving parts. (3) Cracking of solid pellets or grains in explosives. (4) Differential contraction or expansion rates or induced strain rates of dissimilar materials.  \n(5) Deformation or fracture of components. (Solder reflow is the worst case.) (6) Cracking of surface coatings. (7) Seal or gasket failures (leaking of sealed compartments). \n(8) Failure of insulation protection.",
    "(8) Failure of insulation protection.  \n(9) Condensation of water onto cold surfaces suddenly exposed to higher ambient temperatures at \"high \nrelative humidity\" - can cause frosting on optical surfaces - can cause corrosion on vulnerable surfaces.  \n(10)  Differential contraction or expansion rates or induced strain rates between surface and interior \nportions of thermally massive constructs.",
    "portions of thermally massive constructs. \n(11) Packaging failure. (12) Crazing or swelling of plastics and rubbers. (13) Adhesion failures (delamination). (14) Paint/legend removal. \nb. Chemical.   \n(1) Separation of constituents. (2) Failure of chemical agent protection. (3) Leeching of antioxidants and other soluble materials. \n(4) Corrosion. (5) Melting or decomposition. \nc. Electrical. \n(1) Changes in electrical and electronic components.",
    "c. Electrical. \n(1) Changes in electrical and electronic components.  \n(2) Electronic or mechanical failures due to rapid water or frost formation. \n(3) Excessive static electricity. (4) Interruption of electrical continuity (such as \"grounding\" fingers on EMI strips). (5) Increase in electrical resistance due to thermo-mechanical \"fretting corrosion.\"",
    "## 2.1.2  Sequence Among Other Methods.\n\na. \nGeneral.  See Part One, paragraph 5.5. \nb. Unique to this method.  Do not perform these tests prior to other climatic environmental tests because of \npotential effect of the contaminants or their removal by decontaminants.  \n\n## 2.2  Difference Between Procedures. This Method Has Two Procedures.",
    "a. \nProcedure I - Large Systems.  This procedure covers materiel such as aircraft systems, full-up wheeled and \ntrack vehicles, and water craft, to name a few, where operational temperatures may be critical.  Possible \nvariations are given below in paragraph 4.5.5(Step 3a-c).  The most significant parameters used in this test procedure are the fluid(s) to be used, the temperature, and the duration of exposure.  It is also important to",
    "specify the operational configuration of the test item, as well as whether or not the test item is heat \ndissipating during operation.   \nb. Procedure II - Small Systems. This procedure addresses the chemical compatibility of nonmetallic \nmaterials used in small arms systems, clothing, boots, gas masks, gloves, Less Than Lethal and other",
    "ammunition, binoculars, flashlights, small arms tripods, and other materiel.  Testing is performed at standard ambient conditions (see Part One, paragraph 5.1), but this procedure is more tailorable in that the immersion times and item/solution temperatures can be changed to suit the test program.   \n \n2.2.1  Length of exposure.",
    "2.2.1  Length of exposure.   \nThere are three options provided in Procedure I:  occasional, intermittent, and extended contamination (paragraph 1.1).  From the requirements document, determine the option to be used based on the anticipated life cycle scenario, along with the order of application of the test fluids if more than one is required.  There is a general time exposure of \n8 hours for Procedure II, but the test can be tailored to each test item.   \n2.2.2  Contaminant fluid groups.",
    "2.2.2  Contaminant fluid groups.   \nThe groups of fluids are listed in Table 504.1-I for Procedure I, and Table 504.1-II for Procedure II and described in Annex B.  These lists are not all inclusive and allow the addition of other fluids as called out in the test requirements.",

Procedure I is designed to determine the heat produced by solar radiation, and effects of that heat by exposing materiel to continuous 24-hour cycles of simulated solar radiation (or thermal loading) at realistic maximum levels typical throughout the world.

Although Procedure I can be performed using simple heatgenerating lamps (providing the guidance in paragraph 4.1.2 is followed), limited evaluation of actinic effects is possible if full spectrum lamps are used instead.  It is preferable to use the solar radiation test (as",
    "opposed to the High Temperature test, Method 501.5) when the materiel could be affected by differential \nheating (see paragraph 2.1.1.1) or when the levels or mechanisms of heating caused by solar radiation are unknown (this encompasses almost all materiel).   \nb. Procedure II - Steady State (actinic effects).  Use Procedure II to investigate the effects on materiel of long \nperiods of exposure to sunshine.  Actinic effects usually do not occur until materiel surfaces receive large",
    "amounts of sunlight (as well as heat and moisture).  Therefore, it is inefficient to use the repeated, long cycles of normal levels of solar radiation (as in Procedure I) to generate actinic effects.  Using Procedure I \nfor this purpose could take months.  The approach, therefore, is to use an accelerated test that is designed to reduce the time to reproduce cumulative effects of long periods of exposure.  The 4-hour \"lights-off\" period",

In the absence of other guidance, the \nmaximum test duration of seven cycles was chosen because the peak high temperature for the selected \nclimatic region occurs approximately one hour in each of seven cycles in the most extreme month.  If more",

This may include adjustment of solar energy, if appropriate, to account for latitude, altitude, month of anticipated exposure, or other factors (for example, a product exclusively used in northern areas, or exclusively used in winter months).  Any deviation from the standard conditions must be detailed and justified in the test report.",
    "b. Procedure II.  Procedure II produces an acceleration factor of approximately 2.5 as far as the total energy \nreceived by the test item is concerned, i.e., one 24-hour cycle as shown on Figure 505.5-2 provides \napproximately 2.5 times the solar energy experienced in one 24-hour (natural) diurnal cycle plus a 4-hour lights-off period to allow for alternating thermal stressing and for the so-called \"dark\" processes to occur.",

Recommend a duration of ten 24-hour cycles (as on Figure 505.5-2) for materiel that is occasionally used outdoors, such as portable test items, etc.  For materiel continuously exposed to outdoor",
    "conditions, recommend a test duration of 56 24-hour cycles or longer.  Do not increase the irradiance above the identified level because of the danger of overheating; there is presently no indication that attempting to \naccelerate the test in this way gives results that correlate with materiel response under natural solar radiation conditions. \n2.3.3   Humidity.",

    "## Method 505.5 Annex A Detailed Guidance On Solar Radiation Testing\n\n1.  INTRODUCTION.",
    "This Annex describes methods of simulation designed to examine the effects of solar radiation on materiel. The main quantities to be simulated are the spectral energy distribution of the sun as observed at the Earth's surface and the intensity of received energy, in combination with controlled temperature conditions.  However, it may be necessary to consider a combination of solar radiation - including sky radiation - with other environments, e.g., humidity, air velocity, etc.",
    "## 2.  Irradiance And Spectral Distribution. The Effect Of Radiation On The Materiel Will Depend Mainly On The Level Of Irradiance And Its Spectral Distribution.\n\n2.1   Irradiance.",
    "The irradiance by the sun on a plane perpendicular to the incident radiation outside the Earth's atmosphere at the mean Earth-sun distance is known as the solar constant \"I0.\"  The irradiance at the surface of the Earth is influenced by the solar constant and the attenuation and scattering of radiation in the atmosphere.  For test purposes, a maximum intensity of 1120 W/m2 is specified to simulate the global (total) radiation at the surface of the Earth from the sun and the sky with the sun at",
    "the global (total) radiation at the surface of the Earth from the sun and the sky with the sun at zenith, based on a solar constant I0 = 1350 W/m2.  The true solar constant is thought to be about",
    "1365-1370 W/m2.   \n2.2   Spectral Distribution - Sea Level versus High Altitude.",
    "At high altitude, solar radiation contains a greater proportion of damaging UV radiation than at sea level.  The internationally-agreed spectrum (see Table 505.5-I) recommended for general testing is a representation of the real environment at sea level.  This spectrum is recommended for use at both sea level and at high altitude.  \n3.  OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED.",
    "Attention is drawn to the possible cooling effects of air flow over materiel.  This can also result in misleading errors in open-type thermopiles used to monitor radiation intensity; ventilation of pyranometers may be necessary to keep the glass dome cool.  In practice, high solar radiation conditions are rarely accompanied by complete absence of wind.  It may be necessary, therefore, to assess the effect of different air velocities over materiel under test.  The materiel specification should",
    "the effect of different air velocities over materiel under test.  The materiel specification should state any special requirements in this respect.  It is essential, therefore, to measure and control the rate of air flow in order to maintain the required air temperature at the test item.",
    "## 4.  Radiation Sources.\n\n4.1  General.",
    "The radiation source may comprise one or more lamps and their associated optical components, e.g., reflectors, filters, etc., to provide the required spectral distribution and irradiance.  The high pressure xenon arc lamp with filters can provide the best spectral match.  Mercury vapor and xenon-mercury lamps have considerable deficiencies in matching that would lead to error.  If not already covered in test method characteristics of these sources, features of filters, optical arrangements,",
    "covered in test method characteristics of these sources, features of filters, optical arrangements, etc., are covered in the following paragraphs.  The following general information about several light sources may be helpful",
    "a. \nXenon lamps.  The configuration and size of the lamp(s) used will depend on the test required.  The relative \nspectral distribution of the xenon arc radiation has been found to be substantially independent of lamp power. However, variation of lamp power will change the temperature of the electrodes and hence the spectral distribution of their radiation.  With long arc lamps, it is relatively simple to mask off the electrode radiation.",
    "The form of construction of the short arc lamp leads to considerably wider manufacturing variation compared \nwith the long arc, a point particularly important when replacement becomes necessary.  Routine replacement of \neither type of lamp will be needed, since the emission will change continuously with life, and there may be wide variations of the life characteristic from lamp to lamp. \nb. Metal Halide (HMI).  Metal Halide lamps which are properly filterd and utilizing proper electrical power",
    "supply to the lamp can meet the defined spectral requirements. Care must be taken regarding lamp age and lamp power adjustment as spectral shifting can occur leading to changes in spectrum (critical for procedure II testing).  \n4.2  Filters.",
    "Liquid filters have certain disadvantages such as the possibility of boiling, the temperature coefficient of spectral transmission, and long term drift in spectral characteristics.  The present preference is for glass filters to be used, although the characteristics of glass filters are not as accurately reproduced as those of a chemical solution filter.  Some trial and error may be necessary to compensate for different optical densities by using different plate thicknesses.  Glass filters are",
    "compensate for different optical densities by using different plate thicknesses.  Glass filters are proprietary articles and manufacturers should be consulted concerning the choice of filters suitable for particular purposes.  The choice will depend on the source and its methods of use.  For example, a xenon source may be test-compensated by a combination of infrared and ultraviolet absorbing filters.  Some glass infrared filters may be prone to rapid changes in spectral characteristics when",
    "Some glass infrared filters may be prone to rapid changes in spectral characteristics when exposed to excessive ultraviolet radiation.  This deterioration may be largely prevented by interposing the ultraviolet filter between the source and the infrared filter.  Interference type filters, that function by reflecting instead of absorbing the unwanted radiation, (thus resulting in reduced heating of the glass), are generally more stable than absorption filters.",
    "4.3  Uniformity of Irradiance.",
    "Owing to the distance of the sun from the Earth, solar radiation appears at the Earth's surface as an essentially parallel beam.  Artificial sources are relatively close to the working surface and means of directing and focusing the beam must be provided with the aim of achieving a uniform irradiance at the measurement plane within specification limits (i.e.,",
    "1120 W/m2 (see Table 505.4-I)).  This is difficult to achieve with a short-arc xenon lamp with a parabolic reflector because of shadows from the lamp electrodes and supports.  Also, the incandescence of the anode can produce considerable radiation at a much lower color temperature, slightly displaced from the main beam, if only the arc itself is at the focus of the reflector.  Uniform irradiation is more readily achieved with a long arc lamp mounted in a parabolic 'trough' type reflector.",
    "is more readily achieved with a long arc lamp mounted in a parabolic 'trough' type reflector.  However, by employing very elaborate mounting techniques, it is possible to irradiate, with some degree of uniformity, a large surface by a number of short arc xenon lamps.  It is generally advisable to locate radiation source(s) outside the test enclosure or chamber.  This avoids possible degradation of the optical components, e.g., by high humidity conditions, and contamination of test items by",
    "of the optical components, e.g., by high humidity conditions, and contamination of test items by ozone that has been generated by xenon and other types of arc lamps.  Precise collimation of the radiation beam is not normally required except for testing special materiel such as solar cells, solar tracking devices, etc.  However, some of the simulation techniques developed for space research purposes could be adapted for Earth-surface solar radiation studies.",
    "## 5.  Measurements.\n\n5.1  Measurement of Spectral Distribution.",
    "Total intensity checks are readily made, but detailed checks on spectral characteristics are more difficult.  Major spectral changes can be checked by inexpensive routine measurements, using a pyranometer in conjunction with selective filters. For checking the detail spectral distribution characteristics of the facility, it would be necessary to employ sophisticated spectroradiometric instrumentation.  However, there seems to be no practical instrumentation obstacle to prevent this calibration",
    "However, there seems to be no practical instrumentation obstacle to prevent this calibration being done either as a service by the facility manufacturer or by a visit from a national calibration center. Achieve correlation between the filter/pyranometer and spectroradiometric methods at regular intervals.  Changes in the spectral characteristics of lamps, reflectors and filters may occur over a period of time that could result in the spectral distribution being seriously outside the permitted",
    "period of time that could result in the spectral distribution being seriously outside the permitted tolerances.  Manufacturing tolerances may mean that lamp replacement could result in unacceptable changes in both the level of irradiation and spectral distribution compared with that initially set up.  Regular monitoring is therefore essential, but monitoring of the detailed spectral distribution within the test facility may not be possible while an item is undergoing test.  A method of",
    "within the test facility may not be possible while an item is undergoing test.  A method of measuring the intensity of radiation below 320 nm based on the exposure of polysulphone film and that would permit the monitoring of this wavelength range within the test facility is now established.  (The technique is currently being considered as an ISO test method.) Lower cost commercially available spectrometers provide reasonable results, however extreme care must be taken when measuring the",
    "spectrometers provide reasonable results, however extreme care must be taken when measuring the ultraviolet range.  Unless properly calibrated and evaluated, values in the ultraviolet range may be unreliable.",
    "5.2  Measurement of Temperature.",
    "Because of the high level of radiation, it is essential that temperature sensors are adequately shielded from radiant heating effects.  This applies both to measuring air temperatures within the test enclosure, and also to monitoring test item temperatures.  When monitoring test item temperatures, sensors, e.g., thermocouples, should be located on the inside surfaces of the external case and should not be attached to the outside surfaces, unless the surface temperature is of concern.",
    "and should not be attached to the outside surfaces, unless the surface temperature is of concern.  Temperature-indicating paints and waxes are unsuitable for monitoring the temperature of irradiated surfaces, since their absorption characteristics will not be the same.  Commercially available self-adhesive surface mount thermocouples can be used if properly insulated from the source radiation.",

The level of irradiation over the specified measurement plane must be measured immediately prior to each test.  Throughout the test continually monitor any ancillary environmental conditions, e.g., ambient temperature, as well as air velocity and other parameters if specified.  \n6.2   Materiel under Test.",
    "The method of mounting and the orientation of the test item relative to the direction of radiation will have marked influences on the heating effects.  The test item will probably be required to be mounted either on raised supports or on a substrate of specified properties, e.g., a layer of concrete of specified thickness or a sand-bed of certain conductivity.",
    "Include all this and the attitude of the test item in the relevant specification.  Special attention must be paid to the surface conditions of the test item to see that its finish is clean or in accordance with the relevant requirements.  The heating effect on the test item will be largely affected by the condition of its external surfaces.  Care must therefore be exercised in handling the test item, especially in avoiding oil films and in ensuring that the surface finish and its underlay are",
    "item, especially in avoiding oil films and in ensuring that the surface finish and its underlay are fully representative of production standards.  Attach temperature sensors to the test item as required (but see also paragraph 5.3 of this Annex).",
    "6.3 Ground Reflected Radiation",
    "In some cases, such as with a white sand or snow ground cover, and the test item in close association with this surface, significant reflected radiation can be applied to the test item.  This effect can be measured using a radiometer designed to measure the \"albedo\" radiation.  This sensor is primarily consists of a upward-facing radiometer and a downward facing radiometer.  If the test item is to be substantially used in an environment where ground reflected radiation is a concern, consider",
    "to be substantially used in an environment where ground reflected radiation is a concern, consider the albedo radiation in the test design with radiation provided to the lower surface of the test item by auxiliary lighting, or the use of similar reflective material in the test set up.",
    "7.   INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS.",
    "The materiel specification should indicate the permitted changes in the external conditions and/or performance of the test item after exposure to the required level of irradiation for certain durations.  In addition, the following aspects of interpretation may be considered: \n7.1  Comparison with Field Experience.",
    "The effects of exposing material to solar radiation are well documented (see also paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3 below). Investigate any marked differences between the expected effects and the behavior under test conditions, and the basic cause established, i.e., whether caused by the test equipment or procedure, or by some peculiarity in the test item. \n\n## 7.2  Thermal Effects.",
    "a. \nThe maximum surface and internal temperatures attained by materiel will depend on: \n(1) \nthe temperature of the ambient air.  \n(2) \nthe intensity of radiation.  \n(3) \nthe air velocity.  \n(4) \nthe duration of exposure.  \n(5) \nthe thermal properties of the materiel itself, e.g., surface reflectance, size and shape, thermal conductance, and specific heat.    \nb. Materiel can attain temperatures in excess of 60°C if fully exposed to solar radiation in an ambient temperature",
    "as low as 35 to 40°C.  The surface reflectance of an object affects its temperature rise from solar heating to a \nmajor extent; changing the finish from a dark color, for example, to a gloss white will effect a considerable reduction in temperature.  Conversely, a pristine finish designed to reduce temperature can be expected to deteriorate in time resulting in an increase in temperature.  Most materials are selective reflectors, i.e., their",
    "spectral reflectance changes with wavelength.  For instance, paints, in general, are poor infrared reflectors although they may be very efficient in the visible region.  Furthermore, the spectral reflectance of many materials changes sharply in the visible (producing a color sensation to the human eye) and in the near infrared.",
    "It is important, therefore, that the spectral energy distribution of the radiation source(s) used in any simulated test should closely duplicate that of natural radiation.  \n7.3  Degradation of Materials.",
    "The combined effects of solar radiation, atmospheric gases, temperature, humidity changes, etc., are often collectively termed \"weathering,\" and result in the \"ageing\" and ultimate destruction of most organic materials (e.g., plastics, rubbers, paints, timber, etc.).  Many materials that give satisfactory service in temperate regions have been found to be completely unsuitable for use under the more adverse conditions of the tropics.  Typical effects are the rapid deterioration and breakdown of",
    "adverse conditions of the tropics.  Typical effects are the rapid deterioration and breakdown of paints, the cracking and disintegration of cable sheathing, and the fading of pigments. The breakdown of a material under weathering usually results not from a single reaction, but from several individual reactions of different types occurring simultaneously, often with interacting effects.  Although solar radiation, principally the ultraviolet portion, resulting in photodegradation is often the",
    "solar radiation, principally the ultraviolet portion, resulting in photodegradation is often the major factor, its effects can seldom be separated, in practice, from those of other weathering factors.  An example is the effect of ultraviolet radiation on polyvinyl chloride, where the apparent effects of ultraviolet radiation alone are small, but its susceptibility to thermal breakdown, in which oxygen probably plays a major role, is markedly increased.  Unfortunately, artificial tests",
    "which oxygen probably plays a major role, is markedly increased.  Unfortunately, artificial tests occasionally produce abnormal defects that do not occur under weathering.  This can be often attributed to one or more of the following causes:",
    "a. \nMany laboratory sources of ultraviolet radiation differ considerably from natural solar radiation in spectral \nenergy distribution. \nb. When the intensity of ultraviolet, temperature, humidity, etc., are increased to obtain accelerated effects, the \nrate of the individual reactions (that occur under normal exposure conditions), are not necessarily increased to \nthe same extent.  In some cases, e.g., fluorescent lamps, the infrared energy of the source is significantly less",
    "than that of true solar loading, resulting in a surface test temperature that is lower than would be experienced \nout-of-doors. \nc. \nThe artificial tests, in general, do not simulate all the natural weathering factors.",
    "## 8.  Hazards And Personnel Safety.\n\n8.1  General. \n\nThe complex equipment employed for solar radiation testing purposes will necessarily call for operation and maintenance by a skilled test staff, not only to ensure the prescribed performance of the test, but also because of the various health and safety hazards that have to be considered.    \n8.2  Ultraviolet Radiation.",
    "The most obvious dangers that have to be guarded against are those associated with the harmful effects of high intensity radiation in the near ultraviolet region.  In natural sunlight, the eyes are protected in two ways:  the brightness of the sun makes it almost impossible to look directly at it and the ultraviolet radiation is considerably attenuated by the atmosphere.  These protections may not apply to artificial sources.  The eyes must be protected by filtered goggles or viewing apertures,",
    "apply to artificial sources.  The eyes must be protected by filtered goggles or viewing apertures, particularly when setting up the equipment.  Due to the point sources and high UV component of these sources, sunglasses may increase the danger.  Warn all testing personnel that severe eye damage can result from only short exposure to unfiltered radiation from arc-type lamps.  Serious erythema (sunburn) of exposed skin will also occur.  Koller (paragraph 6.1, reference c) states the ultraviolet",
    "of exposed skin will also occur.  Koller (paragraph 6.1, reference c) states the ultraviolet radiation of sunlight is a major causal factor in cancer of the skin in the white population of the US.  The use of suitable protective clothing including protection of the head and hands is highly recommended, even when working in test enclosures irradiated by filtered sources.",
    "8.3  Ozone and Harmful Fumes.",
    "Another serious health hazard arising from the use of xenon and other arc lamps is the possible buildup of local toxic concentrations of ozone during the testing period.  However, the maximum production of ozone occurs at the initial switching on of the lamp, and thereafter the hot envelope of the lamp tends to degrade the ozone back to oxygen. Where forced-air cooling is employed, this cooling air should be sucked out and removed from the building and not blown into the lamp housing.  In this",
    "should be sucked out and removed from the building and not blown into the lamp housing.  In this way, the ozone hazard can be largely eliminated.  Suitable detecting and measuring equipment is commercially available.  The combined effects of heat and ultraviolet radiation on certain plastics (e.g., melamine laminates) may also produce toxic fumes.  Take particular care in the choice of materials used in the construction of a test facility.",
    "8.4  Risk of Lamp Explosions.",
    "The use of high pressure xenon discharge lamps as the primary radiation source can also result in serious accidents unless a well planned code of practice for the handling of these arc discharge tubes has been specified and is adhered to. All such lamps (whether hot or cold, used or new) have a liability to explode violently by reason of the considerable internal pressure (two to three atmospheres when cold, but up to twenty atmospheres when hot).  There should be no visible dirt or oil on the",
    "when cold, but up to twenty atmospheres when hot).  There should be no visible dirt or oil on the envelope, so regular cleaning with detergent and alcohol is necessary using cotton gloves and face protection during such cleaning.  When cold lamps are to be stored, the effects of explosion may be limited by two layers of 0.25 mm thick polycarbonate sheet.  Particular care must be taken to limit the spread of chain reaction breakdowns in multi-lamp equipment.  It is possible to use armor plate",
    "the spread of chain reaction breakdowns in multi-lamp equipment.  It is possible to use armor plate glass for the dual purpose of protection against lamp explosions and as a corrective filter.  Individual lamp records should be kept as a matter of routine so as to be able to detect abnormal voltage/current behavior.",
    "8.5  Electric Shock.",
    "Normal electric shock preventive measures must, of course, be adopted, particularly in the case of the high voltage igniter systems used with arc lamps.  In some xenon lamps, the arc ignition pulse exceeds 60 kV, and an interlock system is therefore essential. \n\n## Method 505.5 Annex B Instrumentation Installation, Placement And Guidance 1. Instrumentation\n\n1.1  Measurement of Irradiance.",
    "The type of instrument considered most suitable for measuring/monitoring the irradiance during test set up and test operation is the pyranometer.  The pyranometer is designed for measuring the irradiance (radiant-flux, watts/m2) on a plane surface, that results from direct solar radiation and from the diffuse radiation incident from the hemisphere above. ISO-9060 (paragraph 6.1, reference d), provides additional information regarding definitions, design criteria, and proper use.",
    "1.2  Pyranometer Classifications.",
    "Referring to ISO-9060, the pyranometer used for testing should be critically selected based on the specific internal requirements for internal tractability/calibration certification, and the ability of the selected pyranometer to meet the requirements of the test and test process (see ISO 9060, Table 1 for classification details, its paragraph 4.3.2, \"Classification Criteria\"). In tests where a direct traceability chain is required, recommend a pyranometer meeting the classification of",
    "a direct traceability chain is required, recommend a pyranometer meeting the classification of \"secondary standard.\"  For typical test set-up and operation, a classification of \"First Class Instrument\" is generally sufficient.  As a minimum, calibrate all instruments on an annual basis.",
    "## 1.3  Pyranometer Use Guidelines.",
    "a. \nPyranometers are used for validating irradiance values during test set-up, for pre-test, during the test, and post \ntest to confirm the specified radiant energy values are maintained.  Recommended the interval used for radiant",

For Procedure II, in addition to recording the pretest calibration, it is",
    "recommended to record the intensity once per-cycle and verify the UVa and UVb portions of the spectrum every seventh cycle. \nb. If pyranometers are continuously exposed to the solar radiation source, consider thermal drift of the radiant \nenergy values provided by the pyranometer.  Some pyranometers require a thermal offset value based on temperature, while others have internal offset characteristics that minimize thermal drift.  \nc.",

Generally, germination and \ngrowth will start when the relative humidity of the ambient air exceeds 70 percent.  Development will \nbecome progressively more rapid as the humidity rises above this value, reaching a maximum in the 90 \nto 100 percent relative humidity range.",

    "## 1. Scope.\n\n1.1 Purpose.   \nThe acceleration test is performed to assure that materiel can structurally withstand the steady state inertia loads that are induced by platform acceleration, deceleration, and maneuver in the service environment, and function without degradation during and following exposure to these forces.  Acceleration tests are also used to assure that materiel does not become hazardous after exposure to crash inertia loads.",
    "## 1.2 Application. This Test Method Is Applicable To Materiel That Is Installed In Aircraft, Helicopters, Manned Aerospace Vehicles, Aircarried Stores, And Ground/Sea-Launched Missiles. 1.3 Limitations.\n\n1.3.1 Acceleration.",
    "1.3.1 Acceleration. \n\nAs addressed in this method, acceleration is a load factor (inertia load, \"g\" load) applied slowly enough and held steady for a period of time long enough such that the materiel has sufficient time to fully distribute the resulting internal loads, and such that dynamic (resonant) response of the materiel is not excited.  Where loads do not meet this definition, more sophisticated analysis, design, and test methods are required. \n\n1.3.2 Aerodynamic loads.",
    "1.3.2 Aerodynamic loads. \n\nMateriel mounted such that any or all surfaces are exposed to aerodynamic flow during platform operations are subject to aerodynamic loads in addition to inertia loads.  This method is not generally applicable to these cases. Materiel subject to aerodynamic loads must be designed and tested to the worst case combinations of these loads.  \nThis often requires more sophisticated test methods usually associated with airframe structural (static and fatigue) tests.",
    "1.3.3 Acceleration versus shock.",
    "Acceleration loads are expressed in terms of load factors that, although dimensionless, are usually labeled as \"g\"",
    "loads.  Shock environments (Methods 516.6 and 517.1) are also expressed in \"g\" terms.  This sometimes leads to the mistaken assumption that acceleration requirements can be satisfied by shock tests or vice versa.  Shock is a rapid motion that excites dynamic (resonant) response of the materiel, but with very little overall deflection (stress). Shock test criteria and test methods cannot be substituted for acceleration criteria and test methods or vice versa.",

    "1.1  Fixture Design Considerations. An installation design in which centrifugal force tends to hold the test item against the machine or fixture as shown in Figure 513.6A-1 and 513.6A-2 is generally preferred for unusually severe acceleration conditions, since this type of installation tends to minimize the possibility of accidental loss of the test item during a test.  In this case, a compressive stress at the test item attachment location results from the normal or centripetal acceleration.",
    "stress at the test item attachment location results from the normal or centripetal acceleration.  A centrifuge equipped with an adjustable mounting table has definite advantages over a machine with a fixed mounting surface as being adjustable means greater versatility in the test installation.  For example, an adjustable mounting table which may be rotated relative to the axis of the centrifuge arm might allow a test installation of the type referred to above or allow a choice of more than one",
    "might allow a test installation of the type referred to above or allow a choice of more than one test item axis for exposure to the acceleration vector without detaching the test item to re-orientate it for each axis tested.  Difficulties in such operations as installation, checkout, servicing, and removal of the test item can be reduced by using a mounting table which allows a change in position relative to the centrifuge arm.",
    "The testing of small items, or items which are difficult to set up, may be expedited by using a fixture which allows exposure of each axis to the acceleration vector without removal of the test item from the fixture.  In this procedure, the fixture (with the test object attached to it) is re-oriented.  One of the simpler fixtures of this type holds the test item at a central location so that any number of fixture faces may be attached to the centrifuge mounting table depending upon the item",
    "number of fixture faces may be attached to the centrifuge mounting table depending upon the item orientation required.  Installations of this type are usually bolted to the centrifuge.  At centrifuge sites where numerous tests requiring re-orientation of the test object are conducted, fixture versatility means reduced costs in test programs and less time to complete tests.",

If the test program is a large one requiring a test to be duplicated for a number of like test items, an elaborate fixture design which minimizes the installation and test time for each test item may be required.  The design and cost of the fixture in this case might be justified by a reduction in the cost of the program such that the cost of fixture design and fabrication is a fraction of the total amount saved.",
    "such that the cost of fixture design and fabrication is a fraction of the total amount saved.  Conversely, a small number of tests might be conducted more economically by using a simple installation in which the test item is unfastened from the centrifuge and re-orientated for each part of a test.

Ensure the flexible modes of the support frame are as high as practical, at least twice the first flexible frequency of the store, \nand that they do not coincide with store modes.  Include and load (torque, clamp, latch, etc.) sway braces,",
    "lugs, hooks or other locking and load carrying devices that attach the store to the suspension equipment and the suspension equipment to the carrier aircraft, as required for captive carriage in service.  Ensure \nthe layout of the structural support frame and the test area is such that there is adequate access for the vibration exciters and test materiel. \n(1) Configure the assembled store for captive carriage and mount it to the structural support frame.",
    "Softly suspend the structural support frame within the test chamber.  Ensure that rigid body modes \nof the store, suspension equipment, and structural support frame combination are between 5 and 20 Hz, and lower than one half the lowest flexible mode frequency of the store.  Use structural support that is sufficiently heavy and of sufficient pitch and roll inertias to approximately simulate carrier",
    "aircraft dynamic reaction mass.  If the structural support is too heavy or its inertia too large, the \nstore suspension equipment and store hardback will be over-stressed.  This is because unrealistically high dynamic bending moments are needed to match acceleration spectral densities.  Conversely, if the structural support is too light or its inertia too low, there will be an undertest of the suspension \nequipment and store hardback.",
    "equipment and store hardback. \n(2) Do not use the structural support to introduce vibration into the store.  Hard-mounting stores to large \nshakers has proven to be inadequate.  Recent test experience with F-15, F-16, and F/A-18 stores indicates that including a structural support/reaction mass greatly improves the match between flight measured data and laboratory vibrations, particularly at lower frequencies.",
    "(3) In cases in which the frequency requirements in (1) and (2) cannot be met, consider force control \nstrategy (see paragraph 4.2.1.2). \nb. Free flight test fixture.  Configure the assembled test store for free flight and softly suspend it within the \ntest chamber.  Ensure rigid body modes of the suspended store are between 5 and 20 Hz and lower than one half the lowest flexible mode frequency of the store. \nc.",
    "c. \nOrientation.  With the store suspended for test, the longitudinal axis is the axis parallel to the ground \nplane and passing through the longest dimension of the store.  The vertical axis is mutually perpendicular to the ground plane and the longitudinal axis.  The lateral axis is mutually perpendicular to longitudinal and vertical axes. \nd. Vibration excitation.  Store longitudinal vibration is typically less than vertical and lateral vibration.",
    "Vertical and lateral excitation of store modes usually results in sufficient longitudinal vibration.  When a store is relatively slender (length greater than 4 times the height or width), drive the store in the vertical \nand lateral axes.  In other cases, drive the store in the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal axes.  If a store",
    "contains material that is not vibration tested except at assembled store level, or the store contains components that are sensitive to longitudinal vibration, include longitudinal excitation. \n(1) Transmit vibration to the store by means of rods (stingers) or other suitable devices running from \nvibration exciters to the store.  Separate drive points at each end of the store in each axis are recommended.  Ideally, the store will be driven simultaneously at each end.  However, it can be",
    "driven at each end separately.  A single driving point in each axis aligned with the store aerodynamic center has also been successful.  Use drive points on the store surfaces that are relatively hard and structurally supported by the store internal structure or by test fixture(s) (usually \nexternal rings around the local store diameter) that distribute the vibratory loads into the store primary structure.",
    "(2) There are many signal forms available to drive the vibration exciters.  Some of the most popular are \nuncorrelated random, sinusoidal and transient (burst random or sine) excitation.  Consideration of the characteristics of the store structure, the suspension equipment, general measurement",
    "considerations, and the desired data resolution will dictate selection of the driving signals. Uncorrelated random excitation and burst random excitation should be accomplished such that the signals are driven periodically within each data acquisition block in order to improve the data quality of the derived frequency response functions (FRFs).  Use of more than one vibration exciter with random excitation will assist in minimizing the influence of non-linear behavior and allows the",
    "structure to be uniformly excited and allow for better frequency response functions (FRFs).  In turn, sinusoidal excitation should be used to characterize non-linearities in the system.  For suspension systems involving carriage of multiple stores, the relative phase characteristics between stores",
    "should be defined and efforts made to replicate relative phasing in the laboratory setting to the maximum degree possible.  It is acknowledged that there may not be sufficient excitation degreesof-freedom to have full control authority over the phase characteristics of multiple stores.   When more than one vibration exciter is used simultaneously, knowledge of multiple exciter testing techniques that include specification of the vibration exciter cross-spectral density matrices is",
    "required (reference Method 527).  The auto and cross-spectral density characteristics should be made available as part of the test specification.  In the absence of measured cross-spectral data, the cross-spectrum will need to be either estimated via model or assumed to be uncorrelated.",
    "Additional information regarding specification of cross-spectral parameters is addressed in paragraph 6.1, reference gg.  For the case in which the cross-spectral density between drive points is assumed to be zero, recognize that due to coupling between the vibration exciters via the \nstore/suspension structure, some level of correlation between the control points will generally exist.     \ne. \nInstrumentation.  Mount transducers on the store and/or the store excitation devices to monitor",
    "Instrumentation.  Mount transducers on the store and/or the store excitation devices to monitor \ncompliance of vibration levels with requirements, to provide feedback signals to control the vibration \nexciter, and to measure materiel function.  Additionally, it is usually important to overall program objectives to add transducers to measure the local vibration environment throughout the store.  Note the",
    "vibration exciter control strategy used, e.g., single point response, multipoint response, force limit, waveform, etc.  Also note the relationship between field measurement data and laboratory measurement data.  \n(1) Mount accelerometers to monitor vibration levels at the forward and aft extremes of the primary",

In some cases (see paragraph 4.4.4c above), transducers are required in the vertical and lateral directions.  In other cases, transducers are required in vertical, lateral, and longitudinal directions. Designate these transducers as the test monitor transducers.",
    "(2) An alternate method is to monitor the test with strain gages that are calibrated to provide dynamic \nbending moment.  This has proven successful where integrity of the store primary structure is a \nmajor concern.  Flight measured dynamic bending moment data is required for this method.

However, there are instances in which the same tests are conducted to only a portion of the fatigue life in the conduct of a system level",

Similarly, development tests and worthiness tests may or may not consume a complete life depending on the specific test goals.

Such tests are commonly a contractual requirement and will include specific test specifications.

In some cases, materiel that must survive severe worst case environments may not be required to function or function at specification levels during worst",

Therefore, insert maximum environmental levels into the durability test, in a realistic manner.  For example,",

    "A statistical reliability test is a test performed on a large sample of production items for a long duration to establish or verify an assigned reliability objective for the equipment operating in its anticipated service environment, where the reliability objective is usually stated in terms of a mean-time-to-failure (MTTF), or if all failures are assumed to be statistically independent, a mean-time-between-failures (MTBF) or failure rate (the reciprocal of MTBF).

    "A reliability growth test is a test performed on one or a few prototype items at extreme test levels to quickly cause failures and, thus, identify weaknesses in materiel design.  In many cases, the test level is increased in a stepwise manner to clearly identify the magnitude of the load needed to cause a specific type of failure.  Design changes are then made and the failure rate of the materiel is monitored by either statistical reliability tests in the laboratory or valuations of failure",
    "is monitored by either statistical reliability tests in the laboratory or valuations of failure data from service experience to verify that the design changes produced an improvement in reliability.  Unlike statistical reliability tests, reliability growth tests do not simulate the magnitudes of the service environments, although some effort is often made to simulate the general characteristics of the environments; for example, random vibration would be used to test materiel exposed to a random",
    "the environments; for example, random vibration would be used to test materiel exposed to a random vibration service environment.",
    "2.1.5  Worthiness test.",
    "When unqualified materiel is to be evaluated in the field, verification that the materiel will function satisfactorily is normally required for safety and/or test efficiency reasons.  This is accomplished by environmental worthiness test.  \nThe worthiness test is identical to a qualification test except that it covers only the life cycle of the field evaluation. Levels are usually typical operating levels unless safety is involved; then maximum operating levels are necessary.",
    "Durations are either equivalent to a complete system/subsystem test, long enough to check materiel function, or an arbitrary short time (5 or 10 minutes).  For safety driven worthiness test, the test item is considered to be consumed by the test (the test item may not be used in the field).  An identical item of hardware is used in the field evaluation. When safety is not an issue, an item may be subjected to a minimum time functional test and then used in the field evaluation.  When it is",
    "be subjected to a minimum time functional test and then used in the field evaluation.  When it is required to evaluate the cumulative environmental effects of vibration and environments such as temperature, altitude, humidity, leakage, or EMI/EMC, a single test item should be exposed to all environmental conditions.  For air worthiness testing, a three step approach may be required.  For example, this could include conducting and initial laboratory vibration test, followed by experimental",
    "this could include conducting and initial laboratory vibration test, followed by experimental flight testing to acquire the actual exposure levels, and ending with a qualification test based on the measured field data.",
    "2.1.6  Environmental Stress Screening (ESS). ESS is not an environmental simulation test representative of a life cycle event and is not a substitute for a qualification test.

    "or pneumatically driven vibration testing machines (often referred to as impact or repetitive shock machines) that allow little or no control over the spectrum of the excitation.  Hence, the screening test environment generally does not represent an accurate simulation of the service environment for the materiel.",
    "2.2  Test Time Compression and the Fatigue Relationship.",
    "The major cause of items failing to perform their intended function is material fatigue and wear accumulated over a time period as a result of vibration-induced stress.  It is preferable for materiel to be tested in real-time so the effects of in-service conditions are simulated most effectively.  However, in most instances real-time testing cannot be justified based on cost and/or schedule constraints and, therefore, it is customary to compress the service life environment into an equivalent",
    "and, therefore, it is customary to compress the service life environment into an equivalent laboratory test.  For vibration environments that vary in severity during the materiel's service life, the duration of the environment can often be reduced for testing by scaling the less severe segments of the vibration environment to the maximum levels of the environment by use of an acceptable algorithm. In many cases, scaling less severe segments to the maximum levels may still yield a test duration",
    "In many cases, scaling less severe segments to the maximum levels may still yield a test duration that is still too long to be practical.  In such cases, the same algorithm may be used to further reduce test duration by increasing test amplitude.  Provided that fatigue is a significant potential failure criterion for the materiel under test, this practice is acceptable within strict limits, notably that test amplitudes are not over exaggerated (or accelerated) simply to achieve short test",

That is, vibration is present at all frequencies over a relatively wide frequency range at varying intensities.  Vibration amplitudes may vary randomly, periodically, or as a combination of mixed random and periodic.  Most vibration tests run with steady state excitation.  Steady state vibration is appropriate at times in simulation of transient events.",

The auto spectral density at a given frequency is the square of the root mean square (rms) value of the acceleration, divided by the bandwidth of the measurement.  Accuracy of spectral values depends on the product of the measurement bandwidth and the time over which the spectral value is computed.  The normalized random error for a spectral estimate is given by  1/",

This range is \nbetween the lowest and highest frequencies at which the materiel may be effectively excited by mechanical vibration.  Typically, the low frequency is one half the frequency of the lowest resonance of \nthe materiel, or the lowest frequency at which significant vibration exists in the environment.  The high",
    "frequency is two times the highest materiel resonant frequency, the highest frequency at which significant vibration exists in the environment, or the highest frequency at which vibration can be effectively transmitted mechanically.  Historically due to limitations in fixture transmissibility and shaker resonances, testing has been limited to a high frequency of 2000 Hz for mechanically transmitted",

When higher frequencies are needed, it may be necessary to augment the vibration with acoustic noise (see Method 523.3). \nb. Rms values.  The use of rms values to specify random vibration is not sufficient.  The spectrum rms \nvalue is the square root of the area under the spectral density curve over the total frequency range.  It",

These new \nlocal resonances may act as vibration isolators (see paragraph 2.4.2 below).",

    "relatively large materiel items, but it applies to materiel of any size.  In these cases, the materiel structure adds to the stiffness of the platform and may significantly affect vibration modes and frequencies. Further, the materiel will be subjected to structural loads for which it may not have been designed.  An example is a beam tied down to the cargo deck of a truck, aircraft, or ship.

Isolation devices are nonlinear with amplitude.  Evaluate these parameters at vibration levels ranging from minimum to maximum.  These comments also apply to isolated sub-elements within materiel items. \nb. Minimum ruggedness.  All materiel should have a minimum level of ruggedness, even if protected by",

    "The installed resonant frequencies of materiel may vary from those of the laboratory test.  One cause is the small variations between serial items from an assembly process.  Tightness of joints, slight differences in dimensions of parts and subassemblies, and similar differences affect both the resonant frequencies and the damping of the various modes of the item.  A second cause is the interaction between the materiel and the mounting.  As installed for field use, a materiel item is tied to",

As installed for field use, a materiel item is tied to mounting points that have an undefined local flexibility, and that move relative to each other in six degrees of freedom as the platform structure vibrates in its modes.

In each case, the mounting participates in the vibration modes of the",

Two different setups of fencing are required depending on the type of test item.  The two types \nare those that are more likely to slide on the test surface or \"rectangular cross section items\" (typically",

Examples of such events are landing impact, arrested landings, catapult, rebound of wings and pylons when heavy stores are ejected, and separated flow or shed vortex excitation of flight surfaces during maneuvers.  Catapult take-off and arrested landing also result in structural motions.  These are included in Method 516.6 as transient vibrations.

In other areas of the airframe (fuselage, inboard wing, etc.) these vibrations are relatively mild and are generally covered by the fallback criteria described below or by minimum integrity criteria (Annex E, paragraph 2.1).",

Jet noise induced vibration is usually dominant in \nvehicles that operate at lower dynamic pressures, i.e., limited to subsonic speeds at lower altitudes and \ntransonic speeds at high altitudes (paragraph 6.1, reference i).

The fluctuating pressures can be crudely predicted analytically (see paragraph 6.1, references l and m) and somewhat more accurately measured in wind tunnel measurements.

That procedure may be used for materiel located inside the cavity, but it is not suitable for simulating the vibration environments for areas near the cavity.  Where cavities remain open continuously, the vibration is continuous.  When doors or covers open, there will be a transient vibration.  While the doors remain open, there is a steady state vibration, followed by",

The peaks are sinusoids produced by the major rotating components (main rotor, tail rotor, engine, gearboxes, shafting, etc.).

The broadband background is a mixture of lower amplitude sinusoids and random vibrations due to sources such as aerodynamic flow noise (see paragraph 2.1).

The definition of and application to design and test of all lower level sinusoidal and random components is not practical.  \nb. Dominant sinusoids.  The dominant sinusoids are generated by rotating components of the helicopter,",
    "primarily the main rotor(s), but also tail rotor, engine(s), drive shafts, and gear meshing.  The normal operating speeds of these components are generally constant, varying less than five percent.  However, recent designs have taken advantage of variable rotor speed control that generates a pseudo steady state \nrotor speed at values between 95 and 110 per cent of the nominal rotor speed.  This complicates the",
    "materiel design and test process since all rotating component speeds, pseudo or otherwise, should be accounted for.  \nc. \nVariable rotor speeds.  Variable speed helicopters are also possible; in this case they also account for the \nfull range of rotation speeds.  A range of 0.975 times minimum speed to 1.025 times maximum speed is recommended. \nd. Design practice.  An obvious requirement for helicopter materiel design is to avoid a match or near",
    "match between materiel resonant frequencies and the dominant sinusoids.  A minimum clearance between operating speed and resonant frequency of at least five per cent is recommended.  It is important to note that helicopter frequencies and amplitudes are unique for each helicopter type and, to some degree, each model of a given type. \ne. \nExposure levels.   \n(1) For reasons stated above, the exposure levels for materiel installed in helicopters should be derived",
    "from field measurement (additional tailored helicopter vibration schedules are provided in paragraph 6.1, reference d).  When measured data are not available, levels can be derived from Table 514.6D- III, and Figures 514.6D-3 and 514.6D-4.  These levels are intended to envelope potential worst-case environments, and have been aggressively compressed in time (paragraph 6.1, reference xx indicates",

    "and to function to specification at the completion of the test.  Materiel costs are often strongly influenced by the performance required in a vibration environment.  Consequently, field measurement based vibration criteria can be very important and are strongly recommended. \n(2) To determine levels, divide the aircraft into zones as shown in Annex C, Figure 514.6C-9.

In addition, ensure criteria for materiel located in an overlap of main and tail rotor zones includes both sets of frequencies.  Fundamental main and tail rotor source frequencies of several helicopters are given in Annex C, Table 514.6C-VIII.  For materiel located on or in close proximity to drive",

    "maximum at initiation of takeoff when the velocity difference between the jet and ambient air is \nmaximum.  This source is generally of primary importance when the store is carried on an aircraft that uses pure jet or very low bypass engines since these engines have the highest exhaust velocities.  Further, it is important at higher frequencies because sources discussed below dominate at lower frequencies (paragraph 6.1, references u, v, and w).",
    "b. In-flight store vibration is primarily caused by aerodynamic turbulence distributed over the surface of the \nstore. \n(1) In single carriage, excitation is relatively independent of the carrying aircraft and mounting location \non the aircraft.  Local flow disturbances such as pylon wakes will vary considerably between aircraft",
    "and between store stations on a given aircraft.  In general, these do not greatly effect overall store vibration.  But, they may severely affect local structures such as tail fins that, in turn, may increase \nlevels of store vibration.  See Annex E, paragraph 2.1.2 for guidance on local flow effects.  When stores are carried close together, the turbulence field around each is increased.  A store carried behind another store is exposed to the turbulence generated by the forward store.",
    "(2) An extensive program of measurement and analysis was accomplished to characterize this \nenvironment (paragraph 6.1, references u, v, and w).  Vibratory excitation is influenced by store configuration, structural configuration, mass density, and flight dynamic pressure.  The high frequency portion of the resulting vibration is best represented by a combination of mechanical",
    "vibration and the acoustic noise exposures of Method 523.3.  The low and medium frequency portion of this environment is better simulated by mechanical excitation.  The studies mentioned above resulted in a method to accomplish this defining the response vibration of the store rather than specifying input vibration.  This method also includes low frequency vibration transmitted from the carrying aircraft (see below).",
    "c. Vibrations of the carrying aircraft are transmitted to the store through the attaching structures.  The total \nvibrating system (aircraft, pylon, bomb rack, and store) is a low frequency system.  That is, the lowest \nnatural frequency of the system is typically below 20 Hertz and the store is isolated from high frequency aircraft vibration.  Depending on the particular circumstances, these vibrations are often best represented \nas transient vibration (see Annex A, paragraph 2.3.4).",
    "as transient vibration (see Annex A, paragraph 2.3.4). \n(1) The low frequency vibration of the airframe transmitted to the store is not separable in the general \ncase from the low frequency turbulence generated vibration.  This vibration is accounted for by the \nmethod discussed under \"Aerodynamic turbulence\" (paragraph 2.4.1b). \n(2) Flight test measurements on the F-15 with various external stores, (paragraph 6.1, reference x) have",
    "shown intense, very low frequency vibrations associated with aircraft buffet during high angle of attack maneuvers.  Other aircraft, such as F-14, F-16, and F-18, or next generation fighters, have the potential to produce intense buffet vibrations during maneuvers. \n(3) The F-15 buffet maneuver envelope is roughly bounded by speeds of 0.7 to 1.0 Mach and altitudes of",
    "approximately 3 to 10.7 kilometers (10,000 to 35,000 ft).  Flight test measurements have shown the maximum F-15 buffet vibration to occur in the flight regime of 0.8 to 0.9 Mach, 4.6 to 7.6 km (15,000 \nto 25,000 ft) altitude, 8° to 12° angle of attack, and dynamic pressure less than 26.3 kN/m\n2 (550 \nlb/ft\n2).  Similar measurements on F/A-18 have shown the maximum buffet maneuver vibration to \noccur in the regime of 0.85 to 0.95 Mach, 1.5 to 4.6 km (5,000 to 15,000 ft.), 8° to 10° angle of",

Although the vibration levels during \nhigh-performance maneuvers are very intense, they generally do not last for more than 10 seconds, reaching maximum in less than a second and deteriorating in 5 to 10 seconds.  Typically F-15 external",
    "stores will experience 30 seconds of maneuver buffet vibration for each hour of captive-carriage flight. \n(4) Buffet vibration is typically concentrated between 10 and 50 Hz.  Vibration response of the store is \ndominated by store structural resonances.  Store loads that occur at frequencies below the lowest store natural frequency are effectively static loads.  Buffet levels vary over a wide range on a given aircraft",
    "as well as between aircraft.  Thus, buffet vibration requirements should be derived from in-flight vibration measurement when possible.  As an alternative to measurements, the lowest store vibratory modes can be exercised at conservative levels to show that the store will be robust enough for any encountered buffet vibration.  This does not cover the static loads associated with buffet.  In order to include these loads, it is necessary to duplicate flight measured dynamic bending moments as",
    "to include these loads, it is necessary to duplicate flight measured dynamic bending moments as discussed as an option in the front part of this method (paragraph 4.2.1.2, Force control strategy). This would require extending the test frequency down to the lowest frequency of airplane buffet response and must be done in coordination with the responsible strength and loads engineers.",
    "d. Stores are also susceptible to vibration generated by internal materiel and local aerodynamic effects.  \nThere are no accepted criteria or methodology for predicting these environments.  However, these environments can be dominating vibration sources and should not be ignored.  Whenever they are present, they should be accounted for through development tests and measurements. \n(1) Internal materiel vibration is typically produced by rotating elements such as electric or hydraulic",
    "motors.  Any device that generates or incorporates physical motion can produce vibration.  Ram air turbines (RAT) are sometimes used to generate electrical or hydraulic power.  A RAT can produce \nhigh levels of rotating element vibration in addition to severe aerodynamic turbulence at and behind the rotating blades. \n(2) Acoustic resonance of simple cavities is typically handled as an acoustic environment (see Method",
    "515.6).  Any hole, cavity, opening, inlet, etc., that allows airflow to enter the store or a cavity in the \nstore can produce high intensity acoustic resonance responses. \n2.4.2 **Captive flight - internal carriage**.",
    "There are two distinct vibration environments for stores carried in a closed, internal, aircraft bay.  These environments occur when the bay is closed to the aircraft external environment and when the bay is open to this environment.  Aircraft capable of high angle of attack maneuvers may be susceptible to buffet.  Since buffet vibration is mechanically transmitted to the store, the bay will provide no protection.  Thus the buffet vibration method discussed above applies.",
    "a. The general vibration environment of a store in a closed bay is very mild.  The store is protected from the \njet engine noise and aerodynamic turbulence environments and isolated from aircraft vibration.  If a store is qualified for external carriage on any jet aircraft, this should more than adequately account for this case.  \nThere is no known method to predict this environment for the general case.  Measured data may be",
    "There is no known method to predict this environment for the general case.  Measured data may be \navailable for specific aircraft, but generally measurements will be necessary if this environment must be \ndefined. \nb. When the bay is opened in flight, a dramatic event occurs.  This event is referred to as cavity resonance",
    "(paragraph 6.1, references l and m) and results in high levels of turbulence inside the bay.  This is wide band turbulence, and unless suppression devices are installed in the bay, with very high spikes across the",
    "spectrum.  The low frequency portions of the disturbance are not likely to drive the store because disturbance wavelengths greatly differ from store dimensions.  The high frequency part of the spectrum will significantly affect the store.  Store vibration resulting from this turbulence cannot be adequately predicted.  Acoustic characterizations of the turbulence exist for most active aircraft and the resulting vibration is best represented by the acoustic noise exposures of Method 515.6.",
    "(1) Generally, store flight surfaces (control surfaces, wings, stabilizers, etc.) are small enough (small \nsurface area) and/or stiff enough (lowest resonant frequency above 100 Hz) that they are not \nsignificantly excited by this environment.  However, in cases in which the control surfaces of the \nstore are relatively large or soft, they may be excited by the open-bay environment.  In these cases the",
    "store response can result in flight surface failure, high levels of store vibration, or both. \n(2) In some instances, a store is carried in one configuration or position until use.  Just prior to use, the \nconfiguration or position may change.  For example, a weapon carried on a rotary launcher inside a",
    "weapons bay of a large bomber.  The weapon moves from clock position to clock position as other weapons on the launcher are launched.  The weapon is exposed to the bay open environment either each time another weapon is launched, or for a relatively long period while several are launched. Another example is a weapon that is extended out of the bay on the launch mechanism prior to launch.  Here the environment will change considerably with position.  A third example is an optical sensor pod.",
    "the environment will change considerably with position.  A third example is an optical sensor pod.  This type of store can be carried internally, extended into the air stream, configuration",
    "changed (e.g., covers over optical windows retract), operated, configuration changed back, and retracted into the closed bay many times in a lifetime.  Account for such variations in environment \nand configuration. \n \nNote:  Door opening, position changes, configuration changes, door closing, etc., should be",
    "Note:  Door opening, position changes, configuration changes, door closing, etc., should be \nexpected to happen rapidly.  Each of these events and possibly a whole sequence of events can happen rapidly enough so that they should be treated as transient (see Annex A, paragraph 2.3.4, and method 516.6) rather than steady state vibration.",
    "## 2.4.3 **Free Flight.** Vibration Will Be Experienced By Stores That Are Deployed From Aircraft, Ground Vehicles, Or Surface Ships. The Sources Of Vibration For The Free Flight Environment Are Engine Exhaust Noise, Vibration And Noise Produced By Internal Equipment, And Boundary Layer Turbulence.",
    "a. Generally, engine exhaust noise levels will be too low to excite significant vibration in the store.  This is \nbecause the engine only operates when the ratio of the exhaust velocity to the ambient air speed is low and (except in unusual cases) the exhaust plume is behind the store. \nb. Vibration produced by onboard materiel can be severe in specific cases.  Examples are ram air turbines,",
    "engines, and propellers.  There is no general basis for predicting store vibrations from such sources.  Each case must be evaluated individually, and it is likely that measurements will be required. \nc.

Many artificial problems have been generated when other types of vibrations have been mislabeled as flutter.  Conversely, flutter problems will not be solved until",
    "recognized as such and treated by flutter engineers. \n(a) A simple form is known as stall or stop sign flutter.  Stop sign flutter can be seen when a plate \n(sign) mounted on a single central metal post flaps violently in the wind.  This happens when the wind blows roughly parallel, but at a small angle to the vertical plane of the plate.  A pressure distribution forms over the plate as with a \"wing.\"  These pressures combine as a",
    "lifting force located upstream (1/4 mean chord) of the post.  This off center force causes the plate to twist the post, increasing the angle between the plate and the wind (angle of attack). Increased angle of attack causes increased lift, more twist of the post, and larger angle of attack.",
    "This continues until either the post torsional stiffness is sufficient to stop further twisting, or until the airflow over the plate stalls.  When stall occurs, the center of lift shifts to the plate center (1/2 mean chord) and the twisting moment disappears.  The post (torsional spring) returns the sign to the original angle, the flow reestablishes and the plate twists again, repeating the cycle.  The cycle then repeats at the frequency of the plate/post torsion mode.  With road",
    "signs this cycling can go on for long periods of time without failing the simple steel post.  \nHowever, when a similar oscillation occurs with more sophisticated structures, failure usually \noccurs rapidly. \n(b) Classical flutter is a mechanism that involves two (or more) modes.  Typically these are the first",
    "bending and first torsion modes.  As flow speed increases the fluid interacts with the modal masses and stiffnesses, changing modal frequencies.  Flutter occurs when modal frequencies converge and the motions of the two modes couple in a mechanism that extracts energy from the fluid flow.  For additional information see paragraph 6.1, reference z, section 7.10 or section 3.6. \n(2) When air flows over a blunt cross section (depth ≈ height), vortices are shed alternately from one",

First, a cantilever exposes a large surface area to the excitation relative to the cross section of the support structure.",
    "Second, a cantilever tends to respond with high amplitude motion and large root stresses in the supporting base.  Third, when the cantilever has the form of a \"wing,\" aerodynamic lift and drag forces can be produced that add to the fluctuating pressure loads.

These variations affect the \"wing\" as variations in angle of attack and flow velocity.",

The flow from the high pressure side wraps around the tip to the low pressure side.  This results in a rotating flow trailing downstream of the tip.  This rotating flow or vortex is left in the wake of the \"wing,\" is highly stable, and persists for long distances downstream.  Such a vortex is highly structured",

When instabilities are discovered, the correct procedure is to understand and then eliminate the mechanism.  This is accomplished by determining the mode shapes and frequencies of those resonances participating in the instability and, if possible, the characteristics of the flow field.",

This is accomplished by changing modal mass, stiffness, or damping \nand/or by changing aerodynamic shapes.  (See paragraph 6.1, reference z, section 6.1.)  Dynamic \nabsorbers are often useful in changing modal properties (see paragraph 6.1, reference y, paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3).",
    "(2) Vortex shedding driven vibration also generally leads to rapid fatigue or wear failure.  This problem",
    "typically involves a single mode of vibration of the materiel.  If possible, the problem should be eliminated by separating the shed frequency and the resonant frequency (ideally by a factor of 2).  If this is not practical, it may be possible to survive this mechanism for useful periods of time with good design.  Good design consists of using materials with good fatigue properties, elimination of high stress points, and adding damping.  In order to define exposure levels, it is necessary to",
    "## \n\nmeasure the motions of the cantilever on the platform in the operating environment.  These measurements are used to define modal responses.  When laboratory tests are required, response control is necessary.  This is because the primary energy input is directly from the fluid flow.  \nResponse of the cantilever to this input is greater than the response to the vibration environment at the mount.",
    "(3) Local turbulence is not predictable except in a very general sense.  Problems of this type should be",
    "avoided whenever possible by locating materiel away from known turbulence areas.  Beyond this, it is necessary to operate the platform through its operational envelope and evaluate problems as they occur.  When problems are discovered, the first approach should be to determine the source of the turbulent wake that is causing the problem and to move the materiel out of this wake.  If this is not possible, proceed as discussed for vortex shedding problems.",

If it is necessary to define exposure durations, take them from the life cycle profile.  These problems may occur in very specific regions of an \noperating envelope.  It may be necessary to break missions down to a very detailed level in order to define realistic durations.",

    "applies at positions within the central volume of the chamber; do not position test items within about 0.5 m of the walls. \nc. \nThe size of the test item can distort the noise field if the item is large relative to the volume of the chamber.  It is normally recommended that the volume of the test item not exceed 10 percent of the \nchamber volume. \n1.2  Noise is normally generated with an air modulator and is injected into the chamber via a coupling horn.",
    "Provision is made in the chamber design to exhaust the air from the modulator through an acoustic attenuator in order to prevent the direct transmission of high intensity noise to areas outside the test chamber.",
    "2. PROGRESSIVE WAVE TUBES.",
    "A parallel sided duct usually forms the working section of such a progressive noise facility.  This may be circular or rectangular in section to suit the test requirements.  For testing panels, a rectangular section may be more suitable while an aircraft carried store may be more conveniently tested in a duct of circular section.  Noise is generated by an air modulator coupled into one end of the working section by a suitable horn. From the opposite end of the plain duct another horn couples",
    "working section by a suitable horn. From the opposite end of the plain duct another horn couples the noise into an absorbing termination.  Maximum absorption over the operating frequency range is required here in order to minimize standing wave effects in the duct.  Noise then progresses along the duct and is applied with grazing incidence over the surface of the test item.  The test item itself may be mounted within the duct in which case the grazing incidence wave will be applied over the",
    "may be mounted within the duct in which case the grazing incidence wave will be applied over the whole of its external surface.  Alternatively, the test item may be mounted in the wall of the duct when the noise will be applied to only that surface within the duct, e.g., on one side of a panel.  The method used will depend upon the test item and its inservice application.",
    "3. ACOUSTIC NOISE CHARACTERISTICS.",
    "Radiated high intensity noise is subjected to distortion due to adiabatic heating.  Thus, due to heating of the high pressure peaks and cooling of the rarefaction troughs, the local speed of propagation of these pressures are modified.  This causes the peaks to travel faster and the troughs to travel slower than the local speed of propagation such that, at a distance from the source, a sinusoidal wave becomes triangular with a leading shock front.  This waveform is rich in harmonics and",
    "wave becomes triangular with a leading shock front.  This waveform is rich in harmonics and therefore the energy content is extended into a higher frequency range.  It can be seen from this that it is not possible to produce a pure sinusoidal tone at high noise intensities.  The same effect takes place with high intensity random noise that is commonly produced by modulating an airflow with a valve driven by a dynamic actuator.  Due to velocity and/or acceleration restraints on the actuator, it",
    "driven by a dynamic actuator.  Due to velocity and/or acceleration restraints on the actuator, it is not possible to modulate the airflow at frequencies greater than about 1 kHz.  Acoustic energy above this frequency, extending to",
    "20 kHz or more, therefore results from a combination of cold air jet noise and harmonic distortion from this lower frequency modulation.",
    "4. CONTROL STRATEGIES.   \nMicrophones are normally used to monitor and control the test condition.  When testing stores and missiles, it is recommended that not less than three microphones be used to control the test.  Some test items may be more effectively monitored on their vibration response; in which case, follow the monitoring requirements of Method",
    "514.6, as appropriate.  Use a monitoring system capable of measuring random noise with a peak to rms ratio of up to 3.0.  Correct pressure calibrated microphones used in reverberation chambers for random incidence noise, while correcting those used in progressive wave tubes for free field grazing  incidence noise, and ensure both have a linear pressure response.  Provide for averaging the outputs of the microphones to provide the spatial average of the noise for control purposes.",

    "2.1 Basic Estimate Assumptions.",
    "Prediction estimates, measurement estimates, or a combination of prediction and measurement estimates may be considered in the same manner.  It is assumed that uncertainty in individual measurements (processing error) does not effect the limit considerations.  For measured field data digitally processed such that estimates of the SRS, ESD, FS, or ASD are obtained for single sample records, it is useful to examine and summarize the overall statistics of \"similar\" estimates selected in a way so",
    "useful to examine and summarize the overall statistics of \"similar\" estimates selected in a way so as to not bias the summary statistics.  To ensure the estimates are not biased, the measurement locations might be chosen randomly, consistent with the measurement objectives.  Similar estimates may be defined as (1) estimates at a single location on materiel that has been obtained from repeated testing under essentially identical experimental conditions; (2) estimates on a system that have been",
    "under essentially identical experimental conditions; (2) estimates on a system that have been obtained from one test, where the estimates are taken (a) at several neighboring locations displaying a degree of response homogeneity or (b) in \"zones\" i.e., points of similar response at varying locations; or (3) some combination of (1)",
    "and (2).  In any case, it is assumed that there is a certain degree of homogeneity among the estimates across the frequency band of interest.  This latter assumption generally requires that (1) the set of estimates for a given frequency have no significant \"outliers\" that can cause large sample variance estimates, and (2) larger input stimulus to the system from which the measurements are taken implies larger estimate values.  \n2.2 Basic Estimate Summary Preprocessing.",
    "There are two ways in which summaries may be obtained.  The first way is to use an \"enveloping\" scheme on the basic estimates to arrive at a conservative estimate of the environment, and some qualitative estimate of the spread of basic estimates relative to this envelope.  This procedure is dependent upon the judgment of the analyst and, in general, does not provide consistent results among analysts.  The second way is to combine the basic estimates in some statistically appropriate way and",
    "The second way is to combine the basic estimates in some statistically appropriate way and infer the statistical significance of the estimates based upon probability distribution theory.  Paragraph 6.1, reference b summarizes the current state of knowledge relative to this approach and its relationship to determining upper limits on sets of data.  In general, the estimates referred to and their statistics are related to the same frequency band over which the processing takes place.",
    "and their statistics are related to the same frequency band over which the processing takes place.  Unfortunately, for a given frequency band, the statistics behind the overall set of estimates are not easily accessible because of the unknown distribution function of amplitudes for the frequency band of interest.  In most cases the distribution function can be assumed to be normal, provided the individual estimates are transformed to a \"normalizing\" form by computing the logarithm to the base",
    "individual estimates are transformed to a \"normalizing\" form by computing the logarithm to the base ten of the estimates.  For ESD and FS estimates, the averaging of adjacent components",
    "(assumed to be statistically independent) increases the number of degrees of freedom in the estimates while decreasing the frequency resolution with the possible introduction of statistical bias in the estimates.  For ASD estimates, averaging of adjacent components can be useful provided the bias error in the estimate is small; i.e., the resolution filter bandwidth is a very small fraction of the overall estimate bandwidth.  For SRS estimates, because they are based on maximum response of a",
    "the overall estimate bandwidth.  For SRS estimates, because they are based on maximum response of a single-degree-of-freedom system as its natural frequency is varied, adjacent estimates tend to be statistically dependent and, therefore, not well smoothed by averaging unless the SRS",
    "is computed for very narrow frequency spacing.  In such cases, smoothing of SRS estimates is better accomplished by reprocessing the original time history data at a broader natural frequency spacing, e.g., 1/6th octave as opposed to 1/12th octave.  There is no apparent way to smooth dependent SRS estimates mathematically when reprocessing cannot be performed, and the acceptable alternative is some form of enveloping of the estimates.  The larger the sample size, the closer the logarithm",
    "is some form of enveloping of the estimates.  The larger the sample size, the closer the logarithm transform of the estimates is to the normal distribution unless there is a measurement selection bias error in the experiment.  Finally, generally, before application, the upper limits obtained in the paragraphs to follow are smoothed by straight line segments intersecting at spectrum \"breakpoints.\"  No guidance is provided in this Annex relative to this \"smoothing\" or \"enveloping\" procedure,",

    "a. \nIn general, response acceleration will be the experimental variable of measurement for pyroshock.  \nHowever, this does not preclude other variables of measurement such as velocity, displacement, or strain \nfrom being measured and processed in an analogous manner, as long as the interpretation, capabilities, and \nlimitations of the measurement variable and measurement system are well-defined.  Pay particular attention",
    "to the high frequency environment generated by the pyrotechnic device and the capabilities of the measurement system to faithfully record the materiel's responses.  Paragraph 6.1, references a and b detail the tradeoffs among pyroshock measurement techniques. In any case, implement the guidelines in paragraph 6.1, reference d.  For the purpose of this method, the terms that follow will be helpful in the discussion relative to analysis of response measurements from pyroshock testing.  To",
    "helpful in the discussion relative to analysis of response measurements from pyroshock testing.  To facilitate the",
    "definition of the terms, each of the terms is illustrated for a typical pyroshock measurement.  Figure 517.1-\n1 provides an acceleration time history plot of a measured far-field pyroshock with the instrumentation",
    "noise floor displayed before the pyroshock, the pyroshock, and the subsequent post-pyroshock noise floor. It is important to provide measurement data including both the pre-pyroshock noise measurement and the post-pyroshock combined noise and low level residual structure response.  The vertical lines at three",
    "discrete times are used to identify a \"short duration\" truncated pyroshock response and a \"long duration\" pyroshock response.  The pre-pyroshock time interval, before the first vertical line, contains the instrumentation system noise floor and serves as a measurement signal reference level.  The pyroshock time interval includes all the significant response energy of the event. The post-pyroshock time interval, after the third vertical line, is of equal duration to the pre-pyroshock time",
    "time interval, after the third vertical line, is of equal duration to the pre-pyroshock time interval and contains the measurement system noise in addition to some of the pyroshock residual noise considered inconsequential to the response energy in the pyroshock.  In cases in which the pre-pyroshock and the post-pyroshock amplitude levels are substantial compared to the pyroshock (the pyroshock has been mitigated and/or the measurement system noise is high), the identification of the pyroshock",
    "been mitigated and/or the measurement system noise is high), the identification of the pyroshock may be difficult and engineering judgment must be used relative to determining the start and the termination of the pyroshock event.  In any case, analysis of pre-pyroshock and post-pyroshock measurement information in conjunction with the pyroshock measurement information is essential.  Validate all data collected from a pyroshock.  Paragraph",
    "6.1, reference d provides guidelines for this.  Perhaps one of the simplest and most sensitive criteria for \n \nvalidation is an integration of the signal time history after removing any small residual offset.  If the resulting integrated signal has zero crossings and does not appear to monotonically increase, the pyroshock has passed this validation test (net velocity is equal to zero). Figure 517.1-2 provides the velocity plot for the long duration pyroshock on Figure 517.1-1.",
    "(1) Effective transient duration:  The \"effective transient duration,\" Te, is defined in this method to be the \nminimum length of time that contains all significant amplitude time history magnitudes beginning at the noise floor of the instrumentation system just prior to the initial most significant measurement, and proceeding to the point that the amplitude time history is a combination of measurement noise and",
    "substantially decayed structural response.  In general, an experienced analyst is required to determine \nthe pertinent measurement information to define the pyroshock event.  The longer the duration of the pyroshock, the more low frequency information is preserved that may be important in far-field test \nconsiderations for the pyroshock.  For near-field test considerations, in general, the effective transient",
    "duration will be much shorter because of the nature of the event.  The amplitude criterion requires that the amplitude of the post-pyroshock amplitude time history envelope be no more than 12 dB above the",
    "noise floor of the measurement system depicted in the pre-pyroshock amplitude time history.  From Figure 517.1-1 there appear to be at least two logical time intervals for the duration of the pyroshock. The first duration is immediately after the end of the high frequency information - the second vertical line on Figure 517.1-1 at approximately 3.5 milliseconds after the beginning of the pyroshock.  The second duration is given by the third vertical line on Figure 517.1-1, some 6.6 milliseconds",
    "The second duration is given by the third vertical line on Figure 517.1-1, some 6.6 milliseconds after the beginning of the pyroshock and after some of the apparent low frequency structural response has been attenuated - the third vertical line on Figure 517.1-1.  These judgments, based on examination of the amplitude time history, used an amplitude criterion and a low frequency criterion.  Figure 517.1-3 contains a plot of amplitude of the absolute value of the pyroshock in dB versus time.",

It is clear that the only significant difference is near 100 Hz.  The magnitude of the SRS at selected natural frequencies (particularly high frequencies) can be quite insensitive to the effective transient duration.",
    "(2) Shock Response Spectrum analysis:  Paragraph 6.1, reference e, defines the absolute acceleration \nmaximax Shock Response Spectrum (SRS) and provides examples of SRS computed for classical \npulses.  The SRS value at a given undamped oscillator natural frequency, fn, is defined to be the \nabsolute value of the maximum of the positive and negative acceleration responses of a mass for a \ngiven base input to a damped single degree of freedom system.  The base input is the measured shock",
    "over a specified duration (the specified duration should be the effective transient duration, Te).  For \nprocessing of pyroshock response data, the absolute acceleration maximax SRS has become the",
    "primary analysis descriptor.  In this measurement description of the pyroshock, the maximax absolute acceleration values are plotted on the ordinate with the undamped natural frequency of the single degree of freedom system with base input plotted along the abscissa.  A more complete description of the pyroshock (and potentially more useful for pyroshock damage comparison in the far-field) can be obtained by determining the maximax pseudo-velocity response spectrum and plotting this on",
    "can be obtained by determining the maximax pseudo-velocity response spectrum and plotting this on fourcoordinate paper where, in pairs of orthogonal axes, (1) the maximax pseudo-velocity response",
    "spectrum is represented by the ordinate with the undamped natural frequency being the abscissa, and",
    "(2) the maximax absolute acceleration along with the maximax pseudo-displacement plotted in a pair of orthogonal axes (paragraph 6.1, reference e).  The maximax pseudo-velocity at a particular oscillator undamped natural frequency is thought to be more representative of the damage potential for a shock since it correlates with stress and strain in the elements of a single degree of freedom system (paragraph 6.1, references f, g, and h).  The maximax pseudo-velocity response spectrum can be",
    "(paragraph 6.1, references f, g, and h).  The maximax pseudo-velocity response spectrum can be computed either by (1) dividing the maximax absolute acceleration response spectrum by the",
    "undamped natural frequency of the single degree of freedom system, or (2) multiplying the maximax \nrelative displacement by the undamped natural frequency of the single degree of freedom system. Both means of computation provide essentially the same spectra except possibly in the lower frequency region, in which case the second method of computation is more basic to the definition of",
    "the maximax pseudo-velocity response spectrum.  Figure 517.1-5 provides the estimate of the maximax absolute acceleration SRS for the pyroshock record on Figure 517.1-1.  Figure 517.1-6 \nprovides the estimate of the maximax pseudo-velocity for this record on four-coordinate paper.",
    "Information below 100 Hz is not considered valid for processing in these measurements.  In general, compute the SRS over the pyroshock event duration and over the same duration for the pre-pyroshock and the post-pyroshock events with twelfth octave spacing and a Q = 10 (Q=10 corresponds to a single degree of freedom system with 5 percent critical damping).  If the testing is to be used for laboratory",
    "simulation, use a second Q value of 50 (Q=50 corresponds to a single degree of freedom system with 1 percent critical damping) in the processing.  It is recommended that the maximax absolute acceleration SRS be the primary method of display for the pyroshock, with the maximax pseudo-velocity SRS as the secondary method of display and useful in cases in which it is desirable to correlate damage of simple systems with the pyroshock.",
    "(3) Other methods:  Over the past few years, at least two other techniques potentially useful in processing \npyroshock data have been suggested.  Paragraph 6.1, reference i describes the use of time domain or temporal moments for comparing the characteristics of the pyroshock over different frequency bands.  \nThe usefulness of this technique resides in the fact that if the pyroshock can be represented by a simple",
    "nonstationary product model, the time domain moments must be constant over selected filter \nbandwidths.  Thus, the pyroshock can be characterized by a model with potential usefulness for stochastic simulation.  Paragraph 6.1, reference j explores this reasoning for mechanical shock.  \nParagraph 6.1, reference k describes the use of wavelets for vibration.  It has been suggested that \nwavelet processing may be useful for pyroshock description, particularly if a pyroshock contains",
    "wavelet processing may be useful for pyroshock description, particularly if a pyroshock contains \ninformation at intervals of time over the duration of the shock at different time scales, i.e., different frequencies.   \nb.  In general, for pyroshock tests, a single response record is obtained.  At times, it may be convenient or",
    "even necessary to combine equivalent processed responses in some appropriate statistical manner. Paragraph 6.1, reference l, and Method 516.6, Annex 516.6A of this standard discuss some options in statistically summarizing processed results from a series of tests.

Parametric or less powerful nonparametric methods of statistical analysis may usually be effectively applied.   \n2.3.2 Test conditions - shock spectrum transient duration and scaling.",
    "Derive the SRS and the effective transient duration, Te, from measurements of the materiel's environment or, if available, from dynamically scaled measurements of a similar environment.  Because of the inherent high degree of measurement randomness and limited response prediction methodology associated with the response to a pyroshock, extreme care must be exercised in dynamically scaling a similar event.

Previous versions of MIL-STD-810 beginning with MIL-STD-810C provided a means of developing a predicted sine-on-random vibration test spectrum based upon several gun/materiel configuration parameters.

It is demonstrated in Annex C that sine-on-random specification does not lead to a unique nor optimum time trace form.",

This methodology requires that preliminary design procedures be in accordance with that for repetitive shock at predicted sine-on-random spectrum levels.  This philosophy is adopted for the stochastic prediction incorporated in Procedure III.",

As a rationale related note on Procedure III, even though the set of measured data available in the mid 1970s was small for the extended prediction philosophy that was developed, there was hesitation in discarding the information in previous versions of MIL-STD-810.

The measurement locations may be determined prior to an in-service measurement effort by examination of random vibration data on the materiel using various accelerometer mounting locations and fixture configurations (the in-service measurement or reference point should be the same as the laboratory control point).

If there is no indication of accelerometer anomalies, digitally band pass filter the in-service measured time trace",

A test of gunfire shock replication on an electrodynamic exciter using Procedure I under guidelines in Method 525 is provided for illustration purposes below. Even though the gunfire shock measurements are substantial, similar results would be obtained for lesser magnitude measurements for other configurations.  Application of test",

    "A specially instrumented unidentified test item is installed in a laboratory vibration fixture and mounted on an electrodynamic exciter.  The test item employed during the laboratory testing is of the same general materiel configuration that was used to collect the gunfire shock materiel response information during an in-service test performed specifically for measurement data collection.

    "2.3 Creating a Digital File of the Measured Gunfire Shock Input to the Materiel.",
    "A **first step** is to formulate a test strategy and carefully examine the available measured time trace information designed to satisfy the test strategy.  Usually selection of a test strategy is based upon the materiel LCEP.  The test strategy may consist of selection of the maximum measured environment for replication according to some criteria, e.g., peak acceleration, maximum energy, etc.  The test strategy may also consist of selection of several levels of measured environment to be run",
    "The test strategy may also consist of selection of several levels of measured environment to be run sequentially in proportion to the level of the particular environment expected in the LCEP.  For the illustration, the maximum measured level that provided gunfire shock transition from 2000 rounds/minute to 4000 rounds/minute was selected based upon a visual inspection of the in-service test measured data.

The maximum  time of gunfire per sortie can be determined from Table 519.6D-II by dividing total rounds per aircraft by the firing rate.  When a gun has more than one firing rate, perform the test using both firing rates, with test time at each firing rate based on the expected proportion of time at each firing rate",

Application of a single scale factor in the time domain is generally unacceptable if the random process has a time-varying variance and only marginally acceptable if the variance is time",

Ad hoc methods that scale the measured or stochastically simulated time trace by a single factor based upon peak distribution, SRS, energy estimates should generally not be used.

This is generally creation of an artificial environment outside of the guidelines in Method 525. With proper justification, this ad hoc technique of test tailoring could be applied.",
    "At this stage, in the relationship between gunfire shock measurement and Method 525, it is recommended that for multiple measurements the measurements be concatenated and used statistically to form a gunfire schedule or pulse train according to the LCEP description. \n\n2.2  TWR Test Tolerances.",

After Examining Requirements Documents And Applying The Tailoring Process In Part One Of This Standard To Determine Where Ballistic Shock Effects Are Foreseen In The Life Cycle Of The Materiel, Use The Following To Confirm The Need For This Method And To Place It In Sequence With Other Methods.",
    "2.1.1 Effects of ballistic shock.",
    "In general, ballistic shock has the potential for producing adverse effects on all electronic, mechanical, and electromechanical systems.  In general, the level of adverse effects increases with the level and duration of the ballistic shock and decreases with the distance from the source (point or points of impact) of the ballistic shock.  Durations for ballistic shock that produce material stress waves with wavelengths that correspond with the natural frequency wavelengths of micro electronic",
    "waves with wavelengths that correspond with the natural frequency wavelengths of micro electronic components within various system components will enhance adverse effects.",
    "Durations for ballistic shock that produce structure response movement that correspond with the low frequency resonances of mechanical and electro-mechanical systems will enhance the adverse effects.  Examples of problems associated with ballistic shock include:",
    "a. \nsystem failure as a result of destruction of the structural integrity of micro electronic chips including \ntheir mounting configuration; \nb. system component failure as a result of relay chatter; c. \nsystem component failure as a result of circuit card malfunction, circuit card damage, and electronic connector failure.  On occasion, circuit card contaminants having the potential to cause short circuits",
    "may be dislodged under ballistic shock.  Circuit card mounts may be subject to damage from substantial \nvelocity changes and large displacements. \nd. material failure as a result of cracks and fracture in crystals, ceramics, epoxies or glass envelopes. e. \nsystem component failure as a result of sudden velocity change of the structural support of the system component, or the internal structural configuration of the mechanical or electro-mechanical system.",
    "## 2.1.2 Sequence Among Other Methods.\n\na. \nGeneral.  See Part One, paragraph 5.5. \nb. Unique to this method.  Unless otherwise identified in the life cycle profile and, since ballistic shock is \nnormally experienced in combat and potentially near the end of the life cycle, normally schedule ballistic shock tests late in the test sequence.  In general, the ballistic shock tests can be considered independent of the other tests because of their unique and specialized nature.",
    "## 2.2 Selecting A Procedure. This Method Includes Six Ballistic Shock Test Procedures.  See Paragraph 2.3.4 For The \"Default\" Approach To Ballistic Shock Testing When No Field Data Are Available.",
    "a. Procedure I - Ballistic Hull and Turret (BH&T), Full Spectrum, Ballistic Shock Qualification.  Replication \nof the shock associated with ballistic impacts on armored vehicles can be accomplished by firing \nprojectiles at a \"Ballistic Hull and Turret\" (BH&T) with the materiel mounted inside.  This procedure is",
    "very expensive and requires that an actual vehicle or prototype be available, as well as appropriate threat munitions.  Because of these limitations, a variety of other approaches is often pursued.  The variety of devices used to simulate ballistic shock is described in paragraph 6.1, reference a. \nb. Procedure II - Large Scale Ballistic Shock Simulator (LSBSS).  Ballistic shock testing of complete",
    "components over the entire spectrum (10 Hz to 100 kHz) defined in Table 522.1-I and in Figure 522.1-1 can be accomplished using devices such as the Large Scale Ballistic Shock Simulator (LSBSS) described \nin paragraph 6.1, reference a.  This approach is used for components weighing up to 500 Kg (1100 lbs), \nand is considerably less expensive than the BH&T approach of Procedure I.   \nc. Procedure III - Limited Spectrum, Light Weight Shock Machine (LWSM).  Components weighing less",
    "c. Procedure III - Limited Spectrum, Light Weight Shock Machine (LWSM).  Components weighing less \nthan 113.6 kg (250 lb) and shock mounted to eliminate sensitivity to frequencies above 3 kHz can be tested \nover the spectrum from 10 Hz to 3 kHz of Table 522.1-I and Figure 522.1-1 using a MIL-S-901 Light Weight Shock Machine (LWSM) (paragraph 6.1, reference c) adjusted for 15 mm (0.59 inch) displacement",
    "limits.  Use of the LWSM is less expensive than full spectrum simulation, and may be appropriate if the specific test item does not respond to high frequency shock and cannot withstand the excessive low \nfrequency response of the drop table (Procedure V). \nd. Procedure IV - Limited Spectrum, Mechanical Shock Simulator.  Mechanical shock simulators have been",
    "constructed to test very light weight components (0.5 to 1.8 kg (1 to 4 lb) for the smallest machine; higher for other contractor machines).  These machines produce a shock that lies within the envelope of the default shock response spectrum described in paragraph 2.3.4 up to 10 kHz.  Shock content is present",
    "above 10 kHz, but it is not well defined.  Use of a Mechanical Shock Simulator is less expensive than full spectrum simulation, and may be appropriate for light weight items that are sensitive to shock up to 10 kHz.",
    "e. Procedure V  -  Limited Spectrum, Medium Weight Shock Machine (MWSM).   Components weighing \nless than 2273 kg (5000 lb) and not sensitive to frequencies above 1 kHz can be tested over the spectrum from 10 Hz to 1 kHz of Table 522.1-I and Figure 522.1-1 using a MIL-S-901 Medium Weight Shock Machine (MWSM) (paragraph 6.1, reference c) adjusted for 15 mm (0.59 in.) displacement limits.  Use of",
    "the MWSW may be appropriate for heavy components and subsystems that are shock mounted and/or are not sensitive to high frequencies. \nf. Procedure VI - Drop Table.  Light weight components (typically less than 18 kg (40 lbs)) which are shock \nmounted can often be evaluated for ballistic shock sensitivity at frequencies up to 500 Hz using a drop \ntable.  This technique often results in overtest at the low frequencies.  The vast majority of components that",
    "need shock protection on an armored vehicle can be readily shock mounted.  The commonly available drop test machine is the least expensive and most accessible test technique.  The shock table produces a halfsine acceleration pulse that differs significantly from ballistic shock.  The response of materiel on shock \nmounts can be enveloped quite well with a half-sine acceleration pulse if an overtest at low frequencies and",
    "an undertest at high frequencies is acceptable.  Historically, these shortcomings have been acceptable for the majority of ballistic shock qualification testing. \nNOTES:  **Related shock tests**:  \n1.  High Impact / Shipboard Equipment. Perform shock tests for shipboard equipment in",
    "1.  High Impact / Shipboard Equipment. Perform shock tests for shipboard equipment in \naccordance with MIL-S-901.  The tests of MIL-S-901 are tailorable through the design of the fixture that attaches the test item to the shock machine.  Ensure the fixture is as similar to the mounting method used in the actual use environment.  High impact shocks for Army armored combat vehicles should be tested using this method",
    "2.  Fuzes and Fuze Components.  Perform shock tests for safety and operation of fuzes and fuze \ncomponents in accordance with MIL-STD-331 (paragraph 6.1, reference d). \n3.  Combined Temperature and Shock Tests.  Perform shock tests at standard ambient \nconditions unless a high or low temperature shock test is required. \n2.2.1 Procedure selection considerations.",
    "Based on the test data requirements, determine which test procedure is applicable.  In most cases, the selection of the procedure will be dictated by the actual materiel configuration, carefully noting any gross structural discontinuities that may serve to mitigate the effects of the ballistic shock on the materiel.  In some cases, the selection of the procedure will be driven by test practicality.  Consider all ballistic shock environments anticipated for the materiel during its life cycle,",
    "Consider all ballistic shock environments anticipated for the materiel during its life cycle, both in its logistic and operational modes.  When selecting procedures, consider:",
    "a. \nThe operational purpose of the materiel.  From the requirements documents, determine the functions to \nbe performed by the materiel either during or after exposure to the ballistic shock environment. \nb. The natural exposure circumstances for ballistic shock.  The natural exposure circumstances for ballistic \nshock are based on well-selected scenarios from past experience and the chances of the occurrence of",
    "such scenarios.  For example, if an armored vehicle is subject to a mine blast, a number of assumptions must be made in order to select an appropriate test for the ballistic shock procedure.  In particular, the size of the mine, the location of major pressure wave impact, the location of the materiel relative to the impact \"point,\" etc.  If the armored vehicle is subject to non-penetrating projectile impact, the energy",
    "input configuration will be different from that of the mine, as will be the effects of the ballistic shock on the materiel within the armored vehicle.  In any case, condition each scenario to estimate the materiel response as a function of amplitude level and frequency content.  It will then be necessary to decide to",
    "which scenarios to test and which testing is most critical.  Some scenario responses may \"envelope\" others, which may reduce the need for certain testing such as road, rail, gunfiring, etc.  In test planning, do not break up any measured or predicted response to ballistic shock into separate amplitude and/or \nfrequency ranges using different tests to satisfy one procedure.",
    "c. \nRequired data.  The test data required to determine whether the operational purpose of the materiel has \nbeen met. \nd. Procedure sequence.  Refer to paragraph 2.1.2. \n\n## 2.2.2 Difference Among Procedures.",
    "2.2.2.1 Procedure I - BH&T.",
    "Ballistic shock is applied in its natural form using live fire testing.  Test items are mounted in the BH&T that replicates the full-size vehicle in its \"as designed\" configuration and location.  If required, \"upweight\" the vehicle to achieve proper dynamic response.  Appropriate threats (type, distance, orientation) are successively fired at the hull and/or turret.

    "Consider the inclusion of other environmental stresses that may be important for particular materiel.  In general, it is not appropriate to include comparatively rare occurrences of extreme stress levels that are better quantified in single environment methods described elsewhere in this standard.

    "of time of occurrence\" (FTO) less than 0.1 (10 percent) of the total time specified for the store's MTBF, the condition may be considered too rare to be included in a test described by this method.  In evaluating FTO, consider all in-service use environments and use the more severe of the two.  Note that the term FTO is used here in place of the more traditional probability of occurrence.  FTO is defined for a level of stress as the ratio of the time the store is under the stress condition",
    "is defined for a level of stress as the ratio of the time the store is under the stress condition divided by the total time of observation, e.g., the store's mean time between failures.

FTO can be shown to provide an estimate of the probability distribution of the level of stress and is a more precise term.  A simple example of this difference is as",
    "of the level of stress and is a more precise term.  A simple example of this difference is as follows:  If the stress condition is the absolute value of the acceleration at a point in the store that is above 5g's, the FTO is easily established from an auto-spectral density (ASD) estimate over a specified time interval.  This implies a stationary Gaussian time history with zero mean and standard deviation as the square root of the area under the ASD estimate.  The probability of occurrence",

The probability of occurrence relates to the number of times the 5g level is exceeded, but the total time above 5g may vary from one occurrence to the next, depending on the difference in ASD estimates and on the associated duration of each of the stationary Gaussian ASD estimates.",
    "2.1.1.3 Operation.",
    "Operating any materiel item produces stress that can cause failure.  In the case of external aircraft stores, operation generally means providing full electrical power, that produces thermal, electromagnetic, and electrochemical stress. Duty cycles (on/off), low and high voltage, power ripple, and voltage spikes may also be significant stresses.  Even when the stress of operation is negligible, it is necessary to operate the materiel under test to detect the presence of failure.  Many failures",
    "is necessary to operate the materiel under test to detect the presence of failure.  Many failures induced by temperature and some vibration-induced failures are reversible, at least initially. As the test continues, reversible failures tend to become irreversible.  Thus, it is important to conduct tests of functions while the environmental stresses are present.",

In Order To Induce All The Stresses Related To Temperature In Their Proper Proportion, Use A Thermal Model Of The Store To Predict The Temperatures And Rates Of Change At Several Internal Points Under Service Mission Profiles.",
    "a. \nAmbient temperature.  The greatest variations in ambient temperature occur near the surface of the \nEarth. The low temperature extreme experience by a store is, in many cases, due to low ambient temperatures immediately preceding flight.  This is because there is ample time for temperature soak and",
    "there is no internal power dissipation or aerodynamic heating.  Hence, it is important to consider on-theground temperatures in determining the initial captive flight temperature.  The test temperature cycle",
    "may need to include a simulated on-the-ground period in order to normalize the temperature for the next simulated mission phase; otherwise an uninterrupted sequence of simulated missions may tend to drive the average internal temperature up or down relative to real missions.

The temperatures that are cited in the two documents are those measured for meteorological purposes, and do not include the heating effects of direct sunlight or cooling due to radiation into the night sky.  Hence, in \ndetermining preflight temperatures, consider the effects of radiation heat transfer, and remember to \nconvert from probability of occurrence to FTO in application.",
    "convert from probability of occurrence to FTO in application. \nb. Aerodynamic heating.  During captive flight, the high convective heat transfer rate will cause the surface \ntemperature of an external store to be near that of the boundary layer.  The recovery air temperature in the boundary layer depends primarily on the ambient temperature and the speed of flight.  The functional dependence is: \n$$\\mathrm{T_{r}=T_{o}\\theta\\!\\left(1+r\\!\\left(\\gamma-1\\right)\\!{\\frac{M^{2}}{2}}\\right)}$$\nwhere:",

    "γ \n=  1.4, atmospheric ratio of specific heats \nM \n=  flight Mach number \nSince flight at high altitude, where the ambient temperatures are lowest, is usually at higher Mach numbers (>0.80), the low temperatures are generally mitigated by aerodynamic heating.  Because of the dominance of boundary layer heat transfer, radiation heat transfer can be neglected in captive flight.",
    "c. \nPower dissipation.  Although the high heat transfer rate will tend to keep the surface of a store at the \nboundary layer recovery temperature, internal temperatures may be considerably higher due to power dissipation of electronic equipment.  For this reason the duty cycle of the materiel being tested must be tailored to reflect realistic operation and it must be coordinated with the external temperature to achieve a good reproduction of the expected temperatures.",
    "d. Temperature gradients.  The strongest temperature gradients will usually be those associated with \npowering the materiel when it is cold.  Temperature gradients will also occur due to changes in flight speed and altitude that change the surface temperature more rapidly than internal temperatures. \n2.1.1.5 Vibration.",
    "Vibration may cause mechanical fatigue failure of parts, abrasion due to relative motion, dislodging of loose particles that can cause electrical shorts, and degradation of electronic functions through microphonics and triboelectric noise. Experiments (paragraph 6.1, reference d) and theoretical analysis (paragraph 6.1, reference e) have shown that the relative likelihood of various failure modes changes with vibration level.  In order to reproduce the service failure modes in proper",
    "modes changes with vibration level.  In order to reproduce the service failure modes in proper proportion, it is necessary to test at several levels, keeping the fraction of time (FOT) in each level the same as predicted for the service use.  The vibration spectrum may be considered to consist of two parts:  the low frequency part that includes those vibrations that can be transmitted from the aircraft, through the store attachments, into the store (this is not the only source of low frequency",
    "through the store attachments, into the store (this is not the only source of low frequency vibration, but it is the major one), and the high frequency part that is driven almost entirely by pressure fluctuations in the boundary layer acting directly on the surface of the store.  Generally, the mechanical impedance of the store attachment is such that the division between low and high frequency is between 100 Hz and 200 Hz.",
    "a. \nLow frequency vibration.  The low frequency vibration primarily stresses the structure, including \nbrackets, large circuit boards, and electromechanical devices (e.g., gyros, relays).  In most cases it is",
    "driven by transmission from the aircraft; hence, input excitation through the normal attachment points with a mechanical shaker best reproduces the low frequency vibration.  Use Method 514.6 as a guide. Note that fluctuating aerodynamic forces may also act in the low frequency range.  For control surfaces, \nwings, or other structure with a large area-to-mass ratio, the direct aerodynamic forces may be dominant.",
    "For this reason, the low frequency vibration of the test item cannot be regarded as a test of the structural fatigue life for wings, fins, or their attachments.  In general, separate tests on components are needed to determine structural fatigue life of these components. \nb. High frequency vibration.  Above the frequency at which the store attachments can transmit vibration,",
    "the vibration is driven by the boundary layer turbulence (paragraph 6.1, reference f).  This vibration does not contribute to failure of the basic structure, but is often a cause of failure in electronics.  The characteristics of the pressure fluctuations in the boundary layer are well known (paragraph 6.1, reference g).  The significant aspects for external stores are: \n(1) The pressure spectrum is almost flat, out to the highest frequencies to which stores' component",
    "parts respond (the -3dB point is about 4000 Hz).  Hence, the vibration spectrum of an external store is determined almost entirely by its natural frequency responses. \n(2) The RMS level of the pressure fluctuations, and hence the vibration, is approximately proportional \nto the dynamic pressure, q, that is a function of flight speed and altitude: \n$$\\mathbf{q}={\\frac{1}{2}}\\rho_{0}\\sigma\\mathbf{V_{a}}^{2}\\mathbf{M}^{2}$$\nwhere: q \n=  dynamic pressure, kN/m2 (lb/ft2) \nρ0",

If the planned test is based on in-service measured values, it is important that the sensors and their locations be identical to those used in these measurements.

Adjust the vibration drive \nsignal and, if necessary, the acoustic drive signal until the highest required levels of vibration response are achieved.",
    "Step 6. Adjust acoustic and vibration stimuli to each of the required intermediate levels and measure the \nresponses.  If the responses at each level are reasonably close (engineering judgement required) to the required levels, maintain the calibrations for the highest response level and iterate to the other levels by changing the overall levels of the drive signals (accuracy of the simulation is more",

The service stress distribution is the set of stresses in the combinations, levels, and duration imposed by the in-service missions.  The procedure reproduces the levels, durations, and combinations of temperature, vibration, and acoustic noise in the same relative proportions as the in-service missions.",

    "2.3 Mission Characterization.",
    "The first step in developing the composite mission profile is to determine the types of aircraft and mission flight profiles that will employ the store.  The mission flight profiles may be described in terms of altitude and Mach number with annotation of events.  A tabulated mission phase analysis or mission profile description is shown in Table 523.3A-II.  A corresponding graphical representation of this mission is shown on Figure 523.3A-1.  The relative frequency of occurrence of the various",
    "of this mission is shown on Figure 523.3A-1.  The relative frequency of occurrence of the various missions must also be determined.  This may be tabulated as shown in Table 523.3A-I.  In determining the relative frequency with which the store will be carried on various missions, it may be necessary to consider some state of hostility.  Experience has shown that weapons that would be expended on their first flight in conflict may be subjected to many flights during a time of high international",
    "their first flight in conflict may be subjected to many flights during a time of high international tension in which there is no combat.  Choose the most stressful, yet realistic, mix of missions for simulation.  Generally, it is not desirable to average together relatively benign missions with relatively stressful ones if a store will experience only one or the other during its service life.  For each aircraft type and mission, determine the carriage location of the store to be tested, as well",
    "each aircraft type and mission, determine the carriage location of the store to be tested, as well as the location of other stores that may affect it.  Stores located ahead of or adjacent to a given store will cause an increase in the turbulence-induced vibration of that store.  Ejection of nearby stores may also induce dynamic loads.  Also, note any geographic or other conditions that would influence the mission (e.g., a store carried only by carrier-based aircraft will not experience as wide",

    "a. \nBoth the frequency spectrum shape and spatial distribution of store vibration in captive flight are almost independent of the flight condition.  Exceptions are increased low frequency vibration during buffeting \nmaneuvers and, in some cases, increased high frequency vibration in supersonic flight.  In general, \nboundary layer fluctuating pressures are proportional to the dynamic pressure (q) of the flight condition.",
    "The store vibration is the dynamic response of the store to these pressures and is also proportional to q. The vibration spectrum rms level (grms) is proportional to q, and the acceleration spectral density (G) at \nany frequency is proportional to q2.  If vibration levels (grmsref, Gref) are defined for a single flight \ncondition (qref), this proportionality can be used to approximate vibration levels throughout the flight \nenvelope as follows:",

    "b. Usually the reference condition is taken to be subsonic carriage on the least stressful aircraft station",
    "(wing pylon with no adjacent stores).  Using this reference, determine the q versus time profile for each mission and construct a histogram representing the proportion of time the store is at a q level.  This summarizes the expected vibration experience of the store.  For stores for which measured vibration data are not available, the levels can be estimated by considering similar stores, with tailoring criteria provided in Method 514.6.

These factors typically account for cases where stores are carried side by side, behind other stores or in other special configurations.  Measured data are the best source for these factors.  Method 514.6 also provides guidance. \nd. Vibration of a store is the dynamic response of the store to the fluctuating pressure and aircraft",
    "transmitted environments.  This is broken down into definitions of the motions of key structural points of the store.  The vibration environments of materiel located in the store are the local store vibration \nresponses.  The test consists of exciting the store with arbitrary levels of vibration and acoustics, and tailoring these inputs to achieve the defined store responses.  \ne. \nFor the exceptional cases (aircraft buffet, catapult launch, arrested landing, gunfire, etc.), determine",
    "vibration/shock level, spectrum, and other characteristics.  Quantify the occurrences of the exceptional \nvibration/shock conditions in terms of duration and mission time, so they can be reproduced in the \nproper proportions and at the proper times in the test cycle.  Measured data are even more important here, but Method 514.6 contains guidance both for interpreting measured data and estimating levels when necessary.  Method 519.6 contains guidance on estimating gunfire-induced shock.",

    "a. \nTo determine the mission simulation part, begin with a sequence of skin temperatures corresponding to a few of the most common mission(s) strung together.  Use a sequence that is no longer than one fortieth (1/40) of the store MTBF.  It is usually convenient to make it a factor of 24 hours (e.g., 6 hrs or 8 hrs) since the test will be run around-the-clock.  Use this skin temperature as an input to the store thermal",
    "model and determine the histograms of the internal temperature.  These must be the responses after many cycles (the \"steady state\" responses).  Compare these to the histograms for all the missions. Adjust the test sequence to achieve approximate agreement between the temperature histograms, both on \nthe skin and internally.  In this adjustment, keep the number and rate of temperature changes roughly the",
    "same as in the actual missions.  It will usually be necessary to introduce a period of simulated on-theground time into the cycle in order that each simulated flight period start with the store at the appropriate uniform temperature.  The temperature during the simulated on-the-ground time may be elevated or reduced in order to speed up the stabilization of internal temperatures.  This initial temperature will be shifted each cycle to simulate the effect of climatic temperature variation.",
    "b. Climatic effects are included by repeating the simulated flight cycle with temperatures shifted up or \ndown by offset values that are constant over one cycle, but which differ from cycle to cycle (see Table 523.3A-III).  Successive cycles have the temperature raised or lowered by an amount that represents a",

The upper bound on the number of offsets is determined by the requirement that the overall cycle must be shorter than one fifth of the MTBF.

For worldwide, day and night operations, the climatic variation below 10 km is well approximated by a",

    "6.1, reference h).  (This includes variation of location as well as season.)  At altitude, the mean temperature is lower, but the standard deviation is about the same (paragraph 6.1, references h and n) over most of the globe.  Near the poles and the equator, the variation at altitude is considerably less (paragraph 6.1, reference o).  For eight offsets, the temperatures would be as shown in Table 523.3A-III.",
    "Stair-step the sequence of offsets in the test cycle up and down as indicated by the step number.  Figure 523.3A-5 displays a climatic set plan where test item skin temperature is a function of elapsed test time.

In general, tolerances",

Relative to TWR test methodology on \nmeasured time traces of diverse form, measured mechanical response *time traces* and portions of such time \ntraces may have any one of three characteristic forms.   \n(1) The first form is that of Gaussian or non-Gaussian stationary random vibration.",
    "(2) The second form is that of a short duration high level transient or shock where the duration of the \ntransient is much shorter than the periods of the lowest natural frequencies of interest for the materiel.   \n(3) The third form is that of a nonstationary transient vibration having duration that substantially \nexceeds the period of the lowest natural frequency of the materiel.",
    "A fourth form, too specialized for consideration here, might be classed as periodic repetition of an event for which test tolerance is established according to time trace ensemble statistics (see Method 519.6, Gunfire Shock).  For TWR tolerance development, such tolerances *should not exceed* the tolerances provided for stationary random vibration and mechanical shock for the first and second forms, respectively.  It is anticipated that a properly designed TWR test will easily meet the",
    "forms, respectively.  It is anticipated that a properly designed TWR test will easily meet the tolerance levels specified in both of these forms (Methods 514.6 and 516.6).  The tolerances for the third form of nonstationary time trace are somewhat dependent upon the nature of the nonstationarity.  Techniques for nonstationarity assessment in which time trace amplitude is a function of both time and frequency are available (see paragraph 6.1 references a and b).  Some nonstationary time traces",
    "and frequency are available (see paragraph 6.1 references a and b).  Some nonstationary time traces that have time invariant frequency characteristics can be represented by the Product Model (PM), and can be processed for tolerance purposes as stationary random vibration with a time-varying envelope.

The particular TWR vendor software re-sampled the waveforms to 24576 samples per second prior to testing.  The Nyquist frequency is  24576/2=12288 Hz.

    "4.2 Frequency Band Limiting The objective of frequency band limiting is to ensure that for time trace comparison, the reference and control time traces exist over the same exact frequency band (generally a bandwidth coincident with the TWR control bandwidth).  The importance of this operation cannot be over emphasized.  If the control time trace has significant high frequency information not contained in the reference time trace (as a result of boundary conditions or impedance mismatch), this",
    "in the reference time trace (as a result of boundary conditions or impedance mismatch), this will be reflected in any TPP amplitude comparisons.  The band pass filter to provide a common bandwidth for the time traces is selected such that the minimum of the reference bandwidth and the control bandwidths is established.  This common bandwidth may be specified as, e.g., 10 Hz to 2000 Hz, or determined by examining the magnitude of a periodogram estimate for both time traces.  The frequency band",
    "by examining the magnitude of a periodogram estimate for both time traces.  The frequency band limiting operation is performed on both the reference and control time traces, and always performed before time trace correlation considerations.  Unless the time traces are excessive in length, a single block rectangular window FFT magnitude",

For excessively long time traces, the Welch method of spectrum computation may be employed for common bandwidth identification. To obtain the common bandwidth a standard bandpass filter may be applied, making sure to preserve filter phase linearity, in obtaining the reference and control time traces.  Figure 525A-3",
    "provides single block periodograms for the reference and control time traces before and after bandpass filtering.",
    "NOTE: With regard to frequency band limiting it is very important that for any field time trace measurement program designed to provide input to TWR laboratory testing, the bandwidth of the field measurementsexceeds by definition the bandwidth of interest for laboratory testing (TWR test control bandwidth). For example, if test specifications call for a 10 Hz to 2000 Hz laboratory test bandwidth, then field time trace measurements must exceed 2000 Hz e.g., 4000 Hz, in order to provide a",
    "then field time trace measurements must exceed 2000 Hz e.g., 4000 Hz, in order to provide a reference time trace with sufficient bandwidth to compare with the unprocessed control time trace resulting from TWR laboratory testing.

Almost certainly the laboratory test will exhibit energy out of the test specification frequency band of interest or the exciter test control",

Thus bandlimiting for comparison of reference and control time traces must be in accord with the most significant energy in the unprocessed laboratory control time trace (that likely exceeds the test specification bandwidth).

Based upon examination of the periodograms for both time traces in Figure 525A-2, the very low frequency information (below 10 Hz), and the very high frequency information (above 2000 Hz) was filtered out.  The frequency analysis bandwidth for this operation was 0.067 Hz. 4.3 Time Trace Correlation After a common frequency bandwidth has been established, it is essential that",

To perform this check and take corrective action, the cross-covariance function",

There is no known single analysis procedure that can *consistently* assess the replication error for all six forms of time trace components identified in paragraph 1.2.3 in the front portion of this method.

This form replication error assessment will not be pursued further here.",

For reference purposes the overall difference time trace along with TPP root-mean-square level are displayed in Figure 525A-9a and Figure 525A-9b.

The rudimentary overall maximum and minimum statistics for the time traces are as follows:  r(H) min/max –22.84/35.24, c(H) min/max –24.28/39.76, and s(H) min/max –4.11/4.78, c(S) min/max –23.85/39.03,",

The differences between response on the head of the shaker (H) and the shaker slip table (S) are reasonably nominal, so that only results for the shaker head will be provided below (a more detailed assessment of this requires SIMO formulation in Annex B).",

    "distribution of a rigid rotor is adjusted in order to ensure that the residual unbalance in two specified planes \nis within specified limits. \nh. **Critical speed.**  Critical speed is the speed of a rotating system that corresponds to a natural frequency of \nthe system. \ni. \nEnvironmental vibration.  Environmental vibration is vibratory force that is imposed on equipment",
    "Environmental vibration.  Environmental vibration is vibratory force that is imposed on equipment \ninstalled aboard ships under all external conditions. The hydrodynamic force from the propeller blades interacting with the hull is usually the principal exciting force. \nj. \nEquipment.  Equipment is any rotating or non-rotating machine that is intended to be installed aboard ship. \nk. **Grade, balance quality.**  Balance quality grade, G, refers to the amount of permissible unbalance of a",

Response prominence is a general term denoting a resonance or other distinct",
    "maximum, regardless of magnitude, in a transmissibility function, including local maxima that may exist at the frequency endpoints of the transmissibility function.  Typically, a response prominence is identified by",
    "the frequency of its maximum response, that is the response prominence frequency.  A response prominence of a system in forced oscillation exists when any change, for both plus and minus increments however small, in the frequency of excitation results in a decrease of the system response at the observing",

The unbalance of a flexible rotor changes with speed.  Any value of unbalance assigned \nto a flexible rotor must be at a particular speed.  The balancing of flexible rotors requires correction in more \nthan two planes.  A rotor that operates above n resonances requires n+2 balance planes of correction.  A",

Test \ntolerances of less than +2dB are usually readily attainable with small, compact test items (such as small and",

Thunderstorms, that are relatively small and localized, produce the heaviest rainfalls over periods of a few hours or less.",
    "Tropical cyclones are responsible for most of the extreme amounts for a few hours to a few days.  Orographic precipitation, that is the result of moist air forced to ascend over topographic features, can also be quite heavy and can continue for long periods.  Windward slopes of mountain ranges in the moist tropics generally have the highest monthly and annual amounts; they are also prone to very extreme amounts when affected by tropical storms.",

    "1.3 Operational, and storage and transit conditions.   \nIn each of the seven daily weather cycles, a distinction is made between operational temperature and humidity conditions, and storage and transit temperature and humidity conditions.  \n  a.

    "is also stated for many of the climatic conditions.  Although the standard conditions measured in \nmeteorological shelters are usually not exactly the same as the operational environment for materiel, it is necessary to state operational conditions in standard terms so: \n   \n(1) Measurements have the same meaning in all parts of the world. \n   \n(2) The great range of variations in response of different materiel to a given climatic condition is not a",
    "complicating factor in setting design criteria.",
    "For example, the temperature of the materiel itself may vary considerably from the operational air temperature because of the effects of incoming solar radiation, internal sources of heat, the thermal mass, and the heat transfer characteristics of the materials.  Most items exposed to the sun will attain higher temperatures than the air temperature.  The exact temperature can be obtained through actual or simulated exposure to the appropriate daily cycle, or through the development and use of",
    "actual or simulated exposure to the appropriate daily cycle, or through the development and use of suitable mathematical models.",
    "b. Storage and transit conditions.  These are temperature and humidity conditions to which materiel might be \nsubjected in storage and transit situations.  Examples of these situations are: \n   \n(1) Inside an unventilated field storage shelter. \n   \n(2) In a railway boxcar. \n   \n(3) Dump stored in the open.",
    "Because of great differences in temperature and humidity in varying storage modes, the severity of the exposure depends upon the choice of storage mode as much as the storage location.  This is very important in areas of extreme solar radiation and high humidity.  Storage and transit air temperature and humidity may differ from operational temperature and humidity because of the induced effects of heat gains or losses of air in confined spaces.  Where a large thermal mass is involved (e.g., in",
    "heat gains or losses of air in confined spaces.  Where a large thermal mass is involved (e.g., in food storage), the temperature of the stores may be much lower than the storage air temperature stated, and may have little daily variation.

    "## Part Three Annex C - Comparison Of Ar 70-38 With Mil-Hdbk-310 1.  Relationship Between Ar 70-381 And Mil-Hdbk-310*",
    "1.1  Background.   \nAR 70-38 and MIL-HDBK-310 are the Army and DoD documents, respectively, that provide environmental information and data for the derivation of design criteria through the tailoring process.  The two documents are similar in many respects.  Both publications reflect a philosophy that accepts a small risk of failure during periods of extreme weather.  They also require a complete return to operation after exposure to extreme conditions has ended.",
    "MIL-HDBK-310, however, considers only the likelihood of natural extremes occurring, whereas AR 70-38 considers the induced conditions many items are exposed to during transit and storage.  This difference means that Army materiel must be able to withstand much higher air temperatures than those in MIL-HDBK-310, although the high temperatures for operation are the same.  The principal differences between the AR and the MIL-HDBK are:",
    "a. The MIL-HDBK is limited to climatic information only (with the exception of blowing sand and dust that is a \ncombination of soil and climatic conditions), whereas the AR provides additional guidance for terrain \nfactors and weather related atmospheric obscurants. \nb. The MIL-HDBK provides data and guidance for both worldwide and regional applications, whereas the AR \ndivides the land areas of the world into design types, some of which are subdivided into multiple daily",
    "weather cycles.  Prior to the 1987 edition, there were no regional types given in MIL-STD-210.  The \nregional types of the \"C\" version were derived from the 1979 edition of AR 70-38.  Although the AR does \nnot specifically state worldwide values, they can be derived by using the most extreme values from the most \nextreme daily weather cycles (hot and severe cold) for each climatic element.",
    "extreme daily weather cycles (hot and severe cold) for each climatic element. \nc. The MIL-HDBK provides guidance and data for coastal/oceanic conditions and upper air conditions, neither",
    "of which is covered by the AR.  The oceans and upper air are, by tradition, primarily areas of concern for the Navy, Air Force, and Army users who have need for such information should consult MIL-HDBK-310. (Its predecessor, MIL-STD-210, was prepared by the Geophysics Laboratory of the United States Air Force Systems Command). \nd. The MIL-HDBK is tailored in a somewhat different manner than the AR.  The former does not provide",
    "values for storage/transit conditions, whereas the Army approach is that some guidance in this area is \nneeded.  The AR provides one level of risk for operational conditions and a second level for storage/transit \nconditions.  The MIL-STD provides several levels for operational conditions and another level for what is \nreferred to as withstanding conditions.  These different risk levels in the MIL-STD are described as follows:",
    "(1) Frequency-of-occurrence values.  These are for use in most operational circumstances, and are presented \nas 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 percent (or other, if appropriate) risk levels for the worst month in the most severe area of occurrence. \n(2) Long-term climatic extremes. For most climatic elements, values are given that are expected to occur at",
    "least once, for a short duration (less than 3 hours) during approximately 10, 30, or 60 years of materiel exposure.  These are much rarer events than those cited for the frequency-of-occurrence values above. Their use should be limited to specifying conditions that materiel must be able to withstand, but not for which it is expected to be operational.  These are generally derived by extreme-value statistical analysis.",
    "(3) Absolute extremes.  The most extreme value ever recorded (not necessarily the most extreme that has \never occurred) is also provided for each element.  These are for use when it is determined that materiel \nshould be designed to operate in the most severe conditions it is ever likely to encounter (assuming this \nis within technical capabilities). Generally, this would be the case only when disastrous consequences would result from failure to operate.",
    "When greater detail is required for the tailoring process, suggest users of AR 70-38 look for corresponding climatic elements in MIL-HDBK-310 that will provide a wider range of values at different risk levels for design application.",
    "1.2 Risk policy.",
    "In the Ground Environment section, MIL-HDBK-310 contains single worldwide values for each climatic element to be considered in the design of materiel for operations.  For most climatic elements, the design value selected was the value exceeded not more than one percent of the hours in the most extreme month in an average year at the most severe location for that element.  (For low temperature, the level selected was 20 percent of the hours and, for rainfall, the level selected was 0.5 percent",
    "level selected was 20 percent of the hours and, for rainfall, the level selected was 0.5 percent of the hours.)  These values have become known as one percent design values.  When they are applied collectively, they are often referred to as a one percent risk policy.  Although this is a convenient short designation, it can be misleading to those who are not aware of this specific definition of a one percent risk policy.  In fact, there is no way to quantify, with any degree of accuracy, the",
    "a one percent risk policy.  In fact, there is no way to quantify, with any degree of accuracy, the probability that materiel will ever encounter a given extreme of an environmental element.  It can be stated with assurance that the designated one percent risk levels as used in MIL-HDBK-310 are very conservative.  For example, on a year-round basis, the risk of encountering the design level of a selected element approaches 1/12 of one percent (there is some likelihood of occurrence in other than",
    "element approaches 1/12 of one percent (there is some likelihood of occurrence in other than the most extreme month).  Also, for many of the climatic elements, the design value applies only to the most severe location in the world.  Therefore, the risk of materiel encountering this extreme may be very small, particularly if the value at the most severe location is representative of only a small area or the location is in a remote part of the world. The above considerations led to the adoption",
    "area or the location is in a remote part of the world. The above considerations led to the adoption of the system now used in AR 70-38.  It provides alternate design values for items not intended for worldwide use.  Consequently, the world was divided, on the basis of temperature, into four types.  The design temperatures in this four-type division are somewhat arbitrary.  However, the geographic areas encompassed by the basic design type contain most of the world's population and landmass.  In",
    "areas encompassed by the basic design type contain most of the world's population and landmass.  In general, the lines delimiting the areas included in a design type are drawn on the basis of having one percent of the hours in the most severe month on average exceeding the design temperature.  Note, it is only along the demarcation line that this criterion applies exactly.  For example, if more than one percent of the hours in the coldest month at a given location are below -46°C (-50°F), the",
    "than one percent of the hours in the coldest month at a given location are below -46°C (-50°F), the area represented by that location is considered part of the severe cold climatic design type.  Yet, at that location, there may be almost no chance of occurrence of -51°C (-60°F), that is the lower design value for that type.  On the other hand, there are stations in the areas included in the severe cold design type that have temperatures below -51°C (-60°F) for as much as 20 percent of the hours",

This kind of variation within the regions could be eliminated only by creating a large number of small regions, a procedure that would make this delineation unduly complex.",
