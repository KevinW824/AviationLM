    "Executive Summary This Change 1 document specifies a change to the TCAS II requirements contained in RTCA document DO-185B. The rationale for the change is described in change proposal CP123, which was approved by the SC-147 Requirements Working Group. The first part of the change concerns an aspect of the TCAS multiaircraft logic. It affects the",
    "\"middle\" aircraft of a multi-threat situation, and removes the feature that would have required a green arc to accompany that aircraft's RA. The second part of the change clarifies the coding of certain bits reporting Hybrid Surveillance capability within the Data Link Capability Report, to be consistent with a change made to DO- 300. Section 1 provides the text changes to Volume I. Section 2 provides changes to the Pseudocode in Volume II, Attachment A. Section 3 provides changes to the state",
    "changes to the Pseudocode in Volume II, Attachment A. Section 3 provides changes to the state charts in Volume II. Section 4 provides changes to the TSIM data set that is specified for the verification of the TCAS implementation. This material is not part of DO-185B, but is accompanying material distributed by FAA, not by RTCA.",
    "## This Page Intentionally Left Blank 1  Changes To Volume I The Following Correction Is Needed In Order To More Accurately Describe The Behavior Of The Multi-Aircraft Logic When Own Aircraft Is \"Projected In The Middle\". 2.2.5.3.3 Multi-Aircraft Logic",
    "Note: \nSpecial rules are invoked when a TCAS-equipped aircraft is involved in a \nmultiple-aircraft encounter.  The pilot of the aircraft with \"projected clear \nairspace above\" is told to CLIMB, and the pilot of the aircraft with \"projected clear airspace below\"  is told to DESCEND.  Aircraft \"projected in the middle\" \nare told to limit their climb and their descent until the aircraft above or below \nare no longer in conflict.",
    "are no longer in conflict. \n \nThe selection of a positive DESCEND advisory in a multi-aircraft situation is also subject to the performance limitations of the TCAS aircraft when it is near the Descend Inhibit altitude threshold.  In this case, a negative DON'T CLIMB \nwill be selected instead of DESCEND. \n \nThe multi-aircraft logic has been designed to prevent premature level-off RAs when own is to pass between two threats vertically.  This requires retention of a",
    "positive RA until certain criteria have been met so that vertical separation is maximized.  The multi-aircraft logic also includes the ability to model and select \nIncrease Rate RAs and sense reversals to better resolve situations that are \ndeteriorating due to adverse maneuvers by own aircraft or one of the threats.  \n(The ability to generate an Increase Rate RA is subject to the INCREASE CLIMB and INCREASE DESCENT inhibit indications and thresholds.)  The logic also",
    "performs an unbiased evaluation of all new threats to select the optimum RA against all rather than constraining the RA to be selected against the second or third threat by the initial choice against the first. \n \nFollowing is the change needed to the coding of the data link capability report:",

    "3  Changes to State Charts There are two transition tables that need to be updated to match the Multiaircraft changes in the pseudocode. These are the Yes to No transition tables for the Corrective_Climb and the Corrective_Descend states on pages 125 and 127, respectively, of DO-185B Volume II. The original DO-",
    "185B form of those two transition tables are shown next, followed by the revised versions of those two tables with the changes highlighted. Note that in addition to the changes made to match the proposed pseudocode change, the subscript page references for the functions Climb_Goal and Descend_Goal are changed because the values printed in DO-185B are incorrect.",
