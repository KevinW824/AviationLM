    "ARINC sponsors the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC), composed of airline technical personnel.  The AEEC formulates standards for electronic equipment and systems for the airlines.  The establishment of Equipment Characteristics is a principal function of this Committee.",
    "An ARINC Equipment Characteristic is finalized after investigation and coordination with the airlines who have a requirement or anticipate a requirement, with other aircraft operators, with the Military services having similar requirements, and with the equipment manufacturers.  It is released as an ARINC Equipment Characteristic only when the interested airline companies are in general agreement.  Such a release does not commit any airline or ARINC to purchase equipment so described nor does",
    "Such a release does not commit any airline or ARINC to purchase equipment so described nor does it establish or indicate recognition of the existence of an operational requirement for such equipment, not does it constitute endorsement of any manufacturer's product designed or built to meet the Characteristic.  An ARINC Characteristic has a twofold purpose, which is:",
    "(1)\nTo indicate to the prospective manufacturers of airline electronic equipment the considered opinion of the airline technical people, coordinated on an industry basis, concerning requisites of new equipment, and\n(2)\nTo channel new equipment designs in a direction which can result in the maximum possible standardization of those physical and electrical characteristics which influence interchangeability of equipment without seriously hampering engineering initiative.",

    "The total system quality should include adequate ability for the operator to test and maintain the CMU Mark 2 effectively. The CMU Mark 2 designer should confer with the user to establish goals and guidelines for testability to minimize unnecessary removals. The use of advanced Built-In Test Equipment, ramp testing equipment, and adequate documentation should help the operators increase MTBUR.  For airline operations, MTBUR is at least as important, perhaps more so, than MTBF. Testability",
    "For airline operations, MTBUR is at least as important, perhaps more so, than MTBF. Testability should be such to identify the causes of repeat removals and eliminate the cause of unconfirmed faults. For shop maintainability, the design of physical access and functional partitioning of the CMU Mark 2 should be such to minimize repair time. Where possible, excessive unit disassembly should not be required for internal component replacement.",

    "1)\nWire Size",
    "The size (gauge) of wire selected for aircraft installations should be considered carefully.  Factors to be considered include current handling capacity, attenuation, insulation, weight, and flexibility.  Over the years, the airlines have reported a number of sad experiences with aircraft where small (less than #22 guage) wire was used.  Although the airlines are, of course, interested in the weight saving its use affords, they will quickly point out that these savings are rapidly nullified by",
    "saving its use affords, they will quickly point out that these savings are rapidly nullified by maintenance costs if frequent breakage ocurs.",
    "2)\nTwisted Shielded Wire\nDigital data bus shields should be grounded to the aircraft structure at both ends of the cable run.  Further, digital data bus shields should be grounded to the aircraft structure on both sides of each production break.\n\n3)\nGeneral Guidance\nAdditional installation guidance is provided in Section 2.0 of this document\n.\n\n## Rear Connector  Insert Layout",

    "## Appendix A The Cmu Mark 2 And Its Position In Cns/Atm Introduction",
    "CNS/ATM requires aircraft to have seamless Data Link Services and interoperable Applications (ground based and airborne).  The concept of the CMU Mark 2 is to provide Data Link service access to the on-board Data Link Applications through various subnetworks to their peer systems on the ground. Initially, the CMU Mark 2 will be a replacement of conventional ACARS MU's (724/724B) with growth in memory, processor, and I/O for future enhancements, protocols, applications and the ATN router using",
    "processor, and I/O for future enhancements, protocols, applications and the ATN router using peer to peer protocols.",
    "## The World Today",
    "The CMU Mark 2 will initially perform as an ACARS Management Unit (MU).  This provides the  channel through which all character based and bit-oriented applications are transmitted to and from the ground. VHF (AM-MSK at 2400 bps) and SATCOM are the two ACARS subnetworks available to date. HF, however, should join them soon as it is well into its proving trials. On the ground side, ARINC, SITA, Air Canada, Avicom, Mascom and other Data Service Providers (DSP) are currently involved in conveying",
    "Canada, Avicom, Mascom and other Data Service Providers (DSP) are currently involved in conveying and processing messages and providing the link to and from the peer system (ATC, airline host, maintenance base, etc.). Because ACARS is not a peer to peer network, like ATN, the CMU Mark 2 does not act like an entry point for a communication \"pipe\". It does subnetwork header switching/processing in order to adapt the on-board message structure to the one used for the air-to-ground link, to",
    "in order to adapt the on-board message structure to the one used for the air-to-ground link, to determine the most appropriate subnetwork based upon multiple criteria (availability or cost, just to name a few) or to distribute the messages on-board, when needed. In communications nomenclature, it acts more like a bridge than a router. On the ground side such conversions may also take place.",
    "## Appendix A (Cont'D) The Cmu Mark 2 And Its Position In Cns/Atm The World With Cns/Atm And Utilizing Atn\n\nThis is the environment the CMU Mark 2 has been designed to transition to. Internally, the CMU Mark 2 comprises not only the ACARS functions such as ARINC Specifications 618/619 protocols and AOC End System functions such as OOOI reports and others, but also - and foremost - the ATN router.  In some aircraft it may also host  ATC applications.",
    "This creates additional capability options within the CMU Mark 2 as follows:\n\n## A) Atn Router",
    "In the ATN Router configuration the CMU Mark 2 hosts the Open System Interconnection (OSI) Router, i.e. the Layer 3 suite of protocols (connectionless IS-ES, interdomain routing) and all the Layer 2 datalink protocols (ARINC",
    "Specifications 429 & 646) required to be linked to the on-board peripherals (FMC, CMC, ACMS, and others; (Figures A1 and A2) and subnetworks like VHF Data Radio (VDR), HF and SAT.  Consequently, any peripheral which uses the CMU Mark 2 as router acts as its own \"communication end system\" and thus has to contain the OSI communication stack required to support it's OSI application.  According to \"OSI theory\", this would be the most elegant system design. In short: Peripheral = Application End",
    "\"OSI theory\", this would be the most elegant system design. In short: Peripheral = Application End System AND Communication End System.",
    "## B) Atn End-System",
    "If the CMU Mark 2 hosts the ATN end-system it \"encapsulates\" the OSI communication and interfaces to the peripherals via a specialized transport layer (Layer 4) protocol. To perform this function the CMU Mark 2 contains the \"full\" OSI communication stack as required for the applications which reside in the peripherals as well as some of the router protocols (since there is no external IS to ES connection no s/w has to be installed in that area). Since the application end system (on-board peer)",
    "no s/w has to be installed in that area). Since the application end system (on-board peer) resides within the peripheral the file has to be forwarded.  Here, ARINC Specification 656 comes into play. It provides some sort of lean transport protocol which interfaces directly to the datalink layer, thus eliminating much of the burden OSI protocols would impose onto the peripheral. In short: Peripheral = Application End System; CMU Mark 2 = ATN Communication End System.",
    "## C) Peer Applications And Data Manager",
    "ATC End Systems applications for CNS/ATM were considered when growth potential was determined. If ATC applications reside within the CMU Mark 2, then data, parameters and the like need to be derived from those peripherals where they are gathered. In order to provide the service of requesting and delivering information between peripherals and the CMU Mark 2 an special application has to be installed at both ends: a Data Manager (DM).  Like in option b)",
    "there must be some sort of link between those peers of the DM.  Again, ARINC Specification 656 performs the transport. The impact to the peripheral has been kept minimal, the major share of the burden of the implementation of additional applications has been put onto the CMU Mark 2. In short: CMU Mark 2 = Application End System AND ATN Communication End System; Peripheral = Data Back-End.",
    "These three options have been collaboratively developed within the FMS, CMU Mark 2 and FMS/CMU Interface Subcommittees/Working Groups and are being documented primarily in ARINC Specification 656.  All of the various options may potentially be found in the variety of aircraft currently in service depending upon the capabilities of the LRU's involved. Consequently, the reader has  to be aware that the CMU Mark 2 Levels describe the actual capability and characteristics of the CMU Mark 2.",
    "The diagram below shows a possible configuration for shared Data/Voice use of an ARINC 716 VHF COM transceiver (or an ARINC 750 VHF COM Transciever operating in the ARINC 716 mode).  The transceiver is tuned to the channel selected on the VHF COM control panel for voice communications and to the channel defined in the CMU Mark 2 for data communications.  Voice operations using this transciever should typically only occur when VHF 1 or VHF 2 has failed.  The arrangements indicate that the CMU",
    "should typically only occur when VHF 1 or VHF 2 has failed.  The arrangements indicate that the CMU Mark 2, when installed, has ultimate control over the VHF radio frequency and mode.  To prevent downgrading the VHF radio certification level, it is recommended that the CMU Mark 2, protect the radio from interference due to a CMU Mark 2 malfunction.  This protection should be at level of integrity equal to, or higher than, the VHF radio (improbable failure rate). It may be noted that either or",
    "equal to, or higher than, the VHF radio (improbable failure rate). It may be noted that either or both CMU Mark 2 units may be removed from the aircraft without compromising the availability of the VHF transceiver for voice communications.",
