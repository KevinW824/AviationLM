    "## 1.2 System Overview",
    "The VDL Mode 2 system provides interconnectivity for data communications between aircraft and ground-based users.  The VDL Mode 2 A/G communications system architecture is defined to provide coverage similar to today's analog-based data communication system.  VDL Mode 2 is a digital packet data system using phase-shift modulation.  VDL Mode 2 provides a significant increase in capacity over the existing Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) currently in use by many",
    "existing Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) currently in use by many aircraft. VDL Mode 2 is designed to be a subnetwork of the ATN and is organized according to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model of the International Standards Organization (ISO).  Point-to-point data communications between the aircraft router and the ground ATN router are provided through the VDL Mode 2 system via the ISO 8208 network interface.  In addition to ISO 8208",
    "provided through the VDL Mode 2 system via the ISO 8208 network interface.  In addition to ISO 8208 communications, point-to-multi-point data communication is also provided as one-way data broadcast from the ground station to the aircraft stations. The VDL Mode 2 system is related to the three lower layers of the OSI model (illustrated in Figure 1-1) providing services described as follows:",
    " \nLayer 1 (Physical layer): provides transceiver frequency control, bit exchanges over the radio media, and notification functions. These functions are more often known as \"radio\" and \"modulation\" functions. \nRTCA DO-224C defines the VDL Mode 2 modulation as being a differentially encoded eight phase shift keying (D8PSK) modulation scheme providing a 31.5 kb/s bit rate (at layer 1).",
    " \nLayer 2 (Link Layer) is split into two sublayers and a management entity:",
    "The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer provides access to the Physical layer by a Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) algorithm. The Data Link Services (DLS) sublayer is composed of the Aviation VHF Link Control (AVLC) protocol derived from the High Level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol (ISO 3309).  The main functions of the AVLC protocol are frame exchanges, frame processing and error detection. The Link Management Entity (LME) manages link establishment between DLS peers.",
    "",
    "Layer 3: DO-224C defines only the Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAcP) sublayer, the lowest network sublayer of OSI layer 3. It is compliant with the Subnetwork sublayer requirements defined in the ATN SARPs and conforms to ISO 8208.  ISO 8208 is the network layer of the international X.25 standard published by International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T).  It provides packet exchanges over a virtual circuit, error recovery, connection flow control,",
    "It provides packet exchanges over a virtual circuit, error recovery, connection flow control, packet fragmentation and reassembly, and subnetwork connection management functions.",
    "This document focuses on the use of VDL Mode 2 as an ATN-compliant subnetwork using ISO 8208 as the SNAcP.  The specifics of the ISO 8208 protocol used for VDL Mode 2 are defined in DO-224C and the ICAO VDL Mode 2 Technical Manual.  Some implementations may provide non-ATN communications using some or all of the ATN protocol stack illustrated in Figure 1-1.  For example, the MAC sublayer can support either the ISO 8208 SNAcP defined in DO-224C or the commonly-used non-8208 protocol known as",
    "either the ISO 8208 SNAcP defined in DO-224C or the commonly-used non-8208 protocol known as ACARS over AVLC (AOA).  The specific SNAcP sublayer within this document does not exist in an AOA implementation.  This document does not include standards used for AOA.",
    "## 1.3 Possible Configuration Of Aircraft Equipment\n\nThis section describes two possible architectures that can provide VDL Mode 2 functionality to user aircraft.  Although not the only possible architectures, they are representative of the most common configurations expected in the marketplace.   \n\n## 1.3.1 Separated Equipment",
    "This section describes the case of the VDL functionalities disseminated in separated equipment as shown in Figure 1-2.  In this example, the VDL functionalities are distributed into the VHF Data Radio (VDR) and the Communication Management Unit (CMU). Requirements for equipment complying with either the VDR or CMU portions of the VDL Mode 2 functionality are specified within this document as being Class Y (VDR) and Class Z (CMU, ISO 8208), respectively.  Alternative non-ISO 8208 implementations",
    "Class Y (VDR) and Class Z (CMU, ISO 8208), respectively.  Alternative non-ISO 8208 implementations are identified as Class Y (VDR) and Class W (CMU, non-ISO 8208), respectively.  Detailed requirements for non-ISO 8208 SNAcP sublayers are not included in this document.  Throughout this document, Class Y and Class Z equipment are assumed to have the following configurations:",
    " \nClass Y equipment (VDR) includes the Physical layer, the MAC sublayer, and a function providing the data and management information transfer between the VDR and the CMU, including a small subset of the DLS functionality; \n \nClass Z equipment (CMU, ISO 8208) includes the SNAcP sublayer, the majority of the DLS sublayer, the LME entity and a function providing the data and management information transfer between the VDR and the CMU.",
    "Other equipment required for operation of a Class Y/Class Z configuration includes a VHF antenna, as illustrated in Figure 1-2.  A Class Y/Class Z architecture assumes that VDR control is performed through the CMU management functions.",
    "## 1.3.2 Integrated Equipment",
    "In the case of integrated equipment (shown in Figure 1-3), all VDL functions are integrated into a common physical unit of equipment dedicated to VDL services. Throughout this document this integrated architecture is referred to as either Class X (ISO 8208) or Class V (non-ISO 8208) equipment. Other equipment required for operation of a Class X configuration includes a VHF antenna, as illustrated in Figure 1-3.  A Class X architecture assumes that VDR control is performed through a dedicated",
    "in Figure 1-3.  A Class X architecture assumes that VDR control is performed through a dedicated VDL Mode 2 control head and management function, but does not dictate how these functions are implemented.",
    "## Figure 1-3: Integrated Class X Vdl Mode 2 Architecture 1.4 Operational Applications\n\nWhile operational applications will evolve with time, this document defines minimum standards to support implementation of anticipated applications.  The specific applications to be served can be classified under the following general categories: \n\n \nAir Traffic Control (ATC) communications; \n \nFlight Information Services (FIS) communications; \n \nAeronautical Operational Communications (AOC).",
    "## 1.5 Operational Goals\n\nThe operational goal of the VDL Mode 2 system is to provide enhanced data capabilities, including greater throughput and more efficient use of the available spectrum resources.   \n\n## 1.6 Equipment Performance Verification\n\nTo test the equipment for compliance with the performance requirements, four types of tests are specified.  These include:",
    " \nBench Tests \n \nEnvironmental Tests \n \nInstalled Equipment Tests \n \nOperational Tests \nThe performance requirements for each type of test and the corresponding test procedures are specified in this document.  The order of tests suggests that the avionics transceiver be subjected to a succession of tests as it moves from design into design validation, equipment qualification, and operation.  The objectives of these tests are described in the following subsections. \n\n## 1.6.1 Bench Tests",
    "The equipment will be subjected to bench tests to verify compliance with the performance requirements under controlled environment.  The test results may be used as the basis for approval of equipment design, equipment qualification, and acceptance.  The bench test procedures are specified in Section 2.4.  Wherever possible, common procedures are used for Class X and Class Z or Class X and Class Y equipment.  Where necessary, specific modifications of the tests are called out for each class of",
    "Y equipment.  Where necessary, specific modifications of the tests are called out for each class of equipment. A cross-reference of tests to equipment classes is included in Appendix B.",
    "## 1.6.2 Environmental Tests\n\nUpon successful completion of bench tests the equipment will be subject to environmental tests to verify compliance to the performance requirements under extreme environmental conditions expected in actual operations and abnormal conditions.  The test results may be applied to equipment qualification and acceptance.  The environmental tests are specified in Section 2.3. \n\n## 1.6.3 Installed Equipment Tests",
    "After successful completion of the environmental tests, the equipment will be installed in the aircraft for further testing to verify compliance with the performance specifications of Section 3 in the aircraft environment.  The installed equipment tests will be conducted primarily with the aircraft on the ground using simulated or operational system inputs and may be supplemented with flight tests.  The test results may be used to isolate design faults that are traceable to the general aircraft",
    "The test results may be used to isolate design faults that are traceable to the general aircraft environment, e.g., radio frequency interference (RFI) and the aircraft power supply system.  As in the case of bench and environmental tests, installed equipment tests are critical to equipment qualification and acceptance.  The installed equipment tests are specified in Section 3.",
    "## 1.6.4 Operational Tests\n\nAfter successful completion of the installed equipment tests, the equipment will be subject to operational tests conducted by operating personnel to ensure that the equipment, as a part of the overall A/G communications system, operates satisfactorily end-to-end in real operational environments.  The operational tests are specified in Section 4. \n\n## 1.7 Definitions Of Terms 1.7.1 Adjacent Channel",
    "## 1.7 Definitions Of Terms 1.7.1 Adjacent Channel\n\nIn VDL Mode 2, an adjacent channel is a channel that has a bandwidth of 25 kHz and whose frequency assignment is adjacent to that of a desired reference channel.  A first adjacent channel is a channel whose center frequency is 25 kHz above or below that of the desired VDL Mode 2 channel.  The nth adjacent channel is a channel whose center frequency is 25n kHz above or below that of the desired VDL Mode 2 channel.",
    "## 1.7.2 Adjacent Channel Power\n\nAdjacent channel power is the amount of radio frequency (RF) signal power that falls within a given adjacent channel.  Contributors to adjacent channel power include discrete spurious signals, signal sidebands, and noise density (including phase noise) at the transmitter output. \n\n## 1.7.3 Adjacent Channel Rejection (Acr)",
    "## 1.7.3 Adjacent Channel Rejection (Acr)\n\nACR corresponds to the receiver's ability to demodulate the desired signal and meet the BER requirement in the presence of an adjacent channel interfering signal which has a power level higher than the desired signal power level. The ACR ratio, expressed in decibels (dB), is the maximum power difference between the adjacent channel interfering signal and the desired signal that allows the specified BER performance to be met.",
    "## 1.7.4 Bit Error Rate (Ber)\n\nBER is expressed as the ratio of the number of erroneous bits received to the total number of bits received.  The uncorrected BER represents the BER without the benefit of Forward Error Correction (FEC).   \n\n## 1.7.5 Co-Channel Interference (Cci)\n\nCCI protection is the overall capability of a receiver to demodulate the desired signal and achieve the specified BER performance in the presence of an unwanted signal at the same assigned frequency.",
    "The CCI ratio is the power ratio between the desired signal and the unwanted signal and is expressed in decibels.  \n\n## 1.7.6 Error Vector Magnitude (Evm)\n\nError Vector Magnitude (EVM) is defined as the root mean square (rms) error in the in phase-quadrature phase (I-Q) vector magnitude measured at the ideal sampling points, expressed as a percentage.  Mathematically, this can be written as  \n\n$E\\!M=100\\cdot\\sqrt{\\left(\\Delta I^{2}+\\Delta Q^{2}\\right)/\\left(I^{2}+Q^{2}\\right)}$.",
    "$E\\!M=100\\cdot\\sqrt{\\left(\\Delta I^{2}+\\Delta Q^{2}\\right)/\\left(I^{2}+Q^{2}\\right)}$.\n\nAt the ideal sampling points, the I-Q values are on the unit circle so that \n1\n2\n2\n\nQ\nI\n, and  \n\n$$E V M=100\\cdot{\\sqrt{E y p e c t a t i o\\,n\\!\\left(\\Delta I^{2}+\\Delta Q^{2}\\right)}}.$$\nMethods that use more than one sample per symbol to determine EVM are acceptable, provided the measurements can be related to the definition above. \n\n## 1.7.7 Reference Signal Level",
    "## 1.7.7 Reference Signal Level\n\nThe reference signal level is the desired signal level used in the receiver performance specifications unless otherwise stated. \n\n## 1.7.8 Undesired Vdl Mode 2 Test Signal",
    "An undesired signal is a simulated VDL Mode 2 signal generated on a valid VDL Mode 2 frequency channel by means of a continuous wave signal frequency modulated by a 400 Hz tone at a peak frequency deviation of 5.25 kHz.   \nNote: This test signal represents an idealized VDL Mode 2 signal, with adjacent channel spectral characteristics that are significantly better than those permitted for a VDL Mode 2 transmitter that marginally meets the requirements of Section 2.2.1.3.7 of this MOPS.",
    "## 1.7.9 Reference Bit Sequence",
    "The maximum \"transmit\" period is determined by the maximum \"burst\" length permitted for VDL Mode 2 operation.  The maximum burst length is 4.16 seconds at the nominal symbol rate of 10,500 symbols/s. The minimum \"off\" period is determined by the transmitter \"power down\" time plus the \n\"channel idle\" detection time. According to ICAO SARPS, the minimum \"off\" period is \n3.1 ms.  \nThe maximum duty cycle is therefore 4.16 seconds in \"transmit\" mode followed by 3.1",
    "3.1 ms.  \nThe maximum duty cycle is therefore 4.16 seconds in \"transmit\" mode followed by 3.1 \nms \"off\". The reference bit sequence will not exceed 15 cycles.",

The VDL MASPS shows the message encoding process. As shown in that document, a transmission consists of from one to several concatenated AVLC frames, each with its own CRC.

An ARINC 750 [2] compliant radio will then perform CRC validation on each frame prior to sending that frame to the attached Communications Management Unit (CMU) through which air-ground communications take place.
