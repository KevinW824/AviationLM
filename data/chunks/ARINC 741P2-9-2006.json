The approach used in developing detailed test cases for link layer tests is to assume the existence in the unit under test of a function called the Upper Tester which resides at the top of the link layer and responds to stimuli received from a Lower Tester.

Each system has all of the equipment necessary (i.e., SDU, RFU, HPA, LNA/Diplexer, and antenna system) to function without the other. Each system may utilize either a low gain or high gain antenna system (i.e., the two systems may be identical or dissimilar -- various configurations are possible in different installations). Dual systems may",
    "or dissimilar -- various configurations are possible in different installations). Dual systems may provide backup redundancy for safety voice and data services, or additional cabin channel capability, or both. Additional external wiring and/or switching may be necessary to realize all of the benefits of a dual system. Due to the use of the ICAO 24-bit aircraft address for data link layer addressing (AES ID), and due to the general restriction of assigning only one such ICAO 24-bit aircraft",
    "(AES ID), and due to the general restriction of assigning only one such ICAO 24-bit aircraft address per aircraft, a typical dual SATCOM installation employs a Master/Slave relationship between the two systems, utilizing a single AES ID for channels handled by either system. The Master/Slave concept is further described in Section 4.8.2 below.",
    "## 4.8.1  Sdu #1/Sdu #2 Programming Pins\n\nWhen there are two SATCOM systems installed on an aircraft, one system is always designated as System #1, the other as System #2. SDU rear connector pin TP12E is strapped to indicate whether the SDU is stand-alone, or part of a dual installation. If part of a dual installation, SDU rear connector pin TP12F indicates whether that particular SDU is installed as part of System #1 or System #2. \n\n## 4.8.2  Master/Slave Definition",

    "## 3  Selected Network Layer Concepts\n\nThe ATN NSAP addressing plan is designed to satisfy the technical and organizational constraints of the international aeronautical environment, while maintaining conformance with certain ISO *Open Systems Interconnection* (OSI) \nNetwork Layer concepts and specifications. This section summarizes key Network Layer concepts which influence the design of an ISO NSAP address format. \n\n## 3.1  Aeronautical Data Communication Domain",
    "The collection of interconnected aeronautical *end-system* (ES), *intermediate-system*",
    "(IS) and *subnetwork* (SN) elements administered by international authorities for aeronautical data communication is denoted the Aeronautical Telecommunication Network. The ATN environment, or *domain*, encompasses all data communication service end-users associated with the international airspace, including Air Traffic Service (ATS) and *Airline Operational Control* (AOC) end-users, as well as General Aviation (GA) end users.

The ATN administrative domain is, thus, inherently international and inter-organizational, since aeronautical data communication spans both national and organizational boundaries.

The ATN domain is divided along these organizational boundaries into sub domains, or *areas*, in order to optimize routing of",
    "along these organizational boundaries into sub domains, or *areas*, in order to optimize routing of data communication traffic. ATN",
    "--```,,`,,,,````,`,``,``,`,`,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---",
    "## Aeronautical Data Network Addressing Plan\n\nAreas are administered by governmental and public/private aeronautical service providers, and are defined to be consistent with organizational boundaries. This allows retention of local control within existing administrations; additionally, this tends to recognize the likely boundaries of dense communication traffic patterns. \n\n## 3.2  Routing With The Atn Domain",
    "An ATN intermediate-system (referred to as an *ATN Router*, or ATNR) makes use of known subnetwork connectivity to perform routing of message traffic among aeronautical end-systems, possible involving one or more cooperating ATN routers. Routing decisions are based on connectivity information exchanged among routers and end-systems, used in conjunction with NSAP address and *quality of service*",
    "(QOS) information supplied by the originating end-user. ATN intra-domain routing is organized as a two-level hierarchy, in conformance with the ISO Network Layer routing architecture (see References [15] and [18]). The upper level of the hierarchy performs inter-Area routing, and is denoted *Level 2*. The lower level of the hierarchy performs routing between intermediate-systems within an Area, and is denoted *Level 1*. ATN Network Layer routing is thus performed as a two-phase process:",
    "1. Route the addressed message to the destination Area based on evaluation \nof the inter-Area portion of the NSAP address. This completes delivery of the message to a known point-of-entry into the destination Area. \n2. Route the addressed message to the destination host equipment, based on \nevaluation of the intra-Area portion of the NSAP address. This completes delivery of the message to the intended recipient host.",
    "The ATN NSAP address format is organized to support this two level routing architecture. The essential benefit of the *area routing* approach is that routing information transfer between Areas is minimized, thus reducing the amount of management overhead traffic carried by interconnecting subnetworks, and reducing the amount of routing information stored within each ATN router. A secondary benefit of this approach is that the Areas share less topology information, and thus preserve an",
    "benefit of this approach is that the Areas share less topology information, and thus preserve an additional degree of privacy. Since the Area boundaries observe natural organizational boundaries, this second benefit is often of equal importance to the first.",
    "## 3.3  Routing Through Non-Aeronautical Subnetworks",
    "Many communication paths between ATN ES and IS elements utilize subnetworks operated by aeronautical authorities; however, certain ATN ES and IS elements may be interconnected through one or more non-aeronautical subnetworks, such as those operated by *Post, Telephone and Telegraph* (PTT) or *Public Data Network*",
    "(PDN) authorities. Although the internal operations of the PTT or PDN subnetworks are outside the administrative domain of the aeronautical authorities, the Network Layer operations occur within ATN-administered routers located at the boundaries of these subnetworks. These Network Layer operations are thus regarded as part of the ATN domain.",

    "ARINC Characteristic 741 Part 2 has undergone major revisions both in format and technical content. The original document described avionics capable of operating in two different systems environments. These were identified as the Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) environment, in which the use of FDMA techniques predominated and the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) environment in which the TDMA techniques predominated. The format of the text of the original Part 2 was unique. When",
    "the TDMA techniques predominated. The format of the text of the original Part 2 was unique. When the material in the document applied equally to operations in both environments, it was located on the pages centrally between the left- and right-hand margins. When it applied only to operations in the  FDMA environment, it was located in the left-hand column on each page and each paragraph number carried the postscript F.

It was then extensively edited to be consistent with the RTCA Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and",
