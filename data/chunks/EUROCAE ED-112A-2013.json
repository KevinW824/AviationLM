    "## 1-1.3 Technical Background 1-1.3.1 Combined Recorders",
    "Investigators are opposed to a single combined recorder installed on large aircraft, as defined by regulation, because the loss of such a recorder would result in the complete loss of all information. Combined recorders can now conceivably record data, voice, data link and images, all in one box. Recent accident investigations have highlighted the need to consider two combined recorders, one installed near the cockpit and one installed towards the rear of the aeroplane for redundancy. A forward",
    "near the cockpit and one installed towards the rear of the aeroplane for redundancy. A forward mounted recorder has the advantage of shorter lines between the cockpit area microphone and boom microphones to the recorder, reducing the chance of the wires being breached during an in-flight fire or break-up. Traditional aft-mounted recorders maximize impact survivability. The use of two redundant, multi-function recorders installed in the forward and tail sections provides operational as well as",
    "multi-function recorders installed in the forward and tail sections provides operational as well as accident investigation benefits. The redundancy created by using two combined recorders increases the probability of recovering all of the information following an accident. Combined recorders would benefit the airlines by providing commonality of parts and test equipment, reduced technical training, and possible time extensions with respect to the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) because of the",
    "and possible time extensions with respect to the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) because of the redundancy.",
    "## 1-1.3.2 Audio Recordings Duration",
    "The 30-minute CVR recording capacity was predicated upon the technology available in the early 1960s; this was the amount of tape that could be crash-protected. Investigators are concerned that 30 minutes of recording time is no longer adequate to capture the initiating events and important background information to many accidents. For example, in accidents involving in-flight fire, the initiating events can develop over a period of time longer than 30 minutes. Longer CVR recording capacity",
    "events can develop over a period of time longer than 30 minutes. Longer CVR recording capacity also facilitates the investigation of non-catastrophic occurrences, occurrences in which current 30-minute recordings are often overwritten by the time the aircraft has safely stopped on the ground. Current technology easily accommodates increased CVR recording capacity. In fact, the majority of newly manufactured solid-state memory CVRs have a two-hour recording capacity, and there is a worldwide",
    "manufactured solid-state memory CVRs have a two-hour recording capacity, and there is a worldwide industry move towards two-hour CVRs. Some states have mandated that they be fitted to all aircraft manufactured after 1998 and are over 5700 kg. As a consequence of ICAO now requiring the investigation of serious incidents, the duration of CVR recordings could be extended to 10, 15 or 25 hours. This document adds three new classes of CVR for these durations.",
    "## 1-1.3.3 Alternate Power Source",
    "Power interruptions have resulted in flight recorder information not being captured during the last few seconds to as high as several minutes during recent major aircraft occurrences. This lack of recorded information has hampered the accident investigation. \"alternate\" means separate from the power source that normally provides power to the CVR.  The use of aeroplane batteries or other power sources are acceptable provided that the requirements above are met and electrical power to essential",
    "are acceptable provided that the requirements above are met and electrical power to essential and critical loads is not jeopardized. It is now feasible to power newtechnology (solid state) Cockpit Voice Recorder (and the cockpit area microphone) and Airborne Image Recorder (and the camera(s)) independently of normal recorder power for a specific period of time in the event that aircraft power sources to the recorder(s) are interrupted or lost. In modern aircraft, flight data and other data from",
    "to the recorder(s) are interrupted or lost. In modern aircraft, flight data and other data from multiple sources are used by the aircraft systems and by the flight crew to operate the aircraft. To record the required parameters, the FDR system monitors the data flowing through data buses. If electrical power to a particular sensor or data bus is lost, FDR information pertaining to that sensor or data bus will no longer be available. In the event of a total loss of electrical power, essentially",
    "data bus will no longer be available. In the event of a total loss of electrical power, essentially there would be no data to record. There may be merit in independently powering the FDR and its flight data acquisition unit in order to capture whatever data are available during partial electrical failures. However, as a minimum, the Cockpit Voice Recorder (and its cockpit area microphone) and the Airborne Image Recorder (and its camera(s)) should continue to be powered for short periods",
    "and the Airborne Image Recorder (and its camera(s)) should continue to be powered for short periods regardless of the availability of normal recorder electrical power. This alternate power source would allow the continued recording of the acoustic and image environment of the cockpit, for a specific period. The addition of a requirement and specifications for a 10 minute recorder independent power supply have therefore been introduced in this MOPS, predicated upon at least a two-hour duration",
    "supply have therefore been introduced in this MOPS, predicated upon at least a two-hour duration audio and image recording.",
    "## 1-1.3.4 Obsolete Technology",
    "Many operators are voluntarily replacing their old technology (tape) data and voice recorders with modern, solid-state recorders. The use of these new recorders not only serves safety but also benefits operators directly, as they avoid the high costs and technical problems associated with maintaining outdated old-technology recorders. Additionally, existing tape recorders no longer meet the most recent EASA/FAA Technical Standard Orders ((E)TSO) crash-worthiness standards, nor those specified",
    "recent EASA/FAA Technical Standard Orders ((E)TSO) crash-worthiness standards, nor those specified in this MOPS.",
    "## 1-1.3.5 Use Of Non-Mandatory Fdrs And Other Flight Recorders",
    "FDR early designs were such that it was very cumbersome to download the information for the investigation of minor incidents or for the purpose of monitoring the data on a regular basis for prevention and maintenance purposes, such as Flight Data Analysis Programs. Consequently, manufacturers developed 'Quick Access', 'Direct Access' and 'Maintenance' recorders. These recorders were typically a replaceable media, such as tape cartridge or optical disk, which could be quickly swapped out when",
    "replaceable media, such as tape cartridge or optical disk, which could be quickly swapped out when the aircraft landed. Over time, these voluntary systems began to record more information than the mandatory system. Accident investigators want to ensure that mandatory systems record as much information as practical. With today's solid state technology, significantly increased capacities, readily available data on the aircraft and affordable ground based wireless download capabilities, an",
    "available data on the aircraft and affordable ground based wireless download capabilities, an integrated crash-protected flight recording system which satisfies both accident investigators and operator's routine playback needs is highly desirable. It is recommended that industry provide operators with solutions that protect the core mandatory list while allowing for the operator to change the recorded data (e.g.: additional data, sample rates or resolutions) in the crash-protected recording",
    "recorded data (e.g.: additional data, sample rates or resolutions) in the crash-protected recording medium without requiring re-certification of the flight recording system. (Refer to EUROCAE ED-12B / RTCA DO-178B Section 2.4)",
    "As operators begin to use additional data to make operational and maintenance decisions, it is important that these parameters be properly recorded and that accident investigators have the same data set available in the aftermath of an accident. A significant additional benefit to using the data set recorded on the FDR for Flight Data Analysis Programs is that the probability that the FDR will be functional at the time of an accident is improved dramatically.",
    "## 1-1.3.6 Electronic Documentation Standard\n\nThis MOPS also contains reference to an acceptable means to exchange parameter configuration documentation between ground replay stations in order to facilitate timely playback of recorded data in engineering units. \n\n## 1-1.3.7 Units Of Measurement\n\nThe measurements are expressed, where appropriate, in SI units.

    "Speech encoding methods fall generally into two categories, waveform coders which attempt to exploit redundancy in the audio waveform and source modelled coders which assume that the audio is produced by human vocal tracts which can be modelled. There is a large variation of features for specific methods from both categories and, consequently, their performance. The following paragraphs discuss the considerations which are important to the fidelity of the recording. These considerations are not",
    "considerations which are important to the fidelity of the recording. These considerations are not all inclusive and are not intended to limit the application of new technology or techniques. Specific encoding methods should be evaluated on their ability to satisfy the requirements of this document.",
    "## I-B.2 Information Retrieval\n\nAll forms of encoding should be readily reversible so that as much information as possible can be recovered from an incomplete or corrupted recording. Methods which require large, complete, error free records of encoded data in order to successfully reconstruct the information should be avoided. \n\n## I-B.3 Effect Of Noise And Non-Speech Audio",
    "## I-B.3 Effect Of Noise And Non-Speech Audio\n\nThe selection of an encoding method should take account of the fact that all the recorded channels are likely to have considerable levels of noise and non-speech audio information (sounds). The performance of the recording system should be compatible with these sounds. The sounds should be reproduced with as much fidelity as possible. For this reason waveform coders are in general preferable to source modelled coders.",
    "## I-B.4 Determination Of Recording Medium Capacity\n\nIf variable rate encoding is used, the required duration of the recording shall be demonstrated for all foreseeable input conditions. That is to say, full recording time is met when the maximum expected amount of radio communications, crew conversations and cockpit noise is recorded. Careful attention shall be given to time correlation between channels. \n\n\n## Annex I-C Maintenance Practices I-C.1 General",
    "The maintenance tasks required to ensure the continued serviceability of the installed CVR system will depend on the extent of monitoring built into the CVR system. The installer shall perform an analysis of the CVR system to identify those parts of system which, if defective, would not be readily apparent to the flight crew or maintenance personnel. Appropriate inspections and functional checks, together with the intervals at which these would need to be performed, need to be established as",
    "together with the intervals at which these would need to be performed, need to be established as indicated by the analysis. The specified checks need to include verification of system performance, where appropriate. A flight recording should be replayed at specified intervals to reveal defective equipment and to indicate essential maintenance actions. Where a replay evaluation indicates an aircraft system defect, appropriate corrective action shall be initiated. Any inspection or test",
    "an aircraft system defect, appropriate corrective action shall be initiated. Any inspection or test requirements specified by equipment manufacturers shall be observed, e.g. battery checks of the underwater locator beacon. Maintenance and flight crew procedures should emphasise the need to preserve the recording following a reportable occurrence.",
    "## I-C.2 Recording Evaluation\n\nAn in-flight recording should be replayed and assessed for quality. ANNEX I-A provides guidance for the evaluation of such recordings. Cockpit Voice recorder systems should be considered unserviceable if the recording duration is less than required, if there is a period of poor quality audio or unintelligible audio/sounds. \n\n## I-C.3 Primary Maintenance Tasks",
    "## I-C.3 Primary Maintenance Tasks\n\nTable I-C.1 shows the primary maintenance tasks for the installed CVR system. Inspection periods should be established on the basis of the CVR system analysis discussed in paragraph I-C.1.",

    "## Ii-A.4 Recording Signed Parameters From Arinc 429 Words",
    "II-A.4.1 \nThere are examples where the range of a parameter in the standard ARINC 429 format far exceeds that needed for normal operations. Some bits at the most significant end can be discarded. If the parameter is signed (i.e. can take positive and",
    "negative values), a common practice is to extract the sign bit and the required value bits and join them together, with the sign at the most significant position. This is not only unnecessarily complicated but leads to confusing behaviour if the chosen range is exceeded. As an example, consider pitch attitude, represented in the standard angular form with bit 29 as the sign, and to be recorded as a 12-bit word.  \nII-A.4.2",
    "As an illustration, suppose that a range of ± 45 degrees is sufficient. A 12-bit word could be formed from bit 29 and bits 26 to 16, and provided the parameter remains within normal limits this will be quite satisfactory. But in two's complement notation the sign bit is repeated down into all value bits higher than those needed to represent the current parameter value. Thus it is possible, as an alternative method, to take bits 27 to 16 only using bit 27 as a sign bit and ignore bit 29. For",
    "an alternative method, to take bits 27 to 16 only using bit 27 as a sign bit and ignore bit 29. For pitch angles smaller than 45 degrees, in either sense, the form of the recorded word will be exactly the same as the form provided by the first method.",
    "II-A.4.3 \nNow consider the overflow case. Suppose the angle increases to exactly +45 degrees. Using the first method, bits 26 to 16 will go to zero; bit 29 (the sign) will remain at zero. So the recorded word will be zero, and the displayed readout value will jump from maximum positive to mid-range. As the parameter value continues to increase, the (false) positive readout value will increase also. \nII-A.4.4",
    "Using the alternative method, when overflow occurs, bits 26 to 16 will go to zero and bit 27 will go to one. The recorded word will jump from the maximum positive value to the maximum negative value, and as the angle continues to increase the (false) negative readout value will decrease in magnitude. This is full-range positive-tonegative wraparound, and in cases of rapidly changing value is less likely to be misunderstood than a half-range jump. This alternative method of sign bit usage is",
    "likely to be misunderstood than a half-range jump. This alternative method of sign bit usage is preferred to the first method described.",
    "## Ii-A.5 Asymmetrically Signed Parameters",
    "Signed parameters have been discussed in paragraph A-II.4 but with some parameters the signed ranges are asymmetric. There may be a large positive range but only a small negative range, e.g. altitude. If the value is treated as a simple two's \ncomplement signed number, such as would be extracted from an ARINC 429 word, nearly half the range will be wasted on impossible negative values which is wasteful of recording medium space. There are two ways of avoiding this: a.",
    "Add an offset equal to the maximum negative value before recording the parameter. This is then subtracted on data retrieval. The recorded value will then be unsigned. As an example, consider radio altitude; the range is from -20 to about +2600 feet. If a two's complement representation is used, a 12-bit word will give -2048 to +2047 ft for a count of 0 to 4095 at 1 ft resolution per count which is inadequate for the range required. With an offset added, zero could represent -20 ft. and the full",
    "inadequate for the range required. With an offset added, zero could represent -20 ft. and the full range is easily accommodated with no loss of resolution.",
    "b. \nRecord the signed parameter unchanged, but on data retrieval assume that values near the top of the recording range are negative. Using the radio altitude example again, the value can be tested against a suitable constant, say 4 000; if it is greater, subtract 4096. This gives a range of –95 to +4 000 feet at 1 ft resolution.",

Attention should be given to the source and nature of the recorded signal, whether analogue or digital.

    "Data compression is used in order that the recording medium capacity requirement of a recorder may be reduced. For accident data recorders, compression techniques should be carefully designed so that discontinuities of the data stream or data corruption do not prevent retrieval of the data from the recording medium. It should be noted that it is relatively straightforward in existing magnetic tape recorders to retrieve data terminating immediately prior to a period of corruption and",
    "tape recorders to retrieve data terminating immediately prior to a period of corruption and recommencing immediately after the period of corruption. For recorders with solid-state memory, with or without data compression, the objective should be to achieve an equivalent level of data retrieval. The following guidelines supplement CHAPTER II-3 and cover some of the features that an acceptable form of data compression would incorporate.",
    "These features are not all inclusive and are not intended to limit the application of new technology or techniques. The following paragraphs illustrate the type of features which are important to the retrieval of accident data. Specific data compression methods shall be evaluated on their ability to meet the intent of these key features. \n\n## Ii-C.2 Data Retrieval",
    "## Ii-C.2 Data Retrieval\n\nAll forms of data compression should be fully reversible. For reconstituted (or decompressed) data, it shall be demonstrated that there is no degradation or loss of accuracy, resolution, sample rates or timing correlation of the data when compared to the original input data. \n\n## Ii-C.3 Compression Characteristics\n\nThe following are considered to be desirable features of any compression technique.",
    "II-C.3.1 \nSynchronisation A unique synchronisation bit pattern should be recorded at intervals not exceeding 4 seconds. \nII-C.3.2",
    "II-C.3.2 \nReference Condition Where a compression technique records a variation from a reference condition, that reference condition should be recorded at pre-determined intervals of 300 seconds or less and within 16 seconds of recovery from each power interruption (refer also to paragraph II-3.2.1). Reference conditions should define the actual data value with full resolution and accuracy.",
    "II-C.3.3 \nVariable Length Frame Synchronisation When variable length frames are used, a technique should be employed which provides a positive indication of each frame length e.g. a count of the number of bits between synchronisation patterns.",
    "II-C.3.4 \nData and Recording Medium Organisation To comply with paragraph II-2.1.4c the organisation of the data in the recording medium shall minimise the loss of data in the event of memory device failure or damage. Should this loss occur during normal operation, the event should be indicated in the recorder BITE output. The memory devices should be reconfigured automatically where this is practicable. \n\n\n## Ii-C.4 Data Compression Of Discrete Parameters",
    "There are various means of data compression; many of them using the principle that a new value of each parameter will be recorded only when there is a significant change. The definition of a significant change varies between parameters; if the threshold is taken as zero counts, any change at all will cause a new value to be recorded, and the data will be fully recoverable.

If the traditional approach is retained, that is to use 10-bit words with a pair of discrete values in the least significant positions, the data compression technique can be applied to the full 12 bit word only if a threshold of zero is used. Otherwise, changes in the discrete states will be lost. This means that the 10-bit",
    "of zero is used. Otherwise, changes in the discrete states will be lost. This means that the 10-bit parameter value will have also a zero threshold, which may be inappropriate. Alternatively, the data compression algorithms may distinguish between different word lengths, but this will make them more complex. A possible solution is to put the discretes at the most significant end of the word; then any discrete change will be seen as a large value change, and any suitable threshold can be chosen",
    "any discrete change will be seen as a large value change, and any suitable threshold can be chosen for the 10 bit word.

    "## Ii-C.5 Effect Of Defective Sensors\n\nThe compression algorithm will become Inefficient when a defective sensor (e.g. a worn position transducer) generates a noisy signal.

    "The viability of an aircraft type is seriously threatened when the cause of an accident involving the type cannot be determined in the recovery of recorders from crash sites and in the subsequent analysis of the recordings. Close attention should be given therefore, to the reliability of the recording function. This consideration applies both to maintenance tasks and to recorder and installation design. For maintenance tasks refer also to ANNEX IV-B.",

For complete text of the overall systems requirements and message types to be recorded refer to Minimum Aviation System Performance Specification for CNS/ATM Recorder Systems (ED-93): a.",
    "All communications to and from the flight crew shall be recorded on the aircraft in order to develop a thorough understanding of the working environment of the cockpit. This is of fundamental importance to accident investigation.",
    "b. \nIn the same way that traditional audio recording has enabled investigators to determine if radio communications systems were overall functioning as required, the airborne recording of digital communications will help to determine the end-to-end functioning of the data link system. \nc.",
    "c. \nIncreased reliance will be placed on digital messaging to ensure safe operation in an environment where separations will be significantly reduced and profiles flown will be assumed to be much more precise. Much of this information may not involve the flight crew or controller and messages may be addressed directly to and from the aircraft's systems. The recording of such information will prove valuable. \nd.",
    "d. \nGround based recording will involve many stations and locations around the world. An effective means of ensuring that the information is readily available to an accident investigation is to record as much of it, as practical on board the aircraft. \ne. \nRecording on the ground is required in order to correlate the transmitted and received messages and to investigate periods beyond the duration of the airborne recording. Part of this reason is to be able to understand the role of air",
    "traffic control in the occurrence, and to be able to understand the interactions between ground stations, other aircraft, and other agencies. \nTo meet the operational goals, there are two main issues each of which require consideration in terms of both airborne and ground recording: a. \nRecording of digital communications to and from the flight crew. This includes those messages that would have traditionally been passed by voice means. \nb.",

    "The recorder shall have adequate capacity to record all required data link messages during the most recent time period at least equal to the recording duration required for the CVR.  \nNOTE 1: \nFuture technology may require alternate bus transfer speeds and larger recording medium capacity. This should be taken into account in the design of the recorder system. \nNOTE 2:",
    "NOTE 2: \nAs the data link message recording is an event type recording (opposed to sequence method as is the case for the audio recorder system), there is no fixed relationship between the recording medium capacity and the duration of the recording.",
    "However in some circumstances, the data link message traffic may exceed the limit defined, and consequently the recording duration may be insufficient regarding the recording medium size defined. Paragraph IV-3.2.6 gives a standard method to calculate the amount of recording medium required. Memory chip or recording capacity failure during normal recording shall be tolerated until the total recording medium capacity falls below the required duration. When the recording capacity threshold is",
    "medium capacity falls below the required duration. When the recording capacity threshold is crossed a BIT fault should be recorded in recording medium, but the recorder should continue to record until power is removed.",
