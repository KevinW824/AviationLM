Bi-directional data flow on a given twisted and shielded pair of wires is not permitted.",

    "numeric data transmission characteristics have been developed from those of successful predecessor air transport industry digital information transfer systems.  Data for transmission, encoded in either twos complement fractional binary notation or binary coded decimal notation, is supplied from source systems at rates sufficiently high to ensure small incremental value changes between updates.

    "is made \"open loop\", i.e., sinks are not required to inform sources that information has been received.  A parity bit is transmitted as part of each data word to permit simple error checks to be performed by the sinks.  These, together with data reasonableness checks which may also be performed by the sinks, may be used to prevent the display or other utilization of a erroneous or suspect word.  The inherently high integrity of the twisted and shielded wire transmission medium ensures that such",
    "inherently high integrity of the twisted and shielded wire transmission medium ensures that such drop-outs are few.  The low rates of change of the data ensure that when one does occur, it is of no consequence.",
    "1.4.2  ISO Alphabet No. 5 Data Transfer In addition to the transfer of BNR and BCD numeric data as just described, the Mark 33 DITS handles alpha and numeric data encoded per ISO Alphabet No. 5.  The same \"broadcast\" transmission philosophy is used, although the \"housekeeping\" aspects of system operation differ in order to accommodate particular needs associated with this type of data.  These differences will be addressed individually in this document as they arise.",
    "1.4.3  Graphic Data Transfer A third type of data which may eventually be handled by the Mark 33 DITS is graphic data, i.e., the lines, circles, randomly positioned alpha/numeric text and other symbols used on CRT map and similar displays.  The technique employed for this purpose can be basically similar to that used for ISO Alphabet No. 5 alpha/numeric data transfer. However, because a need for graphic data handling capability has not yet emerged, the air transport industry has decided not to",

The interval for transmission of parameters should fall between the minimum and maximum specified intervals and nominally should be near the center of the range at equal intervals between transmissions.  When heavy bus loading dictates a shift from the center of the range, the shift should be toward the maximum transmit interval.",

The airlines considered adopting MIL STD 1553, or something like it, for use on post-1980 new civil aircraft types but found the multiplex technique to be inappropriate for such applications.

Thus there",

Thus there is no need for the data transfer system to provide the capability for every unit of every avionics system to both talk and listen to every other unit.

Another development in this same time frame has been the increased use by the military, particularly in transport aircraft, of avionics equipment",
    "been the increased use by the military, particularly in transport aircraft, of avionics equipment designed originally for the airlines. This trend may be expected to continue and so give rise to the need to interface equipment providing Mark 33 DITS I/0 capability with a MIL STD 1553A data bus system.

Some systems which use sampled data, such as closed loop control systems, have a bandwidth which is much smaller than that of the sampling filter.  For this reason it is important to verify that the signal and noise power which is aliased into the frequency band of interest is well below the inherent noise in that band.",

Bit no. 32 is assigned to parity, bit nos. 31 and 30 to the sign/status matrix, bit no. 29 is the most significant bit of the data field, and the maximum decimal value of the most significant character is 7.  Previously, the BCD word contained no parity bit, the sign/status matrix",

Previously, the BCD word contained no parity bit, the sign/status matrix occupied bit nos. 32 and 31, bit no. 30 was the most significant data bit and the maximum decimal value of the most significant character was 3. This format made the word 8-bit byte oriented with respect to the data.  This characteristic is not retained in the Mark 33 system. Also, the Mark 33 BCD word will not accommodate latitude and longitude to the formerly specified resolution of 0.1 minute of arc.",

    "Restructuring involves limiting the maximum decimal value of the most significant character to 1, moving the remaining BCD characters towards the MSB by two bit positions and using bit nos. 9 and 10 for data instead of reserving them for source/destination identification encoding per Section 2.1.4 of this document.  It is probable, however, that future latitude and longitude displays will not be the simple, dedicated read-out type for which BCD data is intended.  More likely is the use of some",

    "COMMENTARY \n \nNote that Section 2.3.1.1 of this document calls for numeric data to be encoded in BCD and binary, the latter using two's complement fractional notation. In this notation, the most significant bit of the data filed represents one half of the maximum value chosen for the parameter being defined.",
    "Successive bits represents the increments of a binary fraction series.  Negative number are encoded as the complements of positive values and the negative sign is annunciated in the sign/status matrix.",
    "In establishing a given parameter's binary data standards for inclusion in Attachment 2, the units, maximum value and resolution of the parameter are first determined in that order.  The least significant bit of the word is then given a value equal to the resolution increment, and the number of significant bits is chosen such that the maximum value of the fractional binary series just exceeds the maximum value of the parameter, i.e., equals the next whole binary number greater than the maximum",
    "maximum value of the parameter, i.e., equals the next whole binary number greater than the maximum parameter value less one least significant bit value.  For example, if the Mark 33 DITS is required to transfer altitude in units of feet over a range of zero to 100,000 feet with a resolution of one foot, the number of significant bits is 17 and the maximum value of the fractional binary series is 131,071 (i.e., 131,071 - 1).  Note that because accuracy is a quality of the measurement process and",
    "(i.e., 131,071 - 1).  Note that because accuracy is a quality of the measurement process and not the data transfer process, it plays no part in the selection of word characteristics.  Obviously, the resolution provided in the DITS word should equal or exceed the accuracy in order not to degrade it.",
    "For the binary representation of angular data, the Mark 33 DITS employs \"degrees divided by 180o\" \nas the unit  of data transfer and ± 1 (semicircle) as the range for two's complement fractional notation encoding ignoring, for the moment, the subtraction of the least significant bit value.  Thus the angular range 0 through 359.XXX degrees is encoded as 0 \nthrough ± 179.XXX degrees, the value of the most significant bit is none half semicircle and there are no discontinuities in the code.",
    "For convenience, all binary word ranges in Attachment 2 are shown as whole binary numbers rather than such numbers less one least significant bit value.  Also the resolutions shown are approximate only.  Accurate resolutions can be determined, if required, by reference to the range values and numbers of significant bits for the words of interest.",

    "Attachment 1 defines 256 discrete label codes. This quantity is expected to meet label assignment needs for the foreseeable future.  Should additional labeling capability be required in the longer term, it is envisaged that, rather than extend the length of the label field, a scheme will be devised in which existing label assignments are duplicated.

    "parameters set forth in this Section of  this document, the pulse distortion likely to be  \nencountered in systems built around them in existing size commercial aircraft was evaluated and judged to be acceptable for a well-designed receiver.  No restriction is placed by this specification, therefore, on the number or length of stubs for installations on aircraft no larger than those existing, e.g., B 747.  See Appendix 1 to this document for a report of this investigation.",
    "Tests have shown that some receivers continue decoding data properly when one side of the transmission line is open or shorted to ground. When this condition exists noise immunity decreases and intermittent operation may occur. Users desire protection against non-annunciated system operation in this mode.  This protection may consist of additional circuitry to detect and annunciate the fault. \n2.2.3.2  RECEIVER VOLTAGE LEVELS Normal voltage ranges changed due to impedance changes.",

    "ARINC Industry Activities Projects and Work Program A project is established in order to accomplish a technical task approved by one or more of the committees (AEEC, AMC, FSEMC) Projects generally but not exclusively result in a new ARINC standard or modify an existing ARINC standard. All projects are typically approved on a calendar year basis.  Any project extending beyond a single year will be reviewed annually before being reauthorized. The work program of Industry Activities (IA) consists",
    "reviewed annually before being reauthorized. The work program of Industry Activities (IA) consists of all projects authorized by AEEC, AMC, or FSEMC (The Committees) for the current calendar year. The Committees establish a project after consideration of an ARINC Project Initiation/Modification (APIM) request. This document includes a template which has provisions for all of the information required by The Committees to determine the relative priority of the project in relation to the entire",
    "by The Committees to determine the relative priority of the project in relation to the entire work program. All recommendations to the committees to establish or reauthorize a project, whether originated by an airline or from the industry, should be prepared using the APIM template.  Any field that cannot be filled in by the originator may be left blank for subsequent action.",
    "## 2. Normal Apim Evaluation Process Initiation Of An Apim\n\nAll proposed projects must be formally initiated by filling in the APIM template. An APIM may be initiated by anyone in the airline community, e.g., airline, vendor, committee staff. \n\n## Staff Support",
    "All proposed APIMs will be processed by committee staff.  Each proposal will be numbered, logged, and evaluated for completeness.  Proposals may be edited to present a style consistent with the committee evaluation process.  For example, narrative sentences may be changed to bullet items, etc. When an APIM is complete, it will be forwarded to the appropriate Committee for evaluation. The committee staff will track all ongoing projects and prepare annual reports on progress.",
    "## Committee Evaluation And Acceptance Or Rejection\n\nThe annual work program for each Committee is normally established at its annual meeting.  Additional work tasks may be evaluated at other meetings held during the year.  Each committee (i.e., AMC, AEEC, FSEMC) has its own schedule of annual and interim meetings.",
    "The committee staff will endeavor to process APIMs and present them to the appropriate Committee at its next available meeting.  The Committee will then evaluate the proposal.  Evaluation criteria will include: \n- Airline support - number and strength of airline support for the project, \nincluding whether or not an airline chairman has been identified \n- Issues - what technical, programmatic, or competitive issues are \naddressed by the project, what problem will be solved",
    "addressed by the project, what problem will be solved \n- Schedule - what regulatory, aircraft development or modification, \nairline equipment upgrade, or other projected events drive the urgency for this project  \nAccepted proposals will be assigned to a subcommittee for action with one of two priorities:  \n- High Priority - technical solution needed as rapidly as possible - Routine Priority - technical solution to proceed at a normal pace",
    "Proposals may have designated coordination with other groups.  This means that the final work must be coordinated with the designated group(s) prior to submittal for adoption consideration. Proposals that are not accepted may be classified as follows: \n- Deferred for later consideration - the project is not deemed of sufficient \nurgency to be placed on the current calendar of activities but will be reconsidered at a later date",
    "- Deferred to a subcommittee for refinement - the subcommittee will be \nrequested to, for example, gain stronger airline support or resolve \narchitectural issues \n- Rejected - the proposal is not seen as being appropriate, e.g., out of \nscope of the committee   \n3.",
    "APIM Template  \nThe following is an annotated outline for the APIM.  Proposal initiators are requested to fill in all fields as completely as possible, replacing the italicized explanations in each section with information as available. Fields that cannot be completed may be left blank.  When using the Word file version of the following template, update the header and footer to identify the project. \n\n--``,,,````,,,,`,````,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---",

If no such group is known to exist, a recommendation to form a new \ngroup may be made.  \n\n## Project Scope",
    "## Project Scope\n\nDescribe the scope of the project clearly and concisely.  The scope should describe \"what\" will be done, i.e., the technical boundaries of the project. \n\nExample: \"This project will standardize a protocol for the control of printers.  \nThe protocol will be independent of the underlying data stream or page description language but will be usable by all classes of printers.\" \n\n## Project Benefit",
    "Describe the purpose and benefit of the project.  This section should describe",
    "\"why\" the project should be done. Describe how the new standard will improve competition among vendors, giving airlines freedom of choice. This section provides justification for the allocation of both IA and airline resources. Example: \"Currently each class of printers implements its own proprietary protocol for the transfer of a print job.  In order to provide access to the cockpit printer from several different avionics sources, a single protocol is needed. The protocol will permit automatic",
