    "Definitions essential to proper understanding of this document are also provided in Section 1.0. \n\nSection 2.0 contains the minimum performance standards for the equipment. \n\nThese standards define the required performance under standard operating conditions and stressed physical environmental conditions. \n\nIt also details the recommended bench test procedures necessary to demonstrate compliance. \n\nSection 3.0 describes the performance required of the installed equipment.",
    "Section 3.0 describes the performance required of the installed equipment. \n\nTests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing. \n\nSection 4.0 describes the operational characteristics for equipment installations and defines conditions that will assure the operator that operations can be conducted safely and reliably in the expected operational environment.",
    "Compliance with these standards by manufacturers, installers and users is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will satiSfactorily perform its intended functionCsl under all conditions normally encountered in routine operations. \n\nIt is recognized that any regulatory application of this document in whole, or in part, is the sole responsibility of appropriate governmental agencies.",

    "In the establishment of the optional equipment standards, the inclusion of color was not considered to be a minimum requirement for the radar display element on which the non-radar derived data is being displayed. \n\nHowever, it was recognized that the state of the art of both technology and product devalopment is such that many radar displays may, either now or in the future, include color capability.",
    "In this regard, for those equipments that do provide color displays, it was considered critical in RTCA/DO-173, \"Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Airborne Weather ,md Ground Mapping Pulsed Radars,\" that the color characteristics of the radar-derived data be precisely defined with attendant minimum performance requirements and test procedures for verification of performance. \n\nAppendix A to DO-173 covers this situation.",

    "When displayed with radar-derived data, the auxiliary information shall not degrade displayed radar information. \n\n## Test Procedures\n\n1.3 \nThe test procedures and associated limits specified throughout this document are intended to be used as one means of demonstrating compliance with the minimum acceptable performance parameters. \n\nAlthough specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be preferred by the test ac tivity.",

    "For example, compliance with the requirements of Section 2.0 should. have been demonstrated as a precondition to satisfactory completion of the installed system tests of Section 3.0. \n\nFour types of test procedures are included which should be used at different stages in the equipment life cycle. \n\nThese are discussed in the following paragraphs. \n\n## Environmental Tests\n\n1. \n3.1 \nEnvironmental tests are specified in Subsection 2.3.",

    "Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance, in preparation of installation instructions and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture. \n\n## Bench Tests\n\n1.3.2 \nBench test procedures are specified in Subsection 2.4. \n\nThese tests are conducted at the equipment level and are intended to provide a laboratory means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of Subsections 2.1 and 2.2.",

    "Although bench and environmental test procedures are not included in the installed system tests, their successful completion is a precondition to completion of the installed tests. \n\nIn certain instances, however, installed system tests may be used in lieu of bench test simulation of such factors as power supply characteristics, interference from or to_ other equipment installed on the aircraft, etc. \n\nInstalled tests are normally performed under two conditions:",
    "Installed tests are normally performed under two conditions: \n\na. \nWith the aircraft on the ground and using simulated \nor operational system inputs. \nb. \nWith the aircraft in flight using operational system \nsignals appropriate to the equipment under test. \nTest results may be used to demonstrate functional perfiirmance in the environment in which the equipment is intended to operate.",
    "In addition, the ground test. procedures may be used as an optional check of equipment performance following corrective maintenance. \n\n## 1.3.4 Operational Tests\n\nThe operational tests are specified in Section 4.0. \n\nThese test procedures and their associated limits are intended to be conducted by operating personnel as one means of ensuring that the equipment is functioning properly and can be reliably used for its intended function. \n\n## 1.4 Definitions",
