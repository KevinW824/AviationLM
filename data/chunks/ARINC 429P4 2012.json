    "ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS To permit the use of common hardware elements for the transmission of BNR and BCD numeric data, the format for the Mark 33 DITS BCD word differs from that used formerly for this type of data.  Bit no. 32 is assigned to parity, bit nos. 31 and 30 to the sign/status matrix, bit no. 29 is the most significant bit of the data field, and the maximum decimal value of the most significant character is 7.  Previously, the BCD word contained no parity bit, the sign/status matrix",
    "character is 7.  Previously, the BCD word contained no parity bit, the sign/status matrix occupied bit nos. 32 and 31, bit no. 30 was the most significant data bit and the maximum decimal value of the most significant character was 3. This format made the word 8-bit byte oriented with respect to the data.  This characteristic is not retained in the Mark 33 system. Also, the Mark 33 BCD word will not accommodate latitude and longitude to the formerly specified resolution of 0.1 minute of arc.",
    "not accommodate latitude and longitude to the formerly specified resolution of 0.1 minute of arc.  If BCD transmission of these quantities in required, either the resolution must be decreased or the word must be restructured.",
    "Restructuring involves limiting the maximum decimal value of the most significant character to 1, moving the remaining BCD characters towards the MSB by two bit positions and using bit nos. 9 and 10 for data instead of reserving them for source/destination identification encoding per Section 2.1.4 of this document.  It is probable, however, that future latitude and longitude displays will not be the simple, dedicated read-out type for which BCD data is intended.  More likely is the use of some",
    "the simple, dedicated read-out type for which BCD data is intended.  More likely is the use of some form of multiple-message display, such as a CRT, which will be backed by its own data processor and prefer inputs of BNR data.  If this proves to be the case, there will be no problem!",
    "2.1.3  Information Identifier Text expanded to explain differing roles of label codes in numeric (BCD/BNR) and alpha/numeric (ISO Alphabet No. 5) data transfer.  \"Special Note\" added. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS The first eight bits of each word are assigned to a label function so that the data contained in the word may be identified.  Label code assignments are set forth in the table of Attachment 1 to this document.",
    "2.1.4  Source/Destination Identifier Section modified to indicate that bit nos. 9 & 10 are not available for the SDI function in DITS words employed for graphic and ISO Alphabet No. 5 data transfer, or in BNR/BCD words in which bit nos. 9 and 10 are needed for valid data in order to achieve the desired resolution. Code table revised and function application more fully described.  Consequential revisions to Commentary.",
    "ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS Bit nos. 9 & 10 of the word should be reserved for a data source/destination identification function.  This function may find application when specific words need to be directed to a specific system of a multi-system installation or when the source system of a multi-system installation needs to be recognizable from the word content.  When the source/destination identifier function is used, bit nos. 9 & 10 should be encoded as follows.  When it is not used, binary zeros or",

    "In many applications of the Mark 33 DITS, data source/destination identification will not be needed. In these cases, bits 9 & 10 will be used as pad bits for valid data.  In certain other applications of the system, for example, BCD latitude and longitude encoding (if needed - see Commentary following Section 2.1.2 of this document), the need to use bit nos. 9 and 10 to obtain adequate data resolution will preclude source/destination identification in this way.",
    "Note that this document does not address the practical question of how these bits will be set in those multi-system installations in which the source/destination identification function is desired. One way would be to use program pins on individual system black boxes which would be wired to set up the appropriate code.  The ARINC Characteristics devoted to the individual systems will define the method actually to be used.",

    "Note that Section 2.3.1.1 of this document calls for numeric data to be encoded in BCD and binary, the latter using two's complement fractional notation. In this notation, the most significant bit of the data filed represents one half of the maximum value chosen for the parameter being defined.",
    "Successive bits represents the increments of a binary fraction series.  Negative number are encoded as the complements of positive values and the negative sign is annunciated in the sign/status matrix.",
    "In establishing a given parameter's binary data standards for inclusion in Attachment 2, the units, maximum value and resolution of the parameter are first determined in that order.  The least significant bit of the word is then given a value equal to the resolution increment, and the number of significant bits is chosen such that the maximum value of the fractional binary series just exceeds the maximum value of the parameter, i.e., equals the next whole binary number greater than the maximum",
    "maximum value of the parameter, i.e., equals the next whole binary number greater than the maximum parameter value less one least significant bit value.  For example, if the Mark 33 DITS is required to transfer altitude in units of feet over a range of zero to 100,000 feet with a resolution of one foot, the number of significant bits is 17 and the maximum value of the fractional binary series is 131,071 (i.e., 131,071 - 1).  Note that because accuracy is a quality of the measurement process and",
    "(i.e., 131,071 - 1).  Note that because accuracy is a quality of the measurement process and not the data transfer process, it plays no part in the selection of word characteristics.  Obviously, the resolution provided in the DITS word should equal or exceed the accuracy in order not to degrade it.",
    "## \n\nFor the binary representation of angular data, the Mark 33 DITS employs \"degrees divided by 180o\" \nas the unit  of data transfer and ± 1 (semicircle) as the range for two's complement fractional notation encoding ignoring, for the moment, the subtraction of the least significant bit value.  Thus the angular range 0 through 359.XXX degrees is encoded as 0 through ± 179.XXX degrees, the value of the most significant bit is none half semicircle and there are no discontinuities in the code.",
    "For convenience, all binary word ranges in Attachment 2 are shown as whole binary numbers rather than such numbers less one least significant bit value.  Also the resolutions shown are approximate only.  Accurate resolutions can be determined, if required, by reference to the range values and numbers of significant bits for the words of interest. \n\n \n\n## 2.1.6 Data Standards (Cont'D) Commentary (Cont'D)",

    "File data will consist of both ARINC 429 BNR numeric words and ISO alphabet No. 5 characters.  A file may contain from 1 to 127 records.  Each record may contain from 1 to 126 data words. A record will contain, at the minimum, one of the eight versions of the \"initial word\" described in Section 2.3.1.5.2.

    "1 to 126 \"intermediate words\" (data) and a \"final word\" (error control).  The file data transfer protocol is as follows. A transmitter having the data to send to a receiver transmits, on the bus connecting it to that receiver, the \"Request to Send\" initial word.  The receiver responds, on the separate bus provided for return data flow, with the \"Clear to Send\" reply.  The transmitter then sends the \"Data Follows\" initial word, the \"intermediate words\" and the \"final word\".  The receiver",
    "sends the \"Data Follows\" initial word, the \"intermediate words\" and the \"final word\".  The receiver processes the error control information in the \"final word\" and, if no errors are revealed, closes out the transaction by",
    "sending the \"Data Received OK\" word to the transmitter. If the receiver is not ready to accept data when the transmitter sends its \"Request to Send\" word, it will so indicate in its response (see Section 2.3.1.5.2).  The transmitter should then wait 200 milliseconds and retransmit the \"Request to Send\".  The transmitter should also repeat a \"Request to Send\" transmission 50 milliseconds after the initial transmission if no response is obtained from the receiver.  An alert should be raised in",
    "initial transmission if no response is obtained from the receiver.  An alert should be raised in the system containing the transmitter if 4 attempts to obtain a \"Clear to Send\" response from a receiver are unsuccessful. If the receiver detects a parity error during the transmission, it may request an error-correcting retransmission by sending a \"Data Received Not OK\" word to the transmitter in which is identified the record in which the error occurred.  The transmitter will interrupt the data",
    "is identified the record in which the error occurred.  The transmitter will interrupt the data flow and back up to the start of the record so identified.  It will then send a \"Data Follows\" initial word identifying this record as the starting point of the retransmission and recommence its output of data, continuing through the \"final word\".  The receiver will then close out the transaction as before. An error detected by processing the error control information in the \"final word\" will also",
    "before. An error detected by processing the error control information in the \"final word\" will also result in the receiver sending a \"Data Received Not OK\" word to the transmitter.  In the absence of identification of the record in which the error occurred, this word should contain the sequence number of the first record of the file.  The transmitter's response will be to retransmit the whole file. The receiver can signal loss of synchronization to the transmitter at any time by sending the",
    "\"Synchronization Lost\" initial word.  On receiving this word the transmitter should curtail the data flow and back up to the beginning of the file.  It should then reestablish that the receiver can accept data by going through the request-to-send/clear-to-send routine.  \nHaving done this it should send the \"Data Follows\" initial word, followed by the data and the \"final word\".",
    "The protocol also allows a transmitter to send file size information to a receiver without any commitment to send, or request to the receiver to accept, the file itself. The \"Header Information\" initial word is used for this purpose.  Additionally, a \"Poll\" initial word is defined for use in system in which continuous \"handshaking\" between two terminals is desired.  The response to a \"Poll\" word will be either a \"Request to Send\" initial word when the polled terminal does have data to transmit,",

    "2.2.1  TRANSMISSION SYSTEM INTERCONNECT Text revised for break connections. Text added to Commentary describing increase of voltage threshold. \n\n \nORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: \n2.2.1  Transmission System Interconnect A data source should be connected to the data sink(s) by means of a single twisted and shielded pair of wires. The shields should be grounded at both ends and at all production breaks in the cable to an aircraft ground close to the rack connector.",
    "In practical wire line digital information transmission systems, cable characteristics and electrical mismatches can produce distortion of the digital data pulses.  Also, noise due to electrical interference perturbs digital signals. \n\n \nThe performance of a digital receiver depends upon the receiver input signal characteristics (data with distortion and noise) and the receiver design.",
    "Prior to the selection of the voltage and impedance \nparameters set forth in this Section of  this document, the pulse distortion likely to be  \nencountered in systems built around them in  \nexisting size commercial aircraft was evaluated and judged to be acceptable for a well-designed",
    "existing size commercial aircraft was evaluated and judged to be acceptable for a well-designed \nreceiver.  No restriction is placed by this specification, therefore, on the number or length of stubs for installations on aircraft no larger than those existing, e.g., B 747.  See Appendix 1 to this document for a report of this investigation.",
    "Tests have shown that some receivers continue decoding data properly when one side of the transmission line is open or shorted to ground. When this condition exists noise immunity decreases and intermittent operation may occur. Users desire protection against non-annunciated system operation in this mode.  This protection may consist of additional circuitry to detect and annunciate the fault.",
    "2.2.3.2  RECEIVER VOLTAGE LEVELS Normal voltage ranges changed due to impedance changes. ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: 2.2.3.2  Receiver Voltage Levels The differential voltage presented at the receiver input terminals will be dependent upon line length, stub configuration and the number of receivers connected. In the absence of noise, the normal ranges of voltages presented to the receiver terminals (A and B) would be: \n\"HI\" \n+6.5V to 10V \n \n\"NULL\" +2.5V to –2.5V \n \n\"LO\" \n-6.5V to –13V",
    "\"HI\" \n+6.5V to 10V \n \n\"NULL\" +2.5V to –2.5V \n \n\"LO\" \n-6.5V to –13V \nIn practice, these nominal voltages will be perturbed by noise and pulse distortion.  Thus, receivers should associate the following voltage ranges with the three states indicated: \n\"HI\" \n+6.5V to 13V \n \n\"NULL\" +2.5V to –2.5V \n \n\"LO\" \n-6.5V to –13V",
    "Receiver reaction is currently undefined in Specification 429 for voltages that fall in the range just above and below the \"NULL\" range. Respective equipment Characteristics should be referenced for desired receiver response in this range.  However, it is desirable that all DITS receivers will discontinue operation when the voltage levels fall into the undefined regions. Manufacturers are urged, as new equipment is developed, to \"design in\" the rejection capability.",
    "The opinion is held by some people that conditions on transmission lines will be encountered which \nwill require receivers to operate with less than the \nabove-defined minimum difference of 4.0V \nbetween the NULL and HI and NULL and LO states.  Receiver designers are encouraged to investigate the possibilities and problems of working with a minimum difference of  1 volt between these states and to report their findings.",
    "ORIGINAL TEXT FOLLOWS: \n2.4.2  Information Rates The minimum and maximum transmit intervals for each item of information transferred by the Mark 33 DITS are specified in the tables of Attachment 2.",
    "Receiver input common mode voltages (terminal A to ground and terminal B to ground) are not specified because of the difficulties of defining ground with any satisfactory degree of precision. Receiver manufacturers are encouraged to work with the differential input voltage (line A to line B) and not line-to-ground voltages.",
    "There are no values given for refresh rates in this Specification.  However, it is desirable that data be refreshed at least once per transmission.  Those data actually requiring long processing times or a large number of samples are the only types not expected to be refreshed with every transmission. Discretes contained within data words should be transferred at the bit rate and repeated at the update rate of the primary data.  Words dedicated to discretes should be repeated continuously at",

    "Appendix C was added to assist designers in establishing connectivity between LRUs designed to different versions of Specification 429. Appendix D comprises the Specification and Description Language (SDL) diagrams that reflect the intent of the textual material. The SDL diagrams have not been fully proofed, and remain advisory in nature. Therefore, the text material has precedence over the SDL diagrams. When the SDL diagrams have been validated, they will be moved to an Attachment.",
