    "This document sets forth minimum operational performance standards for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II) equipment. TCAS II is intended to improve air safety by acting as a last-resort method of preventing mid-air collisions or near collisions between aircraft.

Aircraft equipped with TCAS II have the ability to",

Aircraft equipped with TCAS II have the ability to interrogate airborne transponders to monitor range, bearing, and reported altitude of other aircraft in the vicinity and assess the risk of collision.  Non-transponding aircraft are not detected. TCAS II Version 6.0 was first introduced in the United States in 1990 with collision avoidance logic Version 6.0 and later 6.04 and 6.04a.  TCAS II Version 7.0 was introduced in the United States and Europe in 2000",

    "equipment described in this document is capable of providing two classes of advisories.  Resolution advisories (RAs) indicate vertical maneuvers that are predicted to either increase or maintain the existing vertical separation from threatening aircraft. Traffic advisories (TAs) indicate the positions of intruding aircraft that may later cause resolution advisories to be displayed.  All TCAS equipment described in this document display traffic and resolution advisories. The resolution",
    "TCAS equipment described in this document display traffic and resolution advisories. The resolution advisories described herein do not indicate horizontal escape maneuvers and therefore are not intended to increase horizontal separation.  Vertical separation is based upon predictions from own and intruder altitude data supplied to the TCAS unit assuming that the intruder does not maneuver. Traffic advisories indicate the range, range rate, altitude, altitude rate and bearing (when available) of",
    "advisories indicate the range, range rate, altitude, altitude rate and bearing (when available) of the intruding aircraft relative to own aircraft.  Traffic advisories without altitude information are also provided on non-altitude reporting, transponder-equipped aircraft.",
    "TCAS has been designed to provide a back-up collision avoidance service for the existing conventional air traffic control system while minimizing the number of unwanted alarms in encounters for which the collision risk does not warrant escape maneuvers.  The operation of TCAS is not dependent upon any ground-based systems.",
    "TCAS is most readily understood by visualizing its operation in flight.  When airborne, the TCAS equipment periodically transmits interrogation signals.  These interrogations are received by Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) or Mode S altitude reporting transponders.  In reply to the interrogations, the transponder transmits a signal which reports its altitude.  The TCAS equipment computes the range of the intruding aircraft by using the round-trip time between the transmission",
    "computes the range of the intruding aircraft by using the round-trip time between the transmission of the interrogation and the receipt of the reply. Altitude, altitude rate, range, range rate, range acceleration and bearing are determined by tracking the reply information.  These data, together with the current TCAS sensitivity level (which specifies the protected volume around the aircraft), are used to determine whether the intruding aircraft is a threat.  Each threat aircraft is processed",
    "used to determine whether the intruding aircraft is a threat.  Each threat aircraft is processed individually to permit selection of the minimum safe resolution advisory based on track data and coordination with other TCAS-equipped aircraft with a resolution advisory generating capability.

If the threat aircraft is itself equipped with TCAS equipment that generates resolution advisories, a coordination procedure via",
    "equipped with TCAS equipment that generates resolution advisories, a coordination procedure via the air-to-air Mode S data link is performed. This procedure assures that the aircraft resolution advisories are compatible.

    "\"DON'T CLIMB\" when the aircraft is climbing); and preventive advisories which do not require a modification to the current flight path (e.g., \"DON'T CLIMB\" when the aircraft is in level flight).

The display of traffic advisories alerts the flight crew to the presence of threat, or potential threat aircraft, and may improve the ability of the crew to respond to",
    "of threat, or potential threat aircraft, and may improve the ability of the crew to respond to subsequent resolution advisories.  In addition, traffic advisories may improve the ability of the flight crew to visually acquire the traffic.

    "It is recognized that developments will continue which may have the potential of producing improved operational performance.  However, this MOPS defines performance standards and test procedures based on proven and validated TCAS requirements that were developed under FAA sponsorship.  It is not feasible to describe a generic way of meeting most TCAS requirements and also write specific test procedures that should be used to validate them.  Thus, specific means of accomplishing each desired",
    "that should be used to validate them.  Thus, specific means of accomplishing each desired result are described by this document. Manufacturers are reminded that the TCAS algorithms specified in Volume II have been proven via extensive validation and verification efforts.

New features in addition to those specified in Volume II",

On the other hand, processing of a TCAS-equipped threat for which an intent message has been received is allowed to proceed without delay even if confidence in the threat\"s vertical rate is low.",
    "When TCAS is able to select its RA sense based on the encounter geometry (i.e., against an unequipped threat or against an equipped threat for which an intent message either has not been received or is such that independent sense selection can be made), it uses range-altitude coordinates to model the path of the threat aircraft based on the tracked data of the threat.  TCAS also models for itself the path that would result if TCAS maneuvered to a climb and that which would result if TCAS",

The model will use a higher rate for one direction when own aircraft\"s \ncurrent vertical rate exceeds the computed rate in that direction (up to a maximum of 4400 feet per minute) or a lower rate when constrained by current resolution advisories.",
    "In certain regimes of flight, TCAS may determine that the TCAS aircraft cannot execute the nominal climb escape maneuver.  This determination may be made according to unique characteristics of the aircraft on which TCAS is installed and the regime of flight and may use on-board inputs not otherwise required by TCAS.  Path modeling will substitute level flight for the climb maneuver in such instances.",
    "Similarly, radio altimeter data is used to recognize when TCAS is too near to the ground to issue a descend advisory.  Path modeling recognizes this condition and substitutes level flight at the appropriate altitude.",
    "TCAS computes the predicted vertical separation for each of the two sense selection options.  The directional sense that gives the greater predicted vertical separation from the threat aircraft at the time of closest approach is normally selected as the preferred sense of the resolution advisory caused by this threat. \n \nIn the following cases, due to additional considerations, the preferred sense may not be the direction that gives the greatest modeled separation:",

Against a TCAS threat that has already selected its sense, own TCAS will \nselect a complementary sense choice, unless own TCAS has the lower ICAO aircraft address, the intent is crossing and was received within the past three seconds, in which case own TCAS will select its RA sense independently.  If the resultant sense is noncrossing, the higher address threat will be forced to reverse the sense of its RA to noncrossing (see below).",

    "For example, a conflict between two TCAS-equipped aircraft will with very high probability result in selection of complementary advisory senses because of the coordination protocol between the two aircraft.  However, if coordination communications between the two aircraft are disrupted at the critical time of sense selection, both aircraft may choose their advisories independently.  This could possibly result in sense selection of incompatible senses.",
    "Should a sense incompatibility be discovered by the TCAS logic, the logic will rectify the situation by having the TCAS with the higher ICAO aircraft address reverse its sense.  (The TCAS with the lower ICAO aircraft address retains its original sense.)",
    "The logic permits sense reversals of either crossing or noncrossing resolution advisories based on changes in encounter geometry, which indicate that the original advisory is being thwarted.  Such geometry-based reversals can occur both in TCAS-unequipped and TCAS-TCAS encounters.",
    "For the most part, the reversal logic for unequipped threats applies as well to the TCAS-TCAS case. However, some additions and changes have been made to make this logic more robust for TCAS-TCAS encounters because of the effect when both aircraft are maneuvering.  For example, the need for a reversal must be indicated on two out of three cycles.  Reversals from noncrossing to crossing are also inhibited in TCAS-TCAS encounters.",
    "After the original resolution advisory has been issued, the resolution logic monitors the progress of the encounter.  If it detects a substantial change in the encounter geometry, indicating that the intruder has begun to level-off or accelerate, or that own pilot is disregarding the original resolution advisory, it models pilot response to the reversed-sense advisory.  If the predicted result of",
    "that response exceeds the farthest predicted altitude of the intruder at closest approach (using the confidence test rate bounds) and retention of the existing RA sense will not provide adequate (ALIM) separation, the advisory sense is reversed. \n \nIn all cases, after the decision to reverse sense is made, normal advisory strength selection occurs.",

Because intent messages can be received at any time during the threat processing cycle, the collision avoidance logic ensures data integrity by preventing simultaneous access to the same information.",
    "The basic rule for sense selection in an encounter with a TCAS-equipped threat is that before selecting a sense, each TCAS must first check if it has received an intent message from the threat.  If no intent has been received, TCAS will select a sense based on the encounter geometry (subparagraph 2.2.5.3.1).  If an intent has been received, in most cases TCAS will immediately select the complementary RA sense.  However, if own TCAS\" ICAO aircraft address is lower in value than that of the",

This logic behavior reflects the observed behavior of pilots who will generally",

It shall move as appropriate when an RA is strengthened or weakened by the CAS logic. \n\n## 2.2.6.2.6.2 Mode Annunciation",
    "## 2.2.6.2.6.2 Mode Annunciation\n\nWhen an RA is displayed, the HUD shall display a written annunciation of ―TCAS‖ or \n―TRAFFIC‖.  The exact implementation of the annunciation shall be compatible with the implementation of other mode annunciations on the HUD. \n\n## 2.2.6.2.6.3 Flight Path Target",
    "A flight path target shall be provided whenever a change in the existing vertical speed is desired.  A box consisting of lines twice the width of the lines comprising the trapezoid shall be displayed at the top (up sense RA) or bottom (down sense RA) of the trapezoid for all RAs except initial preventive RAs. The flight path target shall be readily discernible and distinguishable. The flight path target shall remain displayed for the entire duration of the RA.  It shall move to the appropriate",

    "## 2.2.6.2.6.4 Multi-Aircraft Encounters",
    "For the special situation where a multi-aircraft encounter results in an RA where neither a climb nor descent is permitted, two trapezoids shall be simultaneously displayed.  One shall begin at the top of the display and extend downwards to the flight path angle that will result in level flight, while the other shall begin at the bottom of the display and extend upwards to the flight path angle that will result in level flight.  There shall be sufficient room left between the two trapezoids to",
    "will result in level flight.  There shall be sufficient room left between the two trapezoids to display the flight path target box.  This distance shall nominally permit the own aircraft reference on the HUD to fit between the two trapezoids.",
    "## 2.2.6.2.6.5 Display Decluttering",
    "When an RA is displayed, the display may be automatically decluttered by removing certain data and symbols.  Items such as ground speed, mach, wind speed and direction, digital heading, digital selected course, and digital selected heading may be removed if this does not interfere with the pilot's ability to comply with the RA or operate the aircraft in compliance with the appropriate regulations and requirements.  The navigation data, as well as the guidance cue, shall remain displayed at all",
    "and requirements.  The navigation data, as well as the guidance cue, shall remain displayed at all times.",

    "## 2.2.6.3.1.2 Aural Annunciation Generation\n\nAn aural annunciation shall be generated when the first RA of an encounter is displayed and each time a subsequent change in the advisory is displayed (strengthened or weakened).  An aural annunciation shall also be provided to indicate that the TCAS aircraft is clear of conflict with all threatening aircraft.",
    "Note \nThe CAS logic determines when any RA will be displayed and will provide the information required to initiate the aural annunciation. \n\n## 2.2.6.3.1.3 Aural Annunciation Duration",
    "## 2.2.6.3.1.3 Aural Annunciation Duration\n\nThe aural annunciations used shall conform with the content and duration (repetitions) shown in Table 2-15.  An annunciation shall be interrupted before it is completed if the CAS logic determines that a higher priority aural annunciation, e.g., ―Increase Climb, Increase Climb‖, should be announced.  The CAS logic sets a flag to indicate that a higher priority aural annunciation condition has occurred.  \n\n## 2.2.6.3.2 Quality",
    "## 2.2.6.3.2 Quality\n\nAural alerts shall be announced in a high fidelity, distinguishable voice that is audible in all expected flight deck ambient noise conditions.",
    "Note: Automatic volume adjustment for ambient conditions is highly recommended.  \nThe volume level of the automatic adjustment shall provide a range of 0 to 4 watts RMS at 1000 Hz into 8 ohms for a speaker output.  The automatic adjustment shall provide a range of 0 to 40 milliwatts at 1000 Hz into a 600 ohm audio distribution system. \n\n## 2.2.6.3.3 Aural Annunciation Inhibit\n\nNotes:",
    "## 2.2.6.3.3 Aural Annunciation Inhibit\n\nNotes: \n\n1. \nAural annunciations are automatically inhibited by annunciations issued by reactive and predictive wind shear systems, and ground proximity warning systems (GPWS), which have a higher priority, and below an altitude determined by the CAS logic. \n2. \nWhen a higher priority warning system (wind shear or GPWS) has an active warning, TCAS is placed into the TA-Only mode of operation. \n\n## 2.2.6.3.4 Tas",
    "## 2.2.6.3.4 Tas\n\nWhen a TA is initially issued, the aural annunciation ―TRAFFIC-TRAFFIC‖ shall be spoken once.  No aural annunciation shall be issued when an RA against an intruder reverts to a TA at the end of an encounter. The ―TRAFFIC-TRAFFIC‖ annunciation shall be pre-empted by any annunciation associated with an RA. \n\n## 2.2.6.3.5 Ras",
    "## 2.2.6.3.5 Ras\n\nThe annunciations shown in Table 2-15 are spoken whenever the indicated RA is issued by TCAS. The annunciations for an RA reversal and for an increase rate RA indicate the previously annunciated RA has reversed or been increased in strength, respectively.  These aural annunciations shall be spoken with a sense of urgency. Table 2-16 provides the mapping between the aural annunciations, the type of RA, CRS Variables, and the contents of ARINC Word Label 270.",

    "Description:  For each tracked aircraft, the 100 ft vertical tracker determines a bin transition status which characterizes the track as one of five possible values (the substates of 100ft_Bin_Transition_Status).  Bin transition status is an important factor in determining the level of confidence in the tracked altitude and altitude rate.  At initialization, status is either \"New\" or, when there is a known significant altitude rate, \"Trend.\"  \"Trend\" status is assigned when there is a",
    "there is a known significant altitude rate, \"Trend.\"  \"Trend\" status is assigned when there is a regularly-spaced and same direction sequence of bin transitions.  \"Trend\" transitions to \"Level\" status when an expected bin transition is very late.  \"Level\" status, which indicates zero vertical rate, is selected when no bin transition has occurred for a long time.  A sequence of single bin transitions which alternate in direction produces an \"Oscil\" status indicating level flight with",
    "transitions which alternate in direction produces an \"Oscil\" status indicating level flight with oscillations (i.e., jitter) in reported altitude.  The \"Guess\" status is assigned when an altitude report produces an unexpected change in the direction and number of bins crossed.",

In addition, track firmness is high and the tracked relative altitude of the other aircraft is consistent with non crossing biased climb or descend.",

    "some of the test criteria and emphasizes the deviation between own aircraft's current altitude rate and its RA goal altitude rate.  If the deviation exceeds a certain threshold, this test will declare own aircraft non-compliant. This test will fail if the initial RA is a Vertical Speed Limit (VSL) RA because such RAs do not have a well defined goal altitude rate.  The test ensures that extra time has been given to the pilot to react to an RA that has recently been strengthed to a positive RA.",
