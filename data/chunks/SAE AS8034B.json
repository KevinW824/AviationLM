    "The original AS8034 document specified minimum performance standards for Electronic Displays which, at the time of publication, included only Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays. The AS8034A revision updated the minimum performance standards to include specific performance standards for Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) not covered in the originally published document. The current revision, AS8034B, contains clarification on the scope of applicable types of electronic displays, updated references as",
    "clarification on the scope of applicable types of electronic displays, updated references as well as specific updates to the general minimum performance standards for electronic displays identified in Section 3, specific performance standards for LCDs in Section 4.5, and some clarification to CRT specific minimum performance standards in Section 4.4. This document was developed by the SAE A-4 Electronic Display committee and supersedes AS8034 and AS8034A.",
