    "1.1 This test method covers the required procedures to\nevaluate the comparative ability of rubber and rubber-like\ncompositions to withstand the effect of liquids. It is designed\nfor testing: (1) specimens of vulcanized rubber cut from\nstandard sheets (see Practice D3182), (2) specimens cut from\nfabric coated with vulcanized rubber (see Test Methods D751),\nor (3) finished articles of commerce (see Practice D3183). This\ntest method is not applicable to the testing of cellular rubbers,",
    "test method is not applicable to the testing of cellular rubbers,\nporous compositions, and compressed sheet packing, except as\ndescribed in 12.2.2.",
    "1.2 Periodically, it is necessary to produce a new lot of an\nIRM oil to replace the dwindling supply of the current product.\nThe Chairman of the subcommittee shall have the authority to\napprove the production of a replacement lot. Once produced,\nthe technical data of the new lot shall be presented, in a\ncomparative fashion, to that of the existing lot and balloted\nupon by the membership of the D11.15 subcommittee and,\neither subsequently or concurrently, balloted upon by the",
    "either subsequently or concurrently, balloted upon by the\nmembership of the D11 main committee for approval to release\nthe new lot for distribution.",
    "1.3 In the event that an IRM oil becomes unavailable for\ndistribution due to depletion, the Chairman of the subcommit-\ntee shall have the authority to approve production of a new lot\nand, after a meeting of the task group, regularly scheduled, or\nnot, to release a quantity of the product for distribution\nsufficient enough only to address a backlog. Once the backlog\nis addressed, the process described in 1.2 shall be followed.",
    "1.4 ASTM Oils No. 2 and No. 3, formerly used in this test\nmethod as standard test liquids, are no longer commercially\navailable and in 1993 were replaced with IRM 902 and IRM\n903, respectively (see Appendix X1 for details).\n\n  1.5 ASTM No. 1 Oil, previously used in this test method as\na standard test liquid, is no longer commercially available and\n\nin 2005 was replaced with IRM 901; refer to Table 1 and Appendix X3 for details.\n\n1.6 ASTM No. 5 Oil was accepted into Specification D5900",
    "1.6 ASTM No. 5 Oil was accepted into Specification D5900\n\nas an industry reference material in 2010 and designated as\nIRM 905. The composition, and properties of this immersion\noil were not changed and the data in Table 1 remains current.\nRefer to Appendix X4 for other details.",
