    "This SAE Aerospace Standard (AS) specifies the design and performance criteria and testing methods applicable to fire containment covers intended to be used in conjunction with air cargo unit load devices in order to meet through oxygen depletion the fire containment regulations in certain civil transport aircraft cargo compartments. Throughout this Standard, the minimum essential criteria are identified by use of the key word \"shall.\" Recommended criteria are identified by use of the key word",
    "by use of the key word \"shall.\" Recommended criteria are identified by use of the key word \"should\" and, while not mandatory, are considered to be of primary importance in providing safe fire containment covers. Deviation from recommended criteria should only occur after careful consideration, extensive testing and thorough service evaluations have shown alternate methods to be satisfactory. The requirements of this Standard are expressed in the applicable SI units, with approximate inch-pound",
    "requirements of this Standard are expressed in the applicable SI units, with approximate inch-pound unit conversion between brackets. Where it is deemed necessary to use exact values, the SI units are to be used.",

Terms And Definitions\n\nFor the purpose of this Standard, the definitions of ISO 10254 and the following apply: \n\n## 3.1 Fire Containment/Fire Control\n\nEnsuring that a fire does not grow to a state where damage to the airplane or harm to passengers or crew occurs during the time for which the fire containment system is demonstrated to be effective. \n\n## 3.2 Fire Containment Cover (Fcc)",
    "## 3.2 Fire Containment Cover (Fcc)\n\nPassive device used in conjunction with an air cargo pallet and net in order to contain a possible cargo fire beneath it for a rated period. Guidance addressing the use of FCCs is provided in airworthiness regulatory guidance as one of the allowable means of compliance with fire containment requirements in certain classes of aircraft cargo compartments. \n\n## 3.3 Active Unit Load Device",
    "## 3.3 Active Unit Load Device\n\nUnit load device incorporating built-in fire detection and/or fire extinguishing systems. \n\n## 3.4 Passive Unit Load Device\n\nUnit load device or accessory thereto (e.g., FCC) that includes neither fire detection nor fire extinguishing systems, and ensures fire containment by its use of fire resistant or fire proof material and limiting the supply of air. \n\n## 3.5 Unit Load Device (Uld)",
    "## 3.5 Unit Load Device (Uld)\n\nDevice for grouping, transferring, and restraining cargo for transit. It may consist of a pallet with a net or it may be a container. \n\n## 3.6 Class A Fire\n\nFires in ordinary combustible materials, such as wood, cloth, paper, rubber, and plastics for which the quenching and cooling effects of quantities of water, or of solutions containing a large percentage of water, are of prime importance. \n\n## 3.7 Fire Resistant",
    "## 3.7 Fire Resistant\n\nGrade designating components, equipment and structures capable of withstanding application of heat by a defined flame for 5 min, as opposed to fire proof (see ISO 2685 and EUROCAE ED-14G sect. 26). \n\n## 3.8 Fire Proof\n\nGrade designating components, equipment and structures capable of withstanding the application of heat by a defined flame for 15 minutes (see ISO 2685 and EUROCAE ED-14G sect. 26). \n\n## 3.9 Burn Length",
    "## 3.9 Burn Length\n\nDistance from the original edge to the farthest evidence of damage on a test specimen due to flame impingement, including areas of partial or complete consumption, charring or embrittlement, but not including areas sooted, stained, warped, or discolored, nor areas where material has shrunk or melted away from the heat source.  \n\n## 4. General Requirements 4.1 Approval",
    "4.1.1 \nThe fire containment cover type design shall be approved on the basis of demonstration of compliance with the \npresent Standard, and a Certificate of Conformity shall accordingly be delivered by the manufacturer. Where the fire containment cover is intended to constitute a means of complying with applicable airworthiness regulations per 1.1(a) and 1.2(a), type approval should be sought from the airworthiness Authority concerned, who may include additional requirements. \n4.1.2",
    "4.1.2 \nThe fire containment cover may be an entirely separate device (type I), or it may be attached to or integrated with",
    "an approved air cargo pallet net (type II). In the latter case, both sets of airworthiness approval requirements shall simultaneously be met, and no feature of either the cover or the net shall compromise an applicable requirement for the other function. The pallet net used in conjunction with the cover (type I) or attached to it (type II) shall be airworthiness approved under TSO/ETSO C90d, and meet the additional flammability requirements in 5.1.3. The",
