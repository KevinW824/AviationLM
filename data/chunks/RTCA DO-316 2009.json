    "This document contains minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) for airborne navigation equipment using the Global Positioning System (GPS).  DO-316 only provides standards for single-frequency airborne supplemental navigation sensor equipment not augmented by ground- or space-based systems.  Separate standards exist for GPS augmented by ground- or space-based methods.  Additionally, a separate document will be created in the future to address standards for dual frequency equipment.",
    "The basis for this MOPS is RTCA/DO-229D class beta 1 receiver without SBAS requirements. In this document, the term \"shall\" is used to indicate requirements.  An approved design should comply with every requirement, which can be assured by inspection, test, analysis, or demonstration.  The term \"must\" is used to identify items that are important but are either duplicated somewhere else in the document as a \"shall\", or are considered to be outside the scope of this document.  The term \"should\"",
    "as a \"shall\", or are considered to be outside the scope of this document.  The term \"should\" is used to denote a recommendation that would improve the GPS equipment, but does not constitute a requirement. The standards define minimum performance, functions and features for GPS sensors that provide position information to a multi-sensor system or separate navigation system. They also address Area Navigation (RNAV) equipment to be used for the en route, terminal, and Lateral Navigation (LNAV)",
    "Navigation (RNAV) equipment to be used for the en route, terminal, and Lateral Navigation (LNAV) phases of flight. These standards are based upon a nominal allocation of the aircraft-level requirements in RTCA/DO-236B, Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards: Required Navigation Performance for Area Navigation, accounting for the unique issues associated with GPS navigation service and minimizing the need for pilot training. Compliance with these standards by manufacturers, installers and",

Compliance with these standards by manufacturers, installers and users is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will satisfactorily perform its intended functions under conditions encountered in routine aeronautical operations, and will ensure a basic compatibility with the requirements defined in RTCA/DO-236B.",
    "The regulatory application of these standards is the responsibility of appropriate government agencies. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has published a Technical Standard Order (TSO) for GPS equipment to reference the requirements and bench test procedures in Section 2.

    "GNSS refers to a world-wide position and time determination system that uses satellite ranging signals to determine user location.  It encompasses all satellite ranging technologies and augmentation systems, including GPS, Space-Based Augmentation System (SBAS), Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS), Galileo, and Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS).  Different components of the GNSS \ncan have different signal characteristics (e.g. GPS, Galileo, SBAS satellites, etc.).",
    "## 1.2.2 Gps Signal Characteristics",
    "The GPS ranging signal is modulated with data at 50 symbols/second that defines the satellite's position, system time, clock correction parameters, as well as the health and accuracy of the transmitted data and ranging signal.  The user computes a pseudorange to the satellite by timing the arrival of the GPS signal.  The user equipment uses the pseudoranges from the satellites to compute the receiver's internal clock offset and a three-dimensional position fix.  A pseudo-random noise (PRN)",
    "receiver's internal clock offset and a three-dimensional position fix.  A pseudo-random noise (PRN) code, known as the Coarse Acquisition (C/A) code, is generated at a rate of 1.023 MHz and modulated onto the GPS L1 frequency (1575.42 MHz).  All GPS satellites transmit at the same L-band frequency.  The carrier is modulated with a specific C/A code for each GPS satellite. The GPS coordinate system provided by the signal is the Cartesian earth-centered earthfixed (ECEF) coordinates as specified",

    "The GPS position is determined in the WGS-84 coordinate system.",
    "The GPS Control Segment consistently manages GPS time to within one microsecond of Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) (modulo one second).  For time coordination purposes, an offset between GPS time and UTC is provided in the GPS navigation message and is specified to have an SPS accuracy of 340 nanoseconds 95% of time. Detailed GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) information is provided in the GPS",
    "SPS Performance Standard, October 2001, and IS-GPS-200D, \"Navstar GPS Space Segment / Navigation User Interfaces\", December 2004. Note: During the course of this MOPS development, a new GPS SPS version has been released. The new SPS version is not referenced because an in depth analysis has not been performed. Office of the Secretary of Defense with FAA input has ensured backward compatibility between the old standard and the new standard. Application of the previous version does not have any",
    "the old standard and the new standard. Application of the previous version does not have any adverse effect from an operational standpoint.",
    "## 1.3 Operational Goals",
    "The operational goal is to provide supplemental radionavigation equipment onboard the aircraft that meets Area Navigation (RNAV) performance requirements for oceanic, remote area and domestic en route, terminal, and Lateral Navigation (LNAV) approach phases of flight.  Navigation integrity is provided by an FDE algorithm that uses redundant pseudorange measurements for all phases of flight.

    "a) flexibility for future enhancements; b) positioning source for Required Navigation Performance (RNP) applications; \nand, \nc) replacement of other radionavigation systems. \n\n## 1.3.1 Operational Environment",
    "The GPS equipment is intended to be a supplemental radionavigation system within the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS).  As such, GPS may be used on aircraft to navigate within designated airspace, provided other operational radionavigation equipment is on the aircraft.  In Oceanic and/or remote regions it may be possible to use the GPS",
    "equipment as a primary navigation system; that is, without a requirement for other operational equipment.  It is anticipated that the NAS will transition to increased reliance on GNSS services and decreased emphasis on ground-based radionavigation aids.  As with conventional navigation aids, operational precautions will be used to mitigate a potentially hazardous situation in the event of a failure. GPS and its augmentation systems may result in decommissioning other radionavigation aids on the",
    "GPS and its augmentation systems may result in decommissioning other radionavigation aids on the ground and the removal of other radionavigation equipment from the cockpit.",
    "Although the ultimate degree to which these reductions can be made is not yet known, it is believed that they will result in significant savings both to the aviation authority and the aeronautical community.  The operating environment is expected to evolve to capture the benefits of improved RNAV capabilities, resulting in increased operational efficiency.",
    "## 1.3.2 International Compatibility\n\nThe operational concept for GNSS is predicated on the combination of the different GNSS elements without pilot intervention. As GNSS is a global system, there should be no flight crew interaction based on airspace, so that the flight crew should not be involved in the selection of different GNSSs.",
    "For LNAV approaches, it is expected that States will approve all combinations of GNSS elements provided by another State.  If a State decides to approve a subset of GNSS elements for less stringent approach operations there may be serious operational restrictions depending on the capability of the equipment.  While all participating States are coordinating through ICAO to ensure that GNSS provides seamless global coverage, it is important to recognize the potential ramifications should a State",
    "seamless global coverage, it is important to recognize the potential ramifications should a State only approve a subset of GNSS operations, or, impose operational limits on a particular GNSS.",
    "## 1.4 Equipment Type\n\nEquipment developed to this MOPS consists of a GPS sensor that determines position (with integrity) and provides position and integrity data to an integrated navigation system (e.g., flight management system, multi-sensor navigation system).  This equipment provides integrity by using a Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) algorithm. \n\n## 1.5 Fde With Barometric Aiding",
    "Although it is not required, the use of barometric altitude for the fault detection and exclusion (FDE) algorithm is highly recommended. Baro-aiding can significantly improve GPS availability for the en route, terminal area, and LNAV phases of flight. Other sensors, such as clock-aiding, eLoran or inertial, may also be used as part of the FDE algorithm.  Such an algorithm would need to meet all the FDE requirements.  FDE algorithms that use other navigation signals external to the aircraft,",

FDE algorithms that use other navigation signals external to the aircraft, such as eLoran or VOR/DME, must satisfy the availability requirement without using the other navigation signals.  The manufacturer must provide the means to test and analyze alternate FDE algorithms to demonstrate compliance.",
    "## 1.6 Test Considerations",
    "The test procedures specified in Section 2 are intended to be used as recommended means of demonstrating compliance with the minimum acceptable performance parameters specified herein.  Although specific test procedures are cited, it is recognized that other methods may be suitable. These alternate procedures may be used if they provide at least equivalent information.  In such cases, the procedures cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate",
    "cited herein should be used as one criterion in evaluating the acceptability of the alternate procedures.",
    "## 1.6.1 Environmental Tests",
    "Environmental tests are specified in Section 2.2.  These tests, like bench tests, are performed at the equipment level.  The procedures and their associated limit requirements provide a laboratory means of determining the electrical and mechanical performance of the equipment under conditions expected to be encountered in actual aeronautical operations.  Test results may be used by equipment manufacturers as design guidance, in preparation of installation instructions and, in certain cases, for",

    "## 1.6.2 Bench Tests",
    "The test procedures specified in Section 2.3 provide a means to demonstrate equipment performance in a simulated environment.  Test results may be used as design guidance for monitoring manufacturing compliance and, in certain cases, for obtaining formal approval of equipment design and manufacture. Due to the number of possible sensor complements and position-fixing modes for this equipment, and the actual service to be provided, it is deemed impractical to define complete test procedures for",

    "## 1.7.3 Fault Detection And Exclusion (Fde) Terms",
    "Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE):  Fault detection and exclusion is a receiver processing scheme that autonomously provides integrity monitoring for the position solution, using redundant range measurements.

Upon the detection, fault exclusion follows and excludes the source of the unacceptably large",
    "Upon the detection, fault exclusion follows and excludes the source of the unacceptably large position error, thereby allowing navigation to return to normal performance without an interruption in service.  The fault detection aspects of FDE are referred to as Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM).  However, FDE also includes the capability to isolate and exclude failed ranging sources so that navigation can continue in the presence of the failure.",

    "Threat Model B introduces amplitude modulation and models degradations in the analog section of the GPS satellite.  More specifically, it consists of the output from a second order system when the nominal C/A code baseband signal is the input.

The regions of this figure indicated as having interference with bandwidths other than CW are considered to represent in-band and near-band interference with received power levels defined in Figure C-2 as a function of bandwidth.

For interference bandwidths outside of that range, the level of the mask in Figure C-1 is adjusted up or down according to the levels of Figure C-2.

The acquisition test is broken out into a series of three segments each composed of ten trials.  The \"quit-while-ahead\" concept will be used.  For example, if no failure occurs in the first 10 trials, success would be declared and the test terminated.  If one failure occurred in the",

Such a test concept will, on the average, shorten the duration of the testing.
