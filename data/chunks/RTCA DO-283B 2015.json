    "This document contains Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for airborne area navigation equipment operated in a Required Navigation Performance",
    "(RNP) operational environment.  The MOPS documents the minimum requirements and guidance for one functional part of the airplane system that is described and specified by the MASPS, DO-236C Plus Change 1, and ED-75D.  These standards specify system characteristics that should be useful to designers, manufacturers, installers and users of the equipment. Equipment conforming to the requirements of this document is herein referred to as \"RNP\" equipment.  The requirements of the MOPS are consistent",
    "document is herein referred to as \"RNP\" equipment.  The requirements of the MOPS are consistent with the definitions and navigation specifications for RNP contained in the ICAO PBN Manual, Doc 9613.",
    "This is because the MOPS presents a comprehensive set of minimum requirements for RNP that enables a manufacturer to develop equipment suited to designated system installations and PBN operational applications.  The PBN manual navigation specifications represent end use criteria for aircraft systems and equipment that are oriented to specific operational needs, capabilities and performance. The result is that each navigation specification describes specific aircraft equipment, performance",
    "The result is that each navigation specification describes specific aircraft equipment, performance capabilities and functional requirements that, if common with the MOPS, are mostly just a subset of the total MOPS RNP requirements.  Thus the RNP equipment that meets all of the requirements of this MOPS generally will not necessarily be the same as the RNP systems and equipment eligible in any one navigation specification even though they will have requirements in common. In addition,",
    "in any one navigation specification even though they will have requirements in common. In addition, barometric vertical navigation (VNAV) requirements are defined for aircraft that provide this capability to ensure accurate and predictable vertical paths.  The VNAV requirements in this document are consistent with instrument approach procedures with vertical guidance (APV).  Due to the wide disparity of climb performance of different aircraft types, this MOPS only addresses vertical path",
    "disparity of climb performance of different aircraft types, this MOPS only addresses vertical path definition requirements for level flight and descent.",
    "The committee also decided that to achieve the best alignment and implementation of RNP equipment to the planned operational requirements and applications, the MOPS should organize the appropriate requirements and guidance to fit the operational near term applications as well as allow for a step to far term applications. Compliance with these standards is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under all conditions normally",
    "the equipment will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operations. Any regulatory application of this document is the sole responsibility of the appropriate governmental agencies.",
    "Section 1.0 of this document provides information needed to understand the rationale for the equipment characteristics and requirements stated in the remaining sections. It describes typical equipment applications and operational goals, as originally envisioned by Special Committee 181 then expanded by Special Committee 227, and forms the basis for standards stated in Sections 2.0 through 3.0. Definitions and assumptions essential to proper understanding of this document are also provided in",
    "Definitions and assumptions essential to proper understanding of this document are also provided in this section. Section 2.0 contains the minimum performance standards for the equipment. These standards specify the required performance under standard operating conditions and stressed physical environmental conditions. Also included are recommended bench test procedures necessary to demonstrate compliance.",
    "Section 3.0 provides references to installation guidance material for installed equipment performance, and also describes the performance required of the installed equipment. Tests for the installed equipment are included when performance cannot be adequately determined through bench testing.",
    "Section 4.0 describes the operational characteristics for equipment installations and defines conditions that will assure the operator that operations can be conducted safely and reliably in the expected operational environment. \n\nSection 5.0  contains the committee membership list. Appendix A contains glossary, acronyms, and abbreviations. Appendix B contains example system compliance analysis.",

For example, the RNP \"equipment\" may include: a computer unit, as",
    "properly its intended function. For example, the RNP \"equipment\" may include: a computer unit, as well as associated sensor(s), an input-output unit that interfaces with existing aircraft displays/systems, a control unit, a display, etc. In the case of this example, all of the associated components or units comprise the \"equipment\". It should not be inferred from this example, however, that every RNP equipment will necessarily include all of the foregoing components or units. The particular",
    "RNP equipment will necessarily include all of the foregoing components or units. The particular components of the RNP equipment will depend upon the design used by the equipment manufacturer, subject to the constraint that the equipment must meet the applicable requirements of this MOPS.",
    "Note: \nDuring the introduction of RNP, RNAV operations will need to be supported. \n\n## 1.2 System Overview And Intended Function",
    "The RNP equipment as addressed in this document provides the functions of position estimation, path definition, associated control displays and system alerting, along with interfaces for path steering, situational awareness and map displays.  See Figure 1-1 for the Navigation Equipment Block Diagram. The associated control displays and system alerting functions may integral to the RNP equipment, or may be implemented externally.  When implemented externally (as depicted by the dashed line box),",
    "may be implemented externally.  When implemented externally (as depicted by the dashed line box), the requirements of this MOPS apply to those RNP equipment interfaces that support these functions. Environmental qualification required by this MOPS is applicable to the navigation functions depicted. Display, flight director and autopilot systems are not considered part of the RNP equipment and do not require environmental re-qualification for use with RNP equipment.",
    "Note: \n        The intended function at the airplane systems level is still subject to \n        assessment and a determination of acceptability through aircraft and \n        operator qualification for RNP operations. \n\nEquipment compliance to these standards will facilitate approval of the installed system \nto the RNP RNAV requirements defined in RTCA/DO-236C, Change 1 to DO-236C, \nand EUROCAE/ED-75D. \n\n## Position Estimation",
    "Position estimation is a means for determining the aircraft's position over the surface of the earth. Data is used, either from radio signals (received from ground-based navaids or from satellites) or from onboard autonomous navigation sensors, to derive an estimated position. The position estimation function obtains information concerning any groundbased navaids that are being used from a navigation database. The function also provides position data for display of parameters such as estimated",
    "database. The function also provides position data for display of parameters such as estimated position, estimate of position uncertainty, ground speed and track angle, based on the sensor data being processed. The method by which the position estimation function may process the different types of sensor data is described herein. The document provides overall requirements for system performance which in itself may constrain the methods to be used through specification of accuracy, integrity,",
    "which in itself may constrain the methods to be used through specification of accuracy, integrity, continuity, and availability of the data.",
    "## Path Definition\n\nThe path definition function computes the flight path to be flown in the vertical, horizontal and time dimensions. The elements of a flight path include fixes, path constraints (altitude, speed, location) and leg types such that a seamless horizontal and vertical path between the start and end of the planned flight can be achieved.",
    "The lateral aspects of path definition determine a geographically fixed ground track from origin to destination. The sub-functions involved are:",
    "1.\nFix definition, whether derived from an airborne database, pilot entry, or data uplink;\n2.\nLeg type definition;\n3.\nLeg transition definition, e.g., turns;\n4.\nTactical operations, e.g. direct-to, lateral offsets and holds.\nThe vertical aspects of path definition determine a path profile from origin to destination. The vertical aspects are extensions to the sub-functions prescribed for the lateral path:",
    "1.\naltitude/flight level constraints, associated with fix definition\n2.\nvertical angle, associated with leg definition\n3.\nspeed restrictions, associated with fix definition\nNote:  \nPath definition should include an accurate lateral and vertical path, \nwith a best estimate of times of arrival associated with each lateral and some vertical fixes.",
    "with a best estimate of times of arrival associated with each lateral and some vertical fixes.   \nAs the ATM system evolves, the digital air/ground datalink interface will become an integral part of path definition through uplinks of pre-defined procedures to be used from the airborne navigation database or fixes that the system must use to create a route or procedure.",
    "--`````,,,,,,,,`,``,,`,,`,```,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\n\n## Path Steering\n\nThe defined path is used by the path steering function, where it is combined with the estimated position and time to determine parameters of path deviation and steering commands. These parameters are used for correcting errors relative to the defined path in terms of lateral, vertical and time of arrival. \n\n## Lateral Steering",
    "Typical of the parameters for lateral control are the computations of cross-track error and track angle error. Having determined the lateral path steering errors, the lateral steering sub-function computes a steering command that may be used by the aircraft flight control system (autopilot, flight director), and a path deviation for display to the flight crew on their primary flight instruments. Both types of commands, the latter in combination with the pilot, attempt to correct the errors and",
    "Both types of commands, the latter in combination with the pilot, attempt to correct the errors and hold the aircraft to the defined path. The overall navigation performance achieved will depend upon the type of steering command selected, i.e. automatic or manual.",
    "## Vertical Steering",
    "Typical of the parameters for vertical control are the computation of speed, thrust, altitude, vertical track error, and flight path angle.  Having determined the vertical path errors, the vertical steering and control sub-function computes commands and indications, a steering command that may be used by an aircraft flight control system (autopilot, flight director), and path guidance/deviation data for display to the flight crew on the flight instruments.  These commands, where the steering",
    "data for display to the flight crew on the flight instruments.  These commands, where the steering management and display may be in combination with the pilot, attempt to correct the errors and hold the aircraft to the defined vertical path.  The overall navigation performance achieved will depend upon the type of steering command selected, i.e. automatic or manual, and aircraft flight performance.",
    "## Displays And System Alerting",
    "The user interface is achieved through displays, alerting functions, and system controls. These functions provide facilities for system initialization, flight planning and progress, active guidance control, and presentation of navigation data for situational awareness. These functions should be compatible with the overall flight deck philosophy for the aircraft. Similarly, flight crew interaction with the navigation system should be efficient and the design should take into account the effects",
    "with the navigation system should be efficient and the design should take into account the effects of crew workload.",
    "## Aircraft Flight Control System",
    "Lateral and vertical steering guidance is provided by an interface with the aircraft flight control system, specifically, the flight director and autopilot systems. The flight director interface provides a visual indication of the required steering. The pilot may steer manually, or the autopilot interface may provide automatic steering. These interfaces may reduce the lateral and vertical flight technical error by providing the improved anticipation, maneuvering, and control afforded by flight",
    "technical error by providing the improved anticipation, maneuvering, and control afforded by flight control systems. The overall system navigation performance may depend on the steering mode selected, either manual or automatic, and on aircraft performance.",
    "## 1.3 Operational Goals And Applications\n\nThis MOPS establishes requirements for the airborne navigation component of the CNS/ATM operating environment, and supports operations concepts predicated on a systematic application of improved capabilities for traffic planning, operations, management, surveillance and infrastructure. The navigation system described in this MOPS will be compatible with and a catalyst in both existing and future airspace operations.  \n\n## Path Definition",
    "Operation in RNP airspace, especially at lower RNPs, will be characterized by reliable, predictable and repeatable ground tracks. This should be achieved by aircraft equipment and operating environments that utilize the same airspace and path definitions. Additionally, the aircraft equipment and operating environment will support the conduct of operations where a vertical descent profile and/or time of arrival is specified, including arrival and approach procedures with displayed guidance and",
    "time of arrival is specified, including arrival and approach procedures with displayed guidance and path keeping control, as appropriate.",
    "## Containment Methodology",
    "An aircraft meeting the required navigation performance will remain within the confines of the RNP airspace with a predefined level of confidence. Application of this MOPS will enable assignment of a value to that level of confidence and provide a methodology to demonstrate that the aircraft system meets the specified RNP. Following consideration of typical performance of existing navigation systems and evaluating what was necessary to obtain operational benefit, a lateral containment limit of",
    "and evaluating what was necessary to obtain operational benefit, a lateral containment limit of two times the RNP (2xRNP) has been chosen.  The lateral containment limit is also an enabling element for the ICAO PBN requirement for on-board performance monitoring and alerting.",
    "An aircraft meeting vertical navigation performance will remain in proximity to the vertical path and its constraints with a predefined level of confidence.  Application of this MOPS will enable assignment of a value to that level of confidence.  Following consideration of typical performance of existing equipment and systems, a vertical path performance limit (VPPL) that represents 99.7% performance has been chosen.  The VPPL is defined to be independent of the lateral containment limit. These",
    "has been chosen.  The VPPL is defined to be independent of the lateral containment limit. These limits and their corresponding assurance levels should be used to support the development of optimal RNP airspace and procedures.",
    "## Contribution To Increased Capacity\n\nIn certain regions of the world, current air traffic systems are at, or rapidly reaching capacity limits. Continued growth will rely on improvements in navigation, communication and surveillance techniques. The application of the path definition, position estimation and containment requirements in this document will assist the airspace planner in designing airspace or procedures which may support increased capacity.",
    "## User-Preferred Trajectories And Trajectory Based Operations\n\nThe concept of user-preferred trajectories may be a means to improve aircraft operations. The path definition and steering concepts of this document may be used to support conflict probing and detection which is regarded as an important element for the implementation of user-preferred trajectories.",
    "Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) represent a change in the CNS/ATM operations paradigm where flexibility and adaptability are introduced into airspace operations through aircraft flight trajectories that can be quickly created or redefined by ground planning and ATM systems, and communicated to and applied by the aircraft.  A core element of TBO is RNP which establishes the basis for aircraft performance and behavior in the airspace as well as for the new or revised procedures sent to the",
    "performance and behavior in the airspace as well as for the new or revised procedures sent to the aircraft.",
    "--`````,,,,,,,,`,``,,`,,`,```,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\n\n## Advanced Rnp Applications\n\nAdvanced RNP (A-RNP) is an ICAO navigation specification that combines several functional elements into one specification. Additional information can be found in Section 1.4.6.  \n\n## 1.4 Required Navigation Performance (Rnp) Area Navigation",
    "The CNS/ATM operating environment is expected to be based on navigation defined by geographic fixes.  Routes and instrument procedures will not be restricted to the location of ground-based navigation aids.  This concept, known as Area Navigation, is not new. An element that has been missing is the level of confidence of navigation accuracy.  The standards defined in the MASPS, DO-236C/ED-75D, integrate the concepts of Required Navigation Performance with that of Area Navigation to provide this",
    "the concepts of Required Navigation Performance with that of Area Navigation to provide this level of confidence.",
    "These standards also include optional vertical navigation and time of arrival control requirements. \n\n## Pbn And Rnp Concept\n\nPerformance-based navigation (PBN) has been defined in the ICAO PBN Manual. PBN (as defined by the ICAO PBN Manual):  Area navigation based on performance requirements for aircraft operating along an A\nTS route, on an instrument approach procedure or in a designated airspace.",
    "The ICAO PBN Manual also states: \nPerformance requirements are expressed in navigation specifications in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity and functionality needed for the proposed operation in the context of a particular airspace concept. Availability of GNSS signal in space (SIS) or some other NAVAID infrastructure is considered within the airspace concept in order to enable the navigation application.",
    "RNAV system (as defined by ICAO PBN Manual): A navigation system which permits aircraft operation on any desired flight path within the coverage of station-referenced NAVAIDs or within the limits of the capability of self-contained aids, or a combination of these. An RNAV system may be included as part of a flight management system (FMS). RNP system (as defined by ICAO PBN Manual):  An area navigation system which supports on-board performance monitoring and alerting.",
    "This MOPS represents the minimum requirements for RNP that enables manufacturer development of the airborne equipment that is installed into an airplane intended to perform RNP operations.  For clarity as well as to maintain consistency with RNP as defined by ICAO, the term RNP is used to describe MOPS equipment. The term \"RNP RNA\nV\" is only used when describing or discussing the aircraft system, performance, and more comprehensive capabilities defined in the MASPS, DO-236C.",
    "Additionally, the term \"VNA\nV\" has been further developed to address the vertical aspects that are expected to be associated with RNP operations.  All of these terms are described in Section 1.7.  \n\nNote: \n        The PBN manual has a Navigation Specification for RNP AR \n        operations. This MOPS does not address the equipment requirements \n        to support such operations. \n\n## Application Of The Term Rnp",
    "## Application Of The Term Rnp\n\nThe term RNP is applied as a descriptor for airspace, routes and procedures (including departures, arrivals, and instrument approach procedures).  The descriptor is flexible and can apply to a unique approach procedure or to a large region of airspace.  Examples of its use are RNP airspace, RNP route, etc.  \n\n## Navigation Accuracy",
    "This document uses the navigation accuracies, i.e. the RNP, that are consistent with those defined by the ICAO PBN Manual as the basis for establishing requirements.  These include those defined in the PBN navigation specifications for RNP APCH, Advanced RNP, RNP 0.3, RNP 1, RNP 2, and RNP 4.",
    "The committee also recognized that it is impossible to anticipate the complete range of potential applications of RNP requirements.  The requirements in this MOPS are intended to be applicable to any RNP, not only those that are described below.  While the accuracy and containment requirements in Section 2.0 of this document can be scaled to any RNP, the requirements in the MOPS apply to discrete values of RNP.  The following RNPs are intended to be applicable to the following initial",

Other equipment classes may choose to implement RNAV holding as defined in PANS-OPS Volume 1. However, equipment manufacturers are encouraged to incorporate the fly-by holding entries depicted in Appendix J as an interim step to RNP airspace implementation.  \nNote 2:  The TOAC function, as defined at the system level in DO-236C Change",
    "Note 2:  The TOAC function, as defined at the system level in DO-236C Change \n1 and ED-75D, is not sufficiently mature from a total ground/air system perspective and is therefore optional for RNP equipment.",
    "Note 3: Continuity has typically referred to complete loss of function. However, in this MOPS and other documents such as the MASPS and ICAO references, continuity is applied in the context of the RNP operation and the concept has been expanded to include the requirement that functions such as the current RNP, lateral containment, vertical path performance, and time of arrival control operations can be maintained.",
    "Note 4: The continuity requirement for A-RNP, 4.3.3.5.2.3 of the ICAO PBN \nManual, is about loss of function, and the committee agreed that the only correlation to the MOPS is to the loss of navigation performance requirement in 2.2.1.5.3.  Higher Continuity is associated with a dual system configuration. \n\n## 1.5 Assumptions",
    "## 1.5 Assumptions\n\nThe concept of RNP has been developed with the objective of defining all applicable requirements associated with navigation performance, including both airborne and external navigation elements. Airborne elements (e.g., engines, generators) other than those included as part of the navigation system are assumed to be functioning normally.",
    "This section states the assumptions that have been made within the MOPS for the purpose of defining the airborne requirements. These assumptions form requirements or guidance that must be followed by the external navigation elements to realize the airspace optimizations possible with RNP. \n\n## Navigation Infrastructure",
    "All navigation aids are assumed to comply with the signal-in-space assumptions defined in Appendix C. If a particular facility does not comply or a facility type is not authorized for use, it is assumed the facility is NOTAM'ed such that it can be inhibited from use for RNP operations. If a class of facilities does not comply (e.g., VOR facilities), it is assumed that navigation procedures are not based on those facilities and the procedure clearly identifies the sensor as not authorized.",
    "## Defining Airspace Rnp\n\nAs stated in the ICAO PBN Manual, RNP may be specified for a route, a number of routes, or airspace which an airspace planner or authority chooses.",
    "The RNP RNAV containment limit is intended to serve at least two purposes in the development of airspace.  It should provide a means to facilitate the safety assessments for separation and obstacle clearance in the development of routes, areas and procedures. By providing a demonstrated bound on error performance, it should enable reductions in separation buffers derived from traditional collision risk methods.  The containment limit is also a performance assurance element of the ICAO PBN",
    "risk methods.  The containment limit is also a performance assurance element of the ICAO PBN requirement for on-board performance monitoring and alerting.",
    "## Vnav\n\nVNAV is a tool to facilitate the application of vertical navigation (three dimensional point-to-point) for level flight and descent.  Due to the wide disparity of climb performance of different aircraft types, this MOPS does not address VNAV path definition requirements for the climb segment.  However, speed restrictions and altitude constraints must still be considered in all phases of flight.",
    "It is expected that the required implementation of speed restrictions as defined in this MOPS will be understood by regulatory authorities and airspace/procedure designers. The operational use of speed restrictions in the airspace must take care to reflect the actual avionics design for RNP RNAV systems.",
    "It is expected that airspace and procedure designs will take into account any deceleration required prior to a waypoint- or altitude-based speed restriction, as well as ensure the careful application of altitude constraints intended to define or bound a vertical flight path.",
    "For flight operations outside the final approach segment, it is expected that airspace and procedure designs will take into account the impact of horizontal coupling error (the vertical error resulting from horizontal along track position estimation error coupling through the desired vertical path). \n\n## Navigation Error\n\nThis document addresses all navigation errors associated with the RNP equipment, excluding those due to human error. \n\n## Navigation Data",
    "## Navigation Data\n\nThis MOPS assumes the navigation data is current and complies with RTCA/DO-\n201A/EUROCAE ED-77, Standards for Aeronautical Information, and all data is processed in accordance with the requirements of RTCA DO-200B/EUROCAE ED-\n76A, Standards for Processing Aeronautical Data.  \n\n## Reference Earth Model",
    "## Reference Earth Model\n\nAll navigation data is assumed to be referenced to the WGS-84 earth model in accordance with ICAO Annex 15 for lateral and precision landing path points.  All altitude data will be referenced to the MSL geoid and standard atmospheric pressure model.  \n--`````,,,,,,,,`,``,,`,,`,```,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\n \n\n## Desired Path\n\nAn RNP flight plan is generally defined by a series of fixes derived from one or several of the following ATS Route \"types\" (per ICAO definition):",

    "RNP routes and user preferred trajectories are assumed to use a series of fixes. The desired path is defined by a series of geodesic tracks joining successive fixes. Also, RNP procedures are assumed to use the path/terminator (legs) concept for SIDs, STARs, and Instrument approaches.  The desired path is defined by a series of path/terminators (leg types). The procedure designer should note that only a limited set of leg types are allowed for RNP procedures (see Section 2.2.1.2).",
    "Note: These assumptions have been made in order to maintain compatibility with existing database specifications, as stated in Aeronautical Radio, Inc. (ARINC) 424 Specification, titled Navigation System Database.",
    "## Flight Plan Leg Transitions Lateral",
    "For airspace planning purposes, when transitioning between flight path legs, the RNP is assumed to be the largest RNP associated with the two legs defining the transition (e.g., when transitioning from an RNP 1 leg to an RNP 0.3 leg, the airspace planners will assume transition containment based on RNP 1).

    "Note: Applying an offset to the RF or FRT for large course changes may result in unflyable paths. \n\nIf fly-over transitions are used, for example at the missed approach point, the leg following the fly-over fix is assumed not to have the requirements of RNP applied to it, as far as the path is not repeatable and airspace protection cannot follow the RNP concept.",
    "If a fixed radius transition at a fix along a route is used, the transition is assumed to be specified in the navigation data base. \n\n## Vertical\n\nWhen transitioning from one profile segment to another, (e.g., level flight to descent, descent to level flight, or from one descent profile to another, etc.) the vertical path performance limit is assumed to be consistent with the airspace limits on either side of the transition.",
    "VNAV as described in this document is based upon the vertical fly-by transition.  The vertical fly-by is a controlled maneuver between two vertical path segments (reference Section 2.2.2.2.6.1.3) such that a smooth transition onto the next vertical path segment is performed.  It is assumed the procedure designer will use the vertical fly-by in their assessment of obstacle identification and vertical separation.

Where vertical fly-by transitions occur, it is assumed that the airborne systems will provide a means for lookahead maneuver anticipation (e.g. constant \"g\" capture) and guidance such that the aircraft altitude will follow a known trajectory.  The procedure designer is assumed to use this in assessments of obstacle identification and vertical separation.",
    "## Datalink Considerations",
    "Where existing legacy datalink interfaces, such as those for FANS, are used to create an ad hoc ATC clearance in RNP airspace (i.e., a route or procedure not contained in the navigation database), the clearance lacks the capability to specify a performance requirement for the fixes and legs to be flown.    Additionally, the same datalink interface will also preclude the specification of procedures containing turns with a fixed-radius.",
    "ATC and Operators should consider this in the implementation of PBN operations that utilize datalink. As the ATM system evolves, the digital air/ground datalink interface will become an integral part of path definition through uplinks of pre-defined procedures to be used from the airborne navigation database or fixes that the system must use to create a route or procedure.  It is expected that when the next generation of datalink services is implemented, the datalink interface will have the",

    "## Polar Navigation\n\nTerminal area operations with an associated RNP are assumed not to be conducted at latitudes north of 85° N and south of 85° S. In these regions, holding patterns, parallel offset functions and desired track changes larger than 45° are assumed not to be required. \n\n## Dispatch Assessment",
    "The dispatch assessment for an intended aircraft operation within RNP airspace is assumed to consider the available navigation infrastructure, including serviceability of State-identified facilities, relating to the intended routes, procedures, etc.  If the aircraft operation intends to derive navigation performance from other than those facilities, an assessment should be performed to ensure that the alternative sensor source, when used by the navigation equipment, conforms with the accuracy,",

    "There are a number of error sources and error terms that must be considered when evaluating RNP compliance. Figure 1-2 shows the error terms considered in the crosstrack dimension. These terms refer to the actual error, and not an uncertainty. In addition, this MOPS defines only the lateral (cross-track) errors for path definition and path steering.

    "Several terms are introduced by this MOPS in order to define the additional requirements, beyond accuracy, applied to a particular RNP. The foundation of these parameters is the concept of containment. It proposes that a region around the desired path can be defined, and that the probability that the aircraft does not remain within that region can be bounded. The term *containment* as used by this MOPS is the same as on-board performance monitoring and alerting as described in the ICAO PBN",

    "depicts the parameters associated with containment in the cross-track dimension. The definitions of these terms can be found below.",
    "The containment integrity and containment continuity requirements define the allowable probabilities of certain types of failure for the navigation system. In particular, the integrity requirement limits the probability of a malfunction of the navigation system which causes the cross track component of total system error to exceed the cross-track containment limit associated with the current RNP without annunciation. The continuity requirements limit the probability of loss of function, which",
    "without annunciation. The continuity requirements limit the probability of loss of function, which occurs when the system indicates that it is no longer RNP capable. In this context, function or *RNP capability*, is defined as the ability to meet the containment integrity requirements.

    "Figure 1-5 illustrates the possible system operational states at a given instant in time. The two containment related requirements can be interpreted with the help of this diagram. In the figure, C represents the applicable containment limit, which is twice the RNP, and TSE refers to the cross-track Total System Error (TSE).",
    "Subset E2 represents the set of events associated with lack of knowledge of the true value of TSE, hence it is the measure of system integrity relative to the containment limit. The containment integrity requirement is intended to limit the exposure of the aircraft to conditions where the containment limit is exceeded without annunciation. This corresponds to the probability that the TSE can be greater than the containment limit without knowledge of the system or its user. This probability,",
    "greater than the containment limit without knowledge of the system or its user. This probability, P(E2), must be less than",
    "10-5 per flight hour.",
    "Subset E3 represents the set of events associated with annunciation that the system is not RNP capable for any reason, including hardware failures, performance degradation, etc. This does not necessarily mean the system is unusable, but only that the capability for the current RNP has been lost or has been falsely annunciated as lost. The containment continuity requirement is intended to limit the frequency that this event occurs, and it includes all possible events that cause the system to",

    "Showing compliance to RNP involves evaluating P(E2) and P(E3) relative to the \ncontainment limit, as well as demonstrating that the applicable existing requirements are \nmet. The first of these two requirements effectively limits the aircraft exposure to a \npotentially unsafe operation. The second limits the frequency that the crew is advised \nthat the navigation system is no longer fully RNP capable, that is, it is not RNP capable",

That is, P(E2) = Pr(TSE > containment limit and no warning is given).",
    "CONTAINMENT CONTINUITY:  The capability of the total system to satisfy the containment integrity requirement without nonscheduled interruptions during the intended operation. Nonscheduled interruption in operation is defined to be either 1) total loss of navigation capability; 2) a failure of the system which is annunciated as loss of RNP capability, or 3) a false annunciation of loss of RNP capability while the system is working properly. Containment continuity is specified by the maximum",

The input voltage shall be measured at the input terminals of the equipment under test.",
    "b.\nPower Input Frequency 1.\nIn the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC power source of essentially constant frequency (e.g. 400 Hz), the input frequency shall be adjusted\nto design frequency +/- 2%.\n2.",
    "to design frequency +/- 2%.\n2.\nIn the case of equipment designed for operation from an AC power source of variable frequency (e.g. 300 to 1000 Hz), unless otherwise specified, the test shall be conducted with the input frequency adjusted to within 5% of a selected frequency and within the range for which the equipment is designed.\nc.\nAdjustment of Equipment",
    "c.\nAdjustment of Equipment\nThe equipment shall be properly aligned and otherwise adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practices prior to the application of the specified tests.",
    "d.\nTest Instrument Precautions\nDuring the tests, due precautions shall be taken to prevent the introduction of errors resulting from the connection of voltmeters, oscilloscopes, and other test instruments across the input and output impedances of the equipment under test.\n\ne.\nAmbient Conditions\nUnless otherwise specified, all tests shall be conducted under conditions of ambient room temperature, pressure, and humidity. However, the room temperature shall not be lower than 10 degrees C.",
    "f.\nWarm-up Period\nUnless otherwise specified, all tests shall be conducted after the manufacturer's specified warm up period.\n\ng. Connected Loads \nUnless otherwise specified, all tests shall be performed with the equipment connected to loads having the impedance values for which it is designed. \n\n## Types Of Tests And Cross Reference Bench Testing",
    "Two distinct types of bench testing should be performed. These are referred to as static and dynamic tests.",
    "Static tests comprise precise inputs to verify that input signal and data processing is accomplished so that outputs are within specified range, resolution and scale factor limits. Static bench tests should be designed such that the equipment performance and operation are compatible with the initial conditions of the test (e.g. the system should allow for state conditions which lack a dynamic history). Dynamic tests provide quantitative data regarding RNP equipment performance using a",
    "history). Dynamic tests provide quantitative data regarding RNP equipment performance using a simplified simulation of flight conditions. This testing, when properly performed and documented, will minimize the flight test requirements. It is the responsibility of the equipment manufacturer to demonstrate that the fidelity of the dynamic simulation of navigation sensor performance is sufficient to meet the test requirement.",
    "For dynamic testing, the equipment manufacturer has the option to select aircraft type and aircraft speeds, but they should be appropriate for the intended equipment market and application. The fidelity of the response of the simulated aircraft to guidance commands generated by the equipment is left up to the equipment manufacturer.",
    "## Equipment Class Requirements And Test Cross Reference\n\nTable 2-13 provides a cross reference of the requirements of Section 2.2, the RNP equipment classes, and the tests contained in this section and in Section 3.0. The compliance method is indicated as follows:",

The analysis shall include the effects of all factors appropriate to the design of the equipment and its intended installations. \n\n## 4. Operational Characteristics 4.1 Introduction",
    "The conduct of RNP operations is predicated upon the reliability, repeatability, predictability, and performance assurance of the RNP equipment. RNP airspace operation will be dictated by RNP requirements that are intended to support operational requirements for enhanced safety and efficiency. However, in order to enable RNP operations with qualified systems it is necessary to describe a number of considerations that must be taken into account.\n\n## 4.2 Rnp Capability And Display",
    "## 4.2 Rnp Capability And Display\n\nThe display of navigation data to the flight crew will depend on the system installation. The required information should enable the flight crew to have situational awareness of all RNP total system error (TSE) parameters necessary to understand and conduct an RNP operation. Where the system installation follows the predefined performance allocations of this MOPS, the significant information that will be used by the flight crew will include:",
    "•\ncrosstrack deviation,\n•\nestimated positioning uncertainty on an equipment control display, and\n•\nthe allowed operating modes e.g. manual control with CDI, manual control with\nmap, flight director, etc, for the specified RNP type.",
    "Where the installed equipment configuration results in a different allocation of system performance from that in this MOPS, error parameters such as path definition error or display error may be affected. In this case, the required system analysis for the reallocation of the TSE parameters will be required to ensure appropriate information is developed to support flight crew understanding of the relationship of all TSE parameters that are presented to them for display or monitoring, and the",
    "relationship of all TSE parameters that are presented to them for display or monitoring, and the allowed operating modes.",
    "For equipment complying with the requirements of the MOPS, the intended use of the indication of Estimate of Position Uncertainty (EPU) is to provide the flight crew a measure of confidence of the system's RNP capability. However, it should be understood that due to implementation choices, what the EPU display represents and how it correlates to other RNP parameters such as FTE or display error may vary between different equipment. The equipment information should make this clear and how EPU",
    "may vary between different equipment. The equipment information should make this clear and how EPU relates to the RNP and RNP",
    "alerting.",
    "Note: \n        The requirement to provide a TSE caution that indicates the navigation \n        system's inability to comply with current RNP RNAV requirements is not \n        intended to specify a particular implementation. Examples for three \n        possible choices are:",
    "a. A system with real-time estimation of position uncertainty and\nmonitoring of FTE. In this case, a caution may be activated when the combination of position uncertainty and FTE exceeds the budgeted\ndesign limit for total system error.\nb. A system where the caution would be activated when either the position\nuncertainty or FTE becomes unacceptable. In this case, system compliance would be demonstrated by the allocation of the requirements of Section 2.2.1.5 to each potential source and",
    "monitoring those error sources separately. An installation with a TSO-\nC129A navigator, CDI display and alert light is one possible example of this type.",
    "c. A system where a caution would be activated when the position\nuncertainty exceeds an allocated design limit. In this case, the system\nimplementation is demonstrated through test and analysis to show that the FTE is inherently bounded, i.e. FTE is not a measured parameter in the monitoring and alerting. An installation with a Flight Management System, Map or CDI display, and Alerting system is one possible example of this type.\n\n## 4.3 Rnp Selection",
    "In the conduct of operations and procedures with an associated RNP, it is expected that the RNP will be included with the appropriate RNP procedures residing in the equipment navigation database. It is also expected that when the flight crew selects such a procedure, the equipment will recognize and utilize the RNP.",
    "The equipment contains capability not only to use the RNP from the navigation database, but if there is none, to also utilize a manually entered RNP (flight crew) or an uplinked RNP (datalink). If there is a database RNP, it may be manually overridden by the flight crew. The flight crew will receive an annunciation when manually entering an RNP that is larger than the navigation database RNP.",
    "Note: \nSome equipment may contain an additional capability for default RNP \nthat may be overridden by either the RNP in the database procedure or by flight crew manual entry. This level of flexibility should be considered for normal operations as well as those where there may be a procedural requirement for changing the RNP.  \n\n## 4.4 Rnp Rnav Containment Continuity Effect",
    "The following is additional explanatory material related to Section 2.2.1.5.3. The loss of all airborne navigation capability is classified as major, where the probability of loss is 10-5 per hour.  Where the airborne navigation system includes a capability for RNP operation, the probability of annunciated loss of RNP RNAV capability for an RNP",
    "is 10-4 per hour. The result is that there may be instances where the annunciated loss of RNP RNAV capability is followed by the condition where the remaining navigation capability may be insufficient for the initiation or continued conduct of the RNP operation without an alternative basis for aircraft navigation. In the conduct of RNP operations, specifically terminal and approach, predicated upon an RNP RNAV capability and continuity, the probability of 0.01% may also be inadequate for",
    "upon an RNP RNAV capability and continuity, the probability of 0.01% may also be inadequate for certain types of operations. What is acceptable and operationally allowable will be based upon consideration of what level of capability and performance is required for the whole flight procedure including the missed approach. Where this issue applies, it could be resolved by increased equipment redundancy/availability or an aircraft limitation precluding the conduct of such procedures.",
    "## 4.5 Equipment Operating Limitation\n\nTo conduct RNP operations safely and reliably, the RNP equipment operating manual, and when installed, the aircraft flight manual (AFM) will include any equipment operating limitation(s) impacting RNP operations. These limitations will include any equipment limitations that help prevent an unexpected loss of containment and a resultant loss of RNP RNAV capability and encompass other known operational restrictions or prohibitions.",
    "Note: \n        RNP RNAV containment requirements will rely on available \n        infrastructure and the associated navigation sensors. The equipment \n        operating limitations in the AFM enable an operator to determine \n        whether or not the aircraft equipment meets or exceeds these \n        requirements. For example, if use of DME/DME is the sole basis of an \n        operator's RNP airworthiness certification, then the AFM must clearly",
    "operator's RNP airworthiness certification, then the AFM must clearly \n        state this basis. Then, if a State prohibits use of DME/DME for RNP \n        operations and bases their RNP operations on use of GPS, the operator \n        should be able to discern that their equipment would not support RNP \n        operations in that State's airspace",
    "## 4.6 Navigation Facility Selection\n\nThe requirement to tune and select navaids should be commensurate with RNP equipment design.  RNP equipment designed using only spaced-based navaids are not required to tune and select ground-based navaids.  RNP equipment using ground-based navaids or inertial navigation equipment are required to use spaced-based navaids for RNP operations. \n\nThis Page Intentionally Left Blank",

    "For each of the hardware components, a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) must be performed in the traditional manner. All component failures must be analyzed to determine if they could lead to the display of erroneous navigation data and, if a failure can do so, it must be determined whether or not the internal tests of the unit can detect the failure. This analysis results in the value of the MTBF shown in the representation of the hardware units. This is the average time from a \"no",
    "of the MTBF shown in the representation of the hardware units. This is the average time from a \"no failure\" condition to a first failure which would cause erroneous or degraded navigation. The probability of detection and its corollary, missed detection are both shown in the small boxes to the sides of each unit. The product of the probability per hour of this type of failure and the detection or missed detection probability leads to the desired per hour probabilities of undetected or detected",
    "missed detection probability leads to the desired per hour probabilities of undetected or detected failures. The failure probabilities (per hour) are combined in the diagram according to the configuration of the system being analyzed. For example, both systems have DME and VOR receivers, the DME receivers were found to have an MTBF of 2000 hours for failures that lead to misleading navigation outputs. For the example, they were assumed to have internal built-in test equipment (BITE) that had a",
    "For the example, they were assumed to have internal built-in test equipment (BITE) that had a 95% probability of detecting this type of error, allowing 5% to go undetected. The combination of MTBF and BITE detection results in the calculated undetected and detected failure probabilities for the equipment shown in the diagrams. Substantiation of these values will take the usual form of a BITE analysis and an FMEA performed on the components. The VOR receiver was assumed less reliable, with an",
    "and an FMEA performed on the components. The VOR receiver was assumed less reliable, with an MTBF of 1400 hours, with the same level of built-in test capability. Similarly, the navigation computer and the navigation display were assumed to have typical failure rates, with the computer having an MTBF of 2300 hours and the display having 3500 hours. These are hardware driven failure probabilities, and do not relate to the TSE or the measurement screening processes in the navigation computer. The",

    "## B.2.2 Sensor Error Detection",
    "Most systems which utilize a computer to estimate position from DME/DME or VOR/DME data include some type of reasonableness testing to reject extremely noisy data and/or the occasional \"outlier\". The example presented here includes this testing by showing a fault box labeled \"Probability of Nav Sensor Error\". The probability represented is the probability of an undetected fault in either in-use receiver. This is shown on both figures as a line from the output \"or\" gate for the paired receivers.",

Referring to the table below, a simple relationship is proposed for this example. The assumption is that as the containment limit becomes smaller,",

The assumption is that as the containment limit becomes smaller, the tests become less likely to be able to detect sensor errors which could cause containment violation.

C represents the containment limit, D(C) is the probability that a sensor error not detected in hardware BITE will remain undetected by the DME/DME reasonableness tests and V(C) represents the same for the VOR/DME mode. For this example, both of the functions D(C) and V(C) are dependent on the size of the required containment limit C, which equals two times",

The detection probability is one minus the miss probability and is shown as D3 (or V3) on the figure.

One method of arriving at the probabilities D(C) for a specific navigation algorithm would be to use a Monte Carlo simulation.

Once the sensor normal operation is characterized, its non-normal performance must be characterized, for",
    "the sensor normal operation is characterized, its non-normal performance must be characterized, for instance, DME location in navigation data could be in error. Analogously, making an estimate of V(C) must also evaluate normal and non-normal error sources.

This could be done by",
    "and scalloping associated with the environment in which the VOR operates.  This could be done by adding elements to the error model of Appendix C. Once the values for D(C) and V(C) are estimated, the data rejection algorithms from the navigation computer must be tested against the model of normal and non-normal error occurrence in the simulation.",
    "One method would be to define a path through a region of operation, say Europe (dense navaid coverage), USA western regions (less dense), and Africa or Australia (very sparse coverage). These paths would then be flown repeatedly with different initial navigation errors (statistically drawn). Each navaid tuned would be randomly assigned a data base error initially (position error) and as it is used, the statistics for normal operation would be applied at each sample taken. The program would need",
    "the statistics for normal operation would be applied at each sample taken. The program would need to record at least the following relative to the containment or test threshold: the number of false detections (navaid data is ok but algorithm rejects it), the number of missed detections (navaid data is not ok but algorithm accepts it), and the number of correct detections (navaid data is not ok and algorithm rejects it). Once this data is gathered for sufficient trial flights to make the",
    "ok and algorithm rejects it). Once this data is gathered for sufficient trial flights to make the estimate statistically robust, one can compute the probability D(C), and the same could be done for V(C). The analysis of the entire system can then proceed as described in the diagrams and evaluation sections of this appendix.",
    "## B.2.3 Position Error Analysis",
    "The last basic element which must be defined is the total system error including the position estimation error statistics and the path steering error statistics involved in the use of the system. The position estimation error statistics are different for the two modes of operation. For this example, the position estimation error was assumed to be Gaussian with zero mean and variance dependent upon mode of operation. For both modes it was assumed that the position estimation error can be",
    "upon mode of operation. For both modes it was assumed that the position estimation error can be characterized as a bivariate Gaussian probability density function with an approximately equal standard deviation in both principal directions. The standard deviations used for this analysis were 0.2 NM for DME/DME and 0.4 NM for VOR/DME. These errors assume range and reasonableness limits on the use of DME and VOR data. The path steering error was assumed Gaussian in the cross track direction with a",
    "DME and VOR data. The path steering error was assumed Gaussian in the cross track direction with a standard deviation of 0.05 NM, representative of autopilot coupled flight. Therefore, for the combined density the standard deviations for total system error in the cross track direction are essentially unchanged due to PSE.",
    "For the navigation computer that is defined in this MOPS, the only error sources that apply in this section are the path definition error and the position estimation error. The TSE is representative of normal operations; therefore, the evaluation of both position and path definition errors must be carried out for normal operations. Once again, the sensor errors must be defined, as in B.2.2, and a statistical estimate of horizontal error due to the particular position estimation algorithm used",
    "a statistical estimate of horizontal error due to the particular position estimation algorithm used in the navigation computer though use of Monte Carlo simulation. Further, one needs to show that when normal operation does not meet the RNP allocation to the navigation computer, there is an alert compliant with the MASPS.",
    "An analysis of the path definition algorithms must also be carried out globally; with samples measured relative to the exact WGS-84 geodesic computations. An aggregate statistic can be compiled to enter into the analysis, or, if one uses WGS-84 geodesic computations for path, there will be no contribution to TSE from this source. If a path steering error monitor had been included, for example under an assumption of pilot flying using CDI and monitoring being required, the analysis diagrams",

This appendix describes the geometry of the WGS-84 ellipsoid, and defines the geodetic latitude and longitude of a point on that ellipsoid. An example algorithm is then given for solving the following, which is called the inverse problem of geodesy:",

    "The corresponding problem on the surface of a sphere has the following well-known and elementary solution. Suppose that one is given a pair of distinct, nonantipodal points on the surface of a sphere. (Recall that two (distinct) points on the surface of an ellipsoid are said to be antipodal if they are located symmetrically with respect to the center of the ellipsoid). Then these two points, together with the center of the sphere, determine a plane.",
    "This plane intersects the surface of the sphere in two circular arcs which together form a circle called a great circle. The shorter of these two circular arcs is the shortest path on the surface of the sphere which joins the prescribed points.",
    "For two antipodal points on the surface of a sphere, there are infinitely many planes which contain both of those points and which also contain, the center of the sphere. Any of the circular arcs determined by the intersection of one of these planes with the surface of the sphere will be a geodesic. Hence, the problem does not have a unique solution in this case.",
    "On a nonspherical, ellipsoid, the situation is considerably different. (It is therefore inappropriate to refer to geodesics on a nonspherical ellipsoid as \"great circles\"). In particular, the only geodesics which are plane curves are those which lie along a meridian or along the equator [reference 1]. Furthermore, the geodesic can in general be computed to an arbitrary level of accuracy only iteratively. The iterative algorithms presented here were published in [reference 2], and will yield",
    "The iterative algorithms presented here were published in [reference 2], and will yield accuracy to within fractions of a millimeter if the termination criterion ε is taken to be 10-12 (unless the two points are antipodal, or nearly antipodal.

    "## E.2 Definition Of Terms",
    "Throughout this appendix, the term ellipsoid will specifically refer to an ellipsoid of revolution, obtained by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis. The points at which the minor axis intersects the surface of the ellipsoid are called the North and South poles. The plane which passes through the center of the ellipsoid and which is normal to the minor axis is called the equatorial plane. The equatorial plane intersects the surface of the ellipsoid in a circle, called the equator.",
    "The geodetic latitude of a point on an ellipsoid is the angle between the equatorial plane and the outward normal vector at that point on the ellipsoid. This angle is taken to be positive in the Northern Hemisphere and negative in the Southern Hemisphere.",
    "Any plane which is orthogonal to the equatorial plane and which passes through the center of the ellipsoid intersects the surface of the ellipsoid in an ellipse, called a meridian. One of these meridians is arbitrarily selected as a reference, and is called the Greenwich meridian. The longitude of a point on the ellipsoid is determined by the angle between the plane that contains the meridian passing through that point, and the plane which contains the Greenwich meridian. (The longitude of",

    "A curve that is traversed in a specified direction is said to be oriented. The bearing of an oriented smooth curve on an ellipsoid describes the direction of the tangent vector to that curve, at a particular point on that curve. Bearing is usually expressed in degrees, measured clockwise from local North.

This method is valid to 36,000 ft (11000 m).  \n\nNote: \n Lapse rate (Lo) is defined as a negative number in order to be consistent\nwith the ICAO equations. As an example a lapse rate of 2o K per 1000 ft \n= -0.002. \n\n## H.2.5 Displays And Alerting",
    "## H.2.5 Displays And Alerting\n\nThe RNP equipment shall clearly differentiate the display of temperature compensated altitudes from uncompensated altitudes. The RNP equipment shall also clearly indicate the altitudes being used to define the path, and shall provide the means to support their display.",
    "Note 1:  One acceptable means to meet this requirement is to display both the \nuncompensated altitude and the compensated altitude to the flight crew, or make the uncompensated altitude readily available to the crew.  The flight crew may also benefit from a display of the difference between the uncompensated altitude and the compensated altitude.  Meeting this requirement can create clarity between the charted, procedural altitudes",
    "or manually entered altitudes (i.e. ATC-assigned altitudes) vs. the \ntemperature compensated altitudes. \nIf the RNP equipment provides the capability to automatically set the altitude select window on a flight guidance system, and temperature compensation is in use, the compensated altitude shall be displayed in the altitude select window. If the RNP equipment displays the flight path angle, the displayed angle shall match the angle extracted from the navigation database.",
    "Note 2:  The FPA extracted from the navigation database is a geometric angle, \nand is the FPA the procedure designer intends the aircraft to fly \nregardless of the temperature.  The application of temperature compensation has therefore no impact on the display of that angle.",
    "When temperature compensation results in an altitude conflict (e.g. commanded climb while in descent phase of an instrument approach procedure), the RNP equipment shall provide an annunciation suitable to prompt flight crew action.   \nIf the display of predicted waypoint altitudes is implemented, the predicted altitudes shall be on the temperature compensated path.",
    "## H.2.6 Reasonableness Checks\n\nThe RNP equipment shall provide a means to check the reasonableness of the temperature entry.",
    "Note 1: The RNP equipment may use air data from other independent systems to \nsupport this type of function. \nNote 2: The reasonableness check may be a function of the worst case ISA \ndeviations at the altimeter source for the altitudes the RNP equipment corrects.  For example, the RNP equipment may assume worst case ISA \ndeviations of ±\n 50o C. Thus, for a manually entered MDA/DA of 250 feet, \nthe error bound on the compensation would nominally be no greater than \n± 53 feet.",
    "## H.2.7 System Interface Data And Output Considerations",
    "Since the temperature compensation function of the RNP equipment provides compensation solely for the instrument approach procedure, the temperature entered for this temperature compensation function may not be appropriate for other aircraft functions using temperature.",
    "However, when the RNP equipment enables temperature compensation during an instrument approach procedure, the compensation effects on the flight path angle and altitude constraints may be appropriate for use by other systems as intent information (e.g. ADS-C). The design requirements for terrain awareness systems (TAWS) account for temperature effects; consequently the application of the RNP equipment's temperature compensation function to the TAWS function may not be appropriate.",
    "## H.2.8 Temperature Compensation And Qfe\n\nQFE operations are not addressed by this MOPS.  However, if the RNP equipment supports both temperature compensation and QFE operations, the requirements of this Appendix shall also apply to QFE operations.",
    "Note:  \nQFE is the barometric altimeter setting that will cause the aircraft's \naltimeter to read the height above a specific airport or ground level, and therefore read zero on landing. QNH is the barometric altimeter setting that will cause the aircraft's altimeter to read altitude above mean sea \nlevel within a certain defined region. With respect to temperature",
    "level within a certain defined region. With respect to temperature \ncompensation, the only difference between instrument approach operations using QNH altimeter setting and QFE operations is the altimeter reference setting. Similar to QNH, QFE operations base",
    "minimum IFR altitudes on terrain and obstacle clearance.  Thus, QFE operations encounter the same effects from ISA deviations and will encounter the same effects on an RNP equipment's use of barometric altitude.  As a result, aircraft conducting QFE operations can benefit from the RNP equipment's application of temperature compensation. \n--`````,,,,,,,,`,``,,`,,`,```,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---",

If the fix lies in the vicinity of top of descent, the equipment may apply either above behavior.",
    "Note 5: The rationale for the requirement in the vicinity of top of descent is due to possible movement of the descent path upon insertion of the time constraint causing the placement of the time constraint fix as being in cruise or descent to be indeterminate.

The TOAC function may continue to update its speed as long as the speed is not used for control.",
    "Note 7: The tracking of TOAC speed may resume when the aircraft has returned to a defined lateral path, if appropriate and feasible, as determined by pilot / controller procedures.   \nNote 8: ATC expectation is that when vectored off path, aircraft will maintain their speed, thus this requirement is meant to fulfill that expectation by maintaining the current TOAC target speed when departing the lateral path even though the target may continue to be updated for later use.",

RNP path design is expected to be a coordinated effort between those responsible for procedure design and those whose aircraft and systems are expected to fly the procedures.  If the path construction criteria is applied with such coordination, where the aircraft will be in the airspace and how the aircraft will fly the procedure will be",
    "where the aircraft will be in the airspace and how the aircraft will fly the procedure will be predictable and understandable.  This appendix example illustrates situations where small excursions may occur outside window-based geometric path boundaries of the descent profile discussed in Section 2.2.2.2.6.1.  It also illustrates the case where consecutive hard altitude constraints require a geometric vertical path between the constraints from which no such deviations are allowed.",
    "## Q.2 Descent Path Examples Q.2.1 Window-Based Containment Boundaries",
    "As specified in Section 2.2.2.2.6, for descents planned between any order of window and hard altitude constraints that allow maneuvering, the geometric path boundaries between the constraints are meant to limit off-path excursions, and keep the aircraft aligned with the flow of the arrival.  However, small excursions are allowed and expected when deceleration is necessary but not accounted for in the path slope implied by the progression of constraints. RNP equipment will routinely compute",
    "in the path slope implied by the progression of constraints. RNP equipment will routinely compute performance paths for minimum thrust, and short shallow segments that facilitate aircraft deceleration to meet speed restrictions.  These computed segments may briefly cross a geometric boundary, but will return shortly once the excess energy has been dissipated, and will always cross on the correct side of any altitude constraints (Figure Q-1).",
    "RNP equipment should not intentionally compute level segments followed by a descent, through a series of descent constraints just for the purpose of remaining at a higher altitude (\"keep high\" strategy).  The RNP equipment also should not intentionally compute a steep descent and level off at the next constraint altitude (\"dive and drive\" strategy).",
    "Note:  \n         Both of the above strategies may have other disadvantages.  For example, \n         the \"keep high\" aircraft may inadvertently cross an ATC sector boundary \n         while in level flight, resulting in ATC workload to accommodate it.  \n         Additionally, when operating in an Interval Management environment, \n         either strategy in descent may cause loss of longitudinal separation with \n         a preceding or following aircraft due to the difference in groundspeed",
    "a preceding or following aircraft due to the difference in groundspeed \n         caused by the altitude difference while both aircraft maintain the same \n         airspeed in descent.",
    "Arrival and approach procedures that are designed to take into account aircraft performance \nand deceleration needs will allow RNP equipment to compute optimized performance and \ndeceleration segments that remain within the geometric boundaries defined by the altitude \nconstraints. \n\n## Q.2.2 Geometric Point-To-Point Paths",
    "## Q.2.2 Geometric Point-To-Point Paths\n\nFor additional clarification of intent; it is a further requirement of Section 2.2.2.2.6 that, in the case of a computed path between two AT altitude constraints, without any intermediate altitude constraints, the RNP equipment will compute a simple straight line between the AT constraints (i.e. a geometric point-to-point path). No optimized paths, shallow segments, or deceleration slopes will be computed (Figure Q-2).",
    "Note: \nEquipment designers should take into consideration that the descent \ngradient of the resulting GPP path may have been intentionally designed to be 1.5 degree or less, and this gradient should be respected by the RNP equipment.",
    "If this defined path intercepts an altitude-based speed restriction, or the lower waypoint also has a speed restriction, this path construction can only be achieved when the procedure design ensures that the slope of the geometric path takes into account the deceleration requirement.  \n--`````,,,,,,,,`,``,,`,,`,```,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---"
