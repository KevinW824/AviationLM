Compliance with these standards is recommended as one means of assuring that the equipment will perform its intended function(s) satisfactorily under all conditions normally encountered in routine aeronautical operation. Any regulatory application of this document is the sole responsibility of appropriate governmental agencies.",
    "Section 1 of this document provides information needed to understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated in the remaining sections. It describes typical equipment operations and operation goals, as envisioned by the members of RTCA Special Committee 186 (SC-186) and EUROCAE Working Group 51 (WG-51), and establishes the basis for the standards stated in Sections 2 through 3.

    "## 1.2 System Overview",
    "The ASA system provides the avionics for the surveillance processing and display of aircraft-to-aircraft applications.  It is part of the larger aviation system described in the ASA MASPS (DO-289) and the avionics performing the functions needed to support or perform the applications developed by RTCA SC-186 and EUROCAE WG-51, ATSA-AIRB (DO-319/ED-164), ATSA-VSA (DO-314/ED-160), ATSA-ITP (DO-312/\nED-159) ATSA-SURF (DO-322/ED-165), TSAA (DO-348/ED-232), and CAVS \n(DO-354/ED-233).",
    "## 1.2.1 Aircraft Surveillance Applications",
    "The ASA MASPS includes three major subsystems.  Figure 1-1 provides an overview of the standard ASA architecture and depicts the interfaces between functional elements for an ASA aircraft participant. Note that the ADS-B transmit and receive subsystems are specified in DO-260() / EUROCAE ED-102() and DO-282() and ED-108() for the 1090 \nMHz and Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) and Very High Frequency Data Link Mode 4 (VDL4) systems respectively.",
    "This ASA system MOPS specifies the two standard subsystems for the ASA Receive Participant:",
    "•\nSurveillance data processing subsystem: ASSAP.\n•\nDisplay and control subsystem: CDTI.\nThe blocks in Figure 1-1 labeled ASSAP and CDTI collectively are referred to as the ASA system and are the scope of this document.  The ASA system also interfaces with other aircraft systems.",
    "Appendix J describes the system interfaces depicted in Figure J-1.  It also provides a mapping of latency requirements to relevant SPR and other MOPS documents. Traffic Information Service-Broadcast (TIS-B) messages are generated from information obtained through ground surveillance systems.  TIS-B messages are broadcast by the TIS-B Transmit Subsystem. ADS-B Rebroadcast (ADS-R) provides traffic information to equipped aircraft based on ADS-B transmission from aircraft on independent data links",
    "to equipped aircraft based on ADS-B transmission from aircraft on independent data links",
    "(1090ES and UAT and VDL4).  \nADS-B, TIS-B and ADS-R messages are received by the ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B Receive Subsystem at the receiving ASA Aircraft/Vehicle (A/V).  The ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B Receive Subsystem processes these messages and provides ADS-B, TIS-B, and ADS-R \ntraffic reports to ASSAP.",
    "## 1.2.2 Asa System Function",
    "The ASA system provides the platform for the processing and display of the ASA applications.  This document includes requirements to support applications approved by SC-186 and EUROCAE WG-51.  The applications are described in Section §1.3.",
    "In order to provide more complete traffic situation awareness, the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) display should be integrated with the CDTI on aircraft equipped with TCAS.  This document provides requirements and guidance for integration of TCAS with the ASA system.  See Appendix B.  TCAS in this document is meant to include all versions of certified traffic advisory systems (TAS), TCAS and TCAS II (including hybrid surveillance).",
    "## 1.2.2.1 Assap\n\nASSAP is the processing subsystem that accepts surveillance inputs (e.g., ADS-B \nreports), performs surveillance processing to provide reports and tracks, and performs application-specific processing.  Surveillance reports, tracks, and any application-specific alerts or guidance are output by ASSAP to the CDTI function.  ASSAP surveillance processing consists of track processing and correlation of ADS-B, TIS-B, ADS-R, and TCAS reports.  \n\n## 1.2.2.2 Cdti",
    "The CDTI subsystem includes the actual display media and the necessary controls to interface with the flight crew.  Thus the CDTI consists of all displays and controls necessary to support the applications.  The controls may be a dedicated CDTI control panel or it may be incorporated into other controls, (e.g., multifunction control display unit [MCDU] or Electronic Flight Bag [EFB]). Similarly, the CDTI display may be a stand-alone display or displays (dedicated display(s)) or the CDTI",
    "the CDTI display may be a stand-alone display or displays (dedicated display(s)) or the CDTI information may be present on an existing display(s) (e.g., multi-function display) or an EFB.

This may require dedicated test traffic. Previous flight tests (conducted for TCAS validation) have shown that New York and Chicago have been the most stressful environment necessary for evaluation of TCAS Mode S surveillance, and it is expected that this will also hold",
    "necessary for evaluation of TCAS Mode S surveillance, and it is expected that this will also hold for ADS-B traffic as equipage rates increase.  The most effective flight paths for these TCAS tests have proven to be orbital flights of 5 NM radius near the major airport terminal, JFK in New York and O'Hare in Chicago.  The flight test should be conducted at an altitude less than",
    "10,000 feet during peak traffic periods when the ground visibility is greater than 10 NM \nwith a ceiling of at least 11,000 feet to ensure the highest peak traffic densities. The recorded data should include as a minimum that necessary to determine if the intersource correlation requirements given in Section §2.2.3.2 have been met.  \nNote: Tests should include at least 5000 track seconds each of ADS-B, TIS-B and TCAS \ntracks as appropriate for the installation.",

The data storage and success/failure criteria for full TIS-B correlation are very similar to that used for TCAS correlation.  Upon a failed TIS-B correlation window test, a \"0\" is added to the end of a 6-bit FIFO queue stored in the ADS-B/ADS-R track file (e.g., *track(i).TISB_correlation_patterns(j)*), removing any value that may exist in the",

The accuracy of the speed calculation was determined using simulation results, and a maximum threshold was determined for the allowable difference between calculated speed and reported speed. The validation",
    "determined for the allowable difference between calculated speed and reported speed. The validation criteria included a requirement that m of n previous speed calculations did not breech the maximum threshold. A sensitivity study was employed to determine the optimal m and n values as well as other optimal parameters in the speed calculation algorithm. The optimal values were judged based on performance metrics which included the difference between calculated and reported speed, the percentage",
    "metrics which included the difference between calculated and reported speed, the percentage of reports validated for each flight, and the time until the first valid report. Results from the performance metrics were studied for sensitivity to variations in reported speed, accelerations, and NACP. The results of the sensitivity analysis fed back into the algorithm in the form of limits on applying the algorithm, thus reducing incorrect false validations.",
    "The simulation utilized a velocity error model that was derived from the reported speed errors in the field data during straight and level flight. The simulation results were validated against performance metric results of the field data.  \n\n## E.3 Simulation Overview",
    "A simulation and field data were used to analyze the performance of ground speed calculations that are based on ADS-B position reports. The results of a simulation were compared with EUROCONTROL field data from Toulouse and Frankfurt airports and with FAA Surveillance and Broadcast Services (SBS) field data primarily from Louisville, KY.

    "speed as a measure of the current performance of the reported speed accuracy.

    "## E.4 Modeling Approach",
    "The position error model is outlined in detail in Annex E of the SURF SPR [ED-165/DO- 322]. It accounts for the correlation between successive GPS position measurements. The modeled velocity jitter and bias values are chosen to achieve the ground speed accuracy that was measured in the EUROCONTROL and SBS field data. The field data was analyzed to determine the actual jitter and bias in the reported ground speed. Flight segments of at least 20 seconds duration (average duration: 38 seconds)",

The bias was measured by calculating the difference between the average reported speed and the average calculated speed. Conservative estimates of the speed jitter and bias errors are 0.2 m/s standard deviation and < 0.72 m/s 95%, respectively. The velocity error model was tuned to achieve these ground speed jitter and bias measurements.",
    "Note: GPS position errors will sporadically have somewhat larger position jumps, caused by factors such as rising and setting satellites. While such position jumps will occur, they are envisioned to be infrequent enough that an appropriate validation scheme can accommodate them.",
    "The transmit ADS-B processing function received the 1 Hz GPS updates and extrapolated the position at 200 ms increments until the position was transmitted. The Time of Applicability of the transmitted position was assumed to be between -100 and +100 ms from the time of transmission. This assumption satisfies the minimum DO-260B/ED-\n102A standards for position extrapolation and can have a large effect on the error in the calculated speed.",
    "## E.5 Validation Algorithms",
    "The validation of a single report requires several steps including: filtering out problematic reports, calculating the aircraft speed, checking the calculated speed against the reported speed, and applying an m of n success criterion. The steps are illustrated in Figure E-1, where the process begins at the point of ADS-B report generation within the receive aircraft. For each position update, the report is dropped if either the NACP is less than 7",
    "or if the acceleration necessary to propagate the aircraft from the last position to the new position would exceed 1.5g, where g is 9.81 m/s2. Next, the previously calculated acceleration is added to a sliding window average which includes the last 5 acceleration calculations (from the last 6 position updates). If the average acceleration is greater than \n0.5 m/s2, then the report is dropped.",
    "Once the report passes the filters, a simple algorithm is used to calculate ground speed from position updates. The algorithm calculates the distance between two surface position reports and divides the distance by the time interval between the updates to derive the calculated ground speed (s = distance / time). The two surface position reports are chosen by seeking out 1) the first report that occurs between 2 and 10 seconds before the current report, and 2) the first report that occurs",
    "that occurs between 2 and 10 seconds before the current report, and 2) the first report that occurs between 2 and 10 seconds after the current report. By choosing a report before and after the current time, the algorithm achieves better speed estimation as opposed to using only reports that occurred in the past. However, this creates a 2 to 10 second lag until the current speed estimate is available. The difference between the calculated speed and reported speed is compared to the maximum",
    "The difference between the calculated speed and reported speed is compared to the maximum allowable threshold. When validating airborne targets, the threshold is set to 7.0 m/s. When validating ground targets, the threshold is set to 2.5 m/s. The result is added to a table containing the previous N results. If the speed difference is less than the threshold, a \"1\" is added to the table; otherwise, a \"0\" is added to the table. If the age of each result is less than the corresponding maximum age,",
    "a \"0\" is added to the table. If the age of each result is less than the corresponding maximum age, then it is added to the other results. If the summed value is greater than or equal to M then the reported speed is considered to be valid.",
    "## E.6 Speed Difference Threshold",
    "The simulation was used to estimate the error involved when using the speed calculation algorithm. With an estimate of the speed calculation error, a bound can be set on the maximum difference between the calculated speed and reported speed where, if not exceeded, the reported speed error is likely to be less than 3 m/s or 10 m/s 95% of the time when validating ground or airborne targets. The worst case ground scenario was simulated at 25 kts (12.9 m/s) with no acceleration, resulting in a",

    "m/s) with no acceleration, resulting in a speed calculation error of less than 3.6 m/s 95% of the time. Similar to the derivation of the ground threshold, the airborne difference between calculated speed and reported speed must be less than 7.0 m/s to be confident that the true speed difference is less than 10 m/s 95% of the time. If the true speed is less than 250 kts (129 m/s), then the calculation error decreases and there is a higher likelihood that the reported speed is within 10 m/s.",

    "The parameters used in the speed calculation algorithm and the m of n criterion were varied in order to determine the optimal balance between percent of valid reports and time to validation.

    "This Page Intentionally Left Blank \n\n## Appendix F Itp Design Considerations F.1 Background\n\nDuring the development of ADS-B ITP, a number of ITP design guidelines have been proposed and implemented. Although these design considerations do not constitute minimum requirements and should not be part of the ITP MOPS material, they do represent ideas developers may want to consider in the development of an ITP system.  \n\n## F.2 Itp Profile View Implementation Considerations",
    "The main body of these MOPS specifies what ITP specific traffic information is required to be output to the CDTI (Section 2.2.2.6). This information includes Traffic Identification, ITP distance, Traffic Ahead Of or Behind status, and ITP Traffic Geometric Initiation Pass/Fail status. Section 1.2.2.2 states that the CDTI consists of all displays and controls necessary to support the applications. The controls may be a dedicated CDTI control panel or it may be incorporated into other controls,",
    "The controls may be a dedicated CDTI control panel or it may be incorporated into other controls, (e.g., MCDU or EFB). At a minimum, CDTI includes a graphical plan-view (top down) traffic display, in these MOPS referred to as the Traffic Display, and the controls for the display and applications. Since ITP is a vertical maneuver, some developers have indicated that a profile graphical view of the traffic improves situation awareness for flight crews desiring to perform an ITP. This is",
    "of the traffic improves situation awareness for flight crews desiring to perform an ITP. This is particularly true for situations where there is a significant angle between the track of the ownship aircraft and the ITP Traffic aircraft (for ITP the angle can be as great as 44 degrees and still be a valid ITP situation). In these cases, relative geometry (ahead of and behind) may not be intuitive and flight crews might question the ITP ahead of or behind indication.",
    "Figure F-1 is an example of an implementation that contains an ITP profile view. This example combines both a plan and profile display. Other implementations could consist of a stand-alone profile display.  When using a stand-alone profile view, it is assumed there would be a corresponding, separate plan view display.",
    "The following section provides some considerations for developing vertical or profile view display. If an ITP Profile View (ITP-PV) display is provided, the design considerations in the following subsections should be considered.",
    "## F.2.1 Traffic Information Formats - Data Tags\n\nThe ITP-PV should provide a data tag of information for all displayed traffic in the ITP- PV, with the exception of ownship. This data tag should include traffic ID for all aircraft. The ITP-PV data tags may also include:",
    "•\nITP Distance\n•\nAhead of or behind status\n•\nITP Traffic geometric pass/fail status",
    "For implementations that include this data tag, the ITP-PV should have the capability to graphically indicate the specific ITP Traffic geometric pass/fail failing criteria for each displayed traffic aircraft. For the purposes of avoiding clutter on the display, this additional data tag information may be limited by a traffic filter (e.g., limiting expanded data tags to traffic between the ownship altitude and the desired altitude). This can be seen in Figure F-1. In Figure F-1",
    "the aircraft is considering a climb from FL330 to FL350. The data tags are expanded for FL340 but are limited to traffic identification only at FL360. Flight crews may have an operational use for additional information.  For example, flight crews have indicated a desire to be able to view the Rate of Change of ITP distance and/or if aircraft are getting closer to or pulling away from each other. This could aid flight crews in making strategic decisions regarding their flight. When indicating if",
    "could aid flight crews in making strategic decisions regarding their flight. When indicating if aircraft are getting closer or further way from ownship, some designers have chosen to use an arrow pointing toward or away from the ownship aircraft to indicate if ITP Distance is becoming larger or smaller. Some designers have additionally included a solid or hollow arrow to indicate if ITP Distance is growing or reducing.",
    "## F.2.2 Itp-Pv Display Range",
    "The ITP-PV should use ITP Distance as the unit of measure for the horizontal range scale of the ITP-PV. If ITP Distance is not used as the unit of measure for the horizontal range scale, care must be taken to ensure flight crews are not confused by the horizontal range scale chosen versus a scale based on ITP Distance.",
    "If ITP Distance is used for the horizontal scale, it should be clearly labeled as an ITP Distance scale. It is recommended that the scale be adjustable. Designers should consider a range of 25 NM to 200 NM as measured from the ownship position to the edge of the viewable screen. In some oceanic regions separation distances can be as large as 120 NM. The ability to see beyond the separation standard being used can be operationally useful.",
    "Additionally, if an ITP-PV is combined with a top down view on the same screen (as shown in Figure F-1), careful consideration must be taken to ensure flight crews are not confused by potentially different horizontal axes used with the two different views.",
    "## F.2.3 Additional Display Considerations F.2.3.1 Lateral Filter",
    "Designers of ITP-PV displays should give careful consideration to including a lateral filter on what is shown on the ITP-PV. This is particularly important for use of the system on organized track systems. It could be confusing for flight crews to see aircraft that are on parallel tracks up to 60 miles away on their ITP-PV. These aircraft could appear to be very close to them and may cause the flight crew to not request an ITP maneuver when in fact the traffic would not prevent the ITP",
    "the flight crew to not request an ITP maneuver when in fact the traffic would not prevent the ITP maneuver, or the flight crew might include an aircraft on a parallel track in an ITP request which could cause significant confusion when communicating with the controller.",
    "If a lateral filter is being used on the ITP-PV, there should be an indication on the profile view that a lateral filter is being used. It is also helpful to indicate the extent of the lateral filter on the corresponding plan view.",
    "## F.2.3.2 Similar Track Aircraft Filter",
    "Generally the ITP-PV is used primarily to aid the flight crew in the determination of making an ITP request. As a result, designers should only show similar track aircraft (aircraft whose tracks are within ± 44 degrees) since they are the only aircraft that can be considered for an ITP request. One benefit for this is that aircraft that cannot be used in the ITP request do not clutter the ITP-PV. Should a design not include a mandatory or user selected similar traffic filter, the ITP-PV should",
    "Should a design not include a mandatory or user selected similar traffic filter, the ITP-PV should provide a graphical indication of similar track status. These similar track aircraft should still be displayed in the top down view to support AIRB functions.",
    "ITP procedure guidance - One known implementation included guidance on the steps required to develop an ITP request. The implementation guides the pilot through the selection of reference aircraft and creating the ITP request.",
    "## F.3 Communication Implications",
    "The objective of the In-Trail Procedure (ITP) is to enable aircraft that desire flight level changes in procedural, non-radar airspace to achieve these changes on a more frequent basis, thus improving flight efficiency and safety. In non-radar airspace, communication between the flight crew and controllers is achieved through a variety of means ranging from third party high-frequency communication to satellite based Controller Pilot Data Link Communication (CPDLC). During development of the ITP",
    "to satellite based Controller Pilot Data Link Communication (CPDLC). During development of the ITP procedure, it was determined that ITP requests and clearances can only be granted using Direct Controller Pilot Communication (DCPC). There are a few areas in the world where this can be done by direct voice communication but in most non-radar regions this means requests and clearances must be accomplished using CPDLC.  The following section addresses some of the communication issues.",
    "Note: DCPC includes both VHF and CPDLC communications, but does not include HF \ncommunications. \nCPLDC messages sets, both uplink and downlink, have been defined in DO-306/ED-122",
    "and are included below. Designers of ITP systems should be aware of these message sets. Some developers may choose to design a system that populates these messages automatically and sends the messages to the CPDLC system. Other designers may choose to require the flight crew to enter the information manually using procedural guidance (e.g., a checklist). Others may require the flight crew to enter the information manually but provide the filled in message to the crew on a display.",

    "It is generally agreed that a shared traffic display, including all surveillance sources, is of far more value in developing a situation awareness picture than several displays providing partial data.  However, there are a number of issues relating to the shared display.  In particular, there are questions pertaining to the use of existing TCAS data and symbology on a shared display. During the preparation of the ASA MOPS (DO-317), there was much discussion on this topic.  In general, the TCAS",
    "of the ASA MOPS (DO-317), there was much discussion on this topic.  In general, the TCAS and ADS-B symbol requirements included in the document body are quite similar, and are based on the TCAS symbols.  The main deviation is that the document requires directional symbols to be used for all correlated TCAS traffic with valid directionality.  The document body notes:",

    "Research performed in a high fidelity cockpit simulator at the FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in December, 2008, indicated that substituting directional symbology for standard TCAS symbology resulted in no negative impacts on pilot response.  Metrics included pilot compliance to RA guidance, pilot reaction time, vertical and horizontal maneuvering, and pilot visual scan patterns.  As such, the TCAS community was comfortable with this deviation in existing TCAS symbology. This appendix",
    "the TCAS community was comfortable with this deviation in existing TCAS symbology. This appendix provides some information on the issues and discussions regarding TCAS/ADS-B symbol integration.",
    "## G.2 Use Of Current Tcas Symbology G.2.1 For Ads-B And Tis-B Non-Directional Traffic Without Alerts\n\nCurrent TCAS symbols are used to indicate all non-directional ADS-B and TIS-B traffic.  \n\n## G.2.2 For Tcas-Only Traffic\n\nCurrent TCAS symbols are used to indicate all states (other, proximate, TA and RA) for uncorrelated TCAS traffic.   \n\n## G.3 Alert Symbols",
    "## G.3 Alert Symbols\n\nThere is no requirement to distinguish traffic symbols of TCAS traffic advisories from ASA caution level alerts, nor is it prohibited.  ASA caution level alerts are required to be amber/yellow, as with TCAS TAs, but the shape may differ.",
    "Similarly, there is no requirement to distinguish traffic symbols of TCAS resolution advisories from ASA warning level alerts, nor is it prohibited.  ASA warning level alerts are required to be red, as with TCAS RAs, but the shape may differ. On one hand, it is likely beneficial to limit the number of different symbols used.  On the other hand, differentiating ASA alert symbols from TCAS alert symbols can help to ensure the effectiveness of each.",
    "## G.4 Distinguishing Traffic Based On Source\n\nThere is no requirement to indicate the source of traffic data (ADS-B, TCAS, TIS-B).  \nThere is, however, a requirement to indicate traffic data quality, which is affected by the source.  (See Section 2.3.1.2) The indication of traffic data quality versus source is more operationally relevant for performance-based systems like ASA.   \n\n## G.5 Distinguishing Traffic Tracked By Tcas",
    "It may be of interest to the flight crew to know whether individual traffic elements are being monitored by TCAS or some other alerting system.

A",
    "means may be provided for the flight crew to determine if traffic of interest is monitored by TCAS (i.e., is either a TCAS-only or a TCAS correlated traffic element).\" Although it is not a CDTI requirement to display the TCAS capability of the traffic, there is an ASSAP requirement in 2.2.2.1.5.1.10 that requires the ASSAP to pass TCAS \ncorrelation status to the CDTI.",
    "## G.6 Use Of Selected And Designated Symbol Variations During Alerts\n\nSystems integrated with TCAS will need to address selected and designated traffic symbology and status changes when TAs and RAs occur.  This integration is not currently addressed, but should be addressed in a future version of these MOPS.  Similar assessments should be made for ASA applications that generate alerts. \n\n## G.7 Proximate / Nearby Airborne Traffic G.7.1 Determination Of Nearby Airborne Traffic",
    "## G.7 Proximate / Nearby Airborne Traffic G.7.1 Determination Of Nearby Airborne Traffic\n\nTCAS flags traffic within 6 NM and 1200 ft of ownship as Proximate.  Similarly, this same criteria is used to determine Nearby Airborne Traffic in the ASA MOPS, regardless of the track source.  Nearby Airborne Traffic criteria is used in the track output priority scheme (see Section 2.2.2.1.5.1.2).  \n\n## G.7.2 Proximate Traffic Symbology",
    "On standard TCAS displays, the only effect of Proximate status is to alter the traffic symbols (from an unfilled diamond to a filled diamond).

    "In 1090ES and UAT, the ground system communicates TIS-B/ADS-R service status to individual aircraft by encoding the aircraft's 24-bit Address onto the service status message.  Each address is preceded by an in-service or out-of-service qualifier.  The inservice qualifier indicates that the 24-bit Address is within TIS-B/ADS-R coverage, the out-of-service qualifier is sent to indicate the aircraft has left the TIS-B or ADS-R service area. When the aircraft is within the service area it will",

    "20 seconds.  If an aircraft misses the out-of-service message it will rely on a timeout to determine loss of status.  The out-of-service message could also be considered a loss-ofservice message, the terms are used interchangeably. Aircraft that have been receiving the in-service messages that stop receiving in-service messages and do not receive an out-of-service message will timeout after 40 seconds and indicate a loss of TIS-B/ADS-R.",

    "## H.3 Previous Uat Approach\n\nInitial versions of the UAT ground system implementation provided a TIS-B service status that encoded the 24-bit Address onto the service status message.  The ground system service status indication is being changed to include ADS-R as well as TIS-B \ncoverage and add an in-service/out-of-service designator to more quickly identify loss of service.  TIS-B/ADS-R service status will also be provided for both UAT and 1090.",
    "## H.4 Vdl4 Tis-B Service Status Message Approach",
    "The approach for VDL4 differs from UAT and 1090ES in that the service status message is broadcast to all users in the region served by the ground system.  The VDL4 ground system communicates TIS-B service status through the service information (si) field within the Directory of Services (DoS) message which is periodically broadcast to all participating aircraft on the frequency or frequencies served by the ground system.  The aircraft derives information on the service status from the service",
    "by the ground system.  The aircraft derives information on the service status from the service information (si) field in the DoS message.  The field contains a flag for each service. If the flag is not set, the respective service is unavailable from the current ground station. The DoS message will be transmitted at a rate to ensure that all aircraft in the TIS-B",
    "service area can receive the service status message at least every 20 seconds (95%). If the aircraft moves from the coverage of one ground station to another (ie it logs on to a new ground station) which does not support the TIS-B service then the aircraft will receive a DoS message indicating that the TIS-B service is unavailable (from the new ground station). This message will also be received within 20 seconds 95% of the time.",
    "Aircraft that have been receiving the TIS-B service available messages that stop receiving service available messages and do not receive a TIS-B service unavailable message will timeout after 40 seconds and indicate a loss of TIS-B. In addition, the ground stations also transmit information on the TIS-B service volume as part of the TIS-B messages broadcast to the aircraft. The TIS-B service volume is a set of coordinates defining the area in which the display of TIS-B targets can be expected",

    "Note that it is currently assumed that VDL4 is only required to support TIS-B services and therefore only a TIS-B service flag has been define in the standards. However, if VDL4 is required to support ADS-R then the standards will be updated to provide for a combined TIS-B/ADS-R Service Status message in a similar manner to UAT and 1090ES. Alternatively, there are service status bits in the DoS message that are as yet undefined and could be used as a dedicated flag for ADS-R service status.",

    "VDL4 transmits information on the TIS-B service volume in the TIS-B messages, so aircraft using the TIS-B service are aware of when they approaching the service boundary. For 1090ES and UAT systems, in order to receive TIS-B service, ownship must have produced valid position data within the last 30 seconds and must be under surveillance of at least one secondary surveillance radar.  The requirement for being under radar coverage is currently the only boundary awareness implemented in the U.S.",
    "Ideally, the boundary awareness would allow aircraft to know that they are close to a TIS-B/ADS-R service boundary, and thus may not have a complete traffic picture.

If the client is outside of either TIS-B or ADS-R, the client is considered Out-of-Service.",
    "## H.5.5 Nuisance Status Changes Near Boundaries\n\nAircraft flying near boundaries, such as near a vertical boundary in the vicinity of an airport could enter and exit coverage repeatedly.  To avoid nuisance transitions of Traffic Status in the cockpit, transitions from Out-of-Service to In-Service should be inhibited until 30 seconds has elapsed from the previous transition to Out-of-Service. \n\n## H.5.6 International Harmonization",
    "## H.5.6 International Harmonization\n\nMost countries will not have ADS-R or TIS-B.  Manufacturers can create an installation method to disable TIS-B/ADS-R service status.

This Appendix will present and amend the terms used and clarify which parts of the latency budget are allocated between the various interfaces.

The related position error is the product of Total Latency and acceleration uncertainty valid for the duration of the Total Latency.",
    "Compensated Latency: is that part of Total Latency that is compensated for to a new time of applicability, valid at an interface 'Y', through data extrapolation aiming at reducing the effects of latency. Compensated Latency may change for each new received/processed track. The related position error is the product of Compensated Latency and the accuracy error of the A/V velocity used for the extrapolation.",

The Latency Compensation Error may change for each new received/processed track. The related position error is the product of Latency Compensation Error and true A/V velocity.",
    "Time of applicability (TOA): at an interface 'Y', is the TOA as valid at a lower interface 'X' plus the amount of Compensated Latency applied to and valid at an upper interface 'Y'. Therefore, the Time of Applicability uncertainty is the (sum of) Latency Compensation Errors up to interface 'Y'.

In both cases, the actual Time of Transmission (TOT) and Transmit Time of Applicability (TTOA) are asynchronous processes.  This is because of the nature of the transmit requirements. In general, position messages are broadcast at random intervals uniformly distributed between 400 ms and 600 ms. This 'jitter' is introduced such that no two transmitters",

If a transmitter encodes the position data every 200 ms it must extrapolate the TTOA to be a time 100 ms in the future from the encoding time, this to ensure that the position state in the register will contribute less than ±100 ms of error.   A second way to minimize the time uncertainty in the position message is to encode the register more often than 200 ms. A design could combine more frequent updates with the future extrapolation",

For this third case, error due to the asynchronous transmit jitter can be significantly reduced at the cost of an asymmetric error budget during that 200 ms Epoch. So to say that another way, a design can optimize the error budget for accuracy at TOT by extrapolating exactly to TOT. The side effect of this is an asynchronous error budget around TOT. The position encoding for the unsynchronized case is required",

This implies that the design makes use of a counter (or equivalent means) that software can read to measure how long ago the Time Mark arrived. This measurement combined with the UTC Time reported allows the ADS-B transmit device to encode position messages on exact 200 ms UTC Epochs within the tolerance of the software and hardware design.

Since the TTOA is clearly identified, successive encoding would theoretically result in the same answer.  Refer to Figure M-2 \nfor a graphical depiction of the synchronized case.",

Hence allowing 'MINOR' criticality equipment under the given restrictions is formally not a difference but is rather to be seen as a further detailing of the SURF",
    "is formally not a difference but is rather to be seen as a further detailing of the SURF SPR requirements.",
    "## O.2.2 Traffic",
    "From the ongoing work with building the baseline for ADS-B Out certification it is recognized that there may be a number of small 'recreational' aircraft (e.g., gliders) that will only transmit SDA=1 in their ADS-B messages. The SURF SPR \nrequired, based on the most stringent type of operations and in the most stringent scenarios,  that traffic need to transmit SDA of 2 or greater to be eligible for the SURF application.",
    "ASA MOPS identified that displaying SDA=1 traffic would generate large operational benefits in many scenarios (e.g., when operating into remote airports with local glider activity, etc.)",
    "The ASA MOPS assessed the display of SDA=1 traffic on the SURF traffic display as acceptable based on the rational that (1) in US Airspace traffic transmitting SDA of 1 will not be accepted in the regulated ADS-B airspace, which for example includes all large airports and (2) in European airspace the frequency that small 'recreational' aircraft transmitting SDA=1 will be operating in complex environments and scenarios as applicable to the SURF analysis is very low (in addition there is also the",
    "and scenarios as applicable to the SURF analysis is very low (in addition there is also the possibility that local airspace mandates for SDA of 2 or higher will be established around major European airports). It is also likely that similar rational will exists around other complex environments including stringent SURF scenarios. In other words, US and European regulations will limit the display of SDA=1 aircraft to airports and traffic densities in which they can be safely displayed. In general",
    "SDA=1 aircraft to airports and traffic densities in which they can be safely displayed. In general it is expected that there will be very few of the lower SDA aircraft at the bigger aerodromes. It was also acknowledged that the SURF SPR analysis did not assess applicable scenarios with SDA=1 traffic under these operational limitations.",
    "Consequently ASA MOPS requires that SDA=1 (or above) aircraft are displayed on the SURF traffic display.",
    "## O.3 Operational Concept - Cspa (Closely Spaced Parallel Approach)",
    "The SURF SPR derives requirements for traffic position and velocity for airborne traffic on the basis of the two most driving operational scenarios. The two scenarios involve ownship on the ground (e.g., lined-up on the runway for takeoff) and traffic on approach to a closely spaced parallel runway as pictured in the diagrams below:",
    "Displayed Traffic Actual Traffic These scenarios reflect the operational capability to assess that aircraft on the traffic display are associated with the correct runway to avoid confusing the flight crew's traffic situation awareness in such situations. They also require lateral position accuracy for airborne traffic of 50m and directionality accuracy of 15º. In non-CSPA (closely spaced parallel approach) scenarios traffic position accuracy requirements can be relaxed to 185m (i.e., NACP =7 or",
    "approach) scenarios traffic position accuracy requirements can be relaxed to 185m (i.e., NACP =7 or better) when ownship is on the ground. In translating the airborne traffic requirements into the MOPS it was argued that the CSPA scenarios drive too stringent requirements limiting availability and hence operational use.  To increase availability ASA MOPS decided to reduce the operational concept and stress that pilots should not be using the SURF application in such a way as to determine the",
    "and stress that pilots should not be using the SURF application in such a way as to determine the runway to which an aircraft was approaching, particularly when considering SURF as a situation awareness application. Pilots in particular expressed their concern on the envisaged scenario and agreed that it would be very difficult to tell which runway an aircraft was approaching. On the basis that sufficient pilot training and other operational mitigations (e.g., party-line communications) would",
    "sufficient pilot training and other operational mitigations (e.g., party-line communications) would be in place it was therefore decided that the CSPA scenarios would be considered outside the scope of the SURF application and therefore that airborne position and velocity requirements would be established on the basis of the next most stressing scenario (i.e., most stressing scenario excluding CSPA) resulting in horizontal position accuracy of 185m and a velocity accuracy of 10 m/s for airborne",
    "resulting in horizontal position accuracy of 185m and a velocity accuracy of 10 m/s for airborne traffic.",
    "## O.4 Application Integration",
    "The ATSA-SURF SPR required an accuracy of 0.1 NM for any airborne traffic, apart from the CSPA scenario addressed in Section A.3 above. While the SPR documents addressed each application in its own right the ASA MOPS group identified a need to enable efficient application integration. In order to do so joint scenarios where studied (e.g., when performing VSA operations towards a SURF airport). The ASA MOPS also addressed scenarios which had been out of scope in the SPR assessment, such as",
    "The ASA MOPS also addressed scenarios which had been out of scope in the SPR assessment, such as airborne traffic outside the Surface Volume. The ASA MOPS application integration work resulted in new requirements for Traffic outside the Surface Volume, aligned with the AIRB 0.5 NM accuracy requirements. The application integration work also modified the requirement for Airborne Traffic inside the Surface Volume when ownship is airborne to align with the VSA 0.3 NM accuracy requirements. The",

    "SPR analysis. The modified requirements are summarized in Table 2-2.",
    "## O.5 Display Pixel Resolution\n\nIn translating the SURF SPR assumption that the traffic display resolution is better (finer) than or equal to 3 m/pixel (when the display is zoomed such that the smallest dimension of the display corresponds to a distance of 1800m or less) it was agreed to make only a recommendation rather than a requirement in the ASA MOPS. \n\n## O.6 Directionality",
    "## O.6 Directionality\n\nThis section addresses both Data Accuracy and Display Resolution changes made when translating the SURF SPR directionality requirements in to ASA MOPS.   \n\n## O.6.1 Directionality Data Accuracy",
    "## O.6.1 Directionality Data Accuracy\n\nATSA-SURF specifies (in SPR.45 / PR.17) a data directionality accuracy requirement of 8º (95%) for traffic on the ground. In addition it spells out different display directionality needs depending on scenario (being 10º, 15º or 30º). The directionality requirements address both position extrapolation errors (due to latency compensation error) and the operational need for symbol orientation accuracy on the display.",
    "## O.6.1.1 Meeting The Directionality Data Accuracy",
    "For traffic providing direction from a heading sensor, the data accuracy is assumed to be readily met. For traffic that provides directionality as track, directionality accuracy will depend upon the source velocity accuracy and ground speed, so there will be a speed below which the accuracy will become worse than",
    "8º. With the SURF required NACV ≥ 2 (< 3 m/s) velocity accuracy, the 8º data directional accuracy will be breached at speeds below 23 knots (using \"midpoint NACV\" performance, 2 m/s). A 23 knots directionality cutoff threshold was not deemed appropriate by the ASA MOPS group",
    "## O.6.1.2 Reassessment Of Surf Spr Scenarios",
    "In re-assessing the SURF SPR operational scenarios that drove the original 10º",
    "displayed symbol directionality requirement, it was identified that some were high speed scenarios (e.g., rapid exit taxiways), in which track based directionality will be very good anyway. For other lower speed scenarios, where 10º or 15º displayed symbol directionality was originally required, the operational community conceded that a more relaxed (30º) directionality would be acceptable and better than not displaying directionality at all. For latency compensation error, the most demanding",
    "than not displaying directionality at all. For latency compensation error, the most demanding situation envisaged in the SURF SPR is for a high speed (50 knot) vehicle a taxiway parallel to a runway. This speed, in combination with an assumed heading error of 8º towards the adjacent runway will produce an across-track velocity accuracy component of",
    "50×tan(8º) = 7 knots (= 3.6 m/s). Clearly, this across-track velocity accuracy component is larger than would be the case for 3 m/s horizontal velocity accuracy (for 3 m/s overall velocity accuracy, the component in the across taxiway direction will be 2.4 m/s). This shows that traffic reporting directionality as track with an accuracy of 3 m/s or better will always meet the position extrapolation portion of the directionality requirement.",
    "## O.6.1.3 Symbol Orientation And Speed Threshold Requirements",
    "Based on the results of the re-assessment, the ASA MOPS group concluded that the driving requirement for track based directionality, for ground traffic, is the symbol orientation limit for slow moving targets. A directionality accuracy of 30º was considered to be operationally acceptable for such scenarios. Hence, the remaining directionality data requirement, for track based directionality, are the thresholds when a slow moving target drops below 30º directionality accuracy.",
    "Based on a \"midpoint NACV\" numerical simulation it can be determined that this occurs when traffic speed drops below:",
    "- \n6 knots for traffic reporting a NACV of 2 \n- \n2 knots for traffic reporting a NACV of 3 or \n- \n0.5 knots for traffic reporting a NACV of 4 \n\n## O.6.2 Directionality Display Resolution",
    "The SURF SPR requires a directionality display resolution of 12º or better (i.e., maximum of ±6º display quantization error). The ASA MOPS group identified that the ±6º display quantization error, although expected to be exceed by the majority of the displays, may require much more bit map memory for some installations compared to if the requirement would be slightly less stringent, allowing a ±7.5º display quantization error. The performance impact from changing the requirement was deemed",
    "a ±7.5º display quantization error. The performance impact from changing the requirement was deemed small. Consequently, the ASA MOPS requires a maximum of ±7.5º display quantization error.",
    "## O.7 Latency O.7.1 Ownship Latency",
    "The SURF SPR requires that the total latency of the Ownship horizontal position from the time of applicability at interface B2 to the time of display to the flight crew at interface G must not exceed 2 seconds (SPR.20). On manufacturers request investigations were made on the impact of increasing the latency budget with 0.5 seconds. Based on the estimated effect (see below) it was agreed that it could be increased to 2.5s without any significant safety or performance impact on the SURF",

Based on the estimated effect (see below) it was agreed that it could be increased to 3.5s without any significant safety or performance impact on the SURF",
    "that it could be increased to 3.5s without any significant safety or performance impact on the SURF application.",
    "## O.7.3 Estimated Effect Of Increased Latency\n\nIn order to support the acceptability of the increased latency the impact on the position error was estimated. \n\nFor 3 m/s velocity accuracy (95%) the Total (95%) Additional Position Error is bounded by: (0.5 s) * (3 m/s) * 0.8008 (distribution conversion factor) = 1.2 \nmeters For 10 m/s velocity accuracy (95%) the Total (95%) Additional Position Error is bounded by: (0.5 s) * (10 m/s) * 0.8008 (distribution conversion factor) = 4.0 \nmeters",
    "## O.8 Maximum Data Age",
    "The ATSA-SURF SPR required a maximum data age of 11 seconds for moving traffic and 25 seconds for non-moving traffic. The ASA MOPS modified the requirement, making the data age requirement less stringent for airborne moving traffic in situations where the required position accuracy is less stringent than 0.1 NM. The rational for the change was based on that longer extrapolation times (increased uncertainty) is acceptable in situations where the required position accuracy is less stringent. More",
    "is acceptable in situations where the required position accuracy is less stringent. More specifically the modified data age limits were based on simulation results of when a linear extrapolation of the position for an aircraft making a 0.5g turn would exceed the accuracy bound. The modified data age limits are summarized in Table 2-4.",
    "## O.9 Velocity Qualification",
    "The SURF SPR requires a velocity accuracy of 3 m/s (NACV ≥ 2) for ground traffic. The limited ability for today's avionic configurations to qualify velocity data to a 3 m/s accuracy, despite that GPS receivers report very good velocity accuracy (in the order of 1-2 m/s), was recognized by the ASA MOPS group. ASA MOPS therefore provides an alternative method to qualify traffic velocity accuracy based on the knowledge that the transmitted velocity comes from a GPS receiver. The method targets to",
    "on the knowledge that the transmitted velocity comes from a GPS receiver. The method targets to ensure a 3 m/s accuracy and hence is the alternative velocity qualification not a difference from the SURF SPR. The method of ensuring GPS velocity data that is valid for use is using the same criteria as used for alternative position qualification, which is derived in O.10.",
    "Note: SURF SPR also requires the 3 m/s velocity accuracy for airborne traffic but as argued under A.3 the airborne velocity requirements were relaxed in the ASA MOPS by reducing the operational concept. \n\n## O.10 Position Qualification - Extended Availability Risk Mitigation Plan\n\nThis section and its subsections contain a modified version of the Extended Availability Risk Mitigation Plan (RMP) presented as Appendix D in the ATSA-\nSURF SPR.

This fact removed the need for alterative qualification methods for airborne traffic. Finally, the editorial changes relate to adjustments to align the RMP with the changes mentioned above as well as integrating it as an appendix to this document.",
    "## O.10.1 Introduction",
    "The ATSA-SURF SPR requires that qualified on-ground ATSA-SURF traffic has a minimum horizontal position uncertainty at the time of measurement (at the position source) of less than or equal to 30 m (95%) (SPR.31) and airborne ATSA-SURF traffic approaching closely spaced parallel runways has a minimum horizontal position uncertainty at the time of measurement (at the position source) of less than or equal to 50 m (95%) (SPR.32) to be able to be displayed on the Traffic Display. These",

    "The 30 m (95%) horizontal position source accuracy requirement (SPR.30) is the result of the ATSA-SURF OSA analysis (Annex C in the SURF SPR) that provides the safety case for the Operational Hazard (OH1), i.e., \"Traffic Display has erroneous information\", and resulted in an overall Safety Objective (SO) for ATSA-SURF of 4E-03 / fh (refer to Table C.10 in the ATSA-SURF SPR). The factors that contribute to being able to meet the ATSA-SURF SO are illustrated in the OH1 fault tree. Typically these",
    "to being able to meet the ATSA-SURF SO are illustrated in the OH1 fault tree. Typically these factors are related to the integrity of the individual system functions that comprise the application. However, the dominant factor that must be managed for ATSA-SURF to meet the SO is the \"rare normal\" horizontal position accuracy, not related to any equipment integrity failures. The 30 m (95%) horizontal position source accuracy thus sets the driving requirement for GNSS-based position data for",
    "position source accuracy thus sets the driving requirement for GNSS-based position data for ATSA-SURF. Unfortunately, many legacy avionics GPS sensors are unable to qualify their position accuracy to this level of performance; even when their actual position accuracy is much better than the required 30 m [measured demonstrated performance is typically",
    "~2 to 3 m]1. Due to the legacy of GPS selective availability, SA-ON GPS \nreceivers are limited by design to output a 95% Horizontal Figure of Merit \n(HFOM) of typically not less than 60 m (and therefore be encoded in ADS-B",
    "OUT to NACP = 8 at best). SA-Aware GPS receivers are no longer limited to these artificially very conservative constraints and thus provide much better HFOM values that are within the ATSA-SURF accuracy requirement, but are still considerably more conservative than the demonstrated performance of GPS. The risk mitigation plan summarized in the next section provides a means for extending the availability of utilizing GPS-based legacy ADS-B OUT traffic for use by the ATSA-SURF application.",

    "1. Traffic surveillance reports are based on GPS-derived position information. \n2. ATSA-SURF Ownship's GPS-based HDOP is less than or equal to 2.0. \nBased on these two criteria, the risk of accepting ADS-B OUT traffic surveillance reports that may potentially exceed the required 30 m, 95% horizontal position accuracy is maintained at a level below the ATSA-SURF \nSafety Objective of 4E-03.",

    "The SA-ON σUERE of 33.3 m is very conservative and set to an unrealistically high level due to the legacy of selective availability. The minimum SA-Aware \nσUERE of 6.1 m is established using a more realistic, but still conservative level of performance.",
    "From the HFOM equation above, both HDOP and σUERE can affect the observed horizontal position uncertainty from the GPS sensor. The conservative nature of the minimum σUERE values provides margin in the event of signal-in-space errors due to space weather conditions (e.g., solar flare activities). It is noted that, beyond the nominal ionospheric delay models used in SA-Aware receivers, these receivers do not have specific knowledge of such actual ionospheric conditions. In any case, for the",
    "do not have specific knowledge of such actual ionospheric conditions. In any case, for the ATSA-SURF environment, the 95% Horizontal Position Accuracy is assumed to remain within the required performance levels over a range of space weather conditions (ASSUMP-OSED.24). It is also assumed that users will be notified of possible impact of adverse space weather to performance as part of navigation related notification means (ASSUMP-OSED.25).",
    "The basis of the risk management plan thus centers on the characterization of expected HDOP performance and the differences in HDOP (i.e., ∆HDOP) for both the ATSA-SURF Ownship and the ATSA-SURF traffic. The table below illustrates the relationship of HDOP to the resulting 95% horizontal position accuracy (HFOM) and the subsequent NACP values for SA-ON and SA-Aware installations:",
    "SA-ON Receiver  \n(using σUERE of 33.3 m) \nSA-Aware Receiver \n(if using σUERE of 6.1 m) \nHDOP \nHFOM (m) \nNACp \nHFOM (m) \nNACp \nUp to 1.4 \nUp to 92.6 \n8 \nUp to 17 \n9 \n1.4 to 2.46 \n92.6 to 164 \n7 \n17 to 30 \n9 \n2.46 to 2.8 \n164 to 185.2 \n7 \n30 to 34 \n8 \n2.8 to 7.59 \n185.2 to 500 \n6 \n34 to 92.6 \n8 \nOver 7.59 \nOver 500 \n≤ 6 \nOver 92.6 \n≤ 7",
    "From the above table, it can be seen that NACP = 8 from a SA-ON installation can be assumed to always be at least as good an accuracy as given by NACP = 9 \nfrom a SA-Aware installation based on similar satellite performance (URA), signal-in-space (SIS), and receiver performance (RCV), and therefore will always satisfy the ATSA-SURF accuracy requirement. Furthermore, a NACP =7",
    "value from a SA-ON installation will at most be only slightly outside the 30 m accuracy requirement on rare occasions as bounded by the RMP.",
    "Consequently, the main risk associated with accepting 7 ≤ NACP < 9 traffic (i.e., accepting NACP ≥ 7) is for traffic with SA-Aware installations. [Unfortunately there is no information transmitted by ADS-B to directly indicate the type of GPS receiver installed.]  The risk will depend upon their HDOP value; in particular their HDOP value has to be greater than 2.46 for it to exceed the nominal 30 m (95%) horizontal position accuracy assuming a σUERE of 6.1 m.",
    "The risk mitigation plan by Ownship in being able to accept traffic surveillance reports with 7 ≤ NACP < 9 is thus based on the ability to manage the risk of traffic experiencing an HDOP that exceeds an HDOP of 2.46 at a rate (well) \nbelow the ATSA-SURF Safety Objective. The HDOP region of interest for the RMP is shown by the gray shaded rows of Table O-1.",
    "As earlier indicated, an Ownship HDOP threshold of 2.0 has been selected as one of the two criteria for the RMP (the other criteria being that the traffic surveillance report is based on GPS-derived position information). Since the ATSA-SURF Ownship and the traffic aircraft / vehicle may potentially experience some differences in their respective HDOPs (e.g., due to slight differences in their respective GPS receiver performance, reception mask angle, or possible satellite line-of-sight",
    "respective GPS receiver performance, reception mask angle, or possible satellite line-of-sight obstruction due to nearby aircraft), a ∆HDOP of 0.46 is allocated. Thus, an Ownship HDOP of less than or equal to 2.0, and a ∆HDOP of 0.46 yields a risk managed traffic HDOP that does not exceed 2.46.",
    "In order to assess the effectiveness of the RMP, Table O-2 and Table O-3 provide statistics and distributions of simulated HDOP and ∆HDOP values for a 24- satellite GPS constellation, using a 5 degree mask angle, analyzed over the Worldwide Analysis Grid as defined in the WAAS MOPS DO-229D (Section",
    "3.2.9.2)2, sampled every 5 minutes over a 12 hour period.  Table O-2 and Table O-3 provide the distribution of the number of samples and probabilities of achieved HDOP values over 12 bins in steps of 0.25 over the RMP region of interest. ∆HDOP mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, and the distributions of ∆HDOPs over a range of probabilities from 5% to 99.999% are provided in each table. Table O-2 provides the ∆HDOP distributions for the case where the all-in-view HDOPs (such as those",
    "Table O-2 provides the ∆HDOP distributions for the case where the all-in-view HDOPs (such as those achieved by Ownship) are compared to the HDOP values that occur when the lowest elevation satellite is removed, simulating the effect of the ATSA-SURF traffic seeing one less satellite than Ownship, possibly due to an obstruction from another aircraft. Table O-3 repeats these calculations for ∆HDOP values where the lowest 2 satellites are removed, to determine the effects of 2 satellites being",
    "values where the lowest 2 satellites are removed, to determine the effects of 2 satellites being obstructed.",
    "Note: The HDOP and ∆HDOP values in Table O-2 and Table O-3 represent all cases where at least 5 satellites are in view. Fewer than 4 satellites do not support a position solution, and having only 4 satellites-in-view does not support non-zero NIC position reports.",
    "The Risk Management Plan (RMP) probability is calculated as follows:",
    "PRMP = PHDOP x P∆HDOP x PSatellite Obstruction Table O-2 and Table O-3 provide the HDOP probabilities for each of 12 bins in steps of 0.25. These numbers represent the PHDOP. The P∆HDOP are obtained from Table O-2 and Table O-3 for the single satellite, and 2 satellite obstruction cases, respectively. The cells within the tables used for the calculation of PHDOP and P∆HDOP are shaded in gray. In all cases these probabilities reflect the cases where",
    "HDOP + ∆HDOP are approximately equal to 2.46, which represents the boundary condition of the RMP in accepting surveillance reports with NACP < 9.",
    "Table O-4 illustrates the computation of PRMP, which represents the sum of the PRMP probabilities computed for each bin, for both the single and two satellite obstruction cases. The contributions for the single and two satellite obstruction cases are then added to represent the total PRMP. By maintaining PRMP below the ATSA-SURF Safety Objective of 4E-3, we effectively manage the risk of accepting surveillance reports with 7 ≤ NACP < 9.",

    "In assessing methods to improve the identification of GPS source the ASA MOPS group identified that for version 1 traffic on ground a NACP of 7 can genuinely only be produced by GPS-based sensors. However, it was recognized that in the case of RAIM unavailability (due to too few satellites) it will, in version 1, result in unknown NIC but with a positive NACP. Then if at the same time a satellite failure occurs that would not be reflected in the NACP. However, the risk of satellite failure",

However, the risk of satellite failure occurring at the same time as only four satellites are available is 1e-4 (for a satellite failure) times (conservatively) 1e-2 (for the receiver to only observe four satellites). Hence the risk (1e-4 * 1e-2 = 1e-6) is far below the SURF safety objective and is consequently not a safety concern for the SURF application.

    "An aircraft travelling in oceanic airspace is subject to procedure-based separation and minima.  These standards are applied to it and other potentially blocking aircraft when a request for an altitude change is desired.  For safety reasons these standards and minima are conservative since there is no radar coverage in most of this airspace.  The benefits of an altitude change can be significant. The In-Trail Procedure (ITP) was developed to enable ADS-B equipped aircraft to change altitude if",
    "The In-Trail Procedure (ITP) was developed to enable ADS-B equipped aircraft to change altitude if they are leading or following aircraft in intervening altitudes which may otherwise preclude such maneuvers.  This procedure is planned as a first step in a sequence of enhanced oceanic operations.  In this first step, there is no delegation to the pilot of any separation authority.",
    "The ITP maneuver consists of four phases: initiation, instruction, execution, and termination.  This appendix provides sample algorithms for the ADS-B derived parameters provided to the flight crew during the initiation and execution phases of ITP. These parameters are determined onboard ownship and include: ITP distance, Rate of Change of ITP Distance, and ownship ahead or behind status.  Additionally, the algorithms in this appendix compute a common point relative to ownship and reference",
    "the algorithms in this appendix compute a common point relative to ownship and reference aircraft tracks.",
    "## S.2 Itp Parameters\n\nReference aircraft are valid for ITP when similar track criteria are met; these criteria include a relative track angle between ownship and the reference aircraft of less than 45° \nor greater than 315°.  Figure S-1 depicts the four types of similar track aircraft. \n\n \n--`,```,`````,`,`,`,,,,,`,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\nAdditional Geometric Status criteria apply.  Reference aircraft are valid for ITP when:",
    "a. Altitude is within 2500 ft (±) that of ownship. \nb. And ITP Distance is greater than or equal to 15 NM and absolute value of Rate of \nChange of ITP Distance is less than or equal to 20 knots. \nc. Or ITP Distance is greater than or equal to 20 NM and absolute value of Rate of \nChange of ITP Distance is less than or equal to 30 knots.",
    "Change of ITP Distance is less than or equal to 30 knots. \nIt is important to note that determination of reference aircraft validity for ITP will require one processing cycle per the algorithms presented in this appendix.",
    "## S.2.1 Itp Distance",
    "ITP Distance (dITP) is defined as the absolute value of difference or addition of ownship and reference aircraft distances to a common point along the projection of each aircraft's track. The distance from each aircraft to the common point is a scalar quantity and is always positive. The figures below show how ITP Distance is calculated for various traffic configurations. For cases where aircraft are on the same side of the common point, one distance is subtracted from the other. For situations",
    "are on the same side of the common point, one distance is subtracted from the other. For situations where aircraft are on opposite sides of the common point, the equation changes and the distances are additive.",
    "## S.2.2 Ownship Ahead Or Behind Status",
    "When two aircraft are on converging intersecting tracks on the same side of a common point, the aircraft with the shortest distance to the common point is the aircraft ahead and the aircraft with the longest distance to the common point is the aircraft behind. When two aircraft are on diverging intersecting tracks on the same side of a common point, the aircraft with the longest distance to the common point is the aircraft ahead and the aircraft with the shortest distance to the common point is",
    "point is the aircraft ahead and the aircraft with the shortest distance to the common point is the aircraft behind.

    "Fundamentally, the concept of the exemplar TSAA algorithm is to predict discrete, constant turn-rate trajectories for all involved aircraft and alert based on predicted penetrations of protected airspace along those trajectories. As such, the exemplar TSAA",
    "algorithm has three major components: protected airspace zones around target aircraft, trajectory prediction for ownship and target aircraft and the alerting decision logic. A conceptual overview of each component is provided here; the next section focuses on the mathematical and software implementation of the algorithm. The algorithm performs pair-wise evaluations to determine whether a conflict exists between the ownship and a particular target. Around each target, the algorithm calculates",
    "exists between the ownship and a particular target. Around each target, the algorithm calculates two protected airspace zones denoted as the protected airspace zone (PAZ) and the collision airspace zone (CAZ). In Figure T-3, the PAZ is shown in yellow and the CAZ is shown in red. The size of the PAZ is dependent on the closure rate between the target and the ownship. As a surrogate for the potential danger involved in a given encounter geometry, the size of the PAZ increases as closure rate",
    "danger involved in a given encounter geometry, the size of the PAZ increases as closure rate increases. The CAZ remains fixed in size at a radius of 500ft and a height of ±200ft based on the position uncertainty of two rule compliant ADS-B targets.",
    "The second component of the algorithm is the trajectory prediction.  For the ownship as well as each target, discrete trajectories are predicted repeatedly at a nominal frequency (e.g., once per second).  TSAA algorithm uses a constant turn rate trajectory propagation",
    "- as such, the propagated trajectories predict where the aircraft will be if it were to continue its current maneuver.  As shown in Figure T-4, the constant turn rate prediction defaults to a constant heading prediction in the absence of maneuvering.  During the initial design efforts, a constant turn rate trajectory projection was shown to reduce the nuisance alert rate while maintaining the missed alert percentages and the average alert time.",
    "Since the geometry between the two aircraft can change along the trajectories due to the constant turn rate prediction, the closure rate and with it the size of the PAZ between the two aircraft can also change.  For example, as shown in Figure T-5, as the closure rate decreases along the trajectories, the size of the PAZ decreases.",
    "Based on the predicted positions of the aircraft and the sizes of the airspace buffer zones along the trajectory, the alerting logic determines whether or not to issue an alert for a given target. If the ownship is predicted to penetrate the PAZ, an initial alert is issued to the pilot, announcing the location and observed behavior of the target.  A sample alert would be \"Traffic, Twelve O'clock, High, Three Miles, Descending.\" If the situation continues unchanged or deteriorates and the",

    "To reduce nuisance alerts, a \"double trigger\" value is introduced. If tCAZ and tPAZ are in excess of their double trigger thresholds, a violation of the PAZ or the CAZ has to be predicted by two consecutive conflict searches in order for the target to change into alert state. In other words, the algorithm described here has to be called twice in a row and both times predict for a target to violate the PAZ or the CAZ for that target to be switched into alert state.",
    "## T.3.2.3.2 Determine If An Immediate Paz Or Caz Alert Is Necessary",
    "For an alert to be issued on a target upon the first prediction of a violation (i.e., the algorithm runs only once), tCAZ and tPAZ have to be below the value of the double trigger threshold. For example, if the PAZ double trigger is set at 15 seconds, a PAZ conflict has to be predicted less than 15 seconds into the future (i.e., tPAZ < 15) for the target to be switched into alert state upon the first prediction of a violation.",
    "## T.3.2.3.3 Determine If The Alert Occurred Within The Alert Hysteresis And Should Thus Be Suppressed",
    "Once a target is identified as being in conflict with the ownship and an alert is issued, the audio system pronouncing the alert is busy for the length of the pronunciation of the alert. If during that time a maneuver causes the target to go in and out of alert status, a second alert would be issued on the same target, and then announced once the current alert is finished. Though this would be a legitimate alert, it may not be a desired one.",
    "In order to prevent this queuing of alerts, the hysteresis is set such that once a target switches into alert state it will remain in alert state for the longest possible duration of the aural message. This approach to the hysteresis also prevents the target from visually changing appearance during the duration of the annunciation of the aural alert in class II systems.",
    "The duration of the hysteresis is set by the value of the *reAlertDelay*. If tnow - t*last alert* < \nreAlertDelay, the alert status of the target is retained - even if the basic algorithm no longer predicts a conflict for that target. \n\n## T.3.2.4 Conflict Verification",
    "Noise in the turn rate estimation can have a significant effect on the constant turn rate trajectory prediction used by the exemplar algorithm. Specifically, noisy turn rate data may result in a \"wagging\" of the trajectory, soliciting un-necessary alerts that last for the minimum duration of an alert set by the *reAlertDelay*. Additionally, noisy turn rate data can cause valid alerts to turn on and off during the unfolding of an encounter, resulting in unnecessary re-alerting on the same",
    "on and off during the unfolding of an encounter, resulting in unnecessary re-alerting on the same target.",
    "A second effect of using a constant turn rate trajectory prediction is that during sharp turns the projected trajectory may curl up and predict a full 360-degree turn over the length of the trajectory (\"wrap-around\", see Figure T-9). In environments such as the airport pattern, such projections can generate the appearance of an immediate threat where the continuation of current operations will not necessarily lead to an unsafe condition.",
    "In order to address these sensitivities, secondary checks are performed on any predicted conflict before the alert can be issued. Alerts solicited due to trajectory wagging or a wrap-around exhibit the same state space signature - see insert in Figure T-9. In those cases, the time to closest point of approach (or tau) calculated using the last reported states is frequently large or even infinite. (The horizontal closure tau is calculated by dividing the horizontal separation by the horizontal",
    "(The horizontal closure tau is calculated by dividing the horizontal separation by the horizontal closure rate and the vertical tau is calculated by dividing the vertical separation by the vertical rate.) Therefore, a \"taucheck\" is added before an alert is allowed to be issued.\"",
    "The second undesirable effect of trajectory wagging is the turning off and on of a valid alert, for which a \"tau-check\" is not sufficient. Instead, a \"closure-check\" is added which prevents an alert to be turned off as long as an alerted target is still converging on the ownship. Described in pseudo code, the two checks can be described as follows:",
    "Wrap-Around and Wag-Solicited Alert Prevention Pseudo Code: Unless the ownship is currently inside the PAZ, don't let an alert be issued if the currently observed states do not indicate that the closest point of approach will be reached within the time that TSAA \npredicts into the future (i.e., CPA is farther out than [look-ahead time + PAZ scaling] \nseconds).",
    "Re-Alert Prevention Pseudo Code: Do not let an alert be turned off unless the target aircraft is no longer closing on the ownship in either the vertical or the horizontal dimension. \n\n## T.4 Additional Algorithm Functionalities",
    "## T.4 Additional Algorithm Functionalities\n\nThe exemplar algorithm described above is one way that TSAA could be implemented. As mentioned, depending on the algorithmic implementation, additional states may need to be calculated or existing states may need to be conditioned. Additionally, heuristics may be introduced to address certain undesirable alerting behaviors. During the development of the exemplar TSAA algorithm, a few such functionalities were investigated and are summarized here.",
    "## T.4.1 Proximity Function",
    "In light of potential late alerts during encounters with low closure rates, a proximitybased alerting function was evaluated. Given that an aircraft's maneuvering authority from a straight-line course is strongly correlated to its velocity, the TSAA proximity function evaluates whether to increase the horizontal size of the first PAZ ring as a function of the current ownship and target velocities. Conceptually, Equation 5 increases the size of the first PAZ ring to the distance that the ownship",
    "Conceptually, Equation 5 increases the size of the first PAZ ring to the distance that the ownship or the target could travel over tref seconds, were it to enter into a turn toward the ownship with a bank angle of θref Note that the size of the first PAZ ring is only adjusted if the size calculated by the proximity function is larger than that calculated by Equation 3.

    "## T.4.2 Trajectory Truncation",
    "A different approach to reducing the effects of the trajectory wrapping around during steep turns is to truncate the predicted trajectory once the heading change is predicted to be in excess of a threshold value. As mentioned, predicting a full 360-degree turn is most likely not a realistic prediction of the near-term operations of the aircraft. Algorithmically, the truncation can be implemented as part of the trajectory propagation routine or the alerting logic. If implemented as part of the",
    "as part of the trajectory propagation routine or the alerting logic. If implemented as part of the trajectory propagation routine, the length of the trajectory is adjusted to not extend beyond the maximum heading difference. This is computationally advantageous, as the trajectory propagation routing tends to be the most computationally intensive part of the TSAA algorithm. However, it may introduce complications later on as the lengths of the ownship trajectory and the target can be of",
    "introduce complications later on as the lengths of the ownship trajectory and the target can be of different lengths, potentially complicating the comparisons between them. The second approach keeps all trajectories the same length as defined by the *tlook* time and \"truncates\" them in the alerting logic. In this approach, the PAZ and the CAZ dimensions are compared against the predicted separations along the trajectory (Section T.3.2.2) only up to the point along the trajectory where neither",
    "along the trajectory (Section T.3.2.2) only up to the point along the trajectory where neither of the aircraft turned more than the heading change limit.  With this approach, even though a conflict may be predicted along the remaining components of the trajectory, it is not taken into account.",
    "In the sample code, this truncation is most efficiently implemented at the beginning of the alerting logic. Any conflict predicted further into the future than the time at which the maximum allowable delta psi occurs is disregarded.",
    "When implemented in conjunction with the exemplar TSAA algorithm, this functionality was shown to improve the performance beyond the benefit provided by the alert verification logic introduced in Section T.3.2.4. For the OPA performance analysis, the value used for config.max_delta_hdg was 90 degrees.",
    "## T.4.3 Turn Rate Dead-Band",
    "A different approach to address trajectory wagging due to noise in the turn rate is to implement a dead-band around 0 where the turn rate defaults to 0. In doing so, only turn rates above a threshold value are considered to be indicative of a turn. This approach is motivated by the fact that during nominal operations flight technical error as well as data noise can result in small oscillations in the turn rate. By introducing a dead-band, the apparent turns generated by this error and noise are",
    "the turn rate. By introducing a dead-band, the apparent turns generated by this error and noise are eliminated and the projected trajectory is projected not as a turn but rather as straight and level flight. If TSAA calculates its own turn rate estimate, the dead-band should be included as part of the turn rate estimation, as shown in Section T.4.4.  If psidot is passed to TSAA from an external function such as the DO-317 tracker, the turn rate dead-band is most efficiently included in the",
    "function such as the DO-317 tracker, the turn rate dead-band is most efficiently included in the trajectory_propagation method in the tsaa_aircraft_class.m file.

The dead-band threshold was set at 1.5 degrees/second.",

The ownship and target rotorcraft encounter each other on short final. The target can approach from all angles, likely during an autorotation maneuver. This scenario can also occur with switched target and ownship roles. Scenarios marked with (i) occur with ownship as the fixed-wing on final.",

    "ADS-B / TCAS validation at surveillance information level is a general requirement for new generation ADS-B In applications, including CAVS, targeting at the detection of potentially misleading ADS-B Out information from \"rogue\" aircraft. Thereby, the requirement primarily targets at mitigating security threats that are associated with erroneous ADS-B position information that deliberately masks the actual position of real aircraft in the airspace or places fake aircraft into the airspace",
    "the actual position of real aircraft in the airspace or places fake aircraft into the airspace (\"spoofing\"). The ADS-B /",
    "TCAS validation function relies on comparing passive ADS-B position reports (and derived aircraft slant range) with active TCAS slant range measurements.",
    "Whilst the function is primarily defined for Security threat mitigation reasons, it also supports the identification of \"rogue\" aircraft that, without intention, incorrectly encode ADS-B horizontal position quality indications. The term \"rogue\" ADS-B Out aircraft is used in a general sense to describe the target of the ADS-B / TCAS validation function.",
    "In the following, reference is made to the CAVS application and its related SPR material (DO-354/ED-233). However, the key requirements are generally applicable to other Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) ADS-B In applications such as FIM as well. \n\n## V.2 Approach",
    "The ADS-B / TCAS (surveillance) validation function aims at protecting against misleading horizontal position quality information (as associated with the actual position information) that might be encountered, amongst others, from some legacy ADS-B Out installations (in particular from Version 0 ones). In effect, in such cases, the function protects against horizontal measurement integrity failures that are not related to the actual measurement of the information but the encoding of the quality",
    "that are not related to the actual measurement of the information but the encoding of the quality information thereof.",
    "As a consequence, the CAVS spacing error analysis (as described in Annex D to the CAVS SPR) offers a suitable tool for determining the respective requirements of the ADS-B / TCAS validation function. In particular, the method can be used to establish a safety-driven allowable rate of encountering \"rogue\" ADS-B Out installations. This includes the consideration of an operational false-alert rate in the determination of the requirements for the underlying ADS-B / TCAS cross-check algorithm. Such",
    "the determination of the requirements for the underlying ADS-B / TCAS cross-check algorithm. Such false alerts would lead to the undesired and unnecessary \"un-designation\" of a target aircraft during on-going CAVS operations and its rate of occurrence should therefore be minimized.",
    "For this, the measurement integrity analysis approach introduced in CAVS SPR Section D.2 is used to determine an allowable spacing loss relative to a defining aircraft spacing value. The latter is established as a function of the minimum cross-check surveillance range of 5.0 NM. The cross-check surveillance range is the range within which a TCAS \ntrack must be available (which must also coincide with being in ADS-B range).",
    "The cross-check surveillance range of 5.0 NM is selected so that there is a very high likelihood that a TCAS track will have been established at that range. As the CAVS application is performed in the terminal area with potentially high traffic density, reference is made to statistical data that has been collected in high density TMA airspace, taking into account worst case transponder power output and TCAS receiver sensitivity constraints. Under those conditions, the statistics established a",
    "and TCAS receiver sensitivity constraints. Under those conditions, the statistics established a high likelihood of TCAS tracks having been established within a 5 NM to 7 NM range.",
    "The overall approach considers the following aspects:",
    "- \nA safety risk derived performance benchmark for comparison against the ADS-B \n/ TCAS cross-check performance and the derivation of the allowable rate of encountering \"rogue\" ADS-B Out aircraft. In terms of manifestation of the \nhorizontal position error produced by these \"rogue\" aircraft (associated with an incorrect quality indication), a sustained and consistent bias horizontal position error is assumed (as typically experienced with inertial positioning systems). As",
    "this corresponds to the modeling of a measurement integrity error condition, the spacing error analysis method is applied. Rather than a per-flight hour rate unit, \nthe analysis expresses respective rates on a per-CAVS operation basis. \n-",
