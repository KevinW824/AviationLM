In addition, VDL Mode 3 uses Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technology to provide integrated voice and data communications between aircraft users and ground-based users and operates in the standard VHF Aeronautical Mobile (Route)",
    "Service (AM(R)S) band. The VDL Mode 3 system is capable of operating in today's sectorized airspace.  The ground controller and the associated aircraft users form a user group that is assigned dedicated communications resources (a frequency and time slots) for voice and data communications under control of the ground station.  The VDL Mode 3 system can be configured for voice only time slots per frequency assignment or for voice and a data link in separate time slots for each user group on that",
    "assignment or for voice and a data link in separate time slots for each user group on that frequency assignment.  Voice communication is based on a low rate voice-encoding algorithm to achieve high bandwidth efficiency and, for most of the system configurations, uses listen-before-pushto-talk (LBPTT) protocol similar to today's analog-based system. The VDL Mode 3 data subsystem is designed to be a subnetwork of the ATN and is organized according to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model",
    "a subnetwork of the ATN and is organized according to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of the International Standards Organization (ISO).  Data communications are reservation-based to provide contention-free data service.  Point-to-point data communications between an aircraft ATN router and a ground ATN router are provided through the VDL Mode 3 system via the Aircraft Network Interface (ANI) and Ground Network Interface (GNI), respectively.  Point-to-multi-point data communication",
    "(ANI) and Ground Network Interface (GNI), respectively.  Point-to-multi-point data communication is also provided as one way data broadcast from the ground station to the aircraft stations. The VDL Mode 3 system is related to the three lower layers of the OSI model (illustrated in Figure 1-1) providing services described as follows: Layer 1 (Physical layer):  The Physical layer provides transceiver frequency control, bit exchanges over the radio media, and notification functions.  These",
    "frequency control, bit exchanges over the radio media, and notification functions.  These functions are known as \"radio\" and \"modulation\" functions.",
    "VDL Mode 3 uses differentially encoded eight phase shift keying (D8PSK) modulation with a raised cosine filter (Î± = 0.6).  The information to be transmitted is encoded with 3 bits/symbol.  The transmitted symbol rate is \n10,500 symbols/s, resulting in a nominal bit rate of 31,500 bits/s. Layer 2  (Link layer):  The Link layer is split into two sublayers and a management entity.",
    "The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer provides access control to the Physical layer using TDMA and is based on a centralized ground-based reservation system for data link access. The Data Link Services (DLS) sublayer is composed of an Acknowledged- Connectionless Data Link (A-CLDL) protocol whose main functions are frame exchanges, frame processing, priority queuing, error detection, and error recovery.",
    "The Link Management Entity (LME) is in charge of link establishment and release services between the aircraft and ground DLS sublayers.  It also delivers link status information to the subnetwork, DLS, and the Voice Unit. \n \nLayer 3 (Network layer):  The VDL Mode 3 MASPS in RTCA DO-224B define only the \nlowest sublayer of the Network layer, the Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAcP) \nsublayer. \nThe SNAcP sublayer provides transport of VDL Mode 3 subnetwork packets",
    "sublayer. \nThe SNAcP sublayer provides transport of VDL Mode 3 subnetwork packets \nthrough the use of a payload field similar to what is used in links today such as Ethernet.  The subnetwork layer provides packet exchanges, header \ncompression, and subnetwork connection management functions, and can \nprovide error recovery, flow control, and packet fragmentation.  The VDL Mode \n3 subnetwork layer can be configured to send Connectionless Network Protocol",

This paragraph describes two possible types of aircraft equipment architectures: one type is composed of integrated equipment and the other is composed of separated equipment.  Although these architectures are not the only possible architectures, they are representative of the most common equipment architectures expected in the marketplace.",

    "Mode 3 functionality is divided between the VHF Digital Radio (VDR) and the Communication Management Unit (CMU).

A first adjacent channel is a channel whose center frequency is 25 kHz above or below that of the desired VDL Mode 3 channel.  The nth adjacent channel is a channel whose center frequency is 25n kHz above or below that of the desired VDL Mode 3 channel.   \n \n1.7.2",

    "1.7.5 \n \nCo-channel Interference (CCI) CCI protection is the overall capability of a receiver to demodulate the desired signal and achieve the specified bit error rate (BER) performance in the presence of an unwanted signal at the same assigned frequency. The CCI ratio is the power ratio between the desired signal and the unwanted signal expressed in dB.",
    "1.7.6 \n \nError Vector Magnitude (EVM) Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is defined as the root mean square (rms) error in the in phase-quadrature phase (I-Q) vector magnitude measured at the ideal sampling points, expressed as a percentage.  Mathematically, this can be written as \n\n$EVM=100\\cdot\\sqrt{Expectation\\left(\\left(\\Delta I^{2}+\\Delta Q^{2}\\right)/\\left(I^{2}+Q^{2}\\right)\\right)}$.",

    "## Appendix C Functional Partitioning For Separated Equipment Architecture\n\n \nC.1 \nIntroduction To support air carrier equipment configurations, the VDL Mode 3 MOPS includes a variety of equipment classes that define separated equipment architectures supporting the VDL Mode 3 subnetwork capabilities.  This Appendix provides the partitioning of the VDL Mode 3 functionality between the VDR (Equipment Architecture SL) and CMU (Equipment Architecture SU).",
    "C.2 \nRationale The deployment of VDL Mode 3 in the national airspace is projected to occur in phases. VDL Mode 3 deployment is expected to start initially with a VDL Mode 3 voice-only operational capability. It is anticipated that operational support of VDL Mode 3 data will be provided a few years after the introduction of the voice capability.  Therefore, it is highly desirable to devise a plan for implementing VDL Mode 3 avionics equipment for air transport aircraft that:",
    "a. supports the phased deployment of VDL Mode 3 \n \nb. minimizes the initial investment in avionics required to provide VDL Mode 3 voice capability",
    "c. results in no modifications to previously installed VDL Mode 3 avionics when VDL Mode 3 data services become operational To support these objectives, it is desirable to partition the VDL Mode 3 functions so that the VDR equipment alone is sufficient to support all VDL Mode 3 voice functions, including enhanced voice operations.  The CMU should not be required for voice-only applications.  This dictates that the VDR",
    "must include all functionality associated with the physical layer, the MAC sublayer, the part of the LME sublayer that supports voice operation, and the voice unit.  Furthermore, the VDR should also include those DLS sublayer functions that need to be tightly coupled to the MAC and LME functions in order to perform certain time-critical functions. The detailed functional partitioning between the VDR and CMU is given in Section C.3.  Note that the recommended functional partitioning for VDL Mode",
    "and CMU is given in Section C.3.  Note that the recommended functional partitioning for VDL Mode 3 is consistent with the functional partitioning in aircraft within a VDL Mode 2 system.",

    "VDL Mode 3 radios use the DVSI 4.8 kbps AMBE+TM Vocoder for Air Traffic Communication to compress voice for digital transmission.  Although the vocoder is designed to provide good quality voice transmission at low bit rates, it does not generally perform well with a single frequency tone.  Such a tone would be useful in setting up receivers to provide an output audio level that is consistent among VDL Mode 3 radios and between VDL Mode 3 and DSB-AM radios.",

This frequency limit was discovered during empirical testing and validated by a review of the algorithm.  Although a more common test tone frequency of 1004 Hz is desirable because it is located near the center of the passband, the 400 Hz tone is still within the passband and should not be significantly affected by band edge filter rolloff characteristics.",
