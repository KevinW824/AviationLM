    "# Aerospace Standard Electronic Flight Instrument System (Efis) Displays\n\n## Rationale",
    "Historically, FAA Technical Standard Orders (TSOs) and associated industry Minimum Operational Performance Specifications (MOPS) were developed to address sensor and indicator requirements for single functions, such as airspeed, altitude, or fuel flow.  In contrast, modern Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) displays normally present indications for multiple functions, but do not normally include the sensor. Until now, a MOPS did not exist to address the operational/functional",
    "normally include the sensor. Until now, a MOPS did not exist to address the operational/functional requirements for such an EFIS display.",
    "Requirements for this type of EFIS typically consist of a few requirements for each function, drawn from many TSOs and associated MOPS.   As a result, TSO applications for EFIS displays have multiple deviations to many TSOs and may include incomplete TSO authorizations.  This document is intended to facilitate EFIS TSO authorizations by addressing only the EFIS display requirements for a broad set of aircraft functions. This document provides criteria for EFIS displays that are intended for use",
    "of aircraft functions. This document provides criteria for EFIS displays that are intended for use in the flight deck by the flight crew in aircraft to include, but not limited to, Title 14 CFR Part 23, 25, 27, and 29.",

    "The EFIS shall display two levels of TAS advisories - Other Traffic (OT), and Traffic Advisories (TA) - as provided by TAS equipment. Other traffic is defined as any traffic within the selected display range that is not a TA. TAs are issued based either on tau, i.e., the time to closest approach and the time to co-altitude, or on proximity to an intruder aircraft. The range tau is defined as the range divided by range rate and the vertical tau is defined as the relative altitude divided by the",
    "range divided by range rate and the vertical tau is defined as the relative altitude divided by the altitude rate.",
    "## 4.6.2.4 Display Overload\n\nIf the number of targets exceeds the display capability, excess targets shall be deleted in the following order:",
    "1. Other traffic (OT) beginning with the intruder at the greatest range. 2. Traffic Advisories (TAs) beginning with the intruder having the largest tau, i.e., the longest time to closest approach and \ntime to the same altitude. Once a TA has been generated against an intruder, it cannot be removed as a TA until the TA criteria are no longer satisfied even though it may be dropped from the display. \n\n## 5. Minimum Performance Standards Under Environmental Conditions",
    "The environmental tests and performance requirements described therein are intended to provide a laboratory means of determining the overall performance characteristics of the EFIS under conditions representative of those that may be encountered in actual operations.  To demonstrate compliance with this document, the performance requirements in Tables 15, 16, and 17 shall be met for the environmental conditions as outlined in 5.4 through 5.30 of AS8034B.

In addition, the requirements in 5.1 shall be met for the applicable declared functions under this aerospace standard. This is in addition to the requirements noted in AS8034B, and those of 3.4. The tables below, titled \"Performance Required during Environmental Conditions\", indicate additional specific performance",
    "\"Performance Required during Environmental Conditions\", indicate additional specific performance under environmental conditions that shall be met for the functions selected for the EFIS. These have been taken from existing stand-alone TSOs, and are limited to those pertaining to display aspects.

    "for the EFIS being qualified, then any performance required under an environmental condition shall be met. For simplicity, if there were no specific *additional* performance requirements for the display aspects of an existing TSO functionality, rather than having columns entirely of \"N/A\" or \"None\", those functions were not included in the tables.
