    "Current industry standards for safety assessment processes (e.g. ED-79A/ARP 4754A",
    "process with methods from ED-135/ARP 4761) are focused on the failure of onboard Systems and not on malicious intent. As a result, there are gaps when malicious acts are considered. This guidance was developed to address these gaps by working along with the safety assessment process using relevant Security Risk Assessment elements from existing Security Risk Assessment standards. However, there remains enough coordination that any safety-oriented Security Risk Assessment activities should",

    "CS-25 AMC 25.1309 excludes adverse events due to sabotage for assessing flight safety hazards. The standard practice uses a broad definition of \"interference\" that includes most but not all hazards that would occur due to deliberate electronic attack. The effect (on aircraft and crew) of a successfully executed attack is a condition which has an adverse effect on the aircraft or its occupants. Such a threat condition is much like a failure condition as defined in industry standards for safety",
    "a threat condition is much like a failure condition as defined in industry standards for safety assessment processes. The difference",
    "is that a threat condition will occur through a willful (intentional or unintentional) action.",
    "It is in the fundamental nature of airborne functions that proper operation and configuration are dependent on persons, organizations, and external systems. Standard practice in safety assessment already requires the consideration of hazards that arise from these external dependencies. However, the inclusion of the possibility of an electronic attack is new to the external agreements governing these external dependencies and should include Security Risk Assessment.",
    "In general, aircraft safety and information security requirements may be approached in a similar way; however, designing for security is a specialty with its own expertise and practices and should be handled as such.",
    "It is not unusual for requirements for security measures to be stated in terms of the absence of undesired attributes. Such requirements can present problems for verification and test and are the subject of specialized practices such as vulnerability analysis and test. There is a large overlap between security and safety. This overlap represents an opportunity to avoid a large amount of duplicate analysis, but requires collaborative decisions on the resolution of disagreements or gaps.",
    "analysis, but requires collaborative decisions on the resolution of disagreements or gaps. Therefore, a process which has not integrated system development and flight safety assessment with Security Risk Assessment should provide a means to ensure that the processes are consistent with each other and that together they are complete. Furthermore, there needs to be a means for classifying, discriminating, and managing classes of functions and controls which play roles in both flight safety and",
