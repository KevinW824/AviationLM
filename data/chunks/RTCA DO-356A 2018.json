    "## 2.1 Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction\n\nThis section aims at providing a detailed definition and scope for what is and what is not considered Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction (IUEI). \n\nFor purposes of this document, IUEI, its presence, absence, and impact, is the underlying scope of the subject area that is meant when the term \"Security\" is used. \n\n## 2.1.1 Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction - Definition And Meaning",
    "Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction (IUEI) is defined as \"[a] circumstance or event with the potential to affect the aircraft due to human action resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, denial, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and/or aircraft system interfaces. This includes the consequences of malware and forged data and the effects of external systems but does not include physical attacks or electromagnetic disturbance.\" To fully understand the",
    "but does not include physical attacks or electromagnetic disturbance.\" To fully understand the term, the reader should consider the meaning of its individual parts in the context of a typical cyber-event:",
    "•\nThe word \"intentional\" clarifies that the event originates with an intentional act from a human to separate it from other adverse events covered under ED-79A / ARP4754A and ARP4761, such as equipment failures, software logic errors, or human input or decision errors. To clarify, a person who writes a piece of malware defines the intention, not a person who unintentionally installs the malware, for example by inserting an infected USB device into a system.",
    "•\nThe word \"unauthorized\" specifies that the event is not defined as permitted within the system definition/function or operational policies. Any aspect regarding functionality, person or timing that has not been authorized is considered as an unauthorized interaction. Referring back to the example above, malware operating on a system conducts unauthorized activity that was not planned by the original system designer.\n•",
    "•\nThe word \"electronic\" differentiates the interaction from physical attacks and is more easily thought of in the context of being digital in nature. Malware which results in a failed function is an electronic interaction whereas a hammer is not. It also differentiates the interaction from electrical attacks, such as overvoltage, Electro Magnetic Pulse, or disturbance through overpowering the transmitter.\n•",
    "•\nThe word \"interaction\" specifies that the event occurs when the attacker and system act on each other. Note that this refers to both, the state of the system and the state of\nits security attributes. So, while eavesdropping may physically be only a one-way\ntransmission, it also violates the confidentiality attribute of the transmitted information and is thus an interaction between the attacker and the security attributes of the system.",
    "## 2.1.2 Intentional Unauthorized Electronic Interaction - Some Principles\n\nWhile it can be difficult to distinguish what is and what is not considered to be unauthorized interaction, it is easier to conceptualize with the understanding that the ultimate purpose is to cover malicious attacks that occur through digital means. Below are some principles to consider in determining whether an event falls within the scope of IUEI. These principles are based on the ARAC ASISP report [6].",
    "•\nThe event is not the result of a purely physical attack, human error, or equipment failure.",
    "•\nAnalog attacks on digital hardware are not electronic interaction, but digital attacks through analog connections are (\"electronic means digital, not electrical\"). \n•\nThe event can include digital read (unauthorized access to private data) or write operations (unauthorized modification of system configuration or function). \n•\nIt should be understood that cyberattacks can originate from anywhere in the world.\n•",
    "•\nIt should be understood that cyberattacks can originate from anywhere in the world.\n•\nThe event originates with a human actor's intentional act, such as a programmer writing malware, or a malicious hacker trying to gain access to connected aircraft systems.\n•\nThe attack is not necessarily restricted to installed systems that are physically or wirelessly connected to other systems. USB flash drives or connections to an",
    "accessible data port are a common means for attacking isolated networks. Portable systems can be connected to multiple networks at different times and provide a further method bridging isolations in the aircraft.\n•",
    "•\nAny and all events attributed to malware, because malicious software has been developed with the intent to cause harm. Malware is by definition created with malicious intent and never part of the authorized system behavior. Even if the actual interaction is difficult to analyze, any event involving the intentional change of system configuration to an unauthorized configuration has to be regarded as intentionally unauthorized. Malware is a subset of possible unauthorized configuration changes.",
    "•\nAn event does not constitute IUEI if it results only from accidental introduction of a\nvulnerability through configuration error or software defect. But an event resulting from an attack misusing such vulnerability does constitute IUEI.\n•\nAn attempt to utilize a system vulnerability to modify the availability, integrity, confidentiality or other relevant security attribute of a system is IUEI.",

There can be safety effects caused by intentional unauthorized electronic interaction, which is the focus of current regulations.

    "Vulnerability and penetration testing will develop a list of unintended behavior, including program bugs and a list of well-known attack techniques that result in anomalous system behavior. Additionally, all problem reports on security measures may hide vulnerabilities. \nThe security vulnerability assessment should: \n- \nTake each report of unintended behavior on security measures;\n \n- \nDetermine for each report whether an anomaly that represents a vulnerability; and  \n-",
    "- \nDetermine for each report whether an anomaly that represents a vulnerability; and  \n- \nDetermine the impact of each identified vulnerability. \nVulnerabilities should be recorded, classified, and managed in accordance with the current problem report guidance.",
    "## B.2.2.2 Assessment Of Well-Known Vulnerabilities",
    "The vulnerability assessment should include an assessment of well-known vulnerabilities: \n- \nUse one or more established repositories for well-known vulnerabilities;  \n- \nAssess any previously-developed parts of the system against established repository for well-known vulnerabilities; and  \n- \nClassify all documented vulnerabilities that are applicable to the system.",
    "The well-known vulnerabilities are those vulnerabilities that have been documented in previous use of items within the system. A repository of these should be established prior to the final security vulnerability assessment as part of the certification security assessment baseline. Available public databases may be used, along with vendor notifications. Opensource attack tools and proprietary attack tools also serve to document well-known attack techniques and the condition of being vulnerable",
    "tools also serve to document well-known attack techniques and the condition of being vulnerable to one is considered to be a well-known vulnerability.

    "exploited by attack along with a classification of the attributes of the vulnerability related to exposure, exploitability, and scope. Several industrial standards have been developed that are used by well-known vulnerability databases.

Classification standards that may be considered include CVSS, the \"Common Vulnerability Scoring System\", Version 3.0 [20]. Databases that use",
    "include CVSS, the \"Common Vulnerability Scoring System\", Version 3.0 [20]. Databases that use this standard include the US National Vulnerability Database [56], the US National Cyber Awareness System [55], and many more. Note:",
    "Information from these sources is most likely to address software that is commercially marketed for uses unrelated to airborne systems (e.g., COTS). In the absence of databases that specifically accommodate airborne systems it is important to understand the methods used in any vulnerability identification and classification system before applying it to aircraft systems.",
    "Regardless of how vulnerabilities are identified and classified relative to non-airborne systems use, vulnerabilities should be evaluated within the aircraft systems architecture to determine both exposure characteristics and airplane level impact. Exposure and severity will be unique to each aircraft type. Databases for COTS products will assume typical IT architectures, exposure and usage, which can make the assessment results inaccurate for airborne uses.",
    "## B.2.2.3 Vulnerability Reporting And Management",
    "Vulnerabilities should be traced in vulnerability problem reports whatever their impact and independent from the fact that they will be judged acceptable or not. The process for creating and managing Vulnerability problem reports should resemble the same processes used for Complex Electronic Hardware and Software Problem Reports today. One difference is that in addition to designers and testers creating Problem Reports, Vulnerability Problem Reports may be created by independent security teams",

    "In order to validate that in a preliminary design, an adequate Level of Protection has been assigned to the security measures, the following table can be useful. Each vulnerability caps the LoP of the corresponding security measures. The table has rows for each vulnerability capping the LoP of the corresponding security measure and columns for the classes of assets under protection. In this case, the assets are separated into Minor assets (SEV = 3) and Major assets (SEV = 5). For each class of",
    "the assets are separated into Minor assets (SEV = 3) and Major assets (SEV = 5). For each class of assets, the set of cutsets is shown which involve one of the security measures and the asset. For example, O.maint.gateway.passwd protects a minor asset in CU02, while it helps protect a major asset in cutsets CU11, CU12, CU24, and CU31 (see section F.3.2.10 for details on the cutsets). The Major Risk Score is then the maximum risk among the four cutsets CU11, CU12, CU24, and CU31, and similarly",
    "Score is then the maximum risk among the four cutsets CU11, CU12, CU24, and CU31, and similarly for the Minor Risk Score. The LoP margin is the maximum of the different risk scores for the row and represents how much the LoP could be decreased and still result in an acceptable risk level for the overall system. For example, O.maint.gateway.passwd has an LoP of 3, and an LoP Margin of 0, which means that it is not possible to decrease the LoP without unacceptable security risk",
    "(in this case, against a Minor asset.) Considering the discussion in section F.1.2, this also means that if a new vulnerability in the gateway password is found that would materially reduce its LoP, that vulnerability should be mitigated in order to retain acceptable security risk. On the other hand, O.aircraft.maint.gateway.ratelimit has an LoP margin of -3, which means that some decrease in the LoP of the maintenance gateway ratelimit is tolerable.",

As a result,",

As a result, the devices themselves are responsible for providing protection from intentional unauthorized electronic interaction, even if they do not intend to communicate with external systems.

An intrinsic domain (see Figure I-3) is a domain within which the networks and network",

    "The three major classifications of common modes for security are Independence, Diversity and Isolation. In order to understand the difference between these characteristics, examples are provided. Independence If a security architecture uses a firewall that allows certain connections to pass if authenticated, the firewall is dependent on the authentication service.

It may be fully effective for all connections it blocks at all times (e.g. if it always blocks a specific port range) but will be effective only as strong as the authentication services for specific port ranges (e.g. authentication on a specific port that will be allowed based on authentication token given to firewall). If the authentication service is of lower assurance than the firewall, it",
    "token given to firewall). If the authentication service is of lower assurance than the firewall, it effectively lowers the combined effectiveness of the security measures of the firewall and authentication service for those port ranges, as detailed in section 3.6.3.",

    "Cases 2 and 4 may be acceptable in some circumstances but not all. Attacks on the common hardware and software providing logical segregation need to be considered and if mitigations are needed or in place.

    "This document is the joint product of two special industry committees: the EUROCAE Working Group WG-72, titled \"Aeronautical System Security\" and the RTCA Special Committee SC-216, also titled \"Aeronautical Systems Security\". WG-72 was formed and began meeting in 2006 to address information security for the overall Aeronautical Information System Security (AISS) of airborne systems with related ground systems and environment. SC-216 was formed and began meeting in 2007 to specifically address",
    "ground systems and environment. SC-216 was formed and began meeting in 2007 to specifically address information security for certification of aircraft and its systems. Both organizations agreed to develop joint documents through which the airworthiness of aircraft would be enabled despite the potential for intentional or unintentional misuse of aircraft information systems.",
    "Work on ED-203 and DO-356 started in parallel to the development of DO-326 / ED-202 (published in 2012) and later DO-326A / ED-202A (published in 2014). For this reason, DO-326A / ED-202A relies on and references a \"future companion\" document to provide the guidance deemed necessary on methods and considerations. After the publication of DO-326A / ED-202A in June 2014, SC-216 and WG-72 decided in",
    "2014 to publish separate companion documents due to time constraints, different scopes of both committees and the lack of consensus on some topics under discussion.",
    "DO-356 was published by SC-216 in September 2014 as a \"minimum core\" document, extracting some essential guidance on risk assessments out of the existing and controversial draft material. WG-72 started to develop new guidance based on the final DO-326A / ED-202A needs and WG-72 scope. The first part of this material including guidance on risk assessments and security assurance was published as ED-203 in September 2015. WG-72 work on the second part began directly afterwards. DO-356 and ED-203",
    "in September 2015. WG-72 work on the second part began directly afterwards. DO-356 and ED-203 contain significant differences on risk assessment methods and the relation to other development assurance standards (mainly DO-178C / ED-12C). The Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) established the working group on Aircraft System Information Security/Protection (ASISP) to provide information, advice and recommendations on aviation related ASISP issues to the Federal Aviation Administration",
    "advice and recommendations on aviation related ASISP issues to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator, through the Associate Administrator of Aviation Safety. The ARAC is comprised of a wide range of domestic and international industry and government experts to ensure that relevant design, airworthiness, and international harmonization aspects of ASISP are considered in the recommendations. This included representatives from other regulatory bodies such as EASA and ANAC, who",
    "This included representatives from other regulatory bodies such as EASA and ANAC, who participated in the final report.

The ASISP working group recommended that SC-216 create harmonized standards jointly with WG 72 around the risk acceptability and assurance framework based on the guidance material outlined in sections 2.2.3.4.1 - 2.2.3.4.8 of the final report.",
    "The ARAC ASISP working group started in 2015 to develop recommendations to the FAA about security. The ARAC ASISP report [6] recommended to the FAA and both industry committees to harmonize guidance on methods and considerations. SC-216 and WG-72 agreed in June 2016 to jointly develop DO-356A / ED-203A as an update to DO-356 and ED-203 such that they should provide the harmonized guidance. Significant changes from DO-356 to DO-356A and ED-203 to ED-203A: Chapter 2 with regulatory considerations",
    "changes from DO-356 to DO-356A and ED-203 to ED-203A: Chapter 2 with regulatory considerations has been added in response to the ARAC ASISP report [6]. Chapter 3 includes the harmonized risk management methods and considerations from DO- 356 and ED-203. Specific methods that were part of DO-356 or ED-203 have been moved into appendices, so that sections in chapter 3 contain only harmonized methods. Security assurance has been harmonized in a dedicated chapter 4 to allow the different approaches",
    "Security assurance has been harmonized in a dedicated chapter 4 to allow the different approaches from DO-356 and ED-203 under one set of security assurance objectives. Dedicated chapters on security architecture and security logging have been added to the document.",
