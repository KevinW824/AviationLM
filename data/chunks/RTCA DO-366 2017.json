Tracks generated by the radar are sent to the DAA system for further processing.",
    "## 1.2 Daa System Overview",
    "DAA systems are designed to provide Unmanned Aircraft (UA) the ability to remain well clear of and avoid collisions with other aircraft. Two types of surveillance equipment are identified for such a system:  cooperative sensors such as Mode S active surveillance and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), which rely on having compatible equipment in the intruder aircraft, and non-cooperative sensors, which detect intruders without any equipage assumptions. The air-to-air radar is",
    "sensors, which detect intruders without any equipage assumptions. The air-to-air radar is the primary sensor for noncooperative intruders. Paragraphs 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 give an outline of the UA elements and the CS elements of a DAA system. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) UAS Operational Concept document includes assumptions, constraints, requirements, and high-level operational considerations for UAS, and is intended to provide the foundation for the DAA MOPS and DAA Radar MOPS.2",

Operating limitations for radar equipment compliant with these MOPS are documented in Paragraph 1.2.4. These MOPS define the minimum",
    "compliant with these MOPS are documented in Paragraph 1.2.4. These MOPS define the minimum functional and performance requirements, test procedures, limitations, and installation considerations for DAA radar equipment to be used in an operational environment where the UA is transitioning to and from Class A or Special Use Airspace (SUA), or traversing Class D, E, or G airspace.",
    "## 1.2.1 Daa System Description - Unmanned Aircraft\n\nFigure 1-1 shows one possible implementation of a DAA system onboard the aircraft, as depicted in the Phase 1 DAA MOPS. The radar interacts mainly with the UA DAA processor as a surveillance sensor. The radar sends the radar-generated tracks to the DAA processor, which will create unified tracks that will combine information from all sensors.",
    "## 1.2.2 Daa System Description - Control Station\n\nFigure 1-2 shows the control segment as depicted in the DAA MOPS. From the radar perspective, the PIC will have control over the radar functionality, and receive radar status and health information through the CS surveillance control panel.  \n\n## 1.2.3 Daa Radar Overview",
    "Figure 1-3 shows the major elements of DAA radar. It will have one or more antenna elements carefully placed in the UA to cover the FOR. The radar electronics provide all transmit, receive, control, status and tracking functions for the radar. The radar receives commands and navigation data and sends out status and track data. Optionally, the radar may also receive cueing information from the DAA system. The radar electronics maybe co-located with the antenna or placed close by.",
    "## 1.2.4 System Limitations\n\nInstalled DAA radar meeting these MOPS does not:",
    " \nDetect and track intruders that have no reflection in the radar frequency band. It is assumed that at a minimum the intruder would have an RCS of a human. \n \nDetect and track objects while conducting taxi operations or flying at low altitudes below the minimum altitude recommended in Subparagraph 2.2.7–21. \n",
    " \nDetect and track every stationary or hovering target; detection of such targets will depend on their RCS, their location with respect to the ownship, and the level of ground clutter.",
    "## 1.2.5 Document Hierarchy\n\nRadar operational performance requirements at the aircraft level and associated recommendations are derived from the DAA MOPS. However, for all radar requirements, this document supersedes any other document.  \n\n## 1.3 Intended Function",
    "## 1.3 Intended Function\n\nThe intended function of the radar is to detect and generate tracks for all airborne traffic within the radar detection volume. The onboard radar complements other airborne surveillance sensors by providing detection of non-cooperative traffic. This equipment will support some traffic avoidance systems, including Detect and Avoid Systems.  \n\n## 1.4 Operational Goals",
    "The radar is the surveillance source for non-cooperative intruders in a DAA system. This allows UAs to conduct flight operations on an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plan between the terminal area and Class A airspace while transitioning through Class D, E, or G airspace. The radar will provide intruder track information to the DAA system that will enable a decision to be made whether a maneuver is necessary to maintain DAA Well Clear (DWC) and avoid collisions. The track should be",
    "a maneuver is necessary to maintain DAA Well Clear (DWC) and avoid collisions. The track should be established at sufficient range and with sufficient accuracy to enable the system to plan and execute a maneuver to keep the UAS well clear of other traffic and avoid collisions. The DAA system may use the radar data to validate other sensors.",
    "## 1.5 Assumptions 1.5.1 Operational Assumptions",
    "1. The DAA radar will mainly operate in the environment defined in the Operational \nServices and Environment Description in Appendix A of the DAA MOPS. The limitations to this operation are outlined in Paragraph 1.2.4 above. If needed, the DAA system will have other means to provide the functions expected of the radar under the limitations imposed in Paragraph 1.2.4, above.  \n2. The radar will be the non-cooperative sensor for intruders below 10,000' Above",
    "2. The radar will be the non-cooperative sensor for intruders below 10,000' Above \nGround Level (AGL), where non-cooperative intruder aircraft fly at speeds up to 170 Knots True Airspeed (KTAS). \n3. Below 10,000' AGL, where ownship UA aircraft fly at speeds up to 200 KTAS. 4. The radar will be qualified for 4 millimeters per hour (mm/hr) of rain. Operation at \nhigher rates of rain is possible, but performance may be affected, especially at the higher frequency bands.",
    "## 1.5.2 Radome Assumptions\n\nIn most cases, the radar antenna will be covered with a radome supplied by the UAS manufacturer. The radar performance will be evaluated with the radome, so radar manufacturers will need to work with the UAS manufacturer to ensure that radar will perform as specified when used with the radome.  \n\n## 1.5.3 Ownship State Data Assumptions",
    "Table 1-1 defines the ownship state data that needs to be supplied to the radar from the ownship or the DAA processor. Where available, the quality indicators will also be supplied. The update rate needs to be a minimum of 1 Hertz (Hz).

    "## 3.1 Equipment Installation 3.1.1 Accessibility\n\nEquipment designed to meet these MOPS should be reasonably accessible to aircraft maintenance personnel for installation, maintenance and removal. Please see the Paragraph 3.1.1 of the DAA MOPS for requirements related to accessibility to radar controls at the Control Station. \n\n## 3.1.2 Aircraft Environment",
    "## 3.1.2 Aircraft Environment\n\nEquipment should be compatible with the environmental condition present in the specific location in the aircraft where the equipment is installed. \n\n## 3.1.3 Display Visibility\n\nPlease see the Paragraph 3.1.3 of the DAA MOPS for requirements related to display visibility at the Control Station. \n\n## 3.1.4 Dynamic Range",

    "Bands of the radiofrequency spectrum are not created equal. In addition to technical design considerations, the proper consideration of frequency band selection must account for national and international regulations. For example, radiofrequency spectrum in any band could be allocated to several different users on a Primary, Secondary, or Non-Interference basis. A further complication is that even within these status categories some systems may have priority over other systems in that category.",
    "within these status categories some systems may have priority over other systems in that category. Frequency bands for aeronautical DAA Radars are those bands with a primary Aeronautical Radionavigation Service (ARNS) allocation or a general Radionavigation Service allocation where ARNS could be compatibly operated. Frequency bands that have one of these allocations have an appropriate level of protection to ensure that adequate protection is afforded to these safety-critical systems and that",
    "protection to ensure that adequate protection is afforded to these safety-critical systems and that any reports of interference from other systems are resolved in an expeditious manner. Thus, DAA radars need to operate within a frequency band that has an ARNS allocation. Within the United States (US), development of DAA systems by the private sector may occur under a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) experimental license, but the final frequency band of operation must be either a",
    "Commission (FCC) experimental license, but the final frequency band of operation must be either a designated ARNS or an appropriate Radionavigation Service band so the operational system can receive full regulatory protection. Global radiofrequency band allocations are made through the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which is the United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies. The ITU allocations can be found in the 2016 version of the ITU Radio",
    "communication technologies. The ITU allocations can be found in the 2016 version of the ITU Radio Regulations, which are reviewed and updated approximately every four years. The United States incorporates the ITU Radio Regulations into the FCC rules and National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) rules found in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In November 2010 the ITU Radiocommunications Sector (ITU-R) prepared a report1 identifying existing ARNS allocations",
    "the ITU Radiocommunications Sector (ITU-R) prepared a report1 identifying existing ARNS allocations that would be suitable for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) DAA applications. This report was largely the result of contributions from RTCA Special Committee 203 (SC-203) members and was intended to identify frequency bands for DAA applications. The bands identified for airborne DAA applications were:",
    " \n4,200 - 4,400 Megahertz (MHz) (see Table 3 in Section 4.1 of the ITU Report) \n \n5,350 - 5,470 MHz (see Table 3 in Section 4.1 of the ITU Report) \n \n8,750 - 8,850 MHz (see Table 3 in Section 4.1 of the ITU Report) \n--`,``,,,,,,,``,,,````,`,`,`,```-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---",

The bands are for general radionavigation, which includes aeronautical, maritime, and land applications. These bands are:",
    " \n24.45 - 24.65 GHz \n \n32.3 - 33.4 GHz. \nThese two bands are appropriately identified in the FCC and NTIA rules. \n\n## A.2 Discussion And Recommendation",
    "Below is a summary of the situation in each of these bands. Developers must carefully review the rules of the ITU, NTIA and the FCC to better determine the other authorized users and regulations for these bands. Developers should also quantify the electromagnetic interactions with the other users of a band to assist developing appropriate technical sharing conditions. The acceptance of those conditions by appropriate governmental authorities and existing users may require considerable",
    "conditions by appropriate governmental authorities and existing users may require considerable interference analysis, testing, and verification and validation.",
    "4,200-4,400 Megahertz (MHz):  For many decades this band has been used by radio altimeters. The 2015 ITU-sponsored World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) granted regulatory protection for aircraft onboard wireless (non-passenger) applications, such as backup flight controls.
